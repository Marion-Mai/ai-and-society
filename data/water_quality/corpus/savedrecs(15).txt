Water chemistry distinguishes wetland plant communities of the Great Lakes coast	AQUATIC BOTANY			English	Article						Wetland; Plant community; Water chemistry; Phosphorus; Chloride; Conductivity; pH; Great Lakes coast	SHALLOW LAKES; AQUATIC MACROPHYTES; SPECIES RICHNESS; LAND-USE; ECOLOGICAL STATUS; CENTRAL SPAIN; QUALITY; PATTERNS; VEGETATION; BASIN	U.S. coastal wetlands of the Laurentian Great Lakes span a north-to-south gradient (latitude 47-41 degrees N) of increasing human population and agricultural intensity that alters their water chemistry and vegetation. We related field-measured water chemistry to vegetation condition and composition using data from 48 freshwater coastal wetlands along this sub-continental gradient, building upon previous findings that GIS-derived landscape descriptors could adequately predict vegetation condition in Great Lakes coastal wetlands. Our aim was to determine (1) whether plant communities could be differentiated by their surface water chemistry, and (2) if water chemistry could better predict wetland vegetation condition than GIS-derived variables. Seven distinct plant communities were identified by agglomerative hierarchical clustering and non-metric multidimensional scaling of vegetation cover data: Sphagnum-carpeted poor fens, Sparganium eurycarpum marshes, Calamagrostis canadensis wetlands, Schoenoplectus pungens marshes, Phragmites australis marshes, and two floristically distinct Typha-dominated marshes. There were significant differences (ANOVA) among the seven plant assemblages identified for most water chemistry metrics (Cl-, chlorophyll a, conductivity, NO3-N, pH, total N, total P, total suspended solids), but dissolved oxygen, dissolved organic carbon, and NH4-N did not vary significantly across the assemblages. The two different Typha-dominated plant communities were chemically distinct from each other in chlorophyll a, conductivity, NO3-N, pH and total suspended solids concentrations, and we recommend that they be separated into distinct associations: Typha spp. - Thelypteris palustris - Hydrocharis morsus-ranae and Typha spp. - C. canadensis - Leersia oryzoides. Plant communities tended to be geographically clustered, but wetlands that were geographic outliers of their floristic type were chemically similar to other wetlands in their plant community grouping despite being on different lakes. When offered both GIS-derived and field-measured potential predictor variables, a regression tree model of wetland condition chose only GIS-derived variables. However, a classification tree model derived solely from field-measured water chemistry variables correctly classified 79% of the sites into four plant community groupings based on total N, conductivity, and pH. Grouping wetlands by plant communities could provide a scientifically-defensible basis for stricter water quality standards to protect sensitive wetland types. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL CHANGES IN TOTAL SUSPENDED SEDIMENT CONCENTRATIONS IN AN OXBOW LAKE AFTER IMPLEMENTING AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						total suspended solids; oxbow lake; best management practice	WATER-QUALITY; RIVER-BASIN; RESUSPENSION; WIND; PHOSPHORUS; DELIVERY	The WolfBroad oxbow lake (417?ha) was evaluated by the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and included on the Mississippi 303(d) list of impaired waterbodies for total suspended solids (TSS). A study was undertaken for 2?years to evaluate and document changes to TSS (mg?L-1) and overall lake turbidity (NTU) through best management practice implementation. These two objectives were analysed with routine monthly surface sampling events of turbidity (Eureka Manta 2, automated data sonde) as well as 20 random samples per sampling trip for TSS from June 2008 to June 2010. Results from a non-parametric KruskalWallis analysis indicated a significant month-by-year effect on turbidity and TSS (chi-squared?=?76.08, p?=?0.001), but reach (chi-squared?=?2.45, p?=?0.784) and depth by reach (chi-squared?=?2.44, p?=?0.784) did not show significant effects on turbidity. There were no significant correlations between TSS concentrations and turbidity and 2?days and 7?days summed or mean rainfall for the duration of the evaluation. Spearman correlation analysis for TSS indicated significant correlations between TSS and mean two-day (r2?=?0.62, p?=?0.002) and seven-day (r2?=?0.51, p?=?0.014) wind speeds. All other variables used in the analysis did not show significant correlation with TSS (?p?>?0.05). This suggests that wind conditions, rather than rainfall, predict the greatest variability in TSS and turbidity in Wolf Lake. These documented correlations between lake water column TSS, turbidity and wind highlight the difficulties of demonstrating success of management practices in the short temporal period between project initiation and completion. Unmanageable environmental conditions (wind speed and direction) and limited temporal monitoring scales (1 1/2?years post-BMP implementation) limit the possibility of demonstrating successful water-quality improvement within a 303(d) listed waterbody such as Wolf Lake.

Attributiveness of a mass flow analysis model for integrated water resources assessment under data-scarce conditions	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						mass flow analysis; model attributiveness; model performance; nutrient transport model; water quality management	NITROGEN; SYSTEMS; PERFORMANCE; TRANSPORT; LOADS; ZONE	Nutrients in river systems originate from multiple emission sources, follow various pathways, and are subject to processes of conversion and fate. One approach to tackle this complexity is to apply balance-oriented models. Although these models operate on a coarse temporal and spatial scale, they are capable of assessing the significance of the different emission sources and their results can be the basis for developing integrated water quality management schemes. In this paper we propose and apply a methodology to evaluate the attributiveness of such model results with regard to the modelled emission pathways. The MONERIS (MOdelling Nutrient Emissions in River Systems) model is set up, assuming plausible ranges of emission levels from four principal sources. The sensitivity of model performance is computed and related to the contribution from the pathways. The approach is applied for a case study in the upper Western Bug catchment (Ukraine). Coefficient of determination (R-2) is found insensitive against the model assumptions, at levels around 0.65 for nitrogen and 0.55 for phosphorous emissions. Relative mean absolute error is minimized around 0.2 for both nutrients, but with equifinal combinations of the varied emission pathways. Model performance is constrained by the ranges of the emission assumptions to a limited extent only.

Enhanced Understanding of Sediment Phosphorus Dynamics in River Systems with a Simple Supplemental Mass Balance Tool	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Phosphorus flux; Sorption; Water quality; Sediment; River systems; Wastewater discharge limits	INORGANIC PHOSPHORUS	In this study, a mass balance model is developed to improve the understanding of phosphorus fluxes (P fluxes) between sediment and water in a river that is strongly influenced by low-head dams and discharges from wastewater-treatment plants (WWTPs). Before this study, recommendations had been made for dredging the river without a complete understanding of the causes and effects of sediment phosphorus flux. This study changed the way the river dynamics are understood and will provide a basis for watershed management and permitting decisions into the future. The analysis presented focuses on sorption processes at the sediment-water interface as a function of the diagenesis flux rate into the sediment, reactions within the sediments with partitioning between dissolved and particulate forms, and the inorganic phosphorus concentration in the overlying waters. The sediment is modeled as two layers with a thin (0.8 mm) surface aerobic layer and an underlying, thicker (10 cm) anaerobic layer. The phosphorus settling and diagenesis flux and the initial phosphorus concentrations in the sediment and water column are varied to simulate seasonal fluctuations and evaluate the effectiveness of different river management scenarios aimed at reducing phosphorus concentrations. This study shows the importance of including such a microanalysis within water-quality studies to enhance overall system understanding when making water management decisions.

The response of Lake Tahoe to climate change	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article							RESERVOIRS; DYNAMICS	Meteorology is the driving force for lake internal heating, cooling, mixing, and circulation. Thus continued global warming will affect the lake thermal properties, water level, internal nutrient loading, nutrient cycling, food-web characteristics, fish-habitat, aquatic ecosystem, and other important features of lake limnology. Using a 1-D numerical model-the Lake Clarity Model (LCM) -together with the down-scaled climatic data of the two emissions scenarios (B1 and A2) of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Global Circulation Model, we found that Lake Tahoe will likely cease to mix to the bottom after about 2060 for A2 scenario, with an annual mixing depth of less than 200 m as the most common value. Deep mixing, which currently occurs on average every 3-4 years, will (under the GFDL B1 scenario) occur only four times during 2061 to 2098. When the lake fails to completely mix, the bottom waters are not replenished with dissolved oxygen and eventually dissolved oxygen at these depths will be depleted to zero. When this occurs, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and ammonium-nitrogen (both biostimulatory) are released from the deep sediments and contribute approximately 51 % and 14 % of the total SRP and dissolved inorganic nitrogen load, respectively. The lake model suggests that climate change will drive the lake surface level down below the natural rim after 2085 for the GFDL A2 but not the GFDL B1 scenario. The results indicate that continued climate changes could pose serious threats to the characteristics of the Lake that are most highly valued. Future water quality planning must take these results into account.	[Sahoo, G. B.; Schladow, S. G.; Reuter, J. E.] Univ Calif Davis, Tahoe Environm Res Ctr, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Sahoo, G.

J	Liu, S; Chang, NB				Liu, Sha; Chang, Ni-Bin			Geochemical impact of aquifer storage and recovery operation on fate and transport of sediment phosphorus in a large shallow lake	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Aquifer storage and recovery; Climate change; Eutrophication; Fate and transport; Geochemical cycle; Lake management; Phosphorus stability	SUBTROPICAL LAKE; FLORIDA; MODEL; EUTROPHICATION; OKEECHOBEE; RIVER	In response to the impact of climate change, the US Army Corps of Engineers proposed a large-scale implementation plan for an aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) project in the Kissimmee River Basin, Florida, in 2009. It is envisaged that the routine operation of the ASR will deliver recovered water from ASR wells into Lake Okeechobee with inherently different water quality parameters. However, the addition of ASR well water into such a large, shallow lake has raised concerns about sediment phosphorus stability, which could lead to increased eutrophication in Lake Okeechobee. This paper presents a geochemical assessment to explore possible impacts of the addition of ASR well water on lake sediment in terms of phosphorus adsorption, desorption, and diffusion processes via laboratory-scale batch and column tests. Based on five different mixing ratios of ASR well water and lake water, estimated isotherms, and piston velocity calculations, a mechanistic modeling analysis provided a better understanding of the fate of sediment phosphorus and its transport processes. A final multicriteria decision analysis suggests that the mixing ratio of 1:10 between ASR well water and lake water is deemed more applicable than others based on the given composition of ASR well water, which might buffer more external phosphorus loading in the long run.

Water quality modelling of Lis River, Portugal	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Lis River; Water quality; Modelling; QUAL2Kw model	QUAL2KW; INDIA	The aim of the study was to predict the impact of flow conditions, discharges and tributaries on the water quality of Lis River using QUAL2Kw model. Calibration of the model was performed, based on data obtained in field surveys carried out in July 2004 and November 2006. Generally the model fitted quite well the experimental data. The results indicated a decrease of water quality in the downstream area of Lis River, after the confluence of Lena, Milagres and Amor tributaries, as a result of discharges of wastewaters containing degradable organics, nutrients and pathogenic organisms from cattle-raising wastewaters, domestic effluents and agricultural runoff. The water quality criteria were exceeded in these areas for dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen and faecal coliforms. Water quality modelling in different scenarios showed that the impact of tributaries on the quality of Lis River water was quite negligible and mainly depends on discharges, which are responsible by an increase of almost 45, 13 and 44 % of ultimate carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBODu), ammonium nitrogen and faecal coliforms, for winter simulation, and 23, 33 and 36 % for summer simulation, respectively, when compared to the real case scenario.

J	Buckley, C; Carney, P				Buckley, Cathal; Carney, Patricia			The potential to reduce the risk of diffuse pollution from agriculture while improving economic performance at farm level	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Nutrient management efficiency; Data envelopment analysis; Agriculture; Water quality	DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; NONPARAMETRIC FRONTIER ESTIMATION; TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY; DAIRY FARMS; NITROGEN BALANCES; PHOSPHORUS; MANAGEMENT; GRASSLAND; MODELS; IMPLEMENTATION	Within the constraints of the EU Nitrates and Water Framework Directives, controlling and managing nutrient transfers to water from excessive nutrient use on agricultural land is a significant environmental policy challenge. This paper assesses whether there is room to reduce inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus fertiliser applications and imported feeds by exploring the extent to which application rates may have exceeded optimum levels using data envelopment analysis methodology. The investigation concentrates on specialist dairy and tillage farms in the Republic of Ireland stratified by land use potential as these agricultural systems are the most intensive and may pose the greatest risk in terms of managing nutrient transfers from agricultural land to water bodies. Results demonstrate inefficiency in the utilisation of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisers across these systems. Second stage regression analysis indicates significant return to efficiency from agricultural education. Average over application of chemical fertilizers ranged from 22.8 to 32.8 kg N ha(-1) and 2.9 to 3.51 kg P ha(-1) in 2008 which research has shown is at least similar and greater than losses to leaching and runoff for N and P, respectively, from similar intensive agricultural land uses. Potential cost savings on chemical fertilisers across all systems on average ranged from (sic)38.9 ha(-1) to (sic)48.5 ha(-1). Additionally, potential cost reductions on imported feeds of (sic)65-84 per livestock were indicated for dairy farms versus efficient cohort benchmark farms. Average excess of imported feedstuffs equated to 5.82-7.44 kg LU-1 of N and 0.92-1.17 kg LU-1 of P. Such reductions have the potential to deliver a double dividend by reducing the risk of diffuse nutrient losses from agricultural land while improving economic margins at farm level.

The Contribution of Groundwater Discharge to Nutrient Exports from a Coastal Catchment: Post-Flood Seepage Increases Estuarine N/P Ratios	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Submarine groundwater discharge; Subterranean estuary; Permeable sediments; Acid sulphate soils; Eutrophication; Deoxygenation	RICHMOND RIVER ESTUARY; ACID SULFATE SOILS; SUBTERRANEAN ESTUARY; NITROGEN INPUTS; WATER-QUALITY; FLOOD EVENT; LAND-USE; BAY; BIOGEOCHEMISTRY; FLORIDA	Four months of daily nutrient and radon (a natural groundwater tracer) observations at the outlet of a heavily drained coastal wetland illustrated how episodic floods and diffuse groundwater seepage influence the biogeochemistry of a sub-tropical estuary (Richmond River, New South Wales, Australia). Our observations downstream of the Tuckean Swamp (an acid sulphate soil floodplain) covered a dry stage, a flood triggered by a 213-mm rain event and a post-flood stage when surface water chemistry was dominated by groundwater discharge. Significant correlations were found between radon and ammonium and N/P ratios and between radon and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) during the post-flood stage. While the flood lasted for 14 % of the time of the surface water time series, it accounted for 18 % of NH4, 32 % of NO (x) , 66 % of DON, 58 % of PO4 and 55 % of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) catchment exports. Over the 4-month study period, groundwater fluxes of 35.0, 3.6, 36.3, 0.5 and 0.7 mmol m(-2) day(-1) for NH4, NO (x) , DON, PO4 and DOP, respectively, were estimated. The groundwater contribution to the total surface water catchment exports was nearly 100 % for ammonium, and < 20 % for the other nutrients. Post-flood groundwater seepage shifted the system from a DON to a dissolved inorganic N-dominated system and doubled N/P ratios in surface waters. We hypothesise that the Richmond River Estuary N/P ratios may reflect a widespread trend of tidal rivers and estuaries becoming more groundwater-dominated and phosphorus-limited as coastal wetlands are drained for agriculture, grazing and development.

Measurement of rainfall runoff and pollutant load is always the best approach but is not always possible at the desired time and location. In practice, diffuse pollution has a complex natural dependence on various land-use activities such as agriculture, livestock breeding, and forestry. Estimation of pollutant load is therefore essential for watershed management and water pollution control. In this study, a model of rainfall runoff and pollutant load, which uses a geographical information system (GIS) database, is a convenient and powerful tool for resolving the abovementioned complexities. This technology was applied in order to simulate the runoff discharge and the pollutant load of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in the Chikugo River basin of Kyushu Island, Japan. First, a hydrologic modeling system (HEC-HMS) and GIS software extension tool were used for simulations of elevation, drainage line definition, watershed delineation, drainage feature characterization, and geometric network generation. The spatial distributions of land cover, soil classes, rainfall, and evaporation were then analyzed in order to simulate the daily runoff discharge at the Chikugo Barrage from April 2005 to December 2007. An important point in this approach is that a new development for data input processing with HEC-HMS was introduced for optimizing parameters of the model. Next, the water quality indicators TN and TP were examined, and an efficient approach was investigated for estimating monthly pollutant loads directly from unit load and ground-observed hydrological data. Both nonpoint and point sources of pollutants were considered, including different land-cover categories, sewers, factories, and livestock farms. The observed and simulated results for the runoff discharges and pollutant loads were in good agreement and totally consistent, indicating that the proposed model is applicable to simulation of rainfall runoff and pollutant load in the Chikugo River basin. Further, this model will be able to provide managers with a useful tool for optimizing the water surface management of this river basin.

A MODIS approach to predicting stream water quality in Wisconsin	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						MODIS; Streamwater quality; Nitrate; Phosphorus; PLS regression; Wisconsin	LAND-USE CHANGE; NONPOINT-SOURCE POLLUTION; FORESTED WATERSHEDS; AQUATIC VEGETATION; NITROGEN LEAKAGE; RIVER-BASIN; COVER; REGRESSION; PHOSPHORUS; CHEMISTRY	Efforts to predict water quality often rely heavily on static landuse/land-cover (LULC) classifications derived from remote sensing imagery. However, LULC classifications are infrequently updated, and the development of regular (annual) land cover maps that accurately capture intra- and inter-annual change may be expensive in terms of data and labor costs. In addition, existing land cover products may not include classes relevant to the assessment of water quality. Conversely, data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments are freely available, preprocessed, frequently updated, and available in a range of useful data products. Our goal was to predict water quality for streams in Wisconsin, USA using a model constructed exclusively from MODIS products. We used streamwater nitrate and dissolved phosphorus data from 2001 to 2004 from two previous studies (Robertson et al., 2006; Stanley & Maxted, 2008) to evaluate the potential for using MODIS in an empirical model to predict water quality, thereby reducing reliance on possibly dated land cover maps. Using predictors derived exclusively from MODIS data products, we successfully predicted 80% of the variation in measured nitrate concentrations. Remote sensing based models explained 51% of the variation in dissolved phosphorus concentrations. Predictions of water quality were developed on both a per-pixel and a watershed basis. The remote sensing approach offers the potential for spatially continuous estimates of stream nutrient concentrations, and complements the suite of approaches currently used to assess water quality; including periodic stream surveys models, and point-source data.

The processors, named Case II Regional (C2R), boreal (BOR), and eutrophic (EUT), for the associated lake types, have been developed for different types of coastal or inland (Case II) waters. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a), total suspended matter (TSM), absorption of colored dissolved organic matter (alpha(CDOM)(443)), and signal depth (Z(90)) products of the BEAM processors were compared with in situ data. In addition, total absorption (alpha(TOT)) and scattering of TSM (b(TSM)) from different BEAM processors were compared against the results of coastal field campaign measurements. The in situ water quality data consisted of monitoring station data gathered by the Finnish environmental administration during 2006-2009 and data from coastal field campaigns with a flow-through system. AERONET-OC (SeaPRISM) data from the Helsinki Lighthouse station were used to validate the BEAM reflectance products. The comparison with the BEAM processor results and in situ data showed that the bias of the original BEAM algorithms can be decreased through adjustment of the coefficients that relate IOPs such as the absorption of pigments and the scattering of TSM to water quality constituents such as chl-a and turbidity. The TSM products of the BEAM processors can be used to estimate the turbidity measured at monitoring stations with an r(2) of 0.76-0.84 and an RMSE of 0.7-0.85 FNUs (Formazin Nephelometric Units) on the coast of Finland. The best functionality for turbidity estimation was observed with the EUT processor, but the C2R processor also gave a sound performance. The BOR and C2R processors proved to be the best for deriving chl-a concentration. However, the accuracy of chl-a estimations was low with both processors (r(2) ranged from 0.45 to 0.47 and RMSE was between 44 and 45%). Chl-a products, particularly during the phytoplankton bloom seasons of spring and summer, require further development. The Z(90) product from the BOR processor was used to derive an algorithm for Secchi disk depth estimation with r(2) 0.48 and RMSE 0.97 m. The BOR processor was the most successful at CDOM estimation (r(2) 0.6 and RMSE 0.49 1/m), but a simple reflectance ratio was actually able to perform better (r(2) 0.75 and RMSE 0.39 1/m). In many cases, the differences between the outcomes of processors were small and related only to a part of the in situ dataset. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

With a modified version of the lake model BELAMO, we were able to describe the essential features of the dynamics of nutrients, dissolved oxygen, phyto- and zooplankton in three lakes of different trophic status over periods of 1930 years, with essentially the same model parameters for all three lakes. This is remarkable, as the measured nutrient inputs decreased considerably during the simulated time period. 2. Despite having done this before for a period of 4 years with an earlier version of the model, a considerable effort was required that led to a series of model modifications without which the data could not be matched. This demonstrates that long-term calibration of a model that combines processes in the water column with mineralisation in the sediment can be difficult. 3. Due to the necessarily simplified processes within the model, there is a bias in its output. We applied a recently developed technique for model calibration and uncertainty analysis to address bias and multiple calibration criteria. To account for the demanding long-term simulations, a simplified numerical implementation of this technique was used. 4. Our results demonstrate good understanding of the chemical state of the lake during the calibration period but less of the biological variables. The credibility intervals used to visualise this knowledge widen substantially during the prediction period (consisting of the last 10 years of the simulation). 5. The joint calibration of the model with long-term data from lakes of different trophic status is possible but only with considerable prediction uncertainty. Due to the explicit consideration of bias in our calibration technique, we are able to estimate quantitatively the uncertainty of our knowledge about chemical and biological variables in the lake.

J	Piirainen, S; Domisch, T; Moilanen, M; Nieminen, M				Piirainen, Sirpa; Domisch, Timo; Moilanen, Mikko; Nieminen, Mika			Long-term effects of ash fertilization on runoff water quality from drained peatland forests	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Drainage water; Heavy metals; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Potassium; Sulfate	SOIL-SOLUTION CHEMISTRY; WOOD-ASH; CHEMICAL-PROPERTIES; MICROBIAL ACTIVITY; CONIFEROUS STANDS; NUTRIENT STATUS; GROWTH; ADSORPTION; CATCHMENTS; BIOMASS	The increasing use of wood and peat in energy production has created a potential to utilize wood and peat ashes as forest fertilizers on a wide scale. Previous studies have shown that tree growth in peatland benefits most from ash fertilization. However, possible harmful effects on recipient watercourses have prevented any larger-scale fertilization activity. The objective of this study was to examine the long-term changes in runoff acidity and the transport of nutrients, heavy metals and dissolved organic carbon via drainage water from drained boreal peatland catchments fertilized with wood or peat ash. The hypotheses were that the site's peat type, the origin and formula of the ash and the time of application have an influence on leaching amounts. Therefore, the studied catchments represented different peat (Carex or Sphagnum) and site types with different standing tree stocks (8-127 m(3) ha(-1)). Loose, self-hardened and drum-granulated ashes (wood and peat ashes) were used and applied (5000-6500 kg ha(-1)) either in winter on snow or in summer on bare ground. Water samples from the runoff were taken over a 10-11-year period following the applications. After 10-11 years from the treatments, the concentrations of S, K, Na, Cl-, and Mg in the runoff water were still higher at the wood ash treatments compared to the controls. Leaching of elements from peat ash was lower than from wood ash due to the lower content of elements. We estimated that 15-52% of the added S and 2-28% of the added K were leached from the wood and peat ashes during the study period. Leaching of S was the highest after the winter application and higher from the Sphagnum than from the Carex peat dominated catchments. The leaching of K was the highest after the summer application and was the lowest from the catchments having the highest tree stock. No increased leaching of P, N, dissolved organic carbon or heavy metals was detected. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We extracted four significant input variables from 15 input variables, including watershed chemical loads, precipitation, inflow, and outflow. In this study, back-propagation neural network (BPNN) was adopted to estimate the total phosphorous (TP) concentration in a reservoir. The BPNN yields more accurate predictive capability, compared to traditional multilinear regression (MLR) models.

The artificial neural network is a mathematical model on the basis of the results of modern neuroscience. The model has been applied in pattern recognition and in the field of environmental science. Although many methods of lake eutrophication evaluation are applied, in the final analysis, the evaluation is a pattern recognition problem([1]). So in recent years the artificial neural network in the lake water quality evaluation has been a wide range of applications. However, due to the lake nutritional state level is changing, different regions, different times of the day, the level of nutritional status is different, a simple artificial neural network eutrophication evaluation model can only reflect the overall condition of the lake eutrophication,and does not reflect the lake eutrophication changes in the distribution of the situation in time and space.At the same time, because the neural network is a highly nonlinear model, the outputs of the specific meaning are not understanded easily than fuzzy comprehensive evaluation.In the paper,for example,the water qualities of each quarter in four years of six districts in Chaohu Lake were evaluated based on back-Propagation network in series with degree of membership(BPDM) model,and the nutritional state levels and the variation of Chaohu Lake in the period of time are reflected more comprehensive and visually.

Hyperspectral remote sensing is being exploited to retrieve the true estimation of phytoplankton from all platforms like satellite, airborne sensors and handheld field spectroradiometers. This study was aimed to utilize both satellite sensors and field spectrometers for proper assessment of Chlorophyll-a. 4-band model with band combination [Rrs(lambda(1))(-1)-Rrs(lambda(2))(-1)]x[Rrs(lambda(4))(-1)-Rrs(lambda(3))(-1)](-1) is found better than other models, while for Landsat ETM+, band combination b1/b2 is found better for estimating Chlorophyll-a as compared to other band combinations. It is also found that FLAASH is not suitable for atmospheric correction of ETM+ images destined to study Chlorophyll-a concentration.

In the present study, a first attempt has been made towards the coupling of a realistic three-dimensional estuarine circulation model with biophysical model in the Hooghly Estuary (21 degrees 36'-22 degrees 16'N and 87 degrees 42'-88 degrees 15'E) to simulate and capture the varying effect of plankton biomass with response to river discharge and tidal effect. In-situ observational data for physico-chemical and biological parameters were collected from different sampling stations during 2003-2010 are assimilated using successive over relaxation method (SOR) and multiscale objective analysis (OA) and incorporated in Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) to setup a higher resolution both in horizontal (0.5 km X 0.5 km) and vertical (8 vertical levels) biogeochemical model. Strong tidal influence with sliding growth of phytoplankton (less than 1mg/l) towards south and low dissolved oxygen (DO) is low (5.27 mg/l) in the Haldi River mouth also affects water quality.

To determine the non-linear relationships between the water quality factors and the eutrophication indicators, several ANN models was chosen for the investigation. A commonly used back-propagation neural network model was used to relate the key factors that influence a number of water quality indicators such as dissolved oxygen (DO), total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and secchi disk depth (SD) in Lake Fuxian. The measured data were fed to the input layer, representing forcing functions to control the in-lake bio-chemical processes. Eutrophication indicators such as DO, TN, Chl-a and SD were represented in the output layers. The results indicated that the back-propagation neural network model performs good in ten months prediction and the neural network is able to predict these indicators with reasonable accuracy. This study also suggested that the neural network is a valuable tool for lake management. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Sensitivity analysis to investigate the factors controlling the effectiveness of a nitrification inhibitor in the soil	20TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2013)			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 01-06, 2013	Adelaide, AUSTRALIA	CSIRO, Univ S Australia, Ctr Ind & Appl Math, Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol, GOYDER Inst, Govt S Australia, Australian Math Soc, Australian Math Sci Inst, Simulat Australia, Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math		Nitrogen losses; Water quality; Soil processes; DCD; Sensitivity analysis; APSIM simulation	NEW-ZEALAND; GRAZED PASTURE; DICYANDIAMIDE DCD; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; NITROGEN; TEMPERATURE; SIMULATION; MANAGEMENT; DYNAMICS; QUALITY	Nitrification inhibitors have been proposed as an option to mitigate nitrogen (N) losses from farmland. One of these inhibitors, dicyandiamide (DCD), has been shown to significantly reduce N leaching and N2O emissions from nitrogen enriched soils with no adverse effects to the soil environment. However, the effectiveness of DCD in reducing N losses has been shown to be quite variable. We postulate this variability can be linked to the persistence of DCD in the soil layers where ammonium is located. DCD in soils will be subject to biodegradation and so the persistence of DCD in soils should be inversely proportional to microbial activity, for which temperature is a major driver. Furthermore, DCD is a neutral-charge compound and so should be highly mobile in soils and prone to leaching in direct proportion to rainfall. Thus, after application, the distribution of DCD in the soil profile over time can be affected by temperature, rainfall and the soil's drainage characteristics. We employed the simulation model APSIM with a recently-developed DCD module to analyse how the environmental conditions affect the processes governing the persistence of DCD in soils. The analyses involve data from simulations of typical pasture land in different locations across New Zealand with representative rainfall and temperature regimes and soil types. The simulations considered the application of DCD at different rates and in different seasons, over a 20 years period. Using sensitivity analysis techniques, we studied which processes play the greatest role in the disappearance of DCD. This led to recommendations for experimental protocols, including soil sampling, and data analysis which can be used to discern between leaching and degradation. The persistence of DCD was studied using the solutes' apparent half-life, that is, the time taken for the concentration of the solute to decrease to half of its initial concentration. We use the adjective 'apparent' because the reduction in concentration is a result of a combination of degradation and leaching rather than degradation alone. The results from the simulations with DCD were compared with those from simulations with the application of an inert tracer in which the apparent half-life is affected by leaching alone. Differences in the apparent persistence of DCD and tracer from the soil's top 20 cm layer were used to infer the relative effects of degradation and leaching. The results showed large variability for the values of apparent half-life of both solutes, but the variability was considerably smaller for DCD than for the tracer. The month of application and location (weather) were the two major factors driving the variations in apparent half-life of both solutes, with soil-type and some of the interactions between factors being secondary. However the order of relevance for the factors was different for DCD than for the tracer. Overall the influence of month of application in the apparent half-life of DCD was quite small, whereas it was the most important factor for the disappearance of the tracer. The difference between the apparent half-lives of the two solutes can be used to infer the effect of degradation on DCD persistence; the results show, therefore, that the month of application is very important for determining DCD degradation. The relative effects of leaching and degradation follow a clear seasonal pattern, in summer degradation is the major factor and leaching is of lesser importance, but in winter leaching is much more important than degradation. This offset seasonality for the two processes results in the low overall seasonality for the apparent half-life of DCD. It also emphasizes the challenge of distinguishing the relative importance of leaching and degradation for DCD persistence in the soil. To better determine the causes of variation in residence time of DCD, and thus its effectiveness, experiments should use a tracer applied alongside DCD.

Sensitivity analysis of SWAT model in the Yarra River catchment	20TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2013)			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 01-06, 2013	Adelaide, AUSTRALIA	CSIRO, Univ S Australia, Ctr Ind & Appl Math, Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol, GOYDER Inst, Govt S Australia, Australian Math Soc, Australian Math Sci Inst, Simulat Australia, Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math		Sensitivity analysis; SWAT; Latin-Hypercube and One-factor-At-a-Time (LH-OAT) sampling; Yarra River catchment; Australia	AUTOCALIBRATION; PHOSPHORUS; SOIL; TOOL	Catchment-scale hydrologic and diffuse source pollution models simulating a catchment are useful analysis tools to understand problems and find solutions through simulation of BMPs for particular catchment and agronomic settings. However, developing reliable catchment model and validating them on real-world catchment with monitored data is challenging. In this regard, model calibration and uncertainty analysis help to evaluate the ability of the model to sufficiently predict streamflow and constituent yields for specific applications. Complex physics-based distributed models contain many parameters that can complicate calibration process. In addition, the model when includes multi-variable at multi-site with multi-objective functions introduces more complexity to the calibration process. Over-parameterization is a well-known problem in such distributed model. Sensitivity analysis methods reducing the number of parameters to be adjusted during calibration are important for simplifying the use of these models. The objective of this paper is to perform a sensitivity analysis for multiple variables (streamflow, sediment and nutrients) at three sites on a SWAT model developed in the agricultural part of the Yarra River catchment, Victoria (Australia) so that the model can be calibrated efficiently for water quality analysis purposes. SWAT is a continuous physics-based distributed model that operates on a daily time-step. The SWAT model requires the following data types: digital elevation model (DEM), land use, soil, land use management, daily climate, streamflow and water quality data. Australian catchments are data-rich in terms of hydroclimatic data, but data-poor especially for water quality and land use management. For this study, all the data were collected from local organizations except DEM. Water quality and land use management data were most sparse. All input files for the model were organized and assembled following the guidelines of ArcSWAT interface of the SWAT 2005 version. The study area was delineated into 51 sub-catchments and 431 hydrological response units (HRU), which are unique combinations of land use, soil type and slope. The main methods used in modeling the hydrologic processes in SWAT were curve number method for runoff estimating, Penman-Monteith method for PET and Muskingum method for channel routing. SWAT has an embedded automatic sensitivity, and calibration and uncertainty analysis tool. The sensitivity analysis method is a combination of Latin-Hypercube and One-factor-At-a-Time (LH-OAT) sampling that allows a global sensitivity analysis for a long list of parameters with only a limited number of model runs. SWAT has 26 streamflow, 6 sediment and 9 nutrient parameters. The LH-OAT sensitivity analysis was applied for streamflow (Q), Total Nitrogen (TN), Total Phosphorus (TP) and Total Suspended Solid (TSS) output variables at three sites in the study area for 1998-2008 periods. The LH-OAT sensitivity analysis provides a simple and quick way to assess parameter sensitivity for multiple variables across the study area. The output variables found to be most sensitive to 15 hydrologic parameters, and 13 sediment and nutrients parameters in the SWAT model. The results show that the hydrologic parameters dominate the highest parameter ranks. The results also show that water quality variables are potentially capable of contributing to the identification of water quantity parameters within the SWAT model, and a single parameter is correlated to multiple variables. Moreover, there were clear differences in ranking of a parameter among the three sites. This result has evidenced how the parameter importance depends on land use, topography and soil types, meaning that a generalization within a catchment is limited. Hence, justify the importance of multi-site parameterization	[Das, S. K.; Ng, A. W. M.; Perera, B. J.

It is timely to pause and take stock of these models. Do these models accurately reflect our current understanding of the biogeochemistry of aquatic systems? Is their predictive performance improving? Are they improving in the range of system properties and behaviours that can be predicted? Where there is variety in approaches or algorithms, can we demonstrate that one method is better than another and should be preferred? This review begins this process, focusing on how phosphorus cycles are represented in models of aquatic systems. A systematic review of 71 distinct published biogeochemical and ecological models of aquatic systems in 167 applications finds: Lake models and marine models are very similar, while river and catchment models differ. This appears largely to be due to different traditions within modelling communities rather than real differences in biogeochemical processes. River models tend to have simpler representations of phosphorus than lake or marine models. The performance of river models is usually quantitatively assessed using standard metrics (77% of publications include some performance metrics), while this is usually not the case for lake models (35% include some quantitative metric) or marine models (only 29%). Across all three domains, models are becoming more complex over time (Figure 1), but there is no clear evidence that this is improving the predictive performance of models. The appropriate degree of model complexity depends on a number of factors, including the resources and data available to support the model and the purpose for which the model is being developed. Simpler models can be more rigorously calibrated and evaluated and may have just as much predictive capacity, while physiologically-based models, which are usually more complex, may be more generalisable and better able to anticipate unexpected responses and emergent properties of the system. A range of phosphorus papers not included in current models is discussed, including the biogeochemistry of organic phosphorus, the biogeochemical implications of flow through sediments, and sediment drying and re-wetting. In some aquatic environments, these processes are likely to be important. It is concluded that a broader community toolkit of model algorithms is required. [GRAPHICS] .

CLUES allows users to create both land use and farm practice change scenarios (stocking rates, mitigation) using a range of tools. Results are available in map and tabular displays. Our aim was to model the effects of land use change and intensification on nutrient loads and concentrations in streams in New Zealand, over recent periods of intensification (since 1996) and into the future (to 2020). The CLUES model was run for six scenarios reflecting changes in land use and stocking rates. Predictions of the spatial distribution of nutrient loading to streams and changes over time are presented. The predicted total nitrogen (N) load (the load entering streams) increased by 20.4% from 1996 to 2020, reflecting both an increase in dairy area and intensification. Overall, N loads increased significantly over time, as a result of both intensification and land use change. Total phosphorous (P) increased initially but decreased by a small amount overall due to the counterbalancing effects of changes in areas of dairying and changes in afforestation. Regional analysis showed that N loads increased over time in all regions, except that in Auckland and Northland the load decreased slightly from 1996 to 2008, because the area of dairying decreased in those regions, and in Gisborne, N loads decreased from 1996 to 2020, during which time hill country sheep and beef areas decreased considerably and planted forest and scrub areas increased. The largest percentage increases occurred in the Canterbury and Southland regions, and were associated with the large increases in dairying. P loads decreased only slightly overall nationally, with increases in some regions and decreases in others. In Northland, P load decreased because the area of dairying decreased and the area of forestry on vulnerable soils increased. In Northland, there was also a decrease in P, as sheep and beef areas reverted to scrub. In Bay of Plenty, there was a decrease in P due to the conversion of sheep and beef areas to forestry. In other regions, such as Gisborne and Hawke's Bay, there was an overall decrease in P load, because the effect of increased dairy was outweighed by the effect of afforestation. In areas such as Southland, though, there was an overall increase, due to increased dairying without afforestation, while in other regions such as Canterbury, P load increased due to intensification and increased dairy areas. The overall implication from a modelling perspective is that land use change and intensification has and will continue to result in increased nutrient loadings and concentrations in New Zealand streams.

Optimising economic and environmental outcomes: water quality challenges in Corner Inlet Victoria	20TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2013)			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 01-06, 2013	Adelaide, AUSTRALIA	CSIRO, Univ S Australia, Ctr Ind & Appl Math, Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol, GOYDER Inst, Govt S Australia, Australian Math Soc, Australian Math Sci Inst, Simulat Australia, Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math		Decision Support System (DSS); bioeconomic optimisation framework; water quality	POLICIES	The Corner Inlet and Nooramunga Coastal Hotspot and Ramsar site is one of Victoria's important environmental assets. The seagrass beds are critically important to the ecosystem and these are under threat due to sediment and nutrient (nitrogen, N and phosphorus, P) export from agricultural land management (mostly dairy and beef). The West Gippsland Catchment Management Authority (CMA), along with the Victorian and Australian governments, have responsibilities balancing the needs of local communities, including the economic viability of agricultural and fishing industries, and protecting the environmental values of the site through developing and implementing a Water Quality Improvement Plan (WQIP). This study used science and local expert knowledge to develop a bioeconomic optimisation framework (using the General Algebraic Modelling System, GAMS) which informed a stakeholder panel overseeing the WQIP about the costs of achieving pollutant reduction targets under different land use and management options. These included traditionally funded activities (gully, stream and waterway fencing), agricultural 'best-management practices' (BMPs) and land use change. A previously calibrated catchment model provided sub-catchment load estimates of total N (TN), total P (TP) and total suspended sediments (TSS). Development of a new land use layer allowed the proportions of dairy, beef and forestry to be ascribed. BMP effectiveness was assessed by expert opinion and the contribution of gully and waterways were estimated by extrapolating nearby modelling and mapping information based on similar soils. The change in operating profit was calculated assuming single representative dairy and beef systems and practices. A stakeholder and technical panel comprising the CMA, Victorian and Australian governments, farming, fluvial ecology, hydrodynamics, seagrass ecology and catchment modelling expertise oversaw development of the WQIP. Choices about TN, TP and TSS reduction targets to be assessed were made based not only on estimated ecological outcomes, but also considering costs and political acceptability of implied land use and management changes. Three scenarios are presented: 'ideal at least cost' (best estimate of load reduction targets required to maintain seagrass); 'revised at least cost' which was half of the ideal target; 'revised with traditional activities only' (gully, stream and waterway fencing). Achieving 'ideal' targets at least cost was estimated to result in an average loss in profit (cost) of $458/ha over the grazed area (757 km(2)) and involved large scale retirement of agricultural land (over 96% dairy area and over 30% beef area). The 'revised' targets were estimated to cost $157/ha and still required significant land retirement (75% dairy land). Restricting land use activities to those traditionally funded and excluding land use change/retirement options increased costs from $157 to $292/ha. Overall these results imply that achieving large environmental gains involves major politically, socially and economically unacceptable impacts on grazing industries. The premise of 'win: win' outcomes, the basis of most publicly funded programs in Australia, is significantly challenged. The results have been actively and adaptively used by the CMA to inform a realistic WQIP. Stakeholders recognised that the information base is imperfect and that refinement (finer scale catchment modelling and inclusion of heterogeneity in dairy and beef systems) could substantially reduce the estimated costs in achieving environmental outcomes. Bioeconomic modelling and active participation helped people understand the need for a more informed discussion about potential trade-offs between protecting environmental ecosystems and maintaining agricultural profitability. Policy choices involving targeted regulation to protect valuable ecosystems are likely to be needed, as is occurring elsewhere in the world.

Suitability of a coupled hydrodynamic water quality model to predict changes in water quality from altered meteorological boundary conditions	20TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2013)			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 01-06, 2013	Adelaide, AUSTRALIA	CSIRO, Univ S Australia, Ctr Ind & Appl Math, Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol, GOYDER Inst, Govt S Australia, Australian Math Soc, Australian Math Sci Inst, Simulat Australia, Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math		Water quality; Sensitivity analysis; ELCOM-CAEDYM	CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACTS; SHALLOW; LAKE	The application of downscaled climate scenarios can be used to inform management decisions on investment in water treatment infrastructure or alternative water sources. Appropriate models of the system components potentially impacted by climate change such as catchments, rivers, lakes and reservoirs are required. The sensitivity of the coupled hydrodynamic water quality model ELCOM-CAEDYM to climate drivers was investigated to determine its suitability for evaluating climate change impacts and to evaluate the most important climatic drivers. A case study application of the model to Happy Valley Reservoir was used in the investigation (Romero et al. 2005). The hydrodynamic model was validated against field measurements without calibration. The ecological model was set up using values derived from literature sources and measurements made at other reservoirs. Manual calibration of some parameters was performed, however, performance metrics were not provided by Romero et al. (2005). A series of simulations were run with altered boundary condition inputs for the reservoir. Air and inflowing water temperature (TEMP), wind speed (WIND) and reservoir inflow and outflow (FLOW) were altered to investigate the sensitivity of these key drivers over relevant domains. The simulated water quality variables responded in the broadly expected manner to the altered boundary conditions; sensitivity of the simulated cyanobacteria population to increases in temperature was similar to published values. This study demonstrated that ELCOM-CAEDYM is sensitive to climate drivers and suitable for use in climate impact studies. It further highlighted the important factors in determining phytoplankton growth and that any changes in inflowing water quality will be of major importance to the dynamics of raw water quality.

Effects of climate and landuse activities on water quality in the Yarra River catchment	20TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2013)			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 01-06, 2013	Adelaide, AUSTRALIA	CSIRO, Univ S Australia, Ctr Ind & Appl Math, Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol, GOYDER Inst, Govt S Australia, Australian Math Soc, Australian Math Sci Inst, Simulat Australia, Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math		Pollutant concentrations and loads; Climate and landuse activities; Water quality; LOADEST; Yarra River catchment	NUTRIENT LOADS; PROGRAM	Since sediment and nutrient concentrations vary with landuses in different climatic conditions, it is critical in understanding the connection between different landuses activities and water quality, and developing appropriate management strategies for a catchment. The objective of this paper is to assess the effects of climate and landuse activities on nutrient and sediment loads at 5 selected water quality monitoring stations in the Yarra River catchment of Victoria, Australia for 1994-2008 periods. A data-based technique was applied to achieve the above objective using long-term in-stream water quality data and other readily available tools. The methodology addressed the issues of selecting water quality stations, catchment disaggregation, identification of major landuse types, analysis of pollutant concentrations and loads in different climatic conditions, and suitable data-based method (regression model LOADEST) to estimate pollutant loadings. Climatic data were collected from the SILO climate database and the Bureau of Meteorology. Precipitation data from 16 stations and temperature data from 4 stations located in the Middle Yarra segment were collected for the period of 1980-2008. Daily streamflow and monthly water quality grab sample data of Total Suspended Solid (TSS), Total Nitrogen (TN) and Total Phosphorus (TP) were available for the 5 stations from Melbourne Water. ArcGIS 9.3 tool was used for catchment disaggregation and major landuse type identification using ASTER 30m global digital elevation model and landuse map (50m grid raster data collected from Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences). The water quality monitoring stations were selected based on data availability and dominant major landuse types (urban, agriculture and forest). The dominant landuse type in the tributary stations was either agriculture or urban where as in the main Yarra River stations; it was forest-agriculture mix type. There was an abrupt drop in rainfall after 1996 known as millennium drought in the catchment, and the most extreme rainfall event occurs in that drought period. The study period was categorised into wet, dry and average years based on rainfall for water quality analysis purposes. Since the correlations between the concentrations of TSS, TN, TP, and streamflow (TSS: 0.57-0.72; TN: 0.50-0.57 and TP: 0.50-0.57 except station 5) were high and statistically significant (p<0.01), a regression method based model LOADEST was used to estimate constituent loads from the grab sample data. The LOADEST model is well documented, and is accepted as a valid means of calculating constituent load from a limited number of water quality data. The LOADEST model performed well in estimating TSS, TN and TP loads. Coefficients of determination (R-2) for the regression models in LOADEST were greater than 0.84, 0.94 and 0.88 for TSS, TN and TP respectively at all stations. In general, TSS, TN and TP mean concentrations were higher in wet years than in the dry and average years, except at stations 2 and 3 where TN mean concentrations were higher in the average years. Also, TSS and TP mean concentrations were higher in the dry years than in the average years. This is due to the direct correlation of TSS and TP, and high runoff events. In addition, TSS, TN and TP mean concentrations were higher in the urban areas, and then in the agricultural areas. The four wet years (1995, 1996, 2000 and 2004) carried out on average 60% of TSS, 51% of TN and 53% of TP loadings in the monitoring stations. During the study period (1994-2008), the highest export rates of TSS, TN and TP were from urban areas, and the lowest export rates of TSS and TP were from forest areas, and TN from agricultural areas. Overall, water quality and constituent concentrations were influenced by rainfall events and landuse types.	[Das, S. K.; Ng, A. W. M.; Perera, B. J. C.; Adhikary, S.

Catchment modelling scenarios to inform GBR water quality targets	20TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2013)			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 01-06, 2013	Adelaide, AUSTRALIA	CSIRO, Univ S Australia, Ctr Ind & Appl Math, Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol, GOYDER Inst, Govt S Australia, Australian Math Soc, Australian Math Sci Inst, Simulat Australia, Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math		Land management; Catchment modelling; water quality targets; load reductions	GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; LOADS	The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) Water Quality Plan outlines a clear set of water quality and management practice targets (50% reduction in nutrients and photosystem II (PSII) herbicides by 2013, 20% reduction in TSS by 2020). Five lines of evidence have been used to report on progress towards reef plan targets due to investment into improved agricultural management practices. This paper provides an overview of the results from one line of evidence, catchment modelling. The eWater CRC Source Catchments modelling framework was used to generate sediment, nutrient and herbicide loads entering the GBR lagoon from 35 reef catchments. Six catchment models were built for the GBR (423, 000km(2)). Data was collected for each industry under an A (cutting edge), B (best practice), C (common) and D (unacceptable) management practice framework for the baseline year (2008/09) and following implementation of improved management practices. Load reductions were calculated with respect to the baseline load. At the request of the funding agency, Queensland Government Premiers Department, additional scenarios were also run to determine if targets could be met by shifting to an "All A" practice adoption. The modelling results suggest there was a 6.2% reduction in average annual suspended sediment load leaving GBR catchments due to two years of investment with the greatest reduction from grazing areas. In the case of total nitrogen, the average annual load was reduced by 6.7%, with the greatest reduction from the Burdekin and Wet Tropics NRM regions. The average annual PSII herbicide load was reduced by 14.6%, with 70% of the reduction from the Wet Tropics and Mackay-Whitsunday regions. Improved herbicide management practices in the cane industry contributed to the largest reduction. Modelling suggests that TSS targets could be met under a 50/50 A/B management scenario whilst the 50% nitrogen reduction target may not be met under an All A management scenario. The Source Catchment modelling framework is now established across the entire GBR region, and enables regional NRM groups to use the model outputs to make more informed decisions as to where investment should occur to achieve the greatest load reductions for the least cost. This paper describes how the Source Catchment modelling framework is firstly used to report on progress in meeting Reef Plan 2009 water quality targets; and secondly to run additional scenarios to assess the potential to achieve the given water quality targets.

Modelling river constituent budgets in the Burnett Mary region, Queensland, Australia: An example of how it could be used in prioritising management actions	20TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2013)			English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 01-06, 2013	Adelaide, AUSTRALIA	CSIRO, Univ S Australia, Ctr Ind & Appl Math, Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol, GOYDER Inst, Govt S Australia, Australian Math Soc, Australian Math Sci Inst, Simulat Australia, Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math		Burnett Mary; constituent budget; Great Barrier Reef; water quality		To improve the declining water quality entering the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the Australian and Queensland governments are funding changes to on-ground management practices through the Reef Plan Program. Reef Plan 2013, outlines specific water quality targets to address the decline in water quality entering the GBR. For example, it has set a target of 20% reduction in fine sediment export by 2018. An integrated water quality monitoring and modelling program has been established to measure and report on progress in meeting the water quality targets. Current prioritisation of on-ground management actions are based on previous modelling outputs, local knowledge and perception of areas and industries that are likely to generate disproportionately high amounts of constituents. The current Catchment modelling approach will enable more effective prioritisation to catchment areas and pollutant generation processes. This paper reports the results of the recent modelling of constituent budgets using the Source Catchments model outputs including identification of sources of supply to the river system, sinks and contributions to export to the GBR from catchments in the Burnett Mary region, and discusses how this information can be used in prioritizing on-ground management actions. This paper also highlights how examination of modelled constituent budgets can be used to (1) identify parts of the model that may be improved and (2) provide insight into the selection of water quality monitoring sites for model calibration and validation. Of the total modelled suspended sediment (TSS) supplied to the stream network, only 37% (438 kt) is exported, 46% (541 kt/y) is trapped in reservoirs (estimated by an algorithm used commonly elsewhere but modified to simulate daily sediment trapping in the Burdekin Falls Dam), 17% (198 kt/y) is lost as the result of water extraction while floodplain deposition and residual storage accounted for only 1%. The model estimates that streambank erosion, hillslope erosion and gully erosion contribute 56, 28, and 6% of the TSS exported to the GBR lagoon; with each respective erosion process supplying 29, 27, and 3% of particulate nitrogen (PN), and 28, 33, and 3%, of particulate phosphorus (PP). Particulate Nitrogen and Phosphorus budgets were similar to the TSS percent exported compared to the total amount generated. On the other hand, the model estimates that higher percentages of dissolved nutrients and Photosystem II inhibiting herbicides (PSII) that are supplied to the stream network (i.e., 68% dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), 67% dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), 67% dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) and 65% dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) and 67% PSII inhibitor herbicides) are exported to the GBR lagoon. Having the functionality in the model to identify the specific pollutant sources and generation processes that contribute comparatively high constituent export to the GBR lagoon, will help to maximise progress towards water quality targets. For example, model results show that streambank erosion in the Mary catchment is identified to be contributing the highest proportion of TSS of all GBR catchments. Therefore, streambank erosion reduction through riparian revegetation and fencing off to restrict stock access may be considered to be management actions of priority in this catchment. In summary, the GBR Source Catchments modelling framework has now been developed with a range of enhancements not available in previous modelling programs. The development of the dynamic SedNet Source modelling functionality provides regional NRM groups with valuable information for prioritisation of on-ground management investment.

We determined the nutrient loads from rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss farms using nutritional and hydro logical mass-balance models and estimated the fluxes into a regulated stream and into the Mediterranean Sea between March 2008 and February 2009. When compared with the influent, farming activity significantly decreased dissolved oxygen (p < 0.001) and increased biochemical oxygen demand, suspended solids, and nitrogen and phosphorus fractions (p < 0.05) in the effluents. The load predictions of 44.3 kg N and 8.4 kg P t(-1) of fish produced by the nutritional method were close to the measured values of 43.9 kg N and 8.8 kg P t(-1) of fish produced. The load prediction for suspended solids was the same as the measured value of 278 kg t(-1) of fish produced. The predictions were well correlated with measurements for suspended solids and for total nitrogen and phosphorus. The estimated annual mass fluxes of nitrogen and phosphorus from trout farms at the site into the eastern Mediterranean Sea were 125 to 127 and 24 to 25 t yr(-1), respectively. The nutritional mass-balance model may be the method of choice as a decision tool for the environmental impact assessment of land-based aquaculture because of its simplicity and easy application.

The transport simulations have been performed by means of HEC-RAS model, which was calibrated. Study and geochemical analyses indicate that pollutions are cumulated mainly in sediment of grain size, less than 0,20 mm. It was stated that the main sources of contaminations occurring in the Widawa River bottoms are: superficial run-off, municipal and industrial wastes. Sediment bed quality from the Widawa River in selected cross-sections has been analyzed. Samples of suspended load were collected and divided into eight fractions, for which the phosphorus concentration P was calculated. Deposit particles less than 0,20 mm contained most phosphorus, i.e. 73% (3,52 ppm), and particles greater than 0,20 mm about 27% (1,30 ppm) for the whole sample volume. Relationship between the phosphorus concentration P and the sediment grain size was determined. Analysis showed that the initiation of contamination-sediment suspension in the Widawa River is well described by Engelund criterion. Simulations of the migration of pollutions together with deposits in the Widawa River showed that during average flow discharge, the transport intensity of pollution was equal 2 mg/s, and sediments 6 kg/s. In the present work the water quality of the Widawa River has been also presented.

For one model-the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory or GFDL model-the daily model results were used to drive a distributed hydrologic model. The watershed model used an energy balance approach for computing evapotranspiration and snowpack dynamics so that the processes remain a function of the climate change projections. For this study, all other aspects of the model (i.e. land use distribution, routing configuration, and parameterization) were held constant to isolate impacts of climate change projections. The results indicate that (1) precipitation falling as rain rather than snow will increase, starting at the current mean snowline, and moving towards higher elevations over time; (2) annual accumulated snowpack will be reduced; (3) snowpack accumulation will start later; and (4) snowmelt will start earlier in the year. Certain changes were masked (or counter-balanced) when summarized as basin-wide averages; however, spatial evaluation added notable resolution. While rainfall runoff increased at higher elevations, a drop in total precipitation volume decreased runoff and fine sediment load from the lower elevation meadow areas and also decreased baseflow and nitrogen loads basin-wide. This finding also highlights the important role that the meadow areas could play as high-flow buffers under climatic change. Because the watershed model accounts for elevation change and variable meteorological patterns, it provided a robust platform for evaluating the impacts of projected climate change on hydrology and water quality.

Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada has calculated a set of science-based agri-environmental indicators (AEIs) to provide information on environmental conditions in agriculture and their trends. The indicators are based on models developed from scientific understanding of the interactions between agriculture and the environment and are calculated using mathematical models to integrate information on soils, climate, and landscape with agricultural activity or practice information from the Canadian Census of Agriculture. Several AEIs were selected to explore the effects of climate change on agri-environmental sustainability. Based on the analysis in this study, those indicators that would likely decrease in their performance in the future include: risks of soil erosion from wind and water, soil salinization, water quality, nitrogen contamination, phosphorous contamination, pesticide contamination, and particulate matter emission rate. The one indicator found to likely improve with climate change was the greenhouse gas budget. In addition, the impacts of climate change were difficult to assess for several indicators as their values are more affected by both agricultural and non-agricultural factors, as well as lack of knowledge. AEIs are important tools to measure climate impacts and to indicate the success of adaptation to those impacts. This research is only emerging, however, and many knowledge gaps exist.

Understanding the extent to which land-use patterns influence nutrient loading is critical to the development of best-management practices aimed at water-quality improvement. In this study, we investigated total nitrogen (total N) concentration as a function of land-use patterns and compared the relative significance of the identified land-use variables for 26 upstream watersheds of the Haihe River basin. Seven land-use intensity and nine landscape complexity variables were selected to form the land-use pattern metrics on the landscape scale. After analyzing the significance of the land-use pattern metrics, we obtained five dominant principal components: human-induced land-use intensity, landscape patch-area complexity, area-weighted landscape patch-shape complexity, forest and grassland area, and landscape patch-shape complexity. A linear regression model with a stepwise selection protocol was used to identify an optimal set of land-use pattern predictors. The resulting contributions to the total N concentration were 50% (human-induced land-use intensity), 23.13% (landscape patch-shape complexity), 14.38% (forest and grassland area), and 12.50% (landscape patch-area complexity), respectively. The regression model using land-use measurements can explain 87% of total N variability in the upstream regions of Haihe River. The results indicated that human-related land-use factors, such as residential areas, population, and road density, had the most significant effect on N concentration. The agricultural area (30.1% of the study region) was not found to be significantly correlated with total N concentration due to little irrigative farmland and rainfall. Results of the study could help us understand the implications of potential land-use changes that often occur as a result of the rapid development in China.

Quantifying temporal and spatial variations in sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus transport in stream inflows to a large eutrophic lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS			English	Article							WATER-QUALITY MODELS; NEW-ZEALAND; RELATIVE IMPORTANCE; CATCHMENT-SCALE; NUTRIENT EXPORT; LOAD ESTIMATION; STORM-EVENTS; LAND-USE; PHYTOPLANKTON; PARTICULATE	High-frequency sampling of two major stream inflows to a large eutrophic lake (Lake Rotorua, New Zealand) was conducted to measure inputs of total suspended sediment (TSS), and fractions of nitrogen and phosphorus (P). A total of 17 rain events were sampled, including three during which both streams were simultaneously monitored to quantify how concentration-discharge (Q) relationships varied between catchments during similar hydrological conditions. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations declined slightly during events, reflecting dilution of groundwater inputs by rainfall, whereas dissolved inorganic P (PO4-P) concentrations were variable and unrelated to Q, suggesting dynamic sorptive behaviour. Event loads of total nitrogen (TN) were predominantly DIN, which is available for immediate uptake by primary producers, whereas total phosphorus (TP) loads predominantly comprised particulate P (less labile). Positive correlations between Q and concentrations of TP (and to a lesser extent TN) reflected increased particulate nutrient concentrations at high flows. Consequently, load estimates based on hourly Q during storm events and concentrations of routine monthly samples (mostly base flow) under-estimated TN and TP loads by an average of 19% and 40% respectively. Hysteresis with Q was commonly observed and inclusion of hydrological variables that reflect Q history in regression models improved predictions of TN and TP concentrations. Lorenz curves describing the proportions of cumulative load versus cumulative time quantified temporal inequality in loading. In the two study streams, 50% of estimated two-year loads of TN, TP and TSS were transported in 202-207, 76-126 and 1-8 days respectively. This study quantifies how hydrological and landscape factors can interact to influence pollutant flux at the catchment scale and highlights the importance of including storm transfers in lake loading estimates.

Quantifying the Loss of a Marine Ecosystem Service: Filtration by the Eastern Oyster in US Estuaries	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Crassostrea virginica; USA; Restoration; Estuarine habitat; Historical ecology; Water quality	CRASSOSTREA-VIRGINICA GMELIN; CHESAPEAKE BAY; HISTORICAL ECOLOGY; RESTORATION; BIVALVES; HABITAT; CONSEQUENCES; REEFS; EUTROPHICATION; PHYTOPLANKTON	The oyster habitat in the USA is a valuable resource that has suffered significant declines over the past century. While this loss of habitat is well documented, the loss of associated ecosystem services remains poorly quantified. Meanwhile, ecosystem service recovery has become a major impetus for restoration. Here we propose a model for estimating the volume of water filtered by oyster populations under field conditions and make estimates of the contribution of past (c. 1880-1910) and present (c. 2000-2010) oyster populations to improving water quality in 13 US estuaries. We find that filtration capacity of oysters has declined almost universally (12 of the 13 estuaries examined) by a median of 85 %. Whereas historically, oyster populations achieved full estuary filtration (filtering a volume equivalent or larger than the entire estuary volume within the residence time of the water) in six of the eight estuaries in the Gulf of Mexico during summer months, this is now the case for only one estuary: Apalachicola Bay, Florida. By contrast, while all five estuaries on the North Atlantic coast showed large decreases in filtration capacity, none were achieving full estuary filtration at the time of our c. 1900 historic baseline. This apparent difference from the Gulf of Mexico is explained at least in part by our North Atlantic baseline representing a shifted baseline, as surveyed populations were already much reduced by exploitation in this region.

Prospects for ecological intensification of Australian agriculture	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article						Water use efficiency; Nutrient use efficiency; Climate risk management; Precision agriculture; Crop-livestock integration; Deficit irrigation	WATER-USE EFFICIENCY; SEASONAL CLIMATE FORECASTS; NEW-SOUTH-WALES; NATURAL-RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; AVAILABLE SOIL-WATER; DECISION-SUPPORT; NITROGEN-FERTILIZER; FARMING SYSTEMS; CROP ROTATIONS; CEREAL PRODUCTION	World population growth, changing diets and limited opportunities to expand agricultural lands will drive agricultural intensification in the decades ahead. Concerns about the reliance of past agricultural intensification on non-renewable resources, about its negative impacts on natural resources both on and off farm and on greenhouse gas emissions, provide an imperative for future agricultural intensification to become ecologically efficient. We define ecological intensification of agriculture (EIA) as: producing more food per unit resource use while minimising the impact of food production on the environment. Achieving it will require increased precision in the use of inputs and reduction in inefficiencies and losses. It will also require a more holistic view of farming, going beyond efficiencies of single inputs into a single field in a single season to consideration of efficiencies of whole systems over decades. This paper explores the ecological intensification issues facing agricultural production in Australia where opportunities for agricultural intensification are centred on more efficient use of limited and unreliable water resources in both dryland and irrigated agriculture. Ecological efficiencies can be achieved by better matching the supply of nutrients to crops' requirements both temporally and spatially. This has the added benefit of minimising the opportunities for excessive nutrients to impact on soil health (acidity and dryland salinity) and water quality (pollution of groundwater and eutrophication of lakes and rivers). Opportunities for ecologically efficient intensification are also identified through better integration of crop and livestock enterprises on mixed crop-livestock farms. We define nine desirable attributes of an EIA system: (1) increased agricultural production; (2) efficient use of limited resources; (3) minimal impact on global warming; (4) minimal negative on-site impacts; (5) minimal negative off-site impacts; (6) minimal risk and maximum resilience; (7) preservation of biodiversity in agriculture; (8) preservation of biodiversity in nature and; (9) positive social outcomes. We focus on four technologies and production systems emerging in Australian agriculture: climate risk management; precision agriculture; crop-livestock integration and deficit irrigation. For each of these systems we identify how well they are likely to match the nine desirable attributes of an EIA system. While it seems unlikely that any single technology can satisfy all nine desirable attributes, there is hope that in combination emerging and future technologies will progress Australian agriculture towards greater productivity and ecological efficiency.

Calibration of WAVE in irrigated maize: fallow vs. cover crops	FOUR DECADES OF PROGRESS IN MONITORING AND MODELING OF PROCESSES IN THE SOIL-PLANT-ATMOSPHERE SYSTEM: APPLICATIONS AND CHALLENGES	Procedia Environmental Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Four Decades of Progress in Monitoring and Modeling of Processes in the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere System	JUN 19-21, 2013	Naples, ITALY			nitrate leaching; water movement; numerical model; water quality	WATER-BALANCE; NITROGEN MANAGEMENT; SOIL; IMPACTS; FERTILIZER; DRAINAGE; SYSTEMS; REGIME	Nitrate leaching decreases crop available N and increases water contamination. Replacing fallow by cover crops (CC) is an alternative to reduce nitrate contamination, because it reduces overall drainage and soil mineral N accumulation. A study of the soil N and nitrate leaching was conducted during 5 years in a semi-arid irrigated agricultural area of Central Spain. Three treatments were studied during the intercropping period of maize (Zea mays L.): barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), vetch (Vicia villosa L.), and fallow. Cover crops, sown in October, were killed by glyphosate application in March, allowing direct seeding of maize in April. All treatments were irrigated and fertilised following the same procedure. Soil water content was measured using capacity probes. Soil N-min accumulation was determined along the soil profile before sowing and after harvesting maize. Soil analysis was conducted at six depths every 0.20 m in each plot in samples from 0 to 1.2-m depth. The mechanistic water balance model WAVE [1] was applied in order to calculate drainage and plant growth of the different treatments, and apply them to the N balance. We evaluated the water balance of this model using the daily soil water content measurements of this field trial. A new Matlab version of the model was evaluated as well. In this new version improvements were made in the solute transport module and crop module. In addition, this new version is more compatible with external modules for data processing, inverse calibration and uncertainty analysis than the previous Fortran version. The model showed that drainage during the irrigated period was minimized in all treatments, because irrigation water was adjusted to crop needs, leading to nitrate accumulation on the upper layers after maize harvest. Then, during the intercrop period, most of the nitrate leaching occurred. Cover crops usually led to a shorter drainage period, lower drainage water amount and lower nitrate leaching than the treatment with fallow. These effects resulted in larger nitrate accumulation in the upper layers of the soil after CC treatments. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Gabriel, J.

Despite the defined eutrophic status of the investigated area as mesotrophic with the exception of the eutrophic harbor site, high surface DIN/TP ratio at all investigated stations (>16) generally indicated potential P-limitation of phytoplankton growth, while occasionally, nutrient concentrations were balanced. However, at the Secchi depth and at the bottom of all investigated stations, DIN/TP ratio was near the Redfield's ratio (16) during whole investigated period, indicating unhindered and nutrient balanced phytoplankton growth. Bioassay results with higher biomass of Phaeodactylum tricornutum in water samples from the harbour site and a lower biomass in all other water samples coincided with the trophic state based on nutrients and the TRIX index. In controlling of the actual variation of trophic state it was observed that nutrients were not utilized to their maximum potential.

Soil loss by water erosion on arable land together with following sediment transport and its settling in the water system remains big issue. Various anti-erosion measures can decrease the amount of soil particles transported to the river-network and mitigate the water quality problems connected with sediment load. Process description and quantification are essential tools in soil-protection but computer modeling provides the power to quickly assess various areas and point out the endangered ones. The scope of soil-erosion modeling is very wide. For the purpose of legislation and urban planning the area of interest can cover an extent of thousands of square kilometers. On the other hand concrete anti-erosion measures design requires a scope of single farming blocks or small watersheds. The Department of Drainage, Irrigation and Landscape Engineering performs an ongoing research in soil erosion and transport modeling in various scales and their applicability. Empirical model WaTEM/SEDEM is being used for large areas modeling covering tens of thousands of square km. That serves mainly for trouble-spots localization and sediment-transport related tasks. Extensive application of WaTEM/SEDEM model covering about 40% of the extent of the Czech Republic was carried out for project NAAR project No. QI102A265 "Assessment of soil erosion and phosphorus loads causing eutrophication of stagnant water bodies". This project included soil-loss modeling, modeling of sediment and phosphorus transport in river-network and settlement in the important water reservoirs. Physically based models on the other hand enable detailed modeling of the processes, which can be used for practical design of the protection measures. Fully distributed model Erosion 3D is being used widely on the department. This software was tested on the field-block level to assess the impact of the precise farming on the soil properties as well as on a middle-sized watershed level to evaluate technical soil erosion control measures efficiency and soil-erosion off-site effects. SMODERP is physically based computer model, which is being developed in the department since 1990s. Current version of this software is profile-based (1D) and provides tools to assess the soil-erosion a single slope profile. 2D version of SMODERP allowing modeling of sheet and concentrated surface flow is currently being tested and may be released in 2013. The paper describes applications of mentioned models, their potential and limitations and the overlay in their use and scopes. Soil erosion problem in Czech Republic is discussed as well as the availability of needed input data for the models.

Using multi-model averaging to improve the reliability of catchment scale nitrogen predictions	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODELS; LAND-USE CHANGES; FORESTED CATCHMENTS; SOUTHERN SWEDEN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER-QUALITY; UNCERTAINTY; HYDROLOGY; BALANCE; IMPACT	Hydro-biogeochemical models are used to foresee the impact of mitigation measures on water quality. Usually, scenario-based studies rely on single model applications. This is done in spite of the widely acknowledged advantage of ensemble approaches to cope with structural model uncertainty issues. As an attempt to demonstrate the reliability of such multi-model efforts in the hydro-biogeochemical context, this methodological contribution proposes an adaptation of the reliability ensemble averaging (REA) philosophy to nitrogen losses predictions. A total of 4 models are used to predict the total nitrogen (TN) losses from the well-monitored Ellen Brook catchment in Western Australia. Simulations include re-predictions of current conditions and a set of straightforward management changes targeting fertilisation scenarios. Results show that, in spite of good calibration metrics, one of the models provides a very different response to management changes. This behaviour leads the simple average of the ensemble members to also predict reductions in TN export that are not in agreement with the other models. However, considering the convergence of model predictions in the more sophisticated REA approach assigns more weight to previously less well-calibrated models that are more in agreement with each other. This method also avoids having to disqualify any of the ensemble members.

Tokyo Bay was originally a productive area and rich in biodiversity. A large number of people, industries and government offices were concentrated in Tokyo. Ministry of the Environment control water quality, but, red tide and hypoxia were observed recently. The objectives of this study were to investigate ecosystem dynamics with special attention to high trophic levels (up to fish) and to evaluate the impacts of red tide and hypoxia on the ecosystem in Tokyo Bay. Modelling for ecosystem dynamics in Tokyo Bay was attempted using the Ecopath with Ecosim. A total of 10 groups were picked up taking account of availability of biomass data by species and survival tolerance to hypoxia. Group contains 3 fish groups, 3 benthos groups, zooplankton, phytoplankton, algae and detritus. Following the method described allowed the model to capture most past trend, all group biomass reaches its peak in 1980' s after that biomass decrease gradually. Model results suggest that hypoxia and red tide has impacts on not only benthos but also animals eating benthos.

As a result, red tides (harmful algal blooms) have become less frequent and smaller compared with the 1960s, and fisheries such as the yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiara) culture fishery have benefited from the reduced risk of red tide damage. The implementation of quality control standards for river water and conversion of paddy fields to urban areas have also reduced the amount of nutrients in the sea derived from surrounding lands and inflowing rivers. These policies, along with a decline in the areas of seagrass beds and tidal flats, have caused oligotrophication of the sea. Recently, the "Nori" (Porphyra spp.) culture fishery has claimed that the oligotrophic seawater constrains Porphyra growth, and that the amount of nutrients entering the sea should be allowed to increase. We propose a new conceptual model for evaluating water quality control levels that uses a risk management method to determine the optimal nutrient load to maximize total fishery production. Because the available data indicate that the relationship between the nutrient load in seawater and fishery production is probabilistic, the damage to fisheries caused by both eutrophication and oligotrophication must be captured as risk. We quantified the cost of the risk as the price of an insurance bond to compensate for fishery damage caused by red tides or reduced growth. The difference between the expected maximum production of a fishery and this cost is an indicator of the impact of policy on the fishery. This indicator will be low both when the nutrient load is too high and when it is too low. Thus, there exists an optimal nutrient load at which the value of the indicator will be maximized. This study evaluated the COD load that maximizes the sum of the expected incomes of these fisheries is 75 ton/day, and the TN load that maximizes the sum is 65 ton/day. Both these amounts are much higher than the current loads. We applied our model to the evaluation of water quality control levels in Sea of Harima-nada, in the eastern Seto Inland Sea, by carrying out statistical analyses of time series data of yellowtail and Porphyra fishery production, and of chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus loads from the surrounding land. Our results suggest that the Porphyra culture fishery would benefit from a change in the environmental pollution control policy.

To meet recreational demands for the Canal, a new water quality improvement plant was constructed by Hyogo Prefecture of Japan in March 2012, on the basis of the findings of the Amagasaki Sea Blue Project of Hyogo Prefecture. The new water quality improvement plant comprises a tank for removing suspended solids and an algae channel with algae harvesting for composting by civic collaboration. The suspended solids removing tank reduces organic suspended solids in the pumped surface seawater and converts organic suspended solids to dissolved nutrients using bivalve biology. Algae channels serve to assimilate the dissolved nutrients in the canal's treated water from either the suspended solids removing tank or the water pumped up from the bottom of the sea, using the primary productivity of green algae and blue green algae that grows naturally in the channel. In this study, we evaluated a part of the purification effect of the system by on site observation. The purification rate of the suspended solids removing tank was estimated more than 40%. In the algae channel, reduction ratio of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and the dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) was estimated by measuring the distribution of dissolved nutrient in the channel. The values after reduction by advanced sewage treatment were varied in every season, especially about more than 65% of the amount of DIN were removed from the channel in summertime.

Predicting Eurasian watermilfoil's (Myriophyllum spicatum) distribution and its likely response to biological control in a spring-fed river	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT			English	Article						river plants; invasion; biological control; predictive aquatic plant management	EUHRYCHIOPSIS-LECONTEI; PLANT COMMUNITY; MILFOIL WEEVIL; MANAGEMENT; VEGETATION; MACROPHYTES; PHOSPHORUS; HABITAT; BIOMASS; GROWTH	Controlling invasive aquatic plants would benefit from development of predictive theories that can be used to set priorities for when, where, and how to manage these species. The invasion of Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicalum L.) into a northern California river provides an opportunity to apply predictive relationships for it and its management. To test a hypothesis (from the scientific literature) regarding habitat. susceptibility to Eurasian watermilfoil invasion and evaluate prospects for its management, we collected water quality, temperature, and plant data from Fall River. During 2009 and 2010 we determined Eurasian watermilfoil abundance and distribution at 71 locations within the river from an upstream to downstream direction. We also determined water temperature and total phosphorus (P) concentration. Eurasian watermilfoil frequency increased in the river downstream from the confluence of Spring Creek. Based on measured total P concentrations and simulations from a physiologically based growth model, Eurasian watermilfoil should be able to grow upstream of this point. as well, High water levels which prevent boats from passing under the bridge located at this point may limit the upstream spread of Eurasian watermilfoil. One proposal is to introduce the Eurasian watermilfoil weevil (Euhryciopsis lecontei Dietz) as a biological control agent. In other habitats the weevil has been most successful when 3 or more generations of weevils are produced each year. Degree-day calculations using Fall River water temperatures and 2 scenarios for weevil growth and development indicate that the weevil only achieves 3 or more generations per growing season at points downstream of the confluence of the Title River. This represents the downstream one-third of the river. This information, in conjunction with simulations from a published model on the weevil/milfoil interaction, suggest that it is not likely that the milfoil weevil will reduce Eurasian watermilfoil biomass in Fall River.

Modeling Effects of Sediment Diagenesis on Recovery of Hypolimnetic Oxygen	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article						Diagenesis; Dissolved oxygen; Onondaga Lake; Modeling; Sediment	ORGANIC-MATTER DECOMPOSITION; ONONDAGA LAKE; CENTRAL BASIN; URBAN LAKE; NEW-YORK; WATER; PHOSPHORUS; DEPOSITION; PATTERNS; CARBON	Diagenesis of particulate organic matter in sediments can have important effects on the dissolved oxygen (DO) resources of lakes and delay potential benefits from reductions in phosphorus (P) loading. A sediment diagenesis model of intermediate complexity, Sed2K(s), is developed and tested for Onondaga Lake, New York, and linked to a validated one-dimensional mechanistic hydrodynamic/stratification model (UFILS4). Modeling was supported by detailed characterization of the pelagic sediments and long-term monitoring of the lake's water column that included transformation from hypereutrophy to upper mesotrophy and coupled improvements in hypolimnetic DO. Sed2K(s) performed well in representing the observed decreasing trajectory of the downward flux of particulate organic carbon and in predicting the decreases in sediment effluxes of dissolved inorganic carbon and sediment oxygen demand over a 30-year period. Sed2K(s) and the linked overall water-quality model, UFILS4/Sed2K(s), were applied to project the extent and timing of improvements in sediment fluxes and hypolimnetic DO resources for an array of P management alternatives. Substantial delays in response associated with the effects of diagenesis were predicted that extended >= 40 years to reach 95% of steady state. Long-term projections indicate that improvements from the most aggressive P control alternatives may be sufficient to maintain certain coldwater fish. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000594.

Modeling a Proposed Quarry Reservoir for Raw Water Storage in Atlanta, Georgia	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article						Bellwood Quarry Reservoir; CE-QUAL-W2; Water quality model	CRATER LAKE; TEMPERATURE PROFILES; OXYGEN DEPLETION; OREGON; PHOSPHORUS; BEHAVIOR; RENEWAL; BAIKAL	The City of Atlanta plans to convert a recently acquired urban quarry into Bellwood Quarry Reservoir (BQR), an off-stream supplemental water supply. CE-QUAL-W2, Version 3.5, was used to perform five-year water quality simulations of the reservoir. Nine inflow/outflow design and operation scenarios were evaluated for thermal stratification, dissolved oxygen (DO), algae, and iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn). For a perpetual storage scenario with no inflow and outflow and an operating scenario with monthly pump exercising flows, the model predicts ample reservoir DO to maintain an oxidizing environment in the hypolimnion and low dissolved Fe and Mn. A single portal near the bottom of the reservoir is recommended for alternating pump exercise inflows and outflows. Continuous flow-through operating scenarios do not improve predicted water quality. However, if selected, a mid-depth inflow and bottom outflow design configuration is recommended. A natural monomictic cycle is essential to maintain hypolimnetic DO.

In order to identify the relationships between environmental variables and the chironomid assemblages ordination methods were used. A total of 41 chironomid taxa were found across the 46 samples, 21 of which had a minimum abundance >1% and were present in more than one site. The samples were dominated by 12 taxa, which together accounted for 97% of the fauna. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that the predominant drivers of chironomid distribution within Lugu lake were bottom water temperature, water depth, loss-on-ignition (LOI) and water total phosphorus (TP) concentration. Abrupt changes in chironomid assemblages occurred at 10 m of water depth, which is closely related to the macrophyte distribution and the position of the thermocline. The chironomid assemblages became uniform below a water depth of ca. 15 m, and the anthropogenic impact on the chironomid fauna was then limited to the edge of Lugu lake. The depth-related faunal shifts primarily reflect the dominant controls of temperature and macrophyte distribution on the chironomids in Lugu lake. This is the first within-lake subfossil chironomid study from this region and the understanding of key environmental influences on contemporary faunas within the lake will aid interpretations of palaeolimnological datasets to reconstruct past trends and magnitude of environmental change over a range of timescales.

Uncertainties in estimated phosphorus loads as a function of different sampling frequencies and common calculation methods	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Diffuse pollution; phosphorus loads; regulatory monitoring; storm events	WATER-QUALITY; SEDIMENT; RIVERS; EUTROPHICATION; DISCHARGE; TRANSFERS; BASINS; IMPACT; LOIS	Water quality monitoring programs are often based upon low-frequency regular sampling regimes from which loads are estimated. In this study, stream flow (Q) and phosphorus concentrations (C) were measured at 2-hourly intervals over a 10-week period between October and December 2006 in a tributary of Loch Leven, Scotland. The dataset was deconstructed to emulate different weekly, daily and composite sampling strategies, the aim being to highlight the large amount of uncertainty and imprecision in estimating total (TP) and soluble reactive (SRP) phosphorus loads on the basis of commonly applied sampling strategies and calculation methods. When based on the full dataset, phosphorus (P) loads estimated from the 2-hourly data were 459 kg TP, 351 kg particulate P (PP) and 78 kg SRP. In contrast, P loads estimated from different weekly, daily and composite sampling regimes and determined by applying seven different calculation methods ranged from 22 to 5028 kg TP, 13 to 4588 kg PP and 7 to 286 kg SRP. The results of this study highlight the large amount of uncertainty and imprecision associated with estimating P loads and contributes to the body of evidence that high-frequency monitoring is necessary if P loads to standing water bodies are to be quantified accurately and the effects of nutrient management programs interpreted correctly.

J	Cheng, CM; Wei, YC; Xu, JJ; Yuan, ZJ				Cheng, Chunmei; Wei, Yuchun; Xu, Jianjun; Yuan, Zhaojie			Remote sensing estimation of Chlorophyll a and suspended sediment concentration in turbid water based on spectral separation	OPTIK			English	Article						Chlorophyll a; Suspended sediment; Spectral separation; Gaussian parameters; Taihu lake	RETRIEVAL; SIGNATURE	Chlorophyll a and suspended sediment are important indicators of water quality, and remote sensing estimation of them is difficult due to the optical complexity of turbid water. The spectrum above water surface is influenced by phytoplankton, suspended sediment and colored dissolved organic material in water, thus spectral separation is important before estimating one specific component. Based on the field experiment of pond water and Taihu lake, China, this study calculated the Gaussian parameters of Chlorophyll a (Chla) and suspended sediment (SS) through spectral decomposition, and then these parameters were used to separate the mixed spectrum of water samples from pond water and Taihu lake. After spectral separation, the Chla estimation model based on the peak height at 650 nm has high accuracy (R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 4.80 mg/m3), better than the band-ratio model; the SS estimation model based on the peak height at 811 nm (R2 = 0.82, RMSE = 6.80 mg/L) performs better than the single-band model. Results in this study indicate that spectral separation based on Gaussian parameters is a good method for Chla and SS estimation in turbid lake water. 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

A 2007 USEPA science reassessment concluded that nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loads discharged from the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin (MARB) are the primary cause of the Northern Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone. The primary MARB source regions of nutrients exported to the Gulf of Mexico have been documented to be the 492,000 km2 Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) and the 525,770 km2 Ohio Tennessee River Basin (OTRB). Agricultural nonpoint source pollution is the main source of N and P discharged to the UMRB and ORTB stream systems, primarily via fertilizer and/or livestock manure applied to cropland or pasture, although urban areas and point sources are also important nutrient sources. To address these issues, we are constructing an integrated modelling system that will: (1) estimate nutrient loads from the UMRB and ORTB regions for different scenarios, (2) route the estimated nutrient loads for each scenario to the Gulf of Mexico, and (3) estimate the resultant size of the seasonal hypoxic zone using a hypoxic zone regression model. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) water quality model is being used to simulate the land management schemes in the URMB and ORTB and resultant nutrient loads to the Gulf of Mexico. This SWAT application incorporates a greatly refined subwatershed structure relative to previous SWAT applications for the study regions. The placement of alternative cropping systems and/or management practices on specific landscapes within SWAT for the two regions will be performed primarily via an interface with an evolutionary algorithm (EA) and corresponding cost data for each management system. The hypoxic zone size is estimated as a function of nutrient fluxes discharged from the Mississippi River and other relevant data. An overview of the entire system is presented here, including descriptions of each major component and core land use, soil, climate, topographic and other data inputs required for both SWAT models. Initial calibration and validation results for the study region will be described in the companion Part 2 study.

The excessive concentrations of P present in water bodies originate in agricultural and wastewater effluents, storm water runoff, etc. The disruption of the terrestrial P cycle by anthropogenic activities along with a growing awareness that P is a limited resource call for effective methods to remove and retain P before it reaches natural waters. This study investigates the removal of orthophosphate species (PO43--P) by adsorption onto aragonite as a natural adsorbent under a wide range of environmental conditions. Aragonite is a renewable and economical material; it can be used jointly with any best-management practices or as a post-secondary treatment in a wastewater treatment plant to enhance the phosphorus removal and consequently mitigate eutrophication in surface waters. Moreover, the aragonite-adsorbed P product can be used directly as a fertilizer for soils or as a feed material for fertilizer production. Batch experiments were used in this study to examine the adsorption behavior of PO43--P on aragonite as a function of solid-to-liquid ratio, PO43--P concentrations, and pH. The results showed that solution pH greatly affects the PO43--P removal mechanism. The effect of pH on phosphate removal can be attributed to the nature of P species in solution as well as to hydrolysis reactions on the aragonite surface. Zeta-potential measurements suggested that the uptake is driven by specific adsorption of PO43--P onto the aragonite surface. Isotherm studies showed a maximum PO43--P removal of the order of 60 mg/g for a solid-to-liquid ratio of 1 g/I. The data are best described by the Langmuir model, which indicates that adsorption of PO43--P on aragonite occurs most likely via a monolayer mechanism. A column test permeating an aqueous phosphate solution of 10 g/I through an aragonite-packed bed was studied. The results showed that phosphate breakthrough occurred after approximately 20 pore volumes. This study showed that aragonite efficiently removes phosphate from aqueous solutions. The electrokinetic results suggest that orthophosphate species are chemically adsorbed onto aragonite over the pH range examined in this study.

Phosphate in high concentrations is the leading contributor to the degradation of estuaries, lakes and reservoirs, and consequently to the creation of hypoxic zones, where fish and aquatic life cannot survive. A quaternized cellulose nanofiber mesh was prepared using a choline-based ionic liquid to serve as an anion exchange resin for the removal of phosphate from aqueous solutions. A 17% cellulose acetate (CA) solution in a mixture of acetic acid and water (75/25% v/v) was electrospun into nonwoven fiber mesh. The latter was heat-treated at 195 degrees C for 1 hour and then alkali-treated to obtain regenerated cellulose (RC) mesh. The RC mesh was then quaternized in a mixture of a choline chloride derivative and urea in the presence of imidazole. The structure and morphology of the functionalized mesh were characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and polarization microscopy. Batch tests were performed to evaluate the adsorption capacity of the mesh for the removal of phosphorus as phosphate (PO43- -P).The preliminary results showed a maximum uptake for PO43- -P in the order of 55 mg/g mesh. The Langmuir isotherm adsorption model fit the adsorption data best, suggesting a monolayer adsorption mechanism. The developed anion exchange resin can potentially be useful for other water purification purposes mainly the removal of other anions of environmental concern.

Thus, this region mostly located in the Midwestern USA, provides a natural location for research on how intensive agriculture for food, feed and biofuel production can coexist with a healthy environment. The use of a process-based hydrologic and water quality model is considered indispensable to address this objective at such a large spatial scale. An integrated modeling system has been constructed with the hydrologic Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model (see Part 1 paper describing overall modeling system), capable of estimating river basin responses to alternative cropping and/or management strategies. To facilitate the identification of optimum locations for a cost-effective river basin management, this SWAT large-scale application incorporates a greatly refined subwatershed structure based on the 12-digit hydrologic units (subwatersheds), while the land phase of the hydrologic and nutrient cycles are calculated at thousands of Hydrologic Response Units, which represent unique combinations of land, soil and topographical features. However, given the very large scale and the need to ensure the reliability of flow and pollutant load predictions at various locations within such hydrologic systems, a model's calibration becomes a time-demanding and challenging task. The purpose of the current article is to demonstrate a semi-automatic calibration approach for large-scale and spatially detailed modeling studies, with the use of the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting algorithm (SUFI-2) and the SWAT-CUP interface developed exclusively for SWAT hydrologic projects. The calibration framework provides estimates of the uncertainty of predictions at various locations and can be finalized within a reasonable timeframe with a powerful personal computer (PC). This study presents the whole calibration approach providing guidance on similar efforts at the regional scale.

Watersheds in the area, especially in the island area of the Aegean Sea, are typically small and drained by temporary rivers and streams. Temporary waters are unique and sensitive ecosystems as well as important components of the local hydrologic systems. In many Mediterranean coastal areas, they are responsible for the total amount of inflow water to the sea and directly associated with most coastal water nutrient balance and quality problems. As a consequence of the climatic changes and the increasing anthropogenic pressures, temporary rivers are expected to encounter longer dry periods and a higher variability that may have a significant effect on those sensitive systems. With regard to the requirements of the European Water Framework Directive, there is a need to better define the quality characteristics of temporary waters and to evaluate the essential features of those river systems in terms of their seasonal variability in nutrient transport. This will contribute to a better understanding, prediction and management of the complex processes of interaction between temporary flowing waters and receiving water bodies in the future. The present research uses both field measurements and laboratory analyses for the assessment of water quality regarding the nutrient transport in a small eastern Mediterranean watershed. The field work supplied the rate of flow, in situ parameter measurements and water sampling from nine sampling locations representative of the hydrographic network. Physical parameters such as pH, temperature, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen were measured directly in the field during sampling. Chemical analysis of the collected samples was performed using spectrophotometry methods to estimate the nutrient load. The temporal distribution of NO2- -N, NO3- -N, NH3 -N and PO4- -P concentration was found to be closely related to the seasonal flow variations. Low values of nutrient concentrations were observed during dry periods, while they reached their maximum annual values during rainy periods. NO3- was found to be the dominant form of DIN (Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen) in the study area, with few occasional exceptions. The contribution of individual sub-watersheds in water and nutrient loads to the main river was found to be in coherence with the size of the drainage area, the slope and the existence of water springs. Nutrient load in individual sub-watersheds also varied along their route according to a diversity of factors, mainly of anthropogenic origin. The olive cropping methods, light urban wastes, farm wastes and the few olive mills in the area were found to have a significant effect in nutrient spatial and temporal distribution within the watershed. The study results may be indicative of the expected nutrient dynamics and outflow from a small agricultural Mediterranean watershed.

The model predictions were compared against CSTT thresholds for assessing eutrophication in estuaries and coastal waters. The estuary was found to be potentially eutrophic under no barrage conditions as well as under the ebb-only and the flood-ebb operating modes. Potential maximum primary production was found to be significantly higher under the ebb-only and the flood-ebb operating modes compared to the no barrage condition. This is believed to be a direct consequence of increased water residence time and greater light availability behind the barrage. However, the conditions for phytoplankton growth are likely to be more favorable under ebb-only operating mode as the potential maximum primary production was found to be significantly greater under ebb-only operating mode with largely decreased turbidity compared to flood-ebb operating mode with only a small reduction in turbidity.

The concentration of blue-green algae, green algae and freshwater diatom are simulated by the model. The Morris screening method is used to analyze the local sensitivity for blue-green algae. Model parameters in six categories are included: growth rate at 0 degrees C, mortality rate at 0 degrees C, maintenance respiration rate at 0 degrees C, temperature coefficient for growth, temperature coefficient for mortality and temperature coefficient for maintenance respiration. The biomass of blue-green algae is most sensitive to the parameters related to the growth rate and mortality rate. The interactions between blue-green algae and green algae are stronger than that with freshwater diatom. The sensitivity of Energy-type parameters is higher than those of Nitrogen-type and Phosphorus-type parameters for each of the species. Through this research, the key parameters that influence the model result most are identified, and it provides a basis for the use of this model in main Taihu Lake.

Within agricultural watershed scale, different crop coverage has different nutrient precipitation runoff non-point source load properties because of their spatial topography heterogeneity and variable fertilization demands. The objective of this study was to assess the reduction efficiency of an ACM on nitrogen non-point source load from small agricultural watershed, in the black soil region, northeast of china, where present typical gentle hilly landscapes, using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Results showed that SWAT model performed well in calculating runoff (E-NS=0.58), NO3-N (E-NS=0.47) and total N (E-NS=0.69) loads. The calibrated and validated model was used to evaluate the effects of spatial adjustment of crops plantation on NO3-N and total N loads through land use pattern scenario analysis according to crop different fertilization demand and surface runoff nitrogen loss characteristics. Result showed that crops plantation spatial adjustment as an effective ACM strategy can reduce NO3-N and total N loads by 9.5% and 10.7%, respectively. It was apparent that within small watershed scale, crops plantation spatial regulation according to their fertilizer demand, nutrition loads properties and locations as an ACM can effectively decrease non-point source pollution from agricultural watershed, and can provide useful information for targeted water quality management for surface runoff receptor water body.

Since the leachate is deoxidized through infiltration and travelling underground, the first step of water treatment is to oxidize or nitrify the leachate. Although various nitrification techniques have been developed so far, such concentrated treatment systems are feasible only in a case of young landfill with an extremely high level of ammonia load. The landfill in this study is, however, already older than forty years and ammonia-nitrogen load has decreased to a level around several ten mg per liter. In this case, a labor-saving and economic nitrification system is required for making a sustainable water quality management. In a leachate reservoir under investigation, a micro-bubble aeration system was equipped and its nitrification performance was examined by conducting an in-situ experiment in an enclosure. Monitoring time-dependent behaviors of NH4+-N, NO2--N, NO3--N and DO, it was discussed how the nitrification rate was influenced by relating limiting factors. It was also confirmed that denitrification took place in addition to nitrification in the experimental system. It is shown that the micro-bubble aeration is a promising technology as an alternative of the present water treatment system.

We develop a three-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model to study the spatial and temporal variation of hydrodynamics and algal bloom dynamics in a eutrophic tributary embayment, Xiangxi Bay. The study area exhibits distinct longitudinal gradients in hydrodynamics, and could be generally characterized into four longitudinal zones: riverine, intermediate, lacustrine, and mainstream influenced. Compared with the typical longitudinal zonation for a pure reservoir, there is an additional mainstream influenced zone (about 5-10 km long) near the mouth due to the strong effects of the adjacent reservoir mainstream. The transport and transformation of key water quality constituents associated with algal blooms, such as chlorophyll, nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon, are simulated satisfactorily. We further investigate the algal bloom dynamics by combining the model results and in situ water quality observations. There is a strong spatial dependence of algal bloom events (occurrence and distribution) in Xiangxi Bay: (i) during 2003-2012, some 73.9% of algal bloom events were first observed in a 10 km long reach within the intermediate and lacustrine zones, and (ii) the spatial pattern of chlorophyll concentrations is closely related to the longitudinal variance of hydrodynamics. A conclusion from this paper is that the relatively calm environment of the intermediate and lacustrine zones provides favourable conditions for algal growth, suggesting the possibility of using longitudinal zonation for risk assessment of algal bloom initiation and levels in reservoir tributary embayments.

The impact of human activity on surface stream habitats has been extensively studied throughout the world, forming the basis for many stream restoration efforts mostly based on one-dimensional (1D) models that assume steady state and uniform cross-sectional parameters. That simplification is not always adequate to represent a real river or stream. The Ebro River (NE Spain) presents flooding episodes when snow melts in the Pyrenees. To avoid flooding in living areas, some storage areas outside the city are prepared to be flooded. A simplified example inspired in the mentioned river is presented. A benchmark river reach provided with three lateral floodplain areas connected through three regulated gates that allow water to flow in both senses is assumed. A concentration inlet function is introduced under different flooding scenarios. The objective of the solute regulation could be the reduction of the river pollutant at the outlet section, the maximization of the solutes in the inundation floodplain areas or the mitigation of sudden changes in the water temperature. Unsteady events over complex geometry including flooding areas require a 2D hydraulic model. The implementation of a predictive water quality model in a finite volume unsteady 2D shallow flow simulation model is proposed in this work. The coupled system of equations includes the 2D hydraulic model as well as the nitrate and ammonium transport equations. When solved, it provides information about the variables in time and space	[Morales-Hernandez, Mario; Murillo, Javier; Garcia-Navarro, Pilar] Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza 50018, Spain; [Gonzalez-Sanchis, Maria] Univ Politecn Valencia, E-46022 Valencia, Spain	Morales-Hernandez, M (corresponding author), Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza 50018, Spain.	mmorales@unizar.es; magonsa2@upvnet.upv.es; javier.murillo@unizar.es; pigar@unizar.es	Murillo, Javier/K-4339-2015	Murillo, Javier/0000-0002-1386-5543			AUMEN NG, 1990, J N AM BENTHOL SOC, V9, P95; Bernot MJ, 2006, FRESHWATER BIOL, V51, P499, DOI 10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01508.x; Hoellein TJ, 2007, LIMNOL OCEANOGR, V52, P1964, DOI 10.4319/lo.2007.52.5.1964; Johnson LB, 1997, FRESHWATER BIOL, V37, P193, DOI 10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.d01-539.x; KLOTZ RL, 1985, LIMNOL OCEANOGR, V30, P543, DOI 10.4319/lo.1985.30.3.0543; MEYER JL, 1979, LIMNOL OCEANOGR, V24, P365; Morales-Hernandez M., 2013, WATER RESOUR RES, V49, DOI [10.1002/wrcr.20062, DOI 10.1002/WRER.20062]; Murillo J, 2005, INT J NUMER METH FL, V49, P267, DOI 10.1002/fld.992; Murillo J, 2011, J COMPUT PHYS, V230, P7202, DOI 10.1016/j.jcp.2011.05.022; Murillo J, 2010, J COMPUT PHYS, V229, P4327, DOI 10.1016/j.jcp.2010.02.016; Parker J.

In order to ease these problems, the WASP7.3 (water quality analysis simulation program) model recommended by United States Environmental Protection Agency was applied in Shiyan Reservoir in this paper. After the application of geographic information system (GIS), the performance of the model is enhanced. According to the observation data of water quality in the Shiyan Reservoir, dissolved oxygen, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen and other important water quality indices were considered in the process of water quality simulation. After model parameter calibration was carried out, the WASP model was proved to be feasible and reliable by comparing the simulation result with the observation data. According to the integral analysis of WASP model structure, sensitivity analysis of single parameter was carried out. The result of sensitive analysis shows that the high sensitive parameter in dissolved oxygen is the flow rate, temperature and reduction rate at 20 degrees C. At last, according to the hydrological characteristics of Shiyan Reservoir, dissolved oxygen was selected to be the main factor. GIS technology was used to analyze the temporal and spatial variation of the dissolved oxygen concentration. Based on the above results, the causes of the pollution in Shiyan Reservoir as well as suggestions to the water quality management are provided in this paper.

This area was subjected to extensive pumping activities for different purposes such as supplying drinking water, agricultural activities, and industrial and commercial applications. Furthermore, the area was subjected to artificial recharge using treated wastewater in the last 10 years. Some water management strategies have been implemented to control the groundwater quantity and quality by the relevant authorities. Hence, this study tries to evaluate the groundwater quality by analyzing the collected data of groundwater levels, nitrogen nitrate, and salinity for the past 30 years. The obtained results showed that the groundwater in Salalah coastal area was suffering from declining water levels and increasing levels of nitrate and salinity due to the extensive pumping activities and contamination from sewer water leakages to the groundwater until 2002. However, the quality and level of groundwater started to improve since 2002 due to the artificial recharge of the groundwater with treated effluents. The results indicated gradual increase in the groundwater level in the aquifer system, especially at the down gradient side of approximately 1.0 to 2.0 km distant from the Arabian Sea shore along injection strip (where the saline water intrusion possibilities are more). Also, EC (Salinity) of the groundwater decreased in the injection area. The total dissolved solids (TDS) in and around the injection strip was found less than 2000 mg/L, whereas the outside of the injection strip the groundwater TDS value was found higher than 2000 mg/L. The results of Nitrogen Nitrate concentration values were found to be within Omani drinking water quality standard (except for one well). However, the results show higher values in the un-sewered zone (served by septic tanks and soak away pits) compared with the values noted in the areas downstream of the recharge line. The Nitrogen Nitrate concentrations on downstream of the treated water injection line ranged between 5 to 15 mg/L. The range was found from 10 to 20 mg/L in the un-sewered area upstream of the injection line and from 20 to 35 mg/L in the un-sewer area east of the injection line. Due to the importance of groundwater in Salalah plain from social, environmental and economic point of view, sustainable management and monitoring plans have to be developed to protect such valuable natural resource and to optimize its applications. It is believed that the artificial recharging project with treated effluents should continue but with better optimization and coordination with other water related authorities.

First, a simplified water quality model based on NN was developed and applied to predict chlorophyll a concentrations in Feitsui Reservoir. The performance and validity of the proposed NN model was evaluated using a sophisticated eutrophication model (WASP/EUTRO). Further, a GA with water quality prediction produced by the NN model was used to optimize the control of watershed nutrient loads. The GA was applied to address the problem in reservoir water quality management and to provide an alternative when searching for an optimal control strategy. Finally, the time-variable control schemes derived from the NN-GA method were applied to the WASP/EUTRO model to assess the impact on eutrophication in Feitsui Reservoir following phosphorus load reductions in its watershed. In practice, the time-varying reductions in phosphorus loads for controlling reservoir eutrophication can be achieved by way of the combined reduction of point and nonpoint source pollution loads.

Complex mechanistic models are used to quantify generation and movement of pollutants both in baseflow and surface runoff processes. However, these models require extensive data inputs, high computational power and expertise. Alternatively, specific flow regimes (i.e. baseflow conditions and runoff events) can be used to provide an insight into pollutant sources and to study their relationships with landuses, where limited time (for complex analysis) and limited data are available. This paper presents a simple procedure on how to use specific flow regimes to correlate pollutant load with landuse activities. The procedure uses a simple baseflow separation technique and a data-based model LOADEST with other readily available data and tools. Two simple baseflow separation software Base Flow Index (BFI) and Baseflow Filter Program (BFP) were evaluated comparing them with a complex model SWAT to investigate the efficiency of a simple baseflow separation technique. The baseflow separation technique was then used to define each day of the study period with respect to a specific flow regime using the following conditions; (i) baseflow conditions were defined as those days when baseflow contributes >= 70% of daily streamflow, and (ii) runoff events were defined as those days when baseflow contributes <70% of daily streamflow. Accordingly water quality grab sample data (or estimated load) on a baseflow condition day was tagged as baseflow condition data (or load). Similarly water quality grab sample data (or estimated load) on a runoff event day was tagged as runoff event data (or load). The regression model LOADEST was used to estimate pollutant loads from water quality grab samples. The methodology was illustrated using 12 stations in the Yarra River catchment of Melbourne, Australia for the period of 1998-2009. Furthermore, two specific tasks were performed: (1) to establish whether there are any statistically significant differences between concentrations in water quality grab samples of Total nitrogen (TN), Total phosphorus (TP) and Total suspended solids (TSS) representing specific flow regimes, and (2) to identify the major sources of pollutant loads. The simple baseflow separation techniques compared well with the SWAT simulated baseflow. The coefficient of determination (R-2) between BFP generated and SWAT simulated baseflow were 0.73, 0.86 and 0.91 for daily, monthly and annual baseflow respectively. Similarly, R-2 between BFI generated and SWAT simulated baseflow were 0.57, 0.78 and 0.90 for daily, monthly and annual baseflow respectively. Based on this comparison, the BFP software was then used for the two specific tasks outlined earlier. The results showed that at the selected water quality stations, the pollutant concentrations were significantly (p <= 0.01) greater in runoff events than in baseflow conditions. Overall, the water quality and pollutant concentrations were influenced by flow regimes and landuses. Major pollutant loads were generated from agricultural and urban runoff i. e. non-point sources. This suggests that Yarra River catchment managers should focus on the management of potential non-point sources to improve river water quality.	[Das, S. K.; Ng, A. W. M.; Perera, B. J.

Image procedure including radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction converts digital numbers into surface reflectance. Then multiple regression and ANNs are applied to the visible and near-infrared bands of IKONOS in order to determine a relationship between the surface reflectance of the lake and the water quality parameters obtained by in situ measurements. Statistical analysis using determination coefficients and error estimation is employed, aiming to evaluate the most accurate methodology. The results show that the estimated accuracy of water quality parameters using ANNs is higher than the accuracy using multivariate regression approaches, and the measured and estimated values for water quality parameters are in good consistency (R-2 > 0.9). The spatial distribution maps of water quality parameters generated by ANNs model present apparent spatial variations and inform the decision makers of water quality variations in Lake Cihu.

After elaborating time dynamic characteristics of water environmental capacity, this paper puts forward a method to compute the dynamic water environmental capacity. Generally speaking, this method should use a suitable water quality model with corresponding parameters to compute water environmental capacity of various function zones in dynamic designed hydrological conditions. According to this method, a numerical water quality model was set up in the downstream of Xiquanyan reservoir of Ashi River, which is located in Harbin. This model, which is established by the hydrodynamic (HD) & advection-dispersion (AD) module of DHI MIKE11 software, aims at simulating the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH-N) concentration of the observed cross-section in different water function zones and various calculation conditions. Meanwhile, several sensitive parameters were optimized to make the model more reasonable. According to the simulation result, the dynamic water environmental capacity of different water function zones was subsequently calculated by use of the one-dimensional water environmental capacity model. The results show that the COD and NH-H water environmental capacity of various function zones are dynamic, and the water environmental capacity of the frozen period (from November to next March) is far less than the non-frozen period (from April to October). Furthermore, by comparing the water environmental capacity of twelve months on different conditions, both the maximum and minimum water environmental capacity control lines were drawn in several figures. Therefore, the total pollution load of various functional zones will be limited below the maximum or minimum water environmental capacity control line according to requirements, so that there will be more feasible and effective reference for managers.

In this paper, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) and the R-style hierarchical Cluster Analysis (CA) are applied in the middle and lower reaches of the Pudu River, a severely polluted river in Southwest China. Since the spatially different reaches showing different characteristics have to be discriminately treated, nine water quality monitoring sites are categorized into three spatial groups based on both the Trophic Level Index (TLI) of each site and the results from the Q-style hierarchical CA before the key parameter identification and the source apportionment. These three groups are as follows: Cluster 1 (C1) containing three upstream sites with the heaviest eutrophication status; Cluster 2 (C2) consisting of three downstream sites with less serious eutrophication status; and Cluster 3 (C3) constituted of three tributary sites with relatively the lightest eutrophication status. The data sets on water quality of 11 parameters in three seasons (dry season, level season and rainy season) were got from three field surveys during 2010 similar to 2011. According to the results got using the R-style hierarchical CA, 3 key parameters are identified for the sites in C1 while 6 for C2 and 7 for C3. Then PMF is used to identify four latent pollutant sources and estimate the contribution of the identified sources to the concentration of the key parameters. The results reveal that the sources are different among the spatial divisions: sources of C1 containing industrial effluents, municipal effluents, phosphorus factories and non-point agricultural run-off; sources of C2 comprised of pollution from upper reaches, non-point agricultural run-off, internal sources and domestic wastewater; sources of C3 made up of non-point agricultural run-off, internal sources, industrial effluents, municipal or domestic wastewater. Additionally, the main pollutant sources to the key parameters are different in C1, C2 and C3. Decision makers could pay the most attention to the main sources of the key parameters before making policy.

Comparison of Cell-in-series and Mesoscale Physical Habitat Sampling for the Interpretation of Spatiotemporal Variation of Stream Water Quality	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 35TH IAHR WORLD CONGRESS, VOLS I AND II			English	Proceedings Paper	35th World Congress of the International-Association-for-Hydro-Environment-Engineering-and-Research (IAHR)	SEP 08-13, 2013	Chengdu, PEOPLES R CHINA	Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res		Cell-in-series; Ecology; Mesoscale; Total variance; Water quality	RIVER	The commonly used sampling methods at equal segments, namely cell-in-series (CIS), andan approach based on functional classification of streams, namely mesoscale physical habitats (MPH), have been compared to evaluate the performance of sampling methods on spatiotemporal variation of stream water quality. Sampling was carried out in the Tseng LanShue stream (1-3 orders), during spring (dry) and summer (wet) in 2012. Each season observations were donefor two states: typical (no sever rainfalls); flushed (2-3 days after a severe rainfall). The response variables (chlorophyll-a, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, nitrate-nitrogen, nitrite-nitrogen, ammoniacal nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorous) were checked against a group of hydro-environmental variables. These included: stream velocity, width and depth (and the derivatives), slope, bankfull dimensions, and substrate conditions. Relationships among variables were evidenced using redundancy analysis. In general, the water quality parameters showed an irregular variation in the longitudinal direction of the stream. Water quality and hydro-environmental variables based on the best two axes explained 41% of the total variance in response data for MPH approach in spring. For CIS it was 44%. However, in the flushed state these were observed to be 60% and 35% for MPH and CIS, respectively. Similar trend was observed in summer where explanatory power based on CIS was high for the typical state, but otherwise for the flushed state. Furthermore, the significant environmental variable(s) for the respective cases changed with the approach: substrate conditions for CIS; and stream width and its derivatives for MPH. This elucidates explanation and modelling of water quality of a stream is distinctive with the sampling methodas well as weather scenarios. Results elucidated MPH approach is more suitable than CIS as a modelling tool when the stream has less anthropogenic loads. We conclude that the explanatory powers of MPH and CIS approaches could be useful in providing a quantitative definition on what is really meant by a "pristine stream".	[Gomes, Pattiyage I.

Such pollution is visible through water column including bed sediments and as a result, excessive amounts of nutrients (i.e. phosphorus and nitrogen) are loaded to the marine environment manifested by eutrophication phenomenon. Bottom sediments can adsorb significant amount of pollution from water column. However, the pollution flux could be leached from these sediments and increase the pollution level. The aim of this study is to understand the nutrient cycle within the different components in water column and surface bed sediments of the study area through method of numerical modeling along with experimental work. Such study would improve the understanding of numerical modeling tool and data generated will have such scientific value for making comprehensive Marine Environment Impact Assessments. Laboratory experiments and analysis for are carried out for freeze dry sediment samples collected from the northern part of Arabian Gulf. Phosphorus (P) and nitrogen forms (NO2, NO3, NH4) are analyzed using spectrophotometer according to method of Murphy and Riely (1962) and Total Organic Carbon (TOC) analysis according to Walkley-Black procedure. Also, three-dimensional analysis of hydrodynamic characteristics of the Arabian Gulf was carried out using Delft3D-Flow module. This study only present the preliminary results of the experimental work carried out and general hydrodynamics in the Arabian Gulf waters, yet it is needed for future study, a water quality model to be developed for a better concrete understanding of nutrient cycling in marine environment and their interaction with ecosystem components.

However, rivers in the Andes have been insufficiently studied. Condoriri River basin is an interesting case of study since tropical glaciers are very sensitive to climate change and this basin provides drinking water to La Paz and El Alto, the two major cities in Bolivia. The purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of the transport of nutrients and major ions composition over water quality during two different seasons. Field measurements were done in July 2012 (dry season), November 2012 (wet season) and February 2013 (wet season) for the determination of physicochemical parameters like pH and electrical conductivity. Water samples were taken for the analysis of nutrients, major ions compositions, and chlorophyll a. Macrophytes and periphyton were taken for the determination of biomass. Concentrations of nutrients and ions greatly varied through the whole basin. Nutrients are most represented by nitrogen in the forms of nitrate and ammonium, and silicate. According to the results, phosphorus was the limiting factor. The transport of nutrients and major ions were higher during the wet than the dry season in 2012. Transport of nitrate varied from 3.04 kg/day to 0.6 kg/day and silicate from 151.72 kg/day to 28.23 kg/day, from the upper reaches of the stream to the lowest area of the basin. Macrophytes, periphyton and phytoplankton biomass were affected by the availability of nutrients. Major ions were mainly represented by Ca2+ and SO42+, specifically at the glacier effluent. Weathering of rocks like gypsum was estimated as the principal source of solutes. The results of this research can enhance our understandings of the current condition of water quality in the river.

Using 20 years of water quality data, this paper examines how various pollutants are correlated in this river. Prediction equations are developed for Chlorophyll-a, total nitrogen and total phosphorous as a function of easily measurable water quality parameters. These equations show a reasonably high coefficient of determination and a smaller standard error of estimates. The standardized residuals do not show any noticeable trends. These equations thus satisfy the assumptions of the least squares regression very well. These equations can be used to predict Chlorophyll-a, total nitrogen and total phosphorous without going through the expensive and time consuming chemical analysis. Further investigation is being carried out to identify the sources of various pollutants in the Hawkesbury-Nepean River and the attenuation and transport processes of these pollutants. It is expected that the outcomes of this study would assist to understand the heath of the Hawkesbury-Nepean River better and thereby to set up appropriate strategies to preserve and enhance the water quality of this river.

The models used the comprehensive 8 years' monthly water quality data for training, and the most recent 3 years' monthly data for testing. Twenty four water quality variables including physical, chemical and biological parameters were involved. The nonlinear process with measurement noise was regressed by RVM that is based on Bayesian framework, and the near-optimal set points maximizing the objective function were sought by GA. The results showed that the RVM-GA based models are valuable in prediction and optimization of the complex nonlinear processes, and are feasible in understanding the algal bloom problem and predicting/forecasting the phytoplankton abundance.

Among the many pollutants found in the surface water, nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) are two very important parameters in water quality modelling. Their presence, especially in excess, is the main contributing factor to eutrophication. In this study, a model describing the wash-off process of agricultural inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus on the soil surface is presented. Laboratory and field experiments were carried out to investigate nutrients (in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus) leached from soil, and washed off in surface runoff. Chemical degradation due to exposure to the elements and infiltration was also considered. Four water quality indices, including NO3-, NH4+,TN and TP were investigated. The model was calibrated and verified based on the results obtained in the field experiments.

J	Wang, LP; Zheng, BH				Wang Liping; Zheng Binghui			Prediction of chlorophyll-a in the Daning River of Three Gorges Reservoir by principal component scores in multiple linear regression models	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						algal bloom prediction; eutrophication; hydrodynamics; Three Gorges Reservoir	XIANGXI BAY; PHYTOPLANKTON; NUTRIENTS; BLOOM	After the impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) since 2003, eutrophication has occurred and has become severe in Daning River. To predict chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) levels, the relationships between Chl-a and 11/13 routine monitoring data on water quality and hydrodynamics in Daning River were studied by principal component scores in the multiple linear regression model (principal component regression (PCR) model). In order to determine the hydrodynamic effect on simulated accuracy, two 0-day ahead prediction models were established: model A without hydrodynamic factors as variables, and model B with hydrodynamic factors (surface water velocity and water residence time) as variables. Based on the results of correlation analysis, score 1 and 2 with significant loads of phosphorus and nitrogen nutrients were omitted in developing model A (R-2 = 0.355); while score 2 with significant loads of nitrogen was omitted in developing model B (R-2 = 0.777). The results of validation using a new dataset showed that model B achieved a better fitted relationship between the predicted and observed values of Chl-a. It indicated hydrodynamics play an important role in limiting algal growth. The results suggested that a PCR model incorporating hydrodynamics processes has been suitable for the Chl-a concentration simulation and algal blooming prediction in Daning River of TGR.

Removal of phosphate from water using six Al-, Fe-, and Al-Fe-modified bentonite adsorbents	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Modified bentonite; phosphate adsorbents; adsorption; adsorption rate; adsorption capacity; nutrient removal; water quality; United Arab Emirates	AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; ADSORPTION; SORPTION; KAOLIN	This study was part of a larger effort that involves evaluating alternatives to upgrading secondary treatment systems in the United Arab Emirates for the removal of nutrients. In this study, six modified bentonite (BNT) phosphate adsorbents were prepared using solutions that contained hydroxy-polycations of aluminum (Al-BNT), iron (Fe-BNT), and mixtures of aluminum and iron (Al-Fe-BNT). The adsorption kinetics and capacities of the six adsorbents were evaluated, and the adsorbents were used to remove phosphorus from synthetic phosphate solutions and from treated wastewater. The experimental adsorption kinetics results were well represented by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, with R-2 values ranging from 0.99 to 1.00. Similarly, the experimental equilibrium adsorption results were well represented by the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms, with R-2 values ranging from 0.98 to 1.00. The adsorption capacities of the adsorbents were dependent on the BNT preparation conditions; the types, quantities and combination of metals used; BNT particle size; and adsorption pH. The Langmuir maximum adsorption capacities of the six adsorbents ranged from 8.9-14.5 mg P/g-BNT. The results suggested that the BNT preparations containing Fe alone or in combination with Al achieved higher adsorption capacities than the preparations containing only Al. However, the Al-BNT preparations exhibited higher adsorption rates than the Fe-BNT preparation. Three of the six adsorbents were used to remove phosphate from secondarily treated wastewater samples, and the removal results were comparable to those obtained using synthetic phosphate solutions. The BNT adsorbents also exhibited adequate settling characteristics and significant regeneration potential.

In Beijing, pollution prevention in urban storm runoff and storm water utilization has been identified as the primary strategy for urban water management. In this paper, we sampled runoff during storm rainfall events and analyzed the concentration of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP) in the runoff. Furthermore, the first flush effect of storm rainfall from diverse underlying surfaces was also analyzed. With the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), the different impervious rates of underlying surfaces during the storm runoff process were expressed. The removal rates of three typical pollutants and their interactions with precipitation and underlying surfaces were identified. From these rates, the scenarios regarding the urban storm runoff pollution loading from different designs of underlying pervious rates were assessed with the SWMM. First flush effect analysis showed that the first 20% of the storm runoff should be discarded, which can help in utilizing the storm water resource. The results of this study suggest that the SWMM can express in detail the storm water pollution patterns from diverse underlying surfaces in Beijing, which significantly affected water quality.

J	McMillan, H; Krueger, T; Freer, J				McMillan, Hilary; Krueger, Tobias; Freer, Jim			Benchmarking observational uncertainties for hydrology: rainfall, river discharge and water quality	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Review						observational uncertainty; data uncertainty; hydrology; error distributions; hydrometric data; water quality data	QUANTITATIVE PRECIPITATION ESTIMATION; SUSPENDED SEDIMENT LOADS; RATING CURVE APPROACH; POWER-LAW REGRESSION; ET-AL. 2009; RUNOFF MODELS; PARAMETER-ESTIMATION; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; INPUT UNCERTAINTY; BAYESIAN-ANALYSIS	This review and commentary sets out the need for authoritative and concise information on the expected error distributions and magnitudes in observational data. We discuss the necessary components of a benchmark of dominant data uncertainties and the recent developments in hydrology which increase the need for such guidance. We initiate the creation of a catalogue of accessible information on characteristics of data uncertainty for the key hydrological variables of rainfall, river discharge and water quality (suspended solids, phosphorus and nitrogen). This includes demonstration of how uncertainties can be quantified, summarizing current knowledge and the standard quantitative results available. In particular, synthesis of results from multiple studies allows conclusions to be drawn on factors which control the magnitude of data uncertainty and hence improves provision of prior guidance on those uncertainties. Rainfall uncertainties were found to be driven by spatial scale, whereas river discharge uncertainty was dominated by flow condition and gauging method. Water quality variables presented a more complex picture with many component errors. For all variables, it was easy to find examples where relative error magnitudes exceeded 40%. We consider how data uncertainties impact on the interpretation of catchment dynamics, model regionalization and model evaluation. In closing the review, we make recommendations for future research priorities in quantifying data uncertainty and highlight the need for an improved culture of engagement with observational uncertainties.

J	Wu, L; Long, TY; Liu, X; Guo, JS				Wu, Lei; Long, Tian-yu; Liu, Xia; Guo, Jin-song			Impacts of climate and land-use changes on the migration of non-point source nitrogen and phosphorus during rainfall-runoff in the Jialing River Watershed, China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Pollution load prediction; SLURP hydrological model; Climate change; Jialing River Watershed	SOURCE POLLUTION MODEL; SURFACE WATERS; EXPORT COEFFICIENT; CATCHMENT-SCALE; ASSESSMENT-TOOL; QUALITY; BASIN; SOIL; LOAD; SIMULATION	The loss of nitrogen and phosphorus via non-point source (NPS) pollution in the Jialing River Watershed has become the main pollution sources of river waters in the Three Gorges reservoir area in the past decades, while climatic conditions and human activities directly affect changes of rainfall-runoff and land use types which are closely related to NPS pollution. This study is to assess the impact of climate change on hydrological behavior considering future land-use types and rural residential area and their propagation to NPS pollution loads. An integrated pollution load model composed of regional climate, the Semi-distributed Land Use based Runoff Processes (SLURPs) hydrological model and the improved export coefficient approach within a single framework was explored and developed to assess impacts of climate and land-use changes on NPS pollution load. Climate data for the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRESs) future scenario B2 from Met Office Hadley center were generated and used as the input data for the runoff and NPS load evaluation of the Jialing River Watershed and the Markov process was used to forecast changes of land use types, respectively. Simulations of present and future regional NPS pollution from land use, livestock and poultry breeding, and agricultural population over the Jialing River Watershed were performed to investigate the potential impacts of global climate change on river water quality using the established model. Results demonstrate that: (1) Annual pollution load would obviously change due to variations of runoff and livestock and poultry breeding, the largest growth months in one year for total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) load are both in June, which is in accordance with changes of rainfall amount. (2) The impacts of global climate change on pollution load are relatively greater when compared to the impacts of future livestock and poultry breeding increase or agricultural population reduction; the effects from runoff increment leads to approximately 28.6% and 22.5% increases of TN and TP pollution load, respectively. And (3) the impacts of land-use change have shown insignificant effect due to soil conservation measures, whereas the impacts of rural residential area account for great proportion changes, of which about 5% of its increases are contributed to the increase of livestock and poultry breeding; but the biggest contribution rate is still from the output of different land use types. These data will be useful and valuable in evaluating potential NPS pollution load for the control of watershed pollution in the future and understanding its migration and transformation in a large-scale watershed where meteorological and underlying surface data are mutative.

Evaluation of analytical and numerical approaches for the estimation of groundwater travel time distribution	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Travel time distribution; Time lag; Groundwater nitrate	NONPOINT-SOURCE POLLUTION; LAND-USE CHANGE; GULF-OF-MEXICO; WALNUT-CREEK; WATER-QUALITY; BASE-FLOW; NITRATE; IOWA; NITROGEN; STREAM	It is critical that stakeholders are aware of the lag time necessary for conservation practices to demonstrate a positive impact on surface water quality. For solutes like nitrate that are transported primarily by the groundwater pathway, the lag time is a function of the groundwater travel time distribution (TTD). We used three models of varying levels of complexity to estimate the steady-state TTD of a shallow, unconfined aquifer in a small Iowa watershed: (a) analytic model, (b) GIS approach, and (c) MODFLOW model. The analytic model was the least input-intensive, whereas the GIS and MODFLOW approach required detailed data for model development. The resulting TTDs displayed an exponential distribution with good agreement among all the three methods (mean travel times ranging from 16.2 years in the analytic model, 19.6 years in GIS model and 20.5 years in MODFLOW model). The greater deviation in the analytic model was attributed to the difficulty in estimation of a representative saturated thickness in an unconfined aquifer. The correspondence between the spatial travel time distributions generated by GIS and MODFLOW was a function of the landscape position, with greater correspondence in uplands compared to floodplains. In the floodplains the land surface slope is a poor approximation of the water table gradient that is captured by the MODFLOW model but not the GIS that uses the land surface as a surrogate for the water table. Study results indicate that except for cases where there are marked differences between water table surface and land surface, simpler approaches (analytic and GIS) can be used to estimate TTDs required for the design and optimal placement of conservation practices and communicating lag times issues to the public.

Application to the Albufera of Valencia (Spain)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Eutrophication; Modelling; Coastal lagoon; Phytoplankton; Albufera of Valencia	SHALLOW MEDITERRANEAN LAKE; PHYSICAL-BIOLOGICAL MODEL; WATER-QUALITY; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; PLANKTON DYNAMICS; MIXED-LAYER; ARABIAN SEA; ECOSYSTEM; BAY; COMPLEXITY	A simplified two-dimensional eutrophication model was developed to simulate temporal and spatial variations of chlorophyll-a in heavily regulated coastal lagoons. This model considers the hydrodynamics of the whole study area, the regulated connexion of the lagoon with the sea, the variability of the input and output nutrient loads, the flux from the sediments to the water column, the phytoplankton growth and mortality kinetics, and the zooplankton grazing. The model was calibrated and validated by applying it to the Albufera of Valencia, a hypertrophic system whose connection to the sea is strongly regulated by a system of sluice-gates. The calibration and validation results presented a significant agreement between the model and the data obtained in several surveys. The accuracy was evaluated using a quantitative analysis, in which the average uncertainty of the model prediction was less than 6%. The results confirmed an expected phytoplankton bloom in April and October, achieving mean maximum values around 250 mu g l(-1) of chlorophyll-a. A mass balance revealed that the eutrophication process is magnified by the input loads of nutrients, mainly from the sediments, as well as by the limited connection of the lagoon with the sea. This study has shown that the developed model is an efficient tool to manage the eutrophication problem in heavily regulated coastal lagoons. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Global versus local change effects on a large European river	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Trend analysis; Temperature; Hydrology; Eutrophication; Water quality; Loire	FRESH-WATER ECOSYSTEMS; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; LONG-TERM CHANGES; LOIRE FRANCE; HYDROLOGICAL REGIMES; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; RHONE RIVER; TEMPERATURE; STREAM; PHOSPHORUS	Water temperature and discharge are fundamental to lotic ecosystem function, and both are strongly affected by climate. In large river catchments, however, climatic effects might be difficult to discern from background variability and other cumulative sources of anthropogenic change arising from local land and water management. Here, we use trend analysis and generalised linear modelling on the Loire, the longest river in France to test the hypotheses that i) long-term trends in discharge and river temperature have arisen from climate change and ii) climatic effects on water quality have not been overridden by local effects. Over 32 years (1977-2008), discharge in the Middle Loire fell by about 100 m(3)/s while water temperature increased by 1.2 degrees C with greatest effects during the warm period (May-August). Although increasing air temperature explained 80% of variations in water temperature, basin-wide precipitation showed no long-term trend and accounted for only 18% of inter-annual fluctuations in flow. We suggest that trends in abstraction coupled with a potential increase in evapo-transpiration at the catchment scale could be responsible for the majority of the long-term discharge trend. Discharge and water temperature explained only 20% of long-term variations in major water quality variables (conductivity, dissolved oxygen, pH, suspended matter, biochemical oxygen demand, nitrate, phosphate and chlorophyll-a), with phosphate and chlorophyll declining contrary to expectations from global change probably as a consequence of improved wastewater treatment. These data partially support our first hypothesis in revealing how warming in the Loire has been consistent with recent atmospheric warming. However, local management has had larger effects on discharge and water quality in ways that could respectively exacerbate (abstraction) or ameliorate (reduced point-source pollution) warming effects. As one of the first case-studies of its kind, this multi-parametric study illustrates the potential for complex interactions between climate change and other environmental factors in large rivers.

In the present study primary production (in terms of chlorophyll alpha - chl alpha) is modeled based on a number of abiotic parameters using model trees (MTs), a machine learning (ML) approach whereby linear regressions are induced within homogeneous subsets of samples (tree leaves). Standardized regression was applied to determine the relative weight of abiotic parameters in the MT tree leaves whereas the efficiency of the MT method in chl alpha prediction was tested against neural networks (NNs) which is the most frequently used ML approach, and the classical multiple linear regression (MLR). To assess the efficiency of models to describe eutrophication-related responses under different environmental conditions, the methods were applied on a coastal ecosystem affected by terrestrial runoff for two meteorologically contrasting annual cycles: a typical dry ('04-'05) and a typical wet ('09-'10). MTs showed increased predictive power in chl alpha prediction attributed to the discrimination of input data space into tree leaves, instead of using a uniform space as in NNs and MLR. By grouping samples of each tested annual cycle (wet and dry) on a seasonal basis into discrete groups/leaves, MTs offer a much more explanatory description of ecosystem status than NNs and MLR. The discriminating variables forming tree leaves and the weighing coefficients of Linear Models (LMs) in each leaf provided a useful scaling of abiotic parameters driving chl alpha dynamics. The MT method is thus proposed as an efficient tool for obtaining insights into ecosystem processes leading to eutrophication events in coastal ecosystems and a useful component in integrated coastal zone management.

The mean value of daily rate of primary productivity was 10.05 gC/m(2)/d and annual sum of primary productivity was estimated 3669.5 gC/m(2)/y. The yearly mean value of conductivity, pH, alkalinity, SRP and SRS were 486.66 mu S/cm, 7.21, 4.02 meq/l, 0.75 mg/l and 49.75 mg/l, respectively which indicated the intensity of contamination from the catchment. Significant correlations were obtained among the variables' (day length, irradiance, water temperature and DO) relating to primary productivity: "Green Soup" like algal bloom was found to occur on Most occasions. The productivity was confined to the upper few centimeter depth of the water indicating a typical eutrophic nature of the water body.

Accounting for the role of uncertainty in declining water quality in an extensively farmed grassland catchment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Water Framework Directive; Extensive farming; Phosphorus; Uncertainty; Incomplete knowledge; Predictability	DRAINAGE WATER; LAND-USE; PHOSPHORUS; FRAMEWORK; MANAGEMENT; IMPLEMENTATION; PARTICIPATION; FERTILIZER; LESSONS; LOSSES	Debate around the likelihood of achieving full compliance with Water Framework Directive objectives by 2027 has largely focused on the uncertainty in the lag-times between the implementation of mitigation measures and improvements in water quality. This paper examines uncertainties related to limited knowledge, predictability and ambiguity and their roles in declining water quality in Lough Melvin, a large lake in Ireland. Between 1991 and 2007 the total phosphorus (TP) concentration in the lake increased by 52%, raising concerns about eutrophication. Although agriculture in the catchment is extensive, operating at low stocking rates, it is estimated to contribute 62% of the TP load to the lake. Defining the reason(s) for this decline in water quality were hindered by sources of uncertainty in (1) understanding of farm practices; (2) understanding of the catchment hydrology; (3) monitoring and evaluation; and (4) farmer participation in agri-environmental schemes and policy implementation. Sources 1 and 2 contributed to the development of critical source areas of P in the catchment; source 3 reflects the accuracy both of water quality assessment and P source apportionment, and 4 played a part in the limited response to the observed changes in water quality. A number of approaches to overcoming these uncertainties are reviewed in the context of achieving the objectives of the WFD including: a catchment specific approach; stakeholder participation and critical appraisal of the decision - making processes for implementing the WFD.

Long-term Water Quality Variations and Chlorophyll a Simulation with an Emphasis on Different Hydrological Periods in Lake Baiyangdian, Northern China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						artificial neural networks; chlorophyll a; hybrid evolutionary algorithm; hydrological period; Lake Baiyangdian; water quality variations	NAKDONG RIVER KOREA; NUTRIENT; PHYTOPLANKTON; SHALLOW; EUTROPHICATION; DYNAMICS; NITROGEN; NITRIFICATION; RESTORATION; PREDICTION	Eutrophication and water quality degradation comprise one of the most important environmental problems associated with protecting freshwater. Here, systematical analyses of trends, qualitative and quantitative analyses of water quality variables, and simulations of eutrophication were conducted to evaluate biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), dissolved oxygen (DO), chlorophyll a (Chl a), and Secchi disk data (SD) based on separate hydrological periods to enhance our understanding of lake ecosystem restoration. Long-term trends were identified using seasonal-trend decomposition with local error sum of squares, while non-supervised artificial neural networks were used to identify qualitative characteristics, and quantitative characteristics were measured using statistical analyses. Numerical simulation of Chl a by the hybrid evolutionary algorithm provided a theoretical solution for ecological warnings. The results were as follows: (1) declining trends in BOD, TP, TN, DO and Chl a were observed during long-term seasonal decomposition after December 2006, but SD increased after June 2003; (2) partitioned K-means maps revealed quantitative characteristics with heterogeneous changes during three hydrological periods, with BOD, TN, SD and Chl a showing the highest clustering quality; (3) BOD and DO showed clear relative hierarchies when compared with other parameters based on quantitative analysis; (4) Chl a simulation revealed heterogeneous changes in the three hydrological periods, and sensitivity analyses indicated that BOD was highly sensitive to Chl a, but TP was not. The sensitivities of other parameters changed during different hydrological periods. The methods described here can be used as preliminary management tools for degraded lakes.

J	Alam, MJ; Dutta, D				Alam, Md Jahangir; Dutta, Dushmanta			A process-based and distributed model for nutrient dynamics in river basin: Development, testing and applications	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Nutrient pollution; Sediment transport; Process-based modelling; Distributed hydrology; Ecosystem; River Basin	NONPOINT-SOURCE POLLUTION; MULTIPLE SOURCE ASSESSMENT; SOIL-EROSION MODEL; NITROGEN DYNAMICS; INUNDATION SIMULATION; TRANSPORT PROCESSES; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; CATCHMENTS INCA; SYSTEMS; FLOW	A new grid-based model of nutrient dynamics and transport process has been developed within a distributed hydrological modelling framework and integrated with river network module. The key aspect of this development is a process based description of nutrient generation process on the land surface and its related nutrient release with hydrologic runoff and soil erosion. Whereas the conventional modelling uses the event mean concentration method for nutrient dynamics modelling and estimates nutrient loads from catchments to the rivers this study has introduced an export function based release related with flow capacity. The river module solves the dynamic equation for transport and chemical reaction. The model output is available in high spatial and temporal resolution, which was tested and verified applying in two catchment areas from different hydro-climatic backgrounds. The model was able to simulate short term high intensity flood events as well as long term seasonal patterns. The simulated results for most of the nutrient parameters are within acceptable range as reflected by measures of statistical indices and visual interpretation. For example, the R-2 values for different nutrient levels in the Saru River, Japan are within the range of 0.83-0.99 and 0.66-0.87 for calibration and validation, respectively. Similarly, the relative root mean square error (RRMSE) values for different nutrient levels in the Saru River range between 0.06-0.22 and 0.06-0.26 for calibration and validations, respectively. The maximum load of nutrients in each grid was extracted from time series output, analyzed further and presented in two dimensional maps, which showcase the usefulness of the model in decision making process for management of land and maintenance of the in-stream water quality.

Influence of Sampling Frequency on Estimation of Annual Total Phosphorus and Total Suspended Solids Loads	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						turbidity; nutrients; monitoring; sampling frequency; total phosphorus; suspended sediment; load estimation	WATER-QUALITY; STRATEGIES; SEDIMENT; FLUXES; UNCERTAINTIES; VARIABILITY; CATCHMENTS; TRANSPORT; ACCURACY; NUTRIENT	The determination of sediment and nutrient loads is typically based on the collection and analysis of grab samples. The frequency and regularity of traditional sampling may not provide representation of constituent loading, particularly in systems with flashy hydrology. At two sites in the Little Bear River, Utah, continuous, high-frequency turbidity was used with surrogate relationships to generate estimates of total phosphorus and total suspended solids concentrations, which were paired with discharge to estimate annual loads. The high frequency records were randomly subsampled to represent hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly sampling frequencies and to examine the effects of timing, and resulting annual load estimates were compared to the reference loads. Higher frequency sampling resulted in load estimates that better approximated the reference loads. The degree of bias was greater at the more hydrologically responsive site in the upper watershed, which required a higher sampling frequency than the lower watershed site to achieve the same level of accuracy in estimating the reference load. The hour of day and day of week of sampling impacted load estimation, depending on site and hydrologic conditions. The effects of sampling frequency on the determination of compliance with a water quality criterion were also examined. These techniques can be helpful in determining necessary sampling frequency to meet the objectives of a water quality monitoring program.

This study was initiated to assess whether a potential reference lake for identifying lake-type specific reference conditions meets the WFD requirements, of being minimally impacted by human activity during the last centuries. The sediments of Lake Kooraste Koverjarv were analysed for diatom assemblages and sediment composition; past changes in the lake-water pH and total phosphorus were reconstructed, using quantitative models on sedimentary diatoms. The chronology of sediments was established, using spheroidal fly-ash particles stratigraphy. Palaeolimnological investigations, supported by information from historical maps, revealed that man-made changes around the lake have severely influenced its ecological conditions. The lake, which had been oligotrophic with soft and clear water before the mid-17th century, has been transformed into a hard-water lake by modifications to the inflow and outflow. The lake water quality has also been altered by the infiltration of nutrients from a nearby hypertrophic lake that was used for flax retting since the 19th century. Although the ecological status of the lake has remained good despite all these changes, it is still questionable whether to nominate it as a reference lake for stratified hard-water lake types.

J	Othman, F; Eldin, MEA; Mohamed, I				Othman, Faridah; Eldin, Alaa M. E.; Mohamed, Ibrahim			Trend analysis of a tropical urban river water quality in Malaysia	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING			English	Article							LAND-USE; INDEX; MANAGEMENT; POLLUTION; GIS	Rivers play a significant role in providing water resources for human and ecosystem survival and health. Hence, river water quality is an important parameter that must be preserved and monitored. As the state of Selangor and the city of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, are undergoing tremendous development, the river is subjected to pollution from point and non-point sources. The water quality of the Klang River basin, one of the most densely populated areas within the region, is significantly degraded due to human activities as well as urbanization. Evaluation of the overall river water quality status is normally represented by a water quality index (WQI), which consists of six parameters, namely dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, suspended solids, ammoniacal nitrogen and pH. The objectives of this study are to assess the water quality status for this tropical, urban river and to establish the WQI trend. Using monthly WQI data from 1997 to 2007, time series were plotted and trend analysis was performed by employing the first-order autocorrelated trend model on the moving average values for every station. The initial and final values of either the moving average or the trend model were used as the estimates of the initial and final WQI at the stations. It was found that Klang River water quality has shown some improvement between 1997 and 2007. Water quality remains good in the upper stream area, which provides vital water sources for water treatment plants in the Klang valley. Meanwhile, the water quality has also improved in other stations. Results of the current study suggest that the present policy on managing river quality in the Klang River has produced encouraging results; the policy should, however, be further improved alongside more vigorous monitoring of pollution discharge from various point sources such as industrial wastewater, municipal sewers, wet markets, sand mining and landfills, as well as non-point sources such as agricultural or urban runoff and commercial activity.

Natural vertical mixing of lentic surface water bodies can be hindered by the presence of a benthic saline layer and thereby affect lake water quality and ecology. To study the formation and disappearance of the saline layer, temperature and specific conductance profiles were measured intermittently over two years (2007, 2008) and at high frequency during one year (2009) in an urban lake of the northern temperate region (Tanners Lake, Oakdale, Minnesota). Erosion of the saline layer in the spring occurred only in year 2007. In years 2008 and 2009, the saline layer persisted throughout the summer only to be removed during fall turnover when thermal stratification was at a minimum. In all three years, salinity dominated density stratification after ice-out, but was quickly overtaken by temperature stratification as the epilimnion warmed. The deterministic, unsteady dynamic one-dimensional (1D) lake temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) model MINLAKE was modified by including vertical salinity gradients, and it was used to simulate summer stratification and mixing dynamics in Tanners Lake. The daily adjustment of the hypolimnetic eddy diffusion as a function of lake number was an important component in the developed model. This addition allowed mixing in the hypolimnion to be stronger in the fall and spring when the lake stratification was weaker than in the summer after thermal stratification formed. Model results of dissolved oxygen in the water column demonstrated that the saline benthic layer can prevent dissolved oxygen from reaching lake sediments. The adverse consequences of dissolved oxygen depletion on phosphorus recycling from the sediments, benthic microbial communities, and fish habitat are well known. Overall, the results show how salinity from road salt applications can influence water quality and natural mixing in urban lakes. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000590.

EFFECTS OF ARTIFICIAL FLOODING ON WATER QUALITY OF A FLOODPLAIN BACKWATER	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						flow augmentation; riverine floodplain; water chemistry; chlorophyll	FISH ASSEMBLAGES; RIVER; LAKES; RESTORATION; DISTRIBUTIONS; CONNECTIVITY; MANAGEMENT; NUTRIENTS; HABITATS; OXBOW	Seasonal flooding of riverine backwaters is important in maintaining diverse aquatic habitats, but anthropogenic impacts have reduced the frequency and duration of such flooding. This study, conducted in a 2.5-km-long shallow floodplain severed meander backwater adjacent to the Coldwater River in Tunica County, Mississippi, USA, compared water quality during a late summer 30-day artificial flooding period with 28-day pre-flood and 26-day post-flood periods. Flooding was simulated by pumping 0.22 to 0.35?m3?s-1 from the river into the upstream portion of the backwater. In situ parameters (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and fluorescent chlorophyll) were measured every 30?min at one site within the backwater. Solids (dissolved and suspended) and nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen) were measured at three sites in the backwater and in the river every 3 to 5?days. Decreases in the amplitude of temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH diel cycles within the backwater were observed during flooding. Changes in patterns of solids and nutrients were also associated with flooding. Complex patterns in phosphorus and nitrogen emerged as a result of utilization by autotrophs (measured as chlorophyll) and seasonal changes. Artificial flooding in a shallow floodplain water body stabilized and improved water quality for aquatic biota and is a viable method for habitat rehabilitation in these systems.

A 1.4 ha natural gas well pad was constructed in an intermittent stream channel at the Alto Experimental Watersheds in East Texas, USA (F1), while another 1.1 ha well pad was offset about 15 m from a nearby intermittent stream (F2). V-notch weirs were constructed downstream of these well pads and stream sedimentation and water quality was measured. For the 2009 water year, about 11.76 cm, or almost 222% more runoff resulted from F1 than F2. Sediment yield was significantly greater at F1, with 13,972 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) versus 714 kg ha(-1)yr(-1) at F2 on a per unit area disturbance basis for the 2009 water year. These losses were greater than was observed following forest clearcutting with best management practices (111-224 kg ha(-1)). Significantly greater nitrogen and phosphorus losses were measured at F1 than F2. While oil and gas development can degrade surface water quality, appropriate conservation practices like retaining streamside buffers can mitigate these impacts.

Moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) and biologically active filters (BAFs) have been used as post-denitrification biofilm reactors in processes designed and operated for this purpose (Boltz et al., 2010a). There is a paucity of information describing systematic design and operational protocols that will minimize the potential for phosphorus rate-limited conditions as well as a lack of information describing the interaction between these post-denitrification biofilm reactors and unit processes that substantially alter phosphorus speciation (e.g., chemically enhanced clarification). In this paper, a simple mathematical model for estimating the threshold below which P becomes rate-limiting, and the model is presented and evaluated by comparing its predictions with operational data from post-denitrification MBBRs and BAFs. Ortho-phosphorus (PO4-P), which is the dissolved reactive component of total phosphorus, was a primary indicator of P rate-limiting conditions in the evaluated post-denitrification biofilm reactors. The threshold below which PO4-P becomes the rate-limiting substrate is defined: SPO4-P: SNOx-N = 0.0086 g P/g N and SPO4-P: S-M = 0.0013 g P/g COD. Additional analyses indicate J(NOx)(avg)-N = 0.48 g/m(2)/d when SPO4-P: S-NOx-N > 0.0086, and J(NOx)(avg)-N = 0.06 g/m(2)/d when SPO4-P: S-NOx-N < 0.0086. Effluent nitrate-nitrogen plus nitrite-nitrogen concentration (S-NOx-N) from the evaluated post-denitrification biofilm reactors began to rapidly increase when SPO4-P: S-NOx-N was 0.01, approximately (consistent with the rate-limitation threshold of SPO4-P: S-NOx-N < 0.0086 predicted by the mathematical model described in this paper). Depending on the processes used at a given WWTP, optimizing chemically enhanced clarification to increase the amount of PO4-P that remains in the clarifiers effluent stream, dosing phosphoric acid in the MBBR or BAF influent stream, and/or optimizing secondary process EBPR may overcome phosphorus rate-limitations in the biofilm-based post-denitrification process.

There is a need for efficient predictive tools based on easily measured variables for implementing appropriate management strategies and providing advice to local river users on river health and associated risks. Using the Hawkesbury-Nepean River system in New South Wales, Australia as case study, a stepwise discriminant function analysis was employed to develop two predictive models, one for river eutrophication risk and the other for microbial risk. The models are intended for a preliminary assessment of a river reach, particularly to assess the level of risk (high or low) for algal bloom and whether the river water is suitable for primary contact activities such as swimming. The input variables for both models included saturated dissolved oxygen and turbidity, while the eutrophication risk model included temperature as an additional variable. When validated with an independent data set, both models predicted the observed risk category accurately in two out of three instances. Since the models developed in this study use only two or three easy-to-measure variables, their application can help in rapid assessment of river conditions, result in potential cost saving in river monitoring programs and assist in providing timely advice to community and other users for a particular aspect of river use.

Modeling the effects of crop patterns and management scenarios on N and P loads to surface water and groundwater in a semi-humid catchment (West Africa)	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						SWAT; Management scenarios; Land degradation; Water quality; Climate change; Land use change	LAND-USE; DATA RESOLUTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SWAT MODEL; INPUT DATA; MAP SCALE; UNCERTAINTY; SOIL; PARAMETERS; SEDIMENT	Assessment studies of N and P loads to water systems have developed from simple descriptions based on monitoring and sampling into the analysis of multiple scenarios using simulation models. In this study, water, sediment, and nutrient delivery to the stream flow at the Donga-Pont river catchment outlet (586 km(2)) in the Republic of Benin, West Africa were simulated incorporating local management practices including detailed crop systems, fertilization and manure deposition, using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). At the study scale (586 km2), cropping systems are not mapped. Therefore, a land use map was refined for the study area, enabling the evaluation of four management scenarios: crop systems with fertilizer supplied only to cotton, rice and maize, as is common in Benin (Sc0); crop systems without the use of fertilizer (Sc0a); the original land use map with similar fertilizer inputs to all cropping systems (Sc1); and the original land use map without fertilizer inputs (Sc1a). Compared to the first scenario, the latter two scenarios, commonly used in regional scale modeling, exhibited distinct biases in plant growth parameters, crop yields, water yield, sediment yield and nitrogen load. Finally, it was apparent that at the catchment scale, decreases in water yield and nutrient loading were induced by reductions in rainfall (as the result of climate change scenarios), but the effects of the decline in precipitation were counteracted by the effects of changes in land use (land use scenarios). This indicates the strength of the relationship between agriculture and water quality (sediment and nutrient loads) within the Donga-Pont catchment. It was clear that management practices such as fertilizer inputs are among the principal factors controlling this dynamic. Moreover, high spatial variation in the groundwater nitrate concentration, reaching 42 mg/l, was observed. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Bossa, A.

J	Neori, A; Mendola, D				Neori, Amir; Mendola, Dominick			An Anaerobic Slurry Module for Solids Digestion and Denitrification in Recirculating Minimal Discharge Marine Fish Culture Systems	JOURNAL OF THE WORLD AQUACULTURE SOCIETY			English	Article							MARICULTURE SYSTEM; ORGANIC-MATTER; NATURAL-WATERS; AQUACULTURE; SEDIMENTS; REMOVAL; SULFIDE; DESIGN; TRANSFORMATIONS; PERFORMANCE	An anaerobic denitrification module with improved stability for closed aquaculture systems is described. The module was fitted to a recirculating fish mariculture system. The 18 m3 system consisted of a fish basin, a nitrification trickling filter and the module reported here, which was composed of a stirred slurry basin and two subsequent sedimentation tanks. Commercial fish feed (pellets) introduction into the slurry basin simulated nutrient input equivalent to 450 kg of fish biomass. About 50 kg of the sea bream, Sparus aurata, were introduced to bioassay water quality. Conditions remained stable as long as the mixing remained regular (16 wk). Feeding and sampling continued for an additional 6 wk of irregular mixing, during which time water quality gradually deteriorated causing 19% mortality of the stocked fish population. The system removed a majority of the total dissolved nitrogen (N) by denitrification and total phosphorus (P) by immobilization in the sludge. The rate of denitrification approached 9 mmol N/L/d. Hydrogen sulfide concentration in the fish basin remained low. The results constitute a proof-of-concept for the utility and resilience of slurry basins in the control of anaerobic processes and the maintenance of good water quality in recirculating fish culture.

The physical model is a modified ECOM-si version with inclusion of flooding/draining processes over the intertidal zone. The water quality model is based on WASP5 which quantifies processes governing internal nutrients cycling, dissolved oxygen balance and phytoplankton growth. The model was used to simulate the spatial distribution and the temporal variation of water quality in the Jiaozhou Bay for the period of May 2005 to May 2006. In addition, the effect of reduction of riverine nutrients load was simulated and evaluated. The simulated results show that under the influence of nutrients discharged from river, the concentrations of nutrients and phytoplankton were higher in the northwest and northeast of the bay, and decreased from the inner bay to the outer. Affected by strong tidal mixing, the concentrations of all state variables were vertically homogeneous except in the deeper regions where a small gradient was found. Obvious seasonal variation of phytoplankton biomass was found, which exhibited two peaks in March and July, respectively. The variation of riverine waste loads had remarkable impact on nutrients concentration in coastal areas, but slightly altered the distribution in the center of the bay.

J	Wang, XD; Zhang, SS; Liu, SL; Chen, JW				Wang, Xudong; Zhang, Shushen; Liu, Suling; Chen, Jingwen			A two-dimensional numerical model for eutrophication in Baiyangdian Lake	FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING			English	Article						eutrophication; eco-dynamics; hydrodynamics; improved Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP) model; Baiyangdian Lake	WATER-QUALITY; RESERVOIR; CHINA; BAY	Hydrodynamic, physical, and biochemical processes in the Baiyangdian Lake water environment were analyzed comprehensively. An eutrophication ecodynamics model including the effects of reed resistance on flow was coupled with the hydrodynamics governing equations. An improvement on the Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP, a modeling system introduced by the US Environmental Protection Agency) is established, which uses the zooplankton kinetic equation. The model simulates water quality constituents associated with eutrophication in the lake, including phytoplankton, zooplankton, nitrogen, phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, and others. Various kinetic coefficients were calibrated using measured data or information from relevant literature, to study eutrophication in the lake. The values calculated by the calibrated model agree well with field data, including ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and dissolved oxygen. Changes related to nutrition and dissolved oxygen during the processes were simulated. The present model describes the temporal variation of water quality in Baiyangdian Lake with reasonable accuracy. Deviations between model-simulated and observed values are discussed. As an ideal tool for environmental management of the lake, this model can be used to predict its water quality, and be used in research to examine the eutrophication process.

Predicting sediment phosphorus release rates using landuse and water-quality data	FRESHWATER SCIENCE			English	Article						anoxia; landuse characteristics; eutrophication; reservoirs	LAKE; NUTRIENTS; RESERVOIR; FLUX; AVAILABILITY	We developed a series of models using landuse and water-quality variables to predict sediment P release rates under anoxic conditions in reservoirs. We collected sediment cores from 17 reservoirs in the Central Plains region of the USA, and we measured nutrient release rates under anoxic conditions in laboratory incubation studies. We used corresponding landuse and water-quality data from the reservoirs to develop regression models for predicting P release rates. We used variables that relate directly to trophic state, including % cropland in the watershed, which explained the greatest amount of variation in release rates. P release rates tended to be higher in reservoirs that had greater % cropland in the watersheds. We developed additional predictive models using surface total P concentrations and Secchi disk depths. Trophic state was also a good predictor of release rates because more P was released from hypereutrophic reservoirs than from mesotrophic or eutrophic reservoirs. The median release rates for reservoirs representing different trophic state classes (e.g., mesotrophic, eutropbic, and hypereutrophic) were very similar to those previously reported for natural lakes. Our models can be used to predict sediment release rates in individual reservoirs of concern or to screen a large number of reservoirs to help direct resources to those systems that are most vulnerable to internal loading. Models based on landuse characteristics are particularly valuable because these data can be obtained from computer-based assessments and do not require labor-intensive field sampling.

A New Zealand freshwater diatom transfer function was applied to infer past pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved reactive phosphorus and chlorophyll a. A precise, mixed-effect regression model of age versus depth was constructed from 11 tephra and 13 radiocarbon dates, with a basal age of 48.2 cal kyr BP. Diatom-inferred changes in paleolimnology and climate corroborate earlier inferences from geochemical analyses (Stephens et al. 2012), with respect to the timing of marked climate changes in the Last Glacial Coldest Phase (LGCP; 28.8-18.0 cal kyr BP), the Last Glacial Interglacial Transition (LGIT; 18.0 to ca. 12-10 cal kyr BP) and the Holocene, the onset of which is difficult to discern from LGIT amelioration, but which includes an early climatic optimum (10.2-8.0 cal kyr BP). The LGCP is readily defined by a reduction in lake level and effective precipitation, whereas the LGIT represents a period of rising lake level, with greater biomass during the Holocene. There was limited change in diatom assemblage structure, influx or inferred water quality during a Late Glacial Reversal (LGR; 14.5-13.8 cal kyr BP), associated with heightened erosional influx. In contrast, an LGIT peak in paleoproductivity is recorded by increased diatom influx from 13.8 to 12.8 cal kyr BP. Changes in sediment influx and biomass record complex millennial-scale events attuned to the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR; 14.5-12.8 cal kyr BP). Additional millennial-scale environmental change is apparent in the Holocene, with marked changes in lake circulation beginning at 7.6 cal kyr BP, including the onset of seasonal thermal stratification and rapid species turnover at 5.7 cal kyr BP. The most rapid diatom community turnover accompanied widely varying nutrient availability and greater seasonality during the last 3.3 cal kyr. Rising seasonality appears to have been linked to strengthened Southern Westerlies at their northern margins during the middle and late Holocene.

Between-lake variation in the elemental composition of roach (Rutilus rutilus L.)	AQUATIC ECOLOGY			English	Article						Roach; Stoichiometry; Carbon; Nitrogen; Phosphorus	WATER-QUALITY; BIOGEOCHEMICAL IMPLICATIONS; PHOSPHORUS AVAILABILITY; NUTRIENT SUBSIDIES; FISH DECOMPOSITION; BALATON HUNGARY; TROPHIC CASCADE; BOREAL LAKES; LONG-TERM; NITROGEN	Stoichiometry theory states that the elemental composition of individual organisms is a taxon-dependent trait, and that organisms maintain relatively constant body nutrient composition, independent of food nutrient content or ingestion rate. Some recent studies have pointed out that assuming a strict homeostasis in fish is an over-simplification, so that nutrient ratios in fish bodies may not be as constant as previously thought. In this study, our aims were (a) to assess the overall nutrient composition of roach, (b) to reveal any significant differences in elemental composition of roach between populations from different lakes and (c) to relate these potential differences to environmental parameters and fish condition. The mean elemental composition of roach (whole fish) was 45.0 +/- A 5.3 % carbon (C), 10.2 +/- A 0.8 % nitrogen (N), and 2.4 +/- A 0.5 % phosphorus (P), while their molar C/N/P ratio was approximately 50:10:1. The elemental composition of roach was not as constant as homeostatic stoichiometry models would predict. Significant differences were found in the carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus contents of fish sampled from different lakes. Productivity of lakes (expressed as chlorophyll-a) was positively correlated with %C, C/N, C/P, and N/P ratios, and negatively correlated with %N and %P. In turn, mean lake temperature was negatively correlated with %C and C/N ratio, but not with other nutrients or nutrient ratios. Condition factor was negatively related to the %C of fish, but it did not correlate significantly with %N, %P, or nutrient ratios. Our results on intraspecific nutrient variation illustrate the potential differences between populations and emphasize the importance of lake-specific approaches.

J	Hesse, C; Krysanova, V; Voss, A				Hesse, Cornelia; Krysanova, Valentina; Voss, Anja			Implementing In-Stream Nutrient Processes in Large-Scale Landscape Modeling for the Impact Assessment on Water Quality	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Water quality modeling; In-stream processes; Nutrients; Dissolved oxygen; Chlorophyll a; Impact assessment; SWIM	RIVER; ZOOPLANKTON; MEUSE; BASIN	For a long time, watershed models focused on the transport of chemicals from the terrestrial part of the watershed to the surface water bodies by leaching and erosion. After the substances had reached the surface water, they were routed through the channel network often without any further transformation. Today, there is a need to extend watershed models with in-stream processes to bring them closer to natural conditions and to enhance their usability as support tools for water management and water quality policies. This paper presents experience with implementing in-stream processes in a ecohydrological dynamic watershed model and its application on the large scale in the Saale River basin in Germany. Results demonstrate that new implemented water quality parameters like chlorophyll a concentrations or oxygen amount in the reach can be reproduced quite well, although the model results, compared with results achieved without taking into account algal and transformation processes in the river, show obvious improvement only for some of the examined nutrients. Finally, some climate and water management scenarios expected to impact in-stream processes in the Saale basin were run. Their results illustrate the relative importance of physical boundary conditions on the amount and concentration of the phytoplankton, which leads to the conclusion that measures to improve water quality should not only take nutrient inputs into account but also climate influences and river morphology.

J	Fan, CH; Wang, WS; Liu, KFR; Yang, TM				Fan, Chihhao; Wang, Wei-Shen; Liu, Kevin Fong-Rey; Yang, Tsung-Ming			Sensitivity Analysis and Water Quality Modeling of a Tidal River Using a Modified Streeter-Phelps Equation with HEC-RAS-Calculated Hydraulic Characteristics	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT			English	Article						HEC-RAS; Streeter-Phelps; Tidal effect; Water quality; Water quality modeling	SIMULATION; QUAL2K	A modified Streeter-Phelps equation and the Hydrological Engineering Centers River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) were combined to assess water quality of the Tan-Sui River and its tributaries. The Tan-Sui River is the main source of water supply for northern Taiwan, and the water quality of its stream is significantly affected by tides. In this study, HEC-RAS was employed to assess the impact of tides on water quality and to calculate reoxygenation coefficients. The modified Streeter-Phelps equation was used to calculate water quality in terms of contaminant degradation and reoxygenation. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), the most important identified sources of water pollution in the rivers investigated, were evaluated. Dissolved oxygen (DO) was also simulated, since it is often used as a staple of water quality. Results showed that employing HEC-RAS for hydraulic calculations improves the modified Streeter-Phelps simulation. In river sections without tidal influence, water quality was sensitive to the BOD and NH3-N degradation constants. Downstream of Chin-Mei Creek, while the BOD degradation constant decreased by 80%, BOD and DO concentrations increased from 7.1 mg/L to 10.7 mg/L and 5.0 mg/L to 7.2 mg/L, respectively, indicating that water quality was not as sensitive to variations of the BOD degradation constant as expected. The concentrations of DO and BOD at the river mouth had a significant impact on water quality for the tidal sections of the investigated rivers due to mixing of tidal and river waters. The BOD and NH3-N degradation constants in the tidal sections had little impact on water quality simulations. This study demonstrated the innovative combination of the modified Streeter-Phelps equation and HEC-RAS to assess the impact of tidal variation and to simulate the water quality of a tidal river when available data is rather limited.

J	Che, Y; Yang, K; Wu, E; Shang, ZY; Xiang, WN				Che, Yue; Yang, Kai; Wu, Enuo; Shang, Zhaoyi; Xiang, Weining			Assessing the health of an urban stream: a case study of Suzhou Creek in Shanghai, China	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						River health; Ecological indicator; Restoration; Assessment; Suzhou Creek; Shanghai	RIVER RESTORATION; WATER-QUALITY; PHYSICAL HABITAT; MANAGEMENT; PROJECTS; STANDARDS; MODEL	Restoration of urban streams and rivers has increased rapidly in developing countries in recent years. Estimating river health provides a new perspective on evaluating the ecological conditions of streams and rivers. The Suzhou Creek restoration project in Shanghai, China is a milestone for environmental protection. Based on the environmental and ecological data, including 17 indicators in five categories, collected from March 11 to April 20, 2007, the river health index (RHI) for Suzhou Creek was constructed and analysed to quantify the ecosystem of this urban river after a restoration project. The RHI scores of 34 sites ranged from 19.24 to 33.36, i.e. from poor to good. There were no significant RHI differences among stream orders, while differences in land use resulted in significant differences in channel flow status (B12), channel alteration (B21), channel sinuosity (B22), bank stability (B23), bank profile type (B25) and riparian vegetative zone width (B31). River restoration led to improved hydrological condition and channel physical form, while ammonia nitrogen (B44) and indicator scores of the presence of macro-invertebrate families (B51) were the lowest of any indicator. This case study supports the use of river health assessment as a supplement to water quality analysis in China.

Management options to reduce future nitrogen emissions into rivers: A case study of the Weser river basin, Germany	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Agricultural measures; Environmental measures; GROWA/WEKU; Nitrogen modelling; MONERIS; Nutrient; RAUMIS; Water framework directive	GROUNDWATER RESIDENCE TIMES; NITRATE POLLUTION; ECONOMIC MODELS; NUTRIENT; SCALE; ABATEMENT; AQUIFERS; POLICIES; SYSTEMS; COST	The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires a good chemical and ecological status of water and groundwater resources in the EU member countries by 2015. However, for some river basins, the good status cannot be achieved by 2015, and therefore measures have to be taken to reduce the unacceptably high nutrient input. Therefore, a new approach was developed by using an interdisciplinary model network, consisting of the regionalized agricultural economic model RAUMIS and two hydro(geo)logical models GROWA/WEKU and MONERIS. For the 49,000 km(2) Weser river basin, in Germany we: (1) analysed nitrogen surplus on agricultural land for 2003 and nitrogen emissions into ground and surface waters in an area-differentiated manner, (2) quantified the future impact of agro-political measures and global economics for 2015 and its effect on nitrogen emissions (baseline scenario), (3) identified reduction targets to reach the goals of the WFD and (4) designed comprehensive measure packages including cost efficiency. In 2003, high nitrogen balances lead to nitrogen emissions of 91,000 t yr(-1), which were mainly realized via the pathways groundwater flow, tile drainages and point sources. In 2015 the baseline scenario shows a mean reduction of nitrogen balances of similar to 10 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). Consequently, nitrogen emissions into surface waters are predicted to drop to 75,700 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) for the whole catchment, and sitespecific emissions will remain under 30 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). However, despite this reduction, additional measures will be needed in order for agriculture to reach the targets for the good ground and surface water quality. Therefore, seven conventional agricultural measures were chosen based on a comprehensive literature research and expert opinions. Results show, that in 6% of the regions the targets are not attained by conventional measures. This interdisciplinary model network provides an appropriate tool for a sustainable river basin management for large scales. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge. However, Refuge water quality today is impacted by pumped stormwater inflows to the eutrophic and mineral-enriched 100-km canal, which circumscribes the wetland. Optimal management is a challenge and requires scientifically based predictive tools to assess and forecast the impacts of water management on Refuge water quality. In this research, we developed a compartment-based numerical model of hydrodynamics and water quality for the Refuge. Using the numerical model, we examined the dynamics in stage, water depth, discharge from hydraulic structures along the canal, and exchange flow among canal and marsh compartments. We also investigated the transport of chloride, sulfate and total phosphorus from the canal to the marsh interior driven by hydraulic gradients as well as biological removal of sulfate and total phosphorus. The model was calibrated and validated using long-term stage and water quality data (1995-2007). Statistical analysis indicates that the model is capable of capturing the spatial (from canal to interior marsh) gradients of constituents across the Refuge. Simulations demonstrate that flow from the eutrophic and mineral-enriched canal impacts chloride and sulfate in the interior marsh. In contrast, total phosphorus in the interior marsh shows low sensitivity to intrusion and dispersive transport. We conducted a rainfall-driven scenario test in which the pumped inflow concentrations of chloride, sulfate and total phosphorus were equal to rainfall concentrations (wet deposition). This test shows that pumped inflow is the dominant factor responsible for the substantially increased chloride and sulfate concentrations in the interior marsh. Therefore, the present day Refuge should not be classified as solely a rainfall-driven or ombrotrophic wetland. The model provides an effective screening tool for studying the impacts of various water management alternatives on water quality across the Refuge, and demonstrates the practicality of similarly modeling other wetland systems. As a general rule, modeling provides one component of a multi-faceted effort to provide technical support for ecosystem management decisions. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Loading analysis and update (1994-2008)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						Phosphorus; Loadings; Eutrophication; Tributary; Municipal; Industrial	ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION; ERIE; PRECIPITATION; NITROGEN	Phosphorus load estimates have been updated for all of the Great Lakes with an emphasis on lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron and Ontario for 1994-2008. Lake Erie phosphorus loads have been kept current with previous work and for completeness are reported here. A combination of modeling and data analysis is employed to evaluate whether target loads established by the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA, 1978, Annex 3) have been and are currently being met. Data from federal, state, and provincial agencies were assembled and processed to yield annual estimates for all lakes and sources. A mass-balance model was used to check the consistency of loads and to estimate interlake transport. The analysis suggests that the GLWQA target loads have been consistently met for the main bodies of lakes Superior, Michigan and Huron. However, exceedances still persist for Saginaw Bay. For lakes Erie and Ontario, loadings are currently estimated to be at or just under the target (with some notable exceptions). Because interannual variability is high, the target loads have not been met consistently for the lower Great Lakes. The analysis also indicates that, because of decreasing TP concentrations in the lakes, interlake transport of TP has declined significantly since the mid-1970s. Thus, it is important that these changes be included in future assessments of compliance with TP load targets. Finally, detailed tables of the yearly (1994-2008) estimates are provided, as well as annual summaries by lake tributary basin (in Supplementary Information).

J	Chapra, SC; Dolan, DM				Chapra, Steven C.; Dolan, David M.			Great Lakes total phosphorus revisited: 2. Mass balance modeling	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						Phosphorus; Chloride; Model; Eutrophication; Mussels; Dreissenid	LONG-TERM TRENDS; WATER-QUALITY; ROUND GOBIES; ZEBRA; IMPACTS; ONTARIO; ERIE; PHYTOPLANKTON; PREDATION; DREISSENA	Mass balance models are used to simulate chloride and total phosphorus (TP) trends from 1800 to the present for the North American Great Lakes. The chloride mass balance is employed to estimate turbulent eddy diffusion between model segments. Total phosphorus (TP) concentrations are then simulated based on estimated historical and measured TP loading time series. Up until about 1990, simulation results for all parts of the system generally conform to measured TP concentrations and exhibit significant improvement due primarily to load reductions from the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. After 1990, the model simulations diverge from observed data for the offshore waters of all the lakes except Lake Superior with the observations suggesting a greater improvement than predicted by the model. The largest divergence occurs in Lake Ontario where the model predicts that load reductions should bring the lake to oligo-mesotrophic levels, whereas the data indicate that it is solidly oligotrophic and seems to be approaching an ultra-oligotrophic state. Less dramatic divergences also occur in the offshore waters of lakes Michigan, Huron and Erie. In order to simulate these outcomes, the model's apparent settling velocity, which parameterizes the rate that total phosphorus is permanently lost to the lake's deep sediments, must be increased significantly after 1990. This result provides circumstantial support for the hypothesis that Dreissenid mussels have enhanced the Great Lakes phosphorus assimilation capacity. Finally, all interlake mass transfers of TP via connecting channels have dropped since phosphorus control measures were implemented beginning in the mid-1970s.

The processes affecting algae, nutrients, and dissolved oxygen (DO) in small and shallow subtropical estuaries are relatively less studied. This paper documents the development, calibration, and verification of a three dimensional (3D) water quality model for the St. Lucie Estuary (SLE), a small and shallow estuary located on the east coast of south Florida. The water quality model is calibrated and verified using two years of measured data. Statistical analyses indicate that the model is capable of reproducing key water quality characteristics of the estuary within an acceptable range of accuracy. The calibrated model is further applied to study hydrodynamic and eutrophication processes in the estuary. Modeling results reveal that high algae concentrations in the estuary are likely caused by excessive nutrient and algae supplies in freshwater inflows. While algal blooms may lead to reduced DO concentrations near the bottom of the waterbody, this study indicates that stratification and circulation induced by freshwater inflows may also contribute significantly to bottom water hypoxia in the estuary. It is also found that high freshwater inflows from one of the tributaries can change the circulation pattern and nutrient loading, thereby impacting water quality conditions of the entire estuary.

Modeling microalgal abundance with artificial neural networks: Demonstration of a heuristic 'Grey-Box' to deconvolve and quantify environmental influences	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Artificial intelligence; Ecological modeling; Environmental informatics; Output response surfaces; Pedagogical knowledge extraction	WATER-QUALITY; VARIABLE IMPORTANCE; NORTH-CAROLINA; RIVER ESTUARY; FLORIDA USA; PHYTOPLANKTON; INDICATORS; PREDICTION; RESPONSES; COASTAL	An artificial neural network (ANN)-based technology - a 'Grey-Box', originating the iterative selection, depiction, and quantitation of environmental relationships for modeling microalgal abundance, as chlorophyll (CHL) a, was developed and evaluated. Due to their robust capability for reproducing the complexities underlying chaotic, non-linear systems. ANNs have become popular for the modeling of ecosystem structure and function. However, ANNs exhibit a holistic deficiency in declarative knowledge structure (i.e. a 'black-box'). The architecture of the Grey-Box provided the benefit of the ANN modeling structure, while deconvolving the interaction of prediction potentials among environmental variables upon CHL a. The influences of (pairs of) predictors upon the variance and magnitude of CHL a were depicted via pedagogical knowledge extraction (multi-dimensional response surfaces). This afforded derivation of mathematical equations for iterative predictive outcomes of CHL a and together with an algorithmic expression across iterations, corrected for the lack of declarative knowledge within conventional ANNs. Importantly, the Grey-Box 'bridged the gap' between 'white-box' parametric models and black-box ANNs in terms of performance and mathematical transparency. Grey-Box formulations are relevant to ecological niche modeling, identification of biotic response(s) to stress/disturbance thresholds, and qualitative/quantitative derivation of biota-environmental relationships for incorporation within stand-alone mechanistic models projecting ecological structure.

J	Chen, L; Kao, SJ; Traore, S				Chen, Li; Kao, Shuh-Ji; Traore, Seydou			Predicting and managing reservoir total phosphorus by using modified grammatical evolution coupled with a macro-genetic algorithm	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Water quality; Grammatical evolution (GE); Back-propagation neural network (BPNN); Total phosphorous (TP); Macro-evolutionary genetic algorithm (MEGA)	WATER-QUALITY; NEURAL-NETWORK; OPTIMIZATION; PRECIPITATION	A model that predicts the monthly water quality for a subtropical deep reservoir was constructed based on a newly developed programming system, the incremental grammatical evolution (ICE). IGE was designed to execute Grammatical Evolution (GE) by iteratively introducing the optimal solution until convergence, and to explore complex veiled relationships between inputs and outputs when physical models cannot be defined in advance. A disadvantage of traditional GE is that it tends to select the most significant input variables and may become trapped in a local optimum. The ICE adequately manages the large input dimensionality by incrementally expanding the search depth. From three ICE runs, we extracted four significant input variables from 15 input variables, including watershed chemical loads, precipitation, inflow, and outflow, and expressed them appropriately in a sophisticated mathematical manner with accepted complexity. The ICE-derived equation yields the optimal predictive capability, especially for peak total phosphorous (TP) values, compared to traditional multilinear regression (MLR) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) models. The sensitivity analyses reconfirm the effectiveness of the selected variables in the nonlinear mathematical equations. Although BPNN and ICE demonstrate similar performances, we preferred the latter because of its transparency in providing a formula with measurable parameters. After obtaining the ICE-derived model, a Macro-evolutionary Genetic Algorithm (MEGA) was applied to enhance searching efficiency and genetic diversity during optimization, and subsequently deduced the reduction rates of TP loads from various input sources to achieve the water quality requirement of the reservoir.

In spite of their differences from natural lakes, it is important to maintain and improve their chemical and ecological status. In the present study, we tested the value of an assessment tool based on the structure of benthic macroinvertebrate communities, to evaluate the Ecological Potential (EP) of tropical reservoirs. We designed a conceptual assessment scheme based on the Reference Condition Approach, and developed a statistical model based on 28 sites classified as having Maximum Ecological Potential, localized in the reservoir of Serra Azul, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Sixty-two disturbed sites from three reservoirs were used to test the model. A classification system based on three EP classes was found to be the best option, and tracked different levels of total dissolved solids, turbidity, total nitrogen and trophic status. This study confirmed the utility of benthic macroinvertebrates as an indicator group of biological quality in reservoirs, and the statistical model applied was effective in providing a measure of the ecosystem health of the reservoirs. As a further improvement, the level of taxonomic resolution for certain groups such as chironomids could be increased, because knowledge of the species composition may provide a better discrimination of intermediate degradation levels.

Integration of monthly water balance modeling and nutrient load estimation in an agricultural catchment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Export coefficient model; Monthly water balance model; Nitrogen; PCRaster; Phosphorus; Xitiaoxi catchment	NONPOINT-SOURCE POLLUTION; EXPORT COEFFICIENT MODEL; NITROGEN-SOURCES; SOUTHEAST CHINA; SURFACE WATERS; YANGTZE-RIVER; TAIHU BASIN; LAND-USE; PHOSPHORUS; MANAGEMENT	Non-point sources pollution has become a serious environmental problem in the aquatic systems throughout the world. The Xitiaoxi catchment is located in the southwest of Taihu Basin, contributing large amounts of runoff and associated nutrients to Taihu Lake. Thus, identifying critical non-point sources pollution in this catchment is urgent and essential to control water pollution, improve the water quality, and reduce the pollutants drained into water bodies. The present study integrated a monthly water balance model with the export coefficient model for total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads estimation in the Xitiaoxi catchment in southeastern China. The simulated monthly runoff are in good agreement with the observed streamflow at both Hengtangcun and Fanjiancun stations with Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients higher than 0.80. The predictions showed reasonable ranges from 1687 to 2046 t/y (2002-2005) for total nitrogen loads, and from 106 to 157 t/y for total phosphorus loads (1999-2007), respectively, which are consistent with the observed values at Hengtangcun. Overall, the monthly export coefficient model coupling monthly water balance simulation to export coefficient model presented both the seasonal dynamics and magnitude for streamflow and nutrients loads, which generally match well with the observations. These findings demonstrate that the proposed model can provide encouraging results and can be used as an efficient tool to identify the pollution sources for planning and management of large-scale agricultural catchment.

Phytoplankton and Zooplankton Modeling of Pishin Reservoir by Means of an Advection-Diffusion Drought Model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Aquaculture; Lake; Water Flow; Source/Sink; Water quality	CHLOROPHYLL-A; ALGAL GROWTH; ECOSYSTEM; SHALLOW; WATER; DYNAMICS; SIMULATION; LAKES; MECHANISMS; SUCCESSION	Phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations in Pishin reservoir are predicted employing a three-dimensional numerical model in this paper. Modeling is performed using a numerical model based on mass transport equation. Advection, diffusion and source/sink processes are considered as separate subroutines for predicting the concentrations of phytoplankton and zooplankton in the reservoir. Finite volume method is used for solving the governing equations of water quality and water flow. The model is adopted for drought periods and dry climates. Water flow in the reservoir is simulated by Fluent software that is a finite volume numerical model. The model also uses a sub-model for compatibility providing of geometry between software and water quality model. A one-year period of experimental works and sampling is done in the study area. Phytoplankton and zooplankton cycles are used to determine the sources and sinks. Standard methods are chosen for experimentation. The concentrations of phytoplankton and zooplankton are calculated and measured in a one-year period. The concentrations of phytoplankton and zooplankton decrease in the depth of water and the decease rate is not linear. Also the concentrations are increase in the times after the maximum floods because of the inflows contain high amounts of nutrients. The calculated values by the model are in good agreement with measured values of laboratory works. It was concluded that the model can be used for water quality prediction in such aquatic environments.	[Mirbagheri, S. A.; Sadrnejad, S. A.; Monfared, Hashemi S.

Modelling catchment management impact on in-stream phosphorus loads in northern Victoria	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Phosphorus model; In-stream attenuation; South-east Australia; Howleaky; CatchMODS	WATER-QUALITY; SEDIMENT; NITROGEN; TRANSPORT; RUNOFF; EXPORT; RIVER; STRATIFICATION; UNCERTAINTIES; FRAMEWORK	Phosphorus pollution severely impairs the water quality of rivers in Australia and worldwide. Conceptual models have proved useful to assess management impact on phosphorus loads, particularly in data-sparse environments. This paper develops and evaluates the coupling of a point-scale model (HowLeaky2008) to a catchment scale model (CatchMODS) to enhance modelling of farm management impacts on in-stream phosphorus loads. The model was tested in two adjacent catchments in northern Victoria (Avon-Richardson and Avoca), Australia. After calibration of the in-stream attenuation parameter against measurements at gauging stations, the model simulated specific annual phosphorus loads across the catchments well (Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency of 0.52 in the Avon-Richardson and 0.83 for the Avoca catchment). Phosphorus loads at both catchment outlets under current conditions were estimated at 7 t y(-1) and were dominated by field exports. Changes to farm management practices, i.e. the use of perennial pastures in grazing systems and zero-tillage in cropping systems were estimated to reduce phosphorus load by 31% in the Avon-Richardson catchment and 19% in the Avoca catchment, relative to current practices (annual pasture and minimum tillage). The model afforded a major improvement in conceptual modelling by explicit simulation of the impacts of soil and climatic conditions on field-scale exports and by placing them in the context of landscape processes.

This study presents the analysis of spectral signatures from kettle holes based on in situ water sampling and reflectance measurements in application for chlorophyll estimation. Water samples and surface reflectance from kettle holes were collected from 6 ponds in 15 field campaigns (5 in 2007 and 10 in 2008), resulting in a total of 80 spectral datasets. We assessed the existing semi-empirical algorithms to determine chlorophyll content for different types of kettle holes using seasonal and cross-seasonal volume reflectance and derivative spectra. Based on this analysis and optical properties of water leaving reflectance from kettle holes, the following typology of the remote signal interpretation was proposed: Submerged vegetation, Phytoplankton dominated and Mixed type.

MANURE AND RUNOFF WATER QUALITY FROM FEEDLOTS AS AFFECTED BY DIET AND PEN SURFACE	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						Feedlots; Nitrogen; Nutrient losses; Phosphorus; Runoff; Water quality	WET DISTILLERS GRAINS; NUTRIENT; PHOSPHORUS; TRANSPORT; SOIL; INFILTRATION; LITTER; ASH	Environmental management of confined animal feeding operations is closely regulated. Hence, understanding management practices that affect nutrient outputs and the potential risk of transport in the environment is of importance. The objective of this research was to evaluate the impact of feeding corn-based wet distillers grains plus solubles (WDGS) and the type of pen surface material on manure nutrient composition and runoff water quality. Rainfall simulations were conducted at an experimental feedyard that contained soil and fly ash surfaced pens. Two diets, steam-flaked corn (SFC) and 30% WDGS, were fed to cattle on each surface type. Diets containing WDGS resulted in greater manure nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations than SFC diets. Runoff volumes were significantly higher from soil pens where WDGS diets were fed. Runoff volumes were consistent for fly ash pens; however, there was a 3-fold difference between soil surfaced pens, indicating great variability between soil surfaced pens. Feeding WDGS increased soluble reactive P (SRP) concentrations in runoff water by 38% and total P concentrations by 27% compared to SFC. This increase in P runoff concentrations as a result of feeding WDGS was expected, as manure WEP concentrations were greater in pens where WDGS was part of the diet. Pen surfaces with fly ash resulted in increased total P and ammonium-N (NH4-N) concentrations in runoff water Mass losses of SRP total P, NH4-N, and total Kjeldahl N (TKN) were highest from soil surfaced pens in which cattle were fed WDGS. While manure nutrient concentration can be an excellent indicator of the potential of nutrient runoff hydrological properties can be the single most important factor in actually transporting nutrients offsite.

To model the quality of the water, 946 surface water samples from 43 sites were analyzed for 29 water quality parameters in two monitoring programs spanning a period of six years. In this study, we pursued a multivariate approach using nonlinear principal component analysis (Isomap) to identify the prevailing processes that control the water quality of the complex surface water system. The first four principal components explained 79% of the variance in the dataset These components were interpreted as anthropogenic impact factors, such as groundwater exfiltration from degraded peat areas and the influence of coal mining drainage with respect to SO4, as well as groundwater exfiltration from mineral aquifers, and phytoplankton growth and competition. A sub-area of the Spreewald wetland, characterized by a sandy aquifer overlain by degraded peat, had the greatest impact on downstream surface water quality for most of the investigated parameters. In order to achieve better water quality in the Spreewald wetland, pollutant input - particularly SO4 input from the tributaries - must be controlled by enhancing the wetland's buffer capacity in the catchment, and peat mineralization and groundwater exfiltration must be minimized by raising the water table of the peatland area and receiving waters. The results show that Isomap is a very powerful tool for gaining a better insight into the dominating processes defining the surface water quality of complex wetland systems. Nevertheless, to be able to draw the right conclusions from multivariate statistical approaches such as Isomap it is necessary to possess basic knowledge of the structure of the system and of the processes that may occur.

In this study, long-term monitoring of a European great lake, Lake Geneva, provides the opportunity to assess to what extent the predicted toxicity of herbicide mixtures explains the changes in the composition of the phytoplankton community next to other classical limnology parameters such as nutrients. To reach this goal, the gradient of the mixture toxicity of 14 herbicides regularly detected in the lake was calculated using concentration addition and response addition models. A temporal gradient of toxicity was observed which decreased from 2004 to 2009. Redundancy analysis and partial redundancy analysis showed that this gradient explains a significant portion of the variation in phytoplankton community composition with and without having removed the effect of all other covariables. Moreover, species that are significantly influenced, positively or negatively, by the decrease of toxicity in the lake over time are highlighted. It can be concluded that the herbicide mixture toxicity is one of the key parameters to explain phytoplankton changes in Lake Geneva.

J	Son, JH; Carlson, KH				Son, Ji-Hee; Carlson, Kenneth H.			Will stringent total nitrogen wastewater treatment plant discharge regulations achieve stream water quality goals?	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING			English	Article							FLUXES; PHOSPHORUS; FINLAND	The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) proposed the in-stream numeric nutrient criteria as 2 mg TN per L and 0.16 mg TP per L for warm surface waters and 0.40 mg TN per L and 0.11 mg TP per L for cold surface waters. Consequently the department presented the nutrient limits for the municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) as annual averages of 0.7 mg TP per L and 5.7 mg TIN per L and quarterly averages of 1.0 mg TP per L and 9.0 mg TIN per L. Implementing stringent nutrient reduction at point sources is unlikely to result in improvements to the environment without non-point source controls. In this study, total nitrogen (TN) load inputs from known point source, WWTPs, and other non-point sources at six sub-basins of the Cache La Poudre (CLP) River Basin were estimated and compared under various hydrologic conditions. Significant loading exceedance from the proposed limits was observed during lower flow conditions and other sources dominated during events when the exceedance was observed except for one point. The point receives direct TN inputs from a WWTP which has the highest TN concentration in its effluent among all WWTPs in the study area; however, TN loads entered the point from other sources were significant during higher flow conditions. TN loads in the CLP River were simulated to determine whether the loads meet the proposed in-stream limits in a case in which all WWTPs comply with the proposed regulations for WWTPs. From this study, it was observed that reducing TN concentrations only at WWTPs merely impacts total TN loads in the river.

J	Elrashidi, MA; West, LT; Persaud, N				Elrashidi, Moustafa A.; West, Larry T.; Persaud, Naraine			Phosphorus Loss and Forms in Runoff From Watersheds in the Great Plains	SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article						NRCS technique; phosphorus release characteristics; CN runoff equation; phosphorus and sediment loading	AGRICULTURAL PHOSPHORUS; SOIL; MANAGEMENT; QUALITY	Increasing P loss from soils caused by runoff has contributed to contamination of surface waters in the Great Plains. Knowledge of P forms in runoff is necessary to develop appropriate land management practices and reduce the impact of P on water resources. A 2-year study was conducted on the Roca watershed, located in Lancaster County, Nebraska. This watershed is part of the Great Salt Creek watershed, which is considered a representative of watersheds in the Northern Great Plains. The objectives were to apply the Natural Resources Conservation Service technique to (i) estimate P loss from soils by runoff, (ii) determine P forms in the runoff, and (iii) estimate P loading and impact on water quality in Salt Creek. The annual loss of P by runoff was estimated at 17.7 tons for 2009 and 22.1 tons for 2010. These losses could be considered as the annual P loadings into Salt Creek. The predicted average dissolved P concentration in the runoff was 532 and 464 mu g/L during 2009 and 2010, respectively. Most of the P measured in Salt Creek during the 2-year study was in the dissolved reactive (DRP) form (79%), and the remaining P was associated with suspended sediment, mainly in unreactive form (UP). The observed average DRP in stream water was 462 and 454 mu g/L for 2009 and 2010, respectively. For each year, the predicted DRP was within 1 S. D. of the observed value. The data supported the applicability of the Natural Resources Conservation Service technique to estimate soil P losses and the impact on surface waters in the Great Plains.

J	Grossmann, M				Grossmann, Malte			Economic value of the nutrient retention function of restored floodplain wetlands in the Elbe River basin	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Ecosystem services; Economic valuation; Floodplain wetlands; Cost minimisation model; Nutrient management	PHOSPHORUS; COST; SYSTEMS; SWEDEN	This paper presents an application of an indirect method, the alternative or replacement cost method to value a regulatory ecosystem service: the retention of river nutrient loads by floodplain wetlands. The paper presents a cost-minimisation model for nutrient abatement measures for the River Elbe. The model is applied to estimate the shadow price of phosphate and nitrogen nutrient retention services by restored floodplains. It is shown that the shadow price of restored floodplain area is a function of the nutrient load reduction target for the river basin. The scope of the floodplain restoration projects is shown to have a lesser impact on the estimated shadow price. In addition, this paper presents an empirical cost function for the costs of floodplain restoration measures in the Elbe Basin. In conjunction with the shadow prices, this allows for a rapid strategic assessment of the costs and benefits of 45 potential restoration sites along the Elbe trajectory. In spite of the large investment costs for dike realignments, the nutrient retention effects alone may in many cases generate sufficient benefits to generate an economic efficiency gain. Floodplain restoration may therefore, under advantageous circumstances, constitute a cost effective nutrient abatement measure. However the key thrust of the argument is that floodplain restoration projects have to be assessed as multifunctional projects, with the positive impacts on water quality being one of several benefit dimensions.

However, differences in management recommendations and manure application guidelines for similar field conditions among state P Indices, coupled with minimal reductions in the extent of P-impaired surface waters and soil test P (STP) levels, led the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) to revise the 590 Nutrient Management Standard. In preparation for this revision, NRCS requested that a review of the scientific underpinnings and accuracy of current P Indices be undertaken. They also sought to standardize the interpretation and management implications of P Indices, including establishment of ratings above which P applications should be curtailed. Although some states have initiated STP thresholds above which no application of P is allowed, STP alone cannot define a site's risk of P loss. Phosphorus Indices are intended to account for all of the major factors leading to P loss. A rigorous evaluation of P Indices is needed to determine if they are directionally and magnitudinally correct. Although use of observed P loss data under various management scenarios is ideal, such data are spatially and temporally limited. Alternatively, the use of a locally validated water quality model that has been shown to provide accurate estimates of P loss may be the most expedient option to conduct Index assessments in the short time required by the newly revised 590 Standard.

J	Vadas, PA; Joern, BC; Moore, PA				Vadas, Peter A.; Joern, Brad C.; Moore, Philip A., Jr.			Simulating Soil Phosphorus Dynamics for a Phosphorus Loss Quantification Tool	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							POULTRY LITTER; CORN PRODUCTION; FEEDLOT MANURE; PIG MANURE; NO-TILL; RUNOFF; MODEL; SYSTEMS; STRATIFICATION; FERTILIZATION	Pollution of fresh waters by agricultural phosphorus (P) is a water quality concern. Because soils can contribute significantly to P loss in runoff; it is important to assess how management affects soil P status over time, which is often done with models. Our objective was to describe and validate soil P dynamics in the Annual P Loss Estimator (APLE) model. APLE is a user-friendly spreadsheet model, that simulates P loss in runoff and soil P dynamics over 10 yr for a given set of runoff, erosion, and management conditions. For soil P dynamics, APLE simulates two layers in the topsoil, each with three inorganic P pools and one organic P pool. It simulates P additions to soil from manure and fertilizer, distribution among pools, mixing between layers due to tillage and bioturbation, leaching between and out of layers, crop P removal, and loss by surface runoff and erosion. We used soil P data from 25 published studies to validate APLE's soil P processes. Our results show that APLE reliably simulated soil P dynamics for a wide range of soil properties, soil depths, P application sources and rates, durations, soil P contents, and management, practices. We validated APLE specifically for situations where soil P was increasing from excessive P inputs, where soil P was decreasing. due to greater outputs than inputs, and where soil P stratification; occurred in no-till and pasture soils. Successful simulations demonstrate APLE's potential to be applied to major management scenarios related to soil P loss in runoff and erosion.

Using a palaeolimnological approach in shallow lakes, we quantified the species richness responses of diatoms and Cladocera to phosphorus enrichment. We also examined differences in species richness responses between littoral and pelagic assemblages of our focal communities. To address both spatial and temporal relationships, our study includes an analysis of both surface sediments from 40 lakes and of a lake sediment record spanning c. 120 years. The objective of our study was to determine whether similar species richness patterns occurred across trophic levels, as well as along spatial and temporal gradients. 2. We found that both diatom and Cladocera species richness estimates significantly declined with increasing phosphorus across space and through time. When the assemblages were subdivided according to known habitat preferences, littoral biodiversity maintained a negative trend, whereas pelagic species richness tended to show no relationship with phosphorus. 3. Negative productivitydiversity patterns have been observed across almost all palaeolimnological studies that span large productivity gradients. This congruence in patterns is most likely due to the similarity in data collection methods and in focal communities studied. The contrasting responses between littoral and pelagic assemblages may be explained by the differences in physical habitat and the pool of taxa in each of these environments. Consistent with the literature, we found statistical support for the idea that littoral diversity declines could be explained by an interaction between macrophytes and nutrients along strong trophic gradients. The general lack of a diversity response in our pelagic assemblages could be attributable to the limited pool of subfossil taxa. The response of the pelagic diatom could also be related to their broad range of nutrient tolerances. 4. The observed negative response of species richness to phosphorus enrichment, particularly in the littoral assemblages, has implications for ecosystems functioning because communities with reduced biodiversity often are less resilient to anthropogenic change.

The field-measured data were used to calibrate the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM), and the results were summarized in a special issue of Geoderma (Abuja and Hatfield 2007). With a comprehensive, long-term measured dataset and a model that simulates many of the components of the agricultural system, one can begin to understand the effects of management practices on N loading, crop yields, and net income to the farmers. Other researchers can use this dataset to assess the effects of management on similar tile-drained systems occurring some distance from Nashua, under alternative climates and soils, with other management systems, or with simulation models using different process representations. By integrating the understanding developed at Nashua with datasets from other highly monitored sites and other sources, progress can be made in addressing problems related to excessive N fluxes in the Mississippi Basin. An example 30-year RZWQM simulation of 18 management systems implies that significant management changes are needed to meet the goal of reducing N loads to the Gulf of Mexico by 45%.

Development and validation of the Texas Best Management Practice Evaluation Tool (TBET)	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						conservation practice; modeling; nitrogen; nonpoint source pollution; phosphorus; Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT); water quality	WATER-QUALITY IMPACTS; NUTRIENT LOSSES; PHOSPHORUS; RUNOFF; MODEL; SEDIMENT; LITTER; CROPLAND; CULTURE; SITES	Conservation planners need simple yet accurate tools to predict sediment and nutrient losses from agricultural fields to guide conservation practice implementation and increase cost-effectiveness. The Texas Best Management Practice Evaluation Tool (TBET), which serves as an input/output interpreter and vastly simplified interface for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), was developed to predict mean annual runoff, sediment, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) losses from agricultural fields in Texas under a variety of management scenarios and conservation practices. The Texas Best Management Practice Evaluation Tool was developed to provide a scientific basis for decision making, evaluation, and reporting in state and federal conservation programs. A rigorous, data-intensive calibration and validation process was employed in TBET development. First, hydrology outputs were calibrated with basin scale streamflow data from 20 US Geological Survey sites. Then, runoff, sediment, total N, and total P outputs were calibrated and validated with measured field scale data (260+ site years). Even without calibration, TBET was able to make "good" to "very good" predictions of mean annual runoff and total P losses according to commonly applied model evaluation methods. Calibrated TBET predictions of sediment and total N losses were not as accurate but were still "satisfactory." These much-improved results relative to those of often applied tools such as P Indices are very encouraging since the design goals of simple operation and accurate predictions for diverse Texas conditions with only readily available inputs were certainly met. Thus, TBET meets an important need by providing accurate, science-based estimates of conservation practice benefits at the field scale.	[White, M. W.; Harmel, R. D.; Haney, R.

Review of best management practice reduction efficiencies in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						agriculture; best management practice; nutrient; reduction efficiency	AGRICULTURAL DRAINAGE; NUTRIENT LOSSES; WATER-QUALITY; NITROGEN; PHOSPHORUS; RUNOFF; WETLANDS; RETENTION; NITRATE; SOIL	Agricultural best management practices (BMPs) can help reduce nutrient and sediment concentrations and loads leaving farm fields, which in turn can reduce negative impacts on downstream aquatic systems. For nearly three decades, significant federal investment in technical and financial assistance has been provided to implement farm BMPs. Of the conservation programs, only a few attempt to estimate the amount of nutrient and sediment reduction resulting from cost-shared practices, let alone potential positive effect on local or regional water quality. The current study provides a review of the scientific literature to determine nutrient reduction efficiency percentages for BMPs in row-crop agriculture within the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley (LMAV), an area with high delivery of both nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to the Gulf of Mexico. The review consisted of multiple agricultural and biological database searches, a BMP effectiveness tool, and outreach to scientists. Only 18 articles (9 BMPs) provided BMP efficiencies that met specific criteria of (a) row-crop agriculture, (b) clay/silt loam soils, (c) slopes of 0% to 5%, and (d) occurrence within the LMAV. Best management practices included tillage management, wetlands, winter rice field management, subsurface drainage, and vegetated drainage ditches. The majority of the nine key BMPs for the LMAV provided significant nutrient reductions ranging from 15% to 100%. For seven BMPs that had total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TT) reduction efficiencies, the range was between 17% and 76%. Given the limited availability of BMP efficiency estimates within this physiographic region, these estimates should be used with caution. Significant resources should be committed to conducting replicable studies in the LMAV to provide the most reliable estimates possible of BMP effectiveness under a wide-range of realistic cropping, hydrological, and weather. conditions in order to inform program and policy development and analysis.

Suspended particles are also the main optically active substances for ocean color remote sensing. It is important to study the surface reflectance spectra features of coastal turbid water, as it can be the basis for establishing more accurate remote-sensing inversion models. In this study, Hangzhou Bay, China, was selected as the study area. Two in situ measurement and sampling stations in the estuary of the Qiantang River which flows into Hangzhou Bay were set up separately. Above-water spectrum observation method, which the NASA recommended, was adopted to measure the reflection spectrum of turbid waters. Surface water samples were simultaneously collected to obtain the corresponding SSC data. The results showed that the total suspended particle concentrations in the Hangzhou Bay were typically high, and the inorganic suspended particle concentrations were far greater than the phytoplankton concentrations, which averages 705 mg/L and 1.16 mg/m(3). The SSC at two sampling stations both showed significant temporal variability, particularly appearing short-period rapid fluctuations accompanying the tidal cycle. The measured surface water reflectance spectra all showed typical curve characteristics of high turbid water, and as the SSC increased, the corresponding reflectivity of surface water also increased. The increments at different wavelengths were variational, with two reflectance peaks appearing at 650-700-nm and near the 800-nm wavelength of spectral curves, respectively. The first derivative of spectral curves showed that the first reflectance peak location appeared to be a "red shift" phenomenon with the SSC increasing. The correlation coefficients between the SSC of surface water and the remote-sensing reflectance according to moderate resolution imaging spectra-radiometer (MODIS) channels' central wavelength were different significantly, which were larger at MODIS long-wavelength channels (> 650 nm) and smaller at MODIS short-wavelength channels (400-550 nm). The value of determination coefficient R-2 was 0.82 when the reflectance ratio of MODIS band 2 to band 1 was selected as the SSC sensitive bands combination and exponential regression analysis was employed. Therefore, the reflectance ratio of MODIS band 2 to band 1 can be adopted as the main band combination for establishing surface water SSC remote-sensing inversion model in the Hangzhou Bay.

Using the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer to characterise temporal and spatial trends in water temperature of large European lakes	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Lake surface temperature; NOAA AVHRR; European lakes; Accuracy assessment; Climate change; Water Framework Directive	NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; SEA-SURFACE SKIN; PLANKTON DYNAMICS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; THERMAL STRUCTURE; VALIDATION; AIR; PHYTOPLANKTON; RETRIEVAL	Lakes are major repositories of biodiversity, provide multiple ecosystem services and are widely recognised as key indicators of environmental change. However, studies of lake response to drivers of change at a pan-European scale are exceptionally rare. The need for such studies has been given renewed impetus by concerns over environmental change and because of international policies, such as the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), which impose legal obligations to monitor the condition of European lakes towards sustainable systems with good ecological status. This has highlighted the need for methods that can be widely applied across large spatial and temporal scales and produce comparable results. Remote sensing promises much in terms of information provision, but the spatial transferability and temporal repeatability of methods and relationships observed at individual or regional case studies remains unproven at the continental scale. This study demonstrates that NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) thermal data are capable of producing highly accurate (R-2>0.9) lake surface temperature (LST) estimates in lakes with variable hydromorphological characteristics and contrasting thermal regimes. Validation of the approach using archived AVHRR thermal data for Lake Geneva produced observations that were consistent with field data for equivalent time periods. This approach provides the basis for generalizing temporal and spatial trends in European lake surface temperature over several decades and confirms the potential of the full 30 year NOAA AVHRR archive to can provide AVHRR-derived LST estimates to help inform European policies on lake water quality.

Using delta N-15 in Fish Larvae as an Indicator of Watershed Sources of Anthropogenic Nitrogen: Response at Multiple Spatial Scales	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article						Nitrogen stable isotopes; Eutrophication; Monitoring; Sewage waste water; Great Lakes	STABLE-ISOTOPES; FOOD; INPUTS; SIGNATURES; PATTERNS; CARBON; LAKES; DIET; N-15; MACROALGAE	There is growing interest in applying delta N-15 in biota as an indicator of anthropogenic nutrient inputs to coastal environments because changes in delta N-15 correlate to inputs of land-based nutrients. In complex coastal receiving waters, however, land-use effects on biota delta N-15 may be masked by local hydrologic processes, especially exchange with coastal waters of different geochemical character. We examined delta N-15 differences among larval fish, a novel biotic indicator, in coastal receiving waters at both among and within watershed scales. Our goal was to characterize how hydrologic processes within coastal river mouths and embayments mediate the effect of land-based N sources on larval fish delta N-15. We sampled three Lake Superior river-embayment systems from watersheds that span a large population density gradient. Over all stations, mean fish delta N-15 ranged from 2.7 aEuro degrees to 10.8 aEuro degrees. Within each system, we found a different pattern in delta N-15 across the river-lake transition zone. Correlations between fish delta N-15 and water quality, particularly NH (4) (+) and total nitrogen, were highly significant and corresponded to known differences in sewage waste water inputs. A multivariate model that included both watershed-based population density and NH (4) (+) was found to provide the best fit to the delta N-15 data among a series of multi- and univariate candidate models. These results demonstrate that: (1) fish larvae delta N-15 responded at within watershed scales, and (2) within coastal receiving waters, fish larvae delta N-15 was related to waste water inputs at the watershed scale; however, expression at specific locations within a coastal system was strongly influenced by local hydrologic processes.

Topographic placement of management practices in riparian zones to reduce water quality impacts from pastures	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY			English	Article						Agriculture; Best management practice; Flow path; Pasture; Pennsylvania; Spatial resolution; Watershed	DIGITAL ELEVATION MODELS; SOURCE-POLLUTION-CONTROL; AGRICULTURAL WATERSHEDS; PRECISION CONSERVATION; PHOSPHORUS LOSS; OVERLAND-FLOW; BMP PLACEMENT; BUFFERS; AREAS; FARM	Riparian buffers, a best management practice (BMP), lessen environmental impacts caused by pasture-based agriculture by excluding livestock from streams and removing sediment and nutrients from overland flow before they enter the watercourse. Geospatial data analysis of digital elevation models (DEMs) can improve BMP placement by ensuring that BMPs intercept flow paths. Livestock heavy use areas and riparian buffers within 100 m of the stream were digitized using aerial photography of Spring Creek watershed (Pennsylvania, USA). Flow path lengths and stream entry points from heavy use areas, from all agricultural land uses, and from a random sample of points were calculated using 1, 10, and 30 m DEM resolutions. Euclidean distances identified the nearest stream entry point regardless of topography. Drainage areas for each streambank cell were evaluated using each DEM resolution. Topographic calculations differed significantly from Euclidean, with median differences of 14.3 m for flow path length and 24.1 m between stream entry points for the 10 m DEM. Existing buffers intercepted runoff from only 23 % of heavy use areas. Drainage areas ranged from one to hundreds of DEM cells. Any DEM is an arbitrary representation of a continuous surface; both resolution and processing method affect the suitability of such a representation for any given purpose. We found that 30 m DEMs did not provide reasonable flow path estimates at the scale of grazing agriculture in this region, while Pennsylvania 1 m DEMs were minimally smoothed during DEM preparation, resulting in erratic flow paths. The 10 m DEMs were the most suitable available DEM product, and should be used in conjunction with site visits for planning pasture BMP placement.

SPATIAL RELATIONS OF TOPOGRAPHY, LITHOLOGY AND WATER QUALITY IN A LARGE RIVER FLOODPLAIN	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						floodplain; ecosystem services; nutrients; denitrification; geophysics; co-kriging	NITRATE REMOVAL; NUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS; DENITRIFICATION; DYNAMICS; NITROGEN; GROUNDWATER; ZONE; PHOSPHORUS; VEGETATION; INTERFACE	Floodplains exert important controls on water and nutrient processing, yet spatial heterogeneities in floodplain characteristics result in variable effectiveness. In this study, we evaluated the spatial relations among topographic, lithologic and water quality features within the Cedar River floodplain located in southeastern Iowa. Floodplain topography and lithology were dominated by a series of sandy ridges and fine-textured swales typical of a natural meandering river floodplain complex. Groundwater sampling results from 10 monitoring wells placed in representative ridge and swale environments indicated that water quality varied systematically. Beneath sand-dominated ridges, water was aerobic and had low specific conductance, and higher concentration of NO3N and lower concentrations of PO4P and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Groundwater beneath swales was anaerobic and typified by high specific conductance, and higher concentrations of NH4N, PO4P and DOC. We extrapolated the results from point measurements to the entire floodplain area using surface geophysics and light detection and ranging using co-kriging to map the distribution of groundwater geochemical environments at the study site. Results are seen to provide an approach to better predict shallow groundwater quality in large river floodplains and improve our ability to manage ecosystem services in these strategic locations.

Both increased corn growth for ethanol production and perennial dedicated energy crop growth for cellulosic feedstocks are potential sources to meet the rising demand for biofuels. However, these measures may cause adverse environmental consequences that are not yet fully understood. This study 1) evaluates the long-term impacts of increased frequency of corn in the crop rotation system on water quantity and quality as well as soil fertility in the James River Basin and 2) identifies potential grasslands for cultivating bioenergy crops (e.g. switchgrass), estimating the water quality impacts. We selected the soil and water assessment tool, a physically based multidisciplinary model, as the modeling approach to simulate a series of biofuel production scenarios involving crop rotation and land cover changes. The model simulations with different crop rotation scenarios indicate that decreases in water yield and soil nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration along with an increase in NO3-N load to stream water could justify serious concerns regarding increased corn rotations in this basin. Simulations with land cover change scenarios helped us spatially classify the grasslands in terms of biomass productivity and nitrogen loads, and we further derived the relationship of biomass production targets and the resulting nitrogen loads against switchgrass planting acreages. The suggested economically efficient (planting acreage) and environmentally friendly (water quality) planting locations and acreages can be a valuable guide for cultivating switchgrass in this basin. This information, along with the projected environmental costs (i.e. reduced water yield and increased nitrogen load), can contribute to decision support tools for land managers to seek the sustainability of biofuel development in this region.

Bioretention cell efficacy in cold climates: Part 2-water quality performance	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						bioretention; urban runoff; water quality; cold weather; long-term effects	STORM WATER RUNOFF; FIELD PERFORMANCE; REMOVAL; IMPROVEMENT; HYDROLOGY; SNOWMELT; SYSTEMS; MEDIA	Field and column experiments were conducted to test the ability of bioretention cells to improve urban runoff quality. The effects of cold climate conditions, media depth, long-term operation, and extreme loading were analyzed. Field experiments demonstrated significant decrease in contaminant mass, which was a function of the large runoff volume capture. Significant decreases in concentration for sediment (96%), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD, 8%), and total phosphorus (0.6%) were noted. Long-term simulation experiments demonstrated a decrease in effluent concentration over time, suggesting a dependence on media chemistry. Sediment and BOD capture remained high throughout the testing period. Media depth did not impact performance in laboratory experiments. Extreme loading experiments proved that the effluent concentration of contaminants was independent of the influent concentration. Cold climate conditions did not have a significant impact on performance in both field and column experiments.	[Khan, U.

J	Mewes, M				Mewes, Melanie			Diffuse nutrient reduction in the German Baltic Sea catchment: Cost-effectiveness analysis of water protection measures	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Baltic Sea; Cost-effectiveness; Land use; Diffuse nutrient inputs; Nutrient abatement measures	NITROGEN; PERSPECTIVE; RESOURCE; STATE	Water quality of groundwater, rivers, and seas is still negatively influenced by high diffuse nitrogen and phosphorus discharge. Increasing importance is attached to cost-effectiveness to indicate sufficient measures to reduce nutrient input of land use. The aim of this paper is to find cost-effective solutions for diffuse nutrient load reductions for the German Baltic Sea region (by formulating scenarios for a 25% and 50% reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus). I combined nutrient emission and land use modelling (literature analyses, MONERIS-data) with economic land use analysis (e.g. opportunity costs, costs of the production methods) in a cost-effectiveness analysis. The results show that total reduction costs need not be as expensive as often anticipated (e.g. 25% simultaneous reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus costs about 8-20(sic)(ha y)(-1)). Advisory service turned out as the most cost-effective measure and the most important indicator for the cost-saving potential. The measure included guidelines to the farmers on land use and water quality optimization. For example, if a 100% advisory service is successful, total costs for a 25% simultaneous reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus could drop by 65%, corresponding to 23 million (sic)y(-1) compared to a 50% advisory service. Due to a lack of data, I could not consider the additional nutrient retention capacity of wetlands and buffer strips in the analysis. The policy recommendations derived from this study deliver insights for the strategic orientation of water protection policy and useful indicators to measure the performance. The results are of interest not only in the Baltic Sea context, but also for supporting and facilitating the application of the cost-effectiveness analysis postulated in the Water Framework Directive. Future research should concentrate on improving data availability (e.g. livestock husbandry) and models and on implementing further transaction costs and additional indicators like nutrient retention of wetlands.

Optimizing the environmental performance of agricultural activities: A case study in La Boulouze watershed	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Environmental performance; Farming systems; SWAT; Goal programming; Spatial optimization; Watershed	GOAL PROGRAMMING-MODEL; FARMING SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT; FIRMS; INDICATORS; SUSTAINABILITY; AGGREGATION; FRAMEWORK; ECONOMICS; EVALUATE	This paper introduces a method to optimize the environmental performance (EP) of agricultural activities, defined as the distance between the 'environmental' state of a system at a specific time or on a specific period and a 'high environmental performance' state to reach. Focus is on water management at the watershed level with three criteria: nitrogen, sediments (water quality) and water yields (water quantity). The purpose is to provide a new land-use plan. The originality of the method lies in the coupling between an agro-hydrological model, the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT), and the goal programming (GP) optimization method. Modeling is used to define the initial situation of the system and to generate data for the optimization. Goal programming is implemented to relocate farming systems in the watershed using a binary decision variable. The method is implemented on the La Boulouze watershed (South West of France). The results are an improvement of the EP, but the 'high environmental state' is not reached. The main land uses changes are the decrease of the sunflower-wheat farming system in favor of the meadows.

J	Gopalakrishnan, G; Negri, MC; Salas, W				Gopalakrishnan, Gayathri; Negri, Maria Cristina; Salas, William			Modeling biogeochemical impacts of bioenergy buffers with perennial grasses for a row-crop field in Illinois	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY			English	Article						bioenergy crops; biogeochemical modeling; buffers; DNDC; nitrogen cycle; sustainability	N2O EMISSIONS; DNDC MODEL; NITROGEN; BIOFUELS; OXIDE; LAND; SOIL; WATER; AGROECOSYSTEMS; VALIDATION	Current research on the environmental sustainability of bioenergy has largely focused on the potential of bioenergy crops to sequester carbon and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and possible impacts on water quality and quantity. A key assumption in these studies is that bioenergy crops will be grown in a manner similar to current agricultural crops such as corn and hence would affect the environment similarly. In this study, we investigate an alternative cropping system where bioenergy crops are grown in buffer strips adjacent to current agricultural crops such that nutrients present in runoff and leachate from the traditional row-crops are reused by the bioenergy crops (switchgrass, miscanthus and native prairie grasses) in the buffer strips, thus providing environmental services and meeting economic needs of farmers. The process-based biogeochemical model Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) was used to simulate crop yield, nitrous oxide production and nitrate concentrations in leachate for a typical agricultural field in Illinois. Model parameters have been developed for the first time for miscanthus and switchgrass in DNDC. Results from model simulations indicated that growing bioenergy crops in buffer strips mitigated nutrient runoff, reduced nitrate concentrations in leachate by 60-70% and resulted in a reduction of 50-90% in nitrous oxide emissions compared with traditional cropping systems. While all the bioenergy crop buffers had significant positive environmental benefits, switchgrass performed the best with respect to minimizing nutrient runoff and nitrous oxide emissions, while miscanthus had the highest yield. Overall, our model results indicated that the bioenergy crops grown in these buffer strips achieved yields that are comparable to those obtained for traditional agricultural systems while simultaneously providing environmental services and could be used to design sustainable agricultural landscapes.

The objective of this study was to determine the factors governing the spatial distribution of P. rubescens, including the major hydrodynamic processes and the influence of long-term reduction in nutrient concentrations during a period of climate warming. We used an intensive field campaign conducted from February 2010 to January 2011, to evaluate distributions of phytoplankton phyla, as well as P. rubescens, using spectrally resolved fluorescence measurements. These data provided highly spatially and temporally resolved phytoplankton population data suitable to calibrate and validate a coupled three-dimensional hydrodynamic (ELCOM) and ecological model (CAEDYM) of the lake ecosystem. The simulations revealed the fundamental role of physiological features of P. rubescens that led to observed vertical patterns of distribution, notably a deep chlorophyll maximum, and a strong influence of lake hydrodynamic processes, particularly during high-discharge inflows in summer stratification. The simulations are used to examine growth-limiting factors that help to explain the increased prevalence of P. rubescens during re-oligotrophication.

J	Zhang, WW; Li, H; Sun, DF; Zhou, LD				Zhang, Weiwei; Li, Hong; Sun, Danfeng; Zhou, Liandi			A Statistical Assessment of the Impact of Agricultural Land Use Intensity on Regional Surface Water Quality at Multiple Scales	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						agricultural land use intensity; water quality; multi-scale; linear regression	NONPOINT-SOURCE POLLUTION; RIVER-BASIN; MANAGEMENT; CATCHMENT; COVER; AREA; GIS	Understanding the effects of intensive agricultural land use activities on water resources is essential for natural resource management and environmental improvement. In this paper, multi-scale nested watersheds were delineated and the relationships between two representative water quality indexes and agricultural land use intensity were assessed and quantified for the year 2000 using multi-scale regression analysis. The results show that the log-transformed nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) index exhibited a relationship with chemical fertilizer input intensity and several natural factors, including soil loss, rainfall and sunlight at the first order watershed scale, while permanganate index (CODMn) had a positive relationship with another two input intensities of pesticides and agricultural plastic mulch and organic manure at the fifth order watershed scale. The first order watershed and the fifth order watershed were considered as the watershed adaptive response units for NO3-N and CODMn, respectively. The adjustment of agricultural input and its intensity may be carried out inside the individual watershed adaptive response unit. The multiple linear regression model demonstrated the cause-and-effect relationship between agricultural land use intensity and stream water quality at multiple scales, which is an important factor for the maintenance of stream water quality.

Evaluation of Phosphorus Indices after Twenty Years of Science and Development	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							RISK-ASSESSMENT; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; ASSESSMENT-TOOL; NORTH-CAROLINA; FIELD-SCALE; MANAGEMENT; LOSSES; RUNOFF; EUTROPHICATION; STATES	The P Index was proposed as a nutrient management tool in 1992 and has been implemented as such for the past decade. However, lack of water quality improvement in agricultural watersheds and discrepancies in P loss ratings between P indices have raised questions about continued use of the P Index. In response to these concerns, a symposium was held as part of the 2011 ASA, CSSA, SSSA annual meetings. This symposium produced a special collection of seven papers describing the role of P indices in P management, evaluation of P indices, new models for assessing P loss, methods to improve P indices, and changes in producer behavior resulting from P Index use. The objectives of this introductory paper are to provide background on the P Index concept, overviews of the special collection papers, and recommendations for future P Index evaluation and development research. The papers in this special collection conclude that P indices can provide accurate assessments of P loss but must be evaluated appropriately. Evaluation will require compiling large regional P loss datasets at field and small watershed scales. Simulation models may be used to generate P loss estimates; however, models must be calibrated and validated to ensure their accuracy. Further development of P indices will require coordinated regional efforts to identify common P Index frameworks and standardized interpretations. Stringent P Index evaluations will expand the utility of P indices for critical source area identification and strategic best management practice implementation by regulatory, education, and scientific communities alike.

Based on the simulation and field sampling experiments in Baiyangdian Lake, the largest shallow lake in North China, this study proposed a shallow lake remediation regime with Phragmites australis (reed) incorporating its opposite effects of nutrient removal and water evapotranspiration on water quality. The results of simulation experiments showed that both total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) removal efficiencies increased with the increasing reed coverage. The TN removal efficiencies by reed aboveground uptake and rhizosphere denitrification were 11.2%, 13.8%, 22.6%, 28.4%, and 29.6% for the reed coverage of 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%, respectively. Correspondingly, TP removal efficiencies by aboveground reed uptake were 1.4%, 2.5%, 4.4%, 7.4% and 7.9%, respectively. However, the water quality was best when the reed coverage was 60% (72 plants m(-2)). This was due to the fact that the concentration effect of reed evapotranspiration on nutrient increased with reed coverage. When the reed coverage was 100% (120 plants m(-2)), the evapotranspiration was approximately twice that without reeds. The field sampling results showed that the highest aboveground nutrient storages occurred in September. Thus, the proposed remediation regime for Baiyangdian Lake was that the reed coverage should be adjusted to 60%, and the aboveground biomass of reeds should be harvested in each September. with this remediation regime, TN and TP removal in Baiyangdian Lake were 117.8 and 4.0 g m(-2), respectively, and the corresponding removal efficiencies were estimated to be 49% and 8.5% after six years. This study suggests that reed is an effective plant for the remediation of shallow lake eutrophication, and its contrasting effects of nutrient removal and evapotranspiration on water quality should be considered for establishing the remediation regime in the future.

Three complementary methods for sensitivity analysis of a water quality model	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Review						Hydrological modelling; Water quality; One-at-A-Time; Morris Method; Monte Carlo; Regional sensitivity analysis	GLOBAL SENSITIVITY; UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS; UNGAUGED CATCHMENTS; PARAMETERS; IDENTIFICATION; PHOSPHORUS; SIMULATION; STREAMFLOW; TRANSPORT; BEHAVIOR	In this paper, sensitivity analysis (SA) has been used to assess model sensitivities to input parameter values in a water quality model. The water quality model incorporates a rainfall-runoff sub-model and a sediment load estimation sub-model, and is calibrated against hydrologic and water quality data from the Moruya River catchment in southeast Australia. The tested methods, One-at-A-Time (OAT), Morris Method (MM) and Regional SA (RSA) are found to be complementary, and help to characterise the behaviour of the water quality model. The most important parameters are plant stress threshold (f), coefficient of evapotranspiration (e), catchment moisture threshold (d), in decreasing order, indicating that sediment and nutrient loads are more sensitive to parameters that affect the magnitude of flows than those (v(s), tau(q), tau(s)) that control the timing and shape of the peak in a time series. But this application shows a need to be flexible in the use of different SA techniques. RSA is more appropriate for complex models where system nonlinearities and parameter interactions are more likely to be important. The RSA suggests that f and v(s) have strong interactions in the influence on nitrogen estimation. This study is also valuable for future uncertainty analysis, by separating the source of uncertainty of model parameters from the uncertainty in the model inputs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Sources of nutrients impacting surface waters in Florida: A review	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Review						Florida; Nutrients; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Waterways; Water reuse; Wastewater; Atmospheric deposition; Fertilizer; Surface runoff; Septic; Onsite wastewater treatment systems	WASTE-WATER; NITRATE CONTAMINATION; ARTIFICIAL RECHARGE; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; PHARMACEUTICALS; BORON; RIVER; FATE; FERTILIZERS	The promulgation of numeric nutrient criteria for evaluating impairment of waterbodies in Florida is underway. Adherence to the water quality standards needed to meet these criteria will potentially require substantial allocations of public and private resources in order to better control nutrient (i.e., nitrogen and phosphorus) releases from contributing sources. Major sources of nutrients include atmospheric deposition (195-380 mg-N/m(2)/yr, 6 to 16 mg-P/m(2)/yr), reclaimed water irrigation (0.13-29 mg-N/L, 0.02 to 6 mg-P/L), septic systems (3.3 x 10(3)-6.68 x 10(3) g-N/person/yr, 0.49 x 10(3)-0.85 x 10(3) g-P/person/yr) and fertilizer applications (8 x 10(6)-24 x 10(6) mg-N/m(2)/yr). Estimated nitrogen loadings to the Florida environment, as calculated from the above rates are as follows: 5.9 x 10(9)-9.4 X 10(9) g-N/yr from atmospheric deposition, 1.2 x 10(8)-2.6 x 10(10) g-N/yr from reclaimed water, 2.4 x 10(10)-4.9 x 10(10) g-N/year from septic systems, and 1.4 x 10(11) g-N/yr from fertilizer application. Similarly, source specific phosphorus loading calculations are also presented in this paper. A fraction of those nutrient inputs may reach receiving waterbodies depending upon site specific regulation on nutrient control, nutrient management practices, and environmental attenuation. In Florida, the interconnectivity of hydrologic pathways due to the karst landscape and high volumes of rainfall add to the complexity of tracking nutrient loads back to their sources. In addition to source specific nutrient loadings, this review discusses the merits of source specific markers such as elemental isotopes (boron, nitrogen, oxygen, strontium, uranium and carbon) and trace organic compounds (sucralose, gadolinium anomaly, carbamazepine, and galaxolide) in relating nutrient loads back to sources of origin. Although this review is focused in Florida, the development of source specific markers as a tool for tracing nutrient loadings back to sources of origin is applicable and of value to all other geographical locations.

J	Hutchins, MG				Hutchins, Michael G.			What impact might mitigation of diffuse nitrate pollution have on river water quality in a rural catchment?	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Nitrate; Phytoplankton; River water quality; Catchment modelling; Pollution mitigation; Policy	AGRICULTURAL LAND; FERTILIZER NITROGEN; MODEL DEVELOPMENT; UK; LOSSES; SIMULATION; DENITRIFICATION; UNCERTAINTY; COMPLEXITY; YORKSHIRE	Observations of river flow, river quality and solar radiation were collated to assess the degree to which light and nutrients may be limiting phytoplankton growth at seven sites in the River Ouse catchment in NE England under average conditions. Hydraulic information derived from river network model applications was then used to determine where river water has sufficient residence time above the tidal limit to facilitate bloom development. A nitrate model (NALTRACES) was developed to estimate the impact of land management change on mean river nitrate concentrations. Applications of this model showed that although agricultural activity contributes substantially to nitrate loads in the Ouse it is likely to have little impact on phytoplankton growth, which could still occur extensively in its absence given favourable sunny and dry conditions. As an example of a means of controlling light availability, establishing full riparian nee cover would appear to be a considerably more effective management scenario than suppressing inputs to the river of nitrate or phosphorus. Any actions should be prioritised in headwater areas such as the upper reaches of the Swale and Ure tributaries. These conclusions are in broad agreement with those arising from more detailed simulations at daily resolution using the QUESTOR river quality model. The combination of simple modelling approaches applied here allows an initial identification of suitable spatially-targeted options for mitigating against phytoplankton blooms which can be applied more widely at a regional or national level.

Watershed reliability, resilience and vulnerability analysis under uncertainty using water quality data	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Risk assessment; Watershed health; Reliability; Resilience; Vulnerability; Uncertainty; Water quality	RISK; IMPAIRMENT; CRITERIA; SYSTEM; RIVER; MODEL	A method for assessment of watershed health is developed by employing measures of reliability, resilience and vulnerability (R R V) using stream water quality data. Observed water quality data are usually sparse, so that a water quality time-series is often reconstructed using surrogate variables (streamflow). A Bayesian algorithm based on relevance vector machine (RVM) was employed to quantify the error in the reconstructed series, and a probabilistic assessment of watershed status was conducted based on established thresholds for various constituents. As an application example, observed water quality data for several constituents at different monitoring points within the Cedar Creek watershed in north-east Indiana (USA) were utilized. Considering uncertainty in the data for the period 2002-2007, the R R V analysis revealed that the Cedar Creek watershed tends to be in compliance with respect to selected pesticides, ammonia and total phosphorus. However, the watershed was found to be prone to violations of sediment standards. Ignoring uncertainty in the water quality time-series led to misleading results especially in the case of sediments.

Examination of residence time and its relevance to water quality within a coastal mega-structure: The Palm Jumeirah Lagoon	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Residence time scales; Semi-enclosed system; Numerical simulation; Tracer; Coastal development	TIDAL CIRCULATION; ESTUARIES; PHYTOPLANKTON; BATHYMETRY; SHALLOW; MODEL; GULF; SEA	A numerical modeling study was carried out to compute average residence time in the semi-enclosed lagoon formed by the man-made island Palm Jumeirah (Dubai, United Arab Emirates), termed Palm Jumeirah Lagoon (PJL). The PJL encompasses a main island axis with 17 'fronds' radiating from this axis, all encapsulated within a semi-circular breakwater system. A coupled hydrodynamic and solute transport model was developed for the waters of the PJL, based on depth-integrated conservation equations. Numerical model predictions were then verified against a set of field-measured hydrodynamic data. Model-predicted water elevations and velocities were in good agreement with field measurements. Residence times for this tidal dominated system were investigated through numerical experiments using a conservative tracer as a surrogate. The results indicated that average residence time varied spatially throughout the PJL depending on tidal flushing. Average residence time was unequally distributed throughout the PJL, with the eastern side showing higher flushing times than the western side. In addition, there were also differences between sections of the PJL in average residence time of a tracer: between frond tips and the surrounding breakwater the tracer was reduced to 30-40% of its original value after approximately 1 week, while a tracer placed between the fronds was reduced to 30-40% of its value after 20 days. The findings of this research provide vital information for understanding the water transport process in this man-made lagoon, and will be important in assessing the potential impact on coastal water quality conditions in coastal developments within the Middle East.

J	Hartnett, M; Nash, S; Olbert, I				Hartnett, M.; Nash, S.; Olbert, I.			An integrated approach to trophic assessment of coastal waters incorporating measurement, modelling and water quality classification	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						integrated trophic assessment; modelling; monitoring; water quality; classification; remote sensing	PHYTOPLANKTON; METHODOLOGY; BIOMASS; SYSTEMS	Various protocols have been developed for trophic assessment of coastal waters but most incorporate single value compliance criteria for water quality parameters which, in reality, exhibit significant spatial variation. Application of these protocols generally requires the averaging of data recorded at discrete locations to obtain single values for comparison with compliance criteria; however, there is no guarantee that the averaged values are truly representative of overall water quality. The present approach to trophic assessment integrates measurement, remote sensing, flushing analysis and water quality modelling with the aim of identifying sub-regions in coastal waterbodies that demonstrate homogeneity. Averaged water quality data for these homogenous sub-regions should be more representative of the water quality in the sub-region as a whole making the assessment process more accurate. The integrated approach incorporates water quality classification criteria developed by the Irish Environmental Protection Agency but it can incorporate any suitable classification criteria. The approach was validated for a sub-region of Cork Harbour, Ireland and the trophic assessments agreed with previous assessments by the Irish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The approach has significant applications in the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive and was adopted by the Irish EPA in convincing the EU to provide the Irish government with structural funds for water quality management within Cork Harbour.

Simulation-based inexact chance-constrained nonlinear programming for eutrophication management in the Xiangxi Bay of Three Gorges Reservoir	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						The Xiangxi Bay; Eutrophication management; Chance-constrained programming; Uncertainty	WATER-QUALITY MANAGEMENT; FUZZY OPTIMIZATION; PHOSPHORUS MODELS; LAKE; STRATEGIES; OXYGEN; ALLOCATION; BUDGET	Although integrated simulation and optimization approaches under stochastic uncertainty have been applied to eutrophication management problems, few studies are reported in eutrophication control planning where multiple formats of uncertainties and nonlinearities are addressed in forms of intervals and probabilistic distributions within an integrated framework. Since the impounding of Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), China in 2003, the hydraulic conditions and aquatic environment of the Xiangxi Bay (XXB) have changed significantly. The resulting emergence of eutrophication and algal blooms leads to its deteriorated water quality. The XXB becomes an ideal case study area. Thus, a simulation-based inexact chance-constrained nonlinear programming (SICNP) model is developed and applied to eutrophication control planning in the XXB of the TGR under uncertainties. In the SICNP, the wastewater treatment costs for removing total phosphorus (TP) are set as the objective function; effluent discharge standards, stream water quality standards and eutrophication control standards are considered in the constraints; a steady-state simulation model for phosphorus transport and fate is embedded in the environmental standards constraints; the interval programming and chance-constrained approaches are integrated to provide interval decision variables but also the associated risk levels in violating the system constraints. The model results indicate that changes in the violating level (q) will result in different strategy distributions at spatial and temporal scales; the optimal value of cost objective is from [2.74, 13.41] million RMB to [2.25, 13.08] million RMB when q equals from 0.01 to 0.25; the required TP treatment efficiency for the Baisha plant is the most stringent, which is followed by the Xiakou Town and the Zhaojun Town, while the requirement for the Pingyikou cement plant is the least stringent. The model results are useful for making optimal policies on eutrophication control planning and water quality improvement in the XXB. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Huang, Y.

Modeling the potential benefits of catch-crop introduction in fodder crop rotations in a Western Europe landscape	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Catch-crop; Agro-hydrological distributed model; Nitrogen mass balance; Stream water quality	AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES; WATER-QUALITY; COVER CROPS; NITROGEN BALANCES; GENERIC MODEL; STICS MODEL; NITRATE; MANAGEMENT; SIMULATION; POLLUTION	Among possible mitigation options to reduce agricultural-borne nitrate fluxes to water bodies, introduction of catch crop before spring crops is acknowledged as a cost-efficient solution at the plot scale, but it was rarely assessed at the catchment level. This study aims to evaluate a set of catch crop implantation scenarios and their consequences in a coastal catchment prone to eutrophication. The objectives are (i) to discuss the potential benefits of catch crop introduction taking into account the limitations due to the physiographic and agricultural context of the area (ii) to propose a multicriteria classification of these scenarios as a basis for discussion with stakeholders. We used the distributed agro-hydrological model TNT2 to simulate 25 scenarios of catch crop management, differing in length of catch crop growing period, place in the crop rotation and residue management. The scenarios were classified considering the variations in main crop yields and either nitrogen fluxes in stream or the global nitrogen mass balance at the catchment level. The simulations showed that in the catchment studied, little improvement can be expected from increasing the catch crop surface. Catch crop cultivation was always beneficial to reduce nitrogen losses, but led to adverse effects on main crop yields in some cases. Among the scenarios involving additional catch crop surface, introducing catch crop between two winter cereals appeared as the most promising. The classification of scenarios depended on the chosen criteria: when considering only the reduction of nitrogen fluxes in streams, exporting catch crop residues was the most efficient while when considering the global nitrogen mass balance, soil incorporation of catch crop residues was the most beneficial. This work highlights the interest, while using integrated models, of assessing simulated scenarios with multicriteria approach to provide stakeholder with a picture as complete as possible of the consequences of prospective policies.

HIGH-TEMPERATURE; MODELS; ECOSYSTEMS; AGREEMENT; NITROGEN; BIOMASS; GROWTH	Support vector machines (SVMs) methods were used to predict distribution pattern of Azolla filiculoides (Lam.) which is an invasive aquatic fern at Selkeh Wildlife Refuge located in Anzali wetland (southern Caspian Sea, northern Iran). Various structural habitat and physico-chemical variables were used as inputs and 3 classes (low, medium and high) of cover percentage of Azolla were served as output for the models. SVMs were applied using Weka Platt's sequential minimal optimisation (SMO). For training and validation of the given method, a 4-fold cross-validation was used to get a reliable estimate of model error. Some parameter settings in the Weka toolbox were tuned such as the effect of the complexity parameter (C) and the degree of the exponent in a polynomial kernel. To obtain optimal results in predictive performances, the SVMs were optimised based on the application of different exponents from one to ten. The model with the best-performing exponent was run five times after model randomisation. This was mainly done in order to check robustness and reproducibility of SVMs. Model quality was assessed using percentage of correctly classified instances (CCI %) and Cohen's kappa statistics (k). The prediction of species distribution by SVMs resulted in reliable outcomes (CCI > 77% and k > 0.67). SVMs provided quantitative correlations between the distribution pattern of this water fern and wetland characteristics. Almost all structural habitat variables (except freezing days) played a key role in assessing the occurrence of Azolla and were more important than the water quality parameters. The depth of wetland and dissolved oxygen were the two most important explanatory variables in the study area.

P limitation was observed at sites across a transect of stream orders throughout the basin; however, at the two sites with highest ambient nitrogen concentrations, limitation was often coupled with nitrogen limitation. Nutrients were at nonlimiting levels at both of two sites below wastewater treatment plants in all seasonal deployments. A Michaelis-Menten growth equation described LETSI as a function of ambient PO4-P concentrations (p < 0.05); the midpoint (LETSI of 0.50) corresponded with a PO4-P concentration of approximately 3 mu g/l. Change-point analysis indicated a threshold point at LETSI of 0.80 and 15 mu g/l PO4-P. These low values show that the periphytic community has a high affinity for available P, and that the watershed as a whole is sensitive to available nutrient inputs.

EFFECTS OF LAWN MAINTENANCE ON NUTRIENT LOSSES VIA OVERLAND FLOW DURING NATURAL RAINFALL EVENTS	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						lawns; runoff monitoring; developed areas; nutrients; residential; throughfall	PERENNIAL RYEGRASS TURFS; SIMULATED RAINFALL; KENTUCKY BLUEGRASS; CREEPING BENTGRASS; INFILTRATION RATES; POLLUTANT EXPORT; WATER-QUALITY; NITROGEN; RUNOFF; TURFGRASS	A sampling system was used to evaluate the effect of residential lawn management on nutrient losses via overland flow generated during natural rainfall events from three residential landscapes: a high maintenance fescue lawn (HMFL), a low maintenance fescue lawn (LMFL), and a mixed forested residential landscape (FRL). A sampling system was located in designated areas within each landscape such that 100% of the runoff follows natural flow paths to the outlet ports and collects in sterile Nalgene (R) B-3 media bags (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rochester, NY). A rainfall event was defined as producing >= 2.54 mm of water. A total of 87 rainfall events occurred during a 20-month monitoring period. The total runoff volume collected from the LMFL was higher than from the HMFL and FRL, but on average < 1% of the total rainfall was collected from the three landscapes. Mean nitrate concentrations from each lawn did not exceed 0.6 mg N/l. Nutrient unit area losses from the HMFL, LMFL, and FRL were 1,000 times less than fertilizer and throughfall inputs, which were due to the presence of well-structured soils (low bulk densities) with high infiltration rates. This study demonstrated that the frequency of runoff, total runoff volumes, and nutrient losses during natural rainfall events are lower from highly maintained (i.e., irrigation, fertilizer application, and reseeding) densely uniform manicured lawns than low maintenance lawns and forested residential landscapes.

MODELED SUMMER BACKGROUND CONCENTRATION OF NUTRIENTS AND SUSPENDED SEDIMENT IN THE MID-CONTINENT (USA) GREAT RIVERS	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Mississippi River; Missouri River; Ohio River; total nitrogen; total phosphorus; total suspended solids; nutrients; chlorophyll a; criteria; land use; reference condition	UPPER MISSISSIPPI; TROPHIC STATE; DISTRIBUTIONS; CHLOROPHYLL; WATERSHEDS; MISSOURI; NITROGEN; CRITERIA	We used regression models to predict summer background concentration of total nitrogen (N), total phosphorus (P), and total suspended solids (TSS), in the mid-continent great rivers: the Upper Mississippi, the Lower Missouri, and the Ohio. From multiple linear regressions of water quality indicators with land use and other stressor variables, we determined the concentration of the indicators when the predictor variables were all set to zero - the y-intercept. Except for total P on the Upper Mississippi River, we could predict background concentration using regression models. Predicted background concentration of total N was about the same on the Upper Mississippi and Lower Missouri Rivers (430 mu g l(-1)), which was lower than percentile-based values, but was similar to concentrations derived from the response of sestonic chlorophyll a to great river total N concentration. Background concentration of total P on the Lower Missouri (65 mu g l(-1)) was also lower than published and percentile-based concentrations. Background TSS concentration was higher on the Lower Missouri (40 mg l(-1)) than the other rivers. Background TSS concentration on the Upper Mississippi (16 mg l(-1)) was below a threshold (30 mg l(-1)) designed to protect aquatic vegetation. Our model-predicted concentrations for the great rivers are an attempt to estimate background concentrations for water quality indicators independent from thresholds based on percentiles or derived from stressor-response relationships.

J	Chiueh, PT; Shang, WT; Lo, SL				Chiueh, Pei-Te; Shang, Wei-Ting; Lo, Shang-Lien			An Integrated Risk Management Model for Source Water Protection Areas	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						risk assessment; source water protection area; quantitative risk; qualitative; risk land use	QUALITY; CANADA; PHOSPHORUS; TRENDS	Watersheds are recognized as the most effective management unit for the protection of water resources. For surface water supplies that use water from upstream watersheds, evaluating threats to water quality and implementing a watershed management plan are crucial for the maintenance of drinking water safe for humans. The aim of this article is to establish a risk assessment model that provides basic information for identifying critical pollutants and areas at high risk for degraded water quality. In this study, a quantitative risk model that uses hazard quotients for each water quality parameter was combined with a qualitative risk model that uses the relative risk level of potential pollution events in order to characterize the current condition and potential risk of watersheds providing drinking water. In a case study of Taipei Source Water Area in northern Taiwan, total coliforms and total phosphorus were the top two pollutants of concern. Intensive tea-growing and recreational activities around the riparian zone may contribute the greatest pollution to the watershed. Our risk assessment tool may be enhanced by developing, recording, and updating information on pollution sources in the water supply watersheds. Moreover, management authorities could use the resultant information to create watershed risk management plans.

The same parameter vectors can result in suboptimal calibration. In the present paper, a data-driven model based on an artificial neural network is developed to inverse the values of model parameters dynamically. All training data used are calculated using numerical water quality models from the results of multi-parameter matching design cases such that physical properties are not disturbed. The aim is to determine the relationship between the model parameters and the pollution concentration values of interior stations. Field data are used in the analysis of the relationship for inversing optimal parameters. The temporal and spatial variations of sensitive parameters are considered using four inversion methods, namely, temporal-spatial, spatial, temporal and non-temporal, and non-spatial, to enhance the model accuracy. In water quality models, an integrated element method is simultaneously applied using grids for spatial variation. Case studies in the Bohai Sea, China, and an identical experiment using dissolved inorganic nitrogen are conducted to validate the aforementioned methods. The average maximum of absolute error is reduced from 0.0435 to 0.00756, with a reduction rate of 82.62%. The results show that the temporal-spatial inversion method improves the accuracy of the water quality model.

Modeling the effects of conservation practices on stream health	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Macroinvertebrates; Soil and Water Assessment Tool; Biological integrity; Best management practices	FISH ASSEMBLAGE RELATIONSHIPS; ALTERED FLOW REGIMES; BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATES; NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT; HABITAT; MANAGEMENT; RESPONSES; IMPLEMENTATION; PREDICTION; KNOWLEDGE	Anthropogenic activities such as agricultural practices can have large effects on the ecological components and overall health of stream ecosystems. Therefore, having a better understanding of those effects and relationships allows for better design of mitigating strategies. The objectives of this study were to identify influential stream variables that correlate with macroinvertebrate indices using biophysical and statistical models. The models developed were later used to evaluate the impact of three agricultural management practices on stream integrity. Our study began with the development of a high-resolution watershed model for the Saginaw River watershed in Michigan for generating in-stream water quality and quantity data at stream reaches with biological sampling data. These in-stream data were then used to explain macroinvertebrate measures of stream health including family index of biological integrity (FamilyIBI), Hilsenhoff biotic index (HBI), and the number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa (EPTtaxa). Two methods (stepwise linear regression and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS)) were evaluated for developing predictive models for macroinvertebrate measures. The ANFIS method performed the best on average and the final models displayed the highest R-2 and lowest mean squared error (MSE) for FamilyIBI (R-2=0.50, MSE=29.80), HBI (R-2=0.57, MSE=0.20), and EPTtaxa (R-2=0.54, MSE=6.60). Results suggest that nutrient concentrations have the strongest influence on all three macroinvertebrate measures. Consistently, average annual organic nitrogen showed the most significant association with EPTtaxa and HBI. Meanwhile, the best model for FamilyIBI included average annual ammonium and average seasonal organic phosphorus. The ANFIS models were then used in conjunction with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool to forecast and assess the potential effects of different best management practices (no-till, residual management, and native grass) on stream integrity. Based on the model predictions, native grass resulted in the largest improvement for all macroinvertebrate measures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These approaches often assume hydrological connectivity as a driver for environmental risk, however this assumption has rarely been tested. Using high resolution monitoring, 14 rainfall events of contrasting intensity were examined in detail for spatial and temporal dynamics of overland flow generation at a hydrologically isolated grassland hillslope in Co. Down, Northern Ireland. Interactions between overland flow connectivity and nutrient transfers were studied to test the critical source area hypothesis. While total and soluble phosphorus loads were found to be representative of the size of the overland flow contributing area (P = <0.05), the dynamics of concentrations throughout storm hydrographs were found to be complex and storm dependant. Near linear relationships were observed between the contributing area and total overland flow volumes (R-2 = 0.86). Export coefficients (kg ha(-1)) calculated using plot size were found to under estimate annual losses of total phosphorus by a factor of 17, when compared to those calculated using the contributing area. This study shows that current critical source area definitions for implementing mitigation measures may be overlooking the importance of storm characteristics in determining nutrient transfers and hence may be insufficient in determining catchment scale risk.

Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) conducted on spring dataset showed that water temperature, color, and river morphology were primary factors shaping the structure of algal assemblages during the spring post-flood period. CCA on summer and autumn dataset revealed that conductivity and total phosphorus were the most important variables during the base flow period. Cluster analysis carried out on algal assemblages separated all rivers into two main groups that corresponded to the two geomorphological regions of the Lake Ladoga basin: the northern and the southern sub-basins. The separation of the northern and the southern groups were best explained by the pattern of conductivity reflecting geological and land use differences in the watersheds. The values of the Specific Pollution sensitivity Index (IPS) and the Biological Diatom Index (IBD) were higher, indicating better water quality, for rivers of the northern sub-basin than for rivers of the southern sub-basin.

Spatial and temporal variations of assemblages were studied in 12 sites of three rivers. Kibos, Nyando, and Kisat rivers contained 224 diatom taxa collected on seven sampling occasions over 4 years. Species richness showed a marginal decrease downstream and was the lowest at sites with high conductivity and ammonia-nitrogen levels. Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis revealed two major groups of river sites. Conductivity, alkalinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and silicate were the most important variables influencing species distribution. Ecological diatom metrics of temperate regions and the Specific Pollution sensitivity Index showed good relationships with environmental variables. Both diatom assemblages and averaged indicator values were strong in predicting sites of ecological deterioration and in differentiating an upstream site of better quality (drinking water supply of Kisumu), thereby confirming epilithic diatoms as suitable water quality indicators in equatorial rivers. The use of metrics initially designed for temperate rivers, however, appears less valuable in good quality tropical rivers because potential indicators are not considered.

J	Li, SY; Zhang, YL; Zhang, QF				Li, Siyue; Zhang, Yulong; Zhang, Quanfa			Interaction of landscape setting and stream flow seasonality on nitrogen concentrations in a subtropical river, China	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						Han River; Nitrate-nitrogen; Ammonium-nitrogen; Land use/land cover; Landscape; Stream flow seasonality	DISSOLVED TRACE-ELEMENTS; MAJOR ION COMPOSITIONS; WATER-QUALITY; LAND-USE; ALPINE/SUBALPINE BASINS; NUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS; NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS; DANJIANGKOU RESERVOIR; CHANGJIANG RIVER; HEAVY-METALS	The upper Han River, with a drainage area of 95, 200 km(2), has a dominant vegetated land use of forests and shrubs with a total coverage of 81.3%, and agricultural lands, mostly along the riverine network, account for 14% of the total basin area. In this study, water samples were collected in 42 sites during the time period of 2005-2006 in the river, and nitrate-nitrogen and ammonium-nitrogen were determined in situ. Consequently, multivariate statistics analyses were conducted to investigate the interactive influence of landscape setting and stream flow seasonality on nitrogen concentration in river waters. In the high flow period, nitrogen concentrations (NH4+-N and NO3--N) in stream water were significantly correlated with forest coverage and bare land at the catchment level, and with respect to the riparian zones of 100, 200, 500, 1000-m width they were only significantly correlated with bare land. In the low flow period, nitrogen concentrations were respectively correlated with vegetation and bare land regardless of varying scale landscape settings, and additionally NH4+-N was significantly related to agricultural land in riparian zones of 500 and 1000-m width. Nevertheless, nitrogen could be predicted using bare land in the high flow period and in the low flow period vegetation was also a critical variable in particular for NH4+-N. Generally, nitrogen was better predictable by land use in the high flow period rather than low flow period, and land use composition within an entire catchment rather than this in the riparian zone was a better predictor of nitrogen concentrations in rivers. Thus, the interaction between landscape setting and water flow seasonality played an important role in regulating nitrogen concentrations in the subtropical river. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The primary objectives of this study were to investigate the changes in transport fluxes of nitratenitrogen with increasing movement distances and to identify the relationship between transport fluxes of nitratenitrogen and water diffusion coefficients. The results showed that the transport fluxes of nitratenitrogen were significantly and negatively correlated with movement distances in both wetlands, and decreased exponentially with increasing distances. However, the transport fluxes of nitratenitrogen increased exponentially with increasing water diffusion coefficients in both wetlands. The higher transport fluxes of nitratenitrogen in surface soils were observed compared to deeper soils, while they were higher in surface soils at the distances near the tracer water head. The findings of this study can contribute to water quality protection by regulating buffer zone width based on the horizontal movement of nitratenitrogen.

J	Udawatta, RP; Jose, S				Udawatta, Ranjith P.; Jose, Shibu			Agroforestry strategies to sequester carbon in temperate North America	AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Alley cropping; Belowground carbon; Riparian buffers; Silvopasture; Windbreaks	SOIL CARBON; INTERCROPPING SYSTEMS; NITROGEN DYNAMICS; RIPARIAN BUFFERS; SOUTHERN ONTARIO; STORAGE; SEQUESTRATION; BIOMASS; GROWTH; RESPIRATION	Information on carbon (C) sequestration potential of agroforestry practices (AP) is needed to develop economically beneficial and ecologically and environmentally sustainable agriculture management plans. The synthesis will provide a review of C sequestration opportunities for AP in temperate North America and the estimated C sequestration potential in the US. We estimated carbon sequestration potential for silvopasture, alley cropping, and windbreaks in the US as 464, 52.4, and 8.6 Tg C yr(-1), respectively. Riparian buffers could sequester an additional 4.7 Tg C yr(-1) while protecting water quality. Thus, we estimate the potential for C sequestration under various AP in the US to be 530 Tg yr(-1). The C sequestered by AP could help offset current US emission rate of 1,600 Tg C yr(-1) from burning fossil fuel (coal, oil, and gas) by 33 %. Several assumptions about the area under different AP in the US were used to estimate C sequestration potential: 76 million ha under silvopasture (25 million ha or 10 % of pasture land and 51 million ha of grazed forests), 15.4 million ha (10 % of total cropland) under alley cropping, and 1.69 million ha under riparian buffers. Despite data limitation and uncertainty of land area, these estimates indicate the important role agroforestry could play as a promising CO2 mitigation strategy in the US and temperate North America. The analysis also emphasizes the need for long-term regional C sequestration research for all AP, standardized protocols for C quantification and monitoring, inventory of AP, models to understand long-term C sequestration, and site-specific agroforestry design criteria to optimize C sequestration.

The wetlands have successfully operated in this moderately cold climate for over ten years. Phosphorus removal of 2.3 gP/(m(2) yr) was achieved, with an annual areal rate coefficient of 9.2 m/yr. The removal is strongly seasonal, with the greatest reductions occurring in spring. The total nitrogen loading was dominated by ammonia (208 gN/(m(2) yr)), with smaller amounts of organic and oxidized nitrogen. Ammonia was reduced to 173 gN/(m(2) yr). Implied areal rate constants were high for mineralization of organic nitrogen (29 m/yr) and denitrification (101 m/yr), but low for nitrification (4 m/yr). CBOD5 was reduced from 5.4 to 3.2 mg/L, and TSS was reduced from 13.2 to 7.2 mg/L., both with slightly higher values during late winter. The wetland was not effective in reducing pathogens, with Escherichia coli at 167 cfu/100 ml entering, and 132 cfu/100 ml leaving. Vegetation was sparse, likely due to muskrats and deep water. Macro-invertebrate diversity was lower than for regional wetlands. Bird use was very high, and birding was a popular human activity. The wetland has been designated as provincially significant.

To provide insights into this effect, we evaluated the spatial distribution of DP and its control factors in the Shibetsu River Catchment (SRC), eastern Hokkaido, Japan. Soil samples from August 2008 were used in the lab to determine the DP (using the acetylene inhibition method) of grassland, windbreak forest, and riparian forest soils in the SRC. Soil DP ranged from 0.001 to 64 mg N kg soil(-1) d(-1) and followed a log-normal distribution. Soil DP was highest in the surface peat soil of a low-elevation riparian forest. The land-use type and soil depth both significantly affected soil DP, with higher DP in riparian forests and surface soils. Soil DP increased with increasing soil moisture content and water-extractable soil organic carbon (WESOC). The clay, moisture, and WESOC contents in the surface soils decreased significantly with increasing elevation, resulting in increased soil DP in low-elevation riparian forests. The stream NO3- concentration was significantly correlated with the upland (grassland and cropland) proportion (%) of the catchment's area, and the ratio of stream NO3- concentration to this proportion tended to be lower in low-elevation areas, indicating higher NO3- denitrification. We conclude that low-elevation riparian forest soils have a higher DP due to the higher moisture, clay, and WESOC contents of their soils, and that these factors control riverine NO3- export in the SRC.

Nutrient losses in runoff from conventional and no-till pearl millet on pre-wetted Ultisols fertilized with broiler litter	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Water quality; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Residue; Runoff; Watering-in; No tillage	ANTECEDENT WATER-CONTENT; MANURE APPLICATION; PHOSPHORUS RUNOFF; SOIL PROPERTIES; IRRIGATION; RESIDUE; SEDIMENT; IMPACT; COVER; AMMONIUM	In the Southeastern Coastal Plain (USA) farmers with access to irrigation commonly water in herbicides following their preemergence application to improve efficacy of the herbicide. This practice increases near surface soil water content and may promote increased runoff during subsequent storm events. The objective of our study was to determine differences in P and N runoff from conventional tillage (CT) and no tillage (NT) systems when herbicides were watered into loamy sand Ultisols fertilized with broiler litter. Simulated rain with variable intensity was applied for 70 min with runoff samples collected every 5 min and analyzed for total P and N, PO43-, NH4+ and NO3-. Results indicated the no-tillage treatment lost significantly more PO43- and NH4+ than the conventional tillage treatment. However, total P and N and NO3- runoff losses were significantly less in the no-tillage treatment. The proportion of total P and N leached through NT residues was 5.6% and 22% of the P and N applied as broiler litter, and the proportion of total P and N in runoff was 0.8% and 1.2% of the P and N applied in broiler litter. Overall 3.4 times more N and 2.7 more P were lost in runoff from the CT treatments than for the NT treatments. Reduced tillage was found to reduce N and P losses when combined with watering-in of surface applied broiler litter. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Franklin, D. H.; Jenkins, M.

Historic nutrient loading and recent species invasions caused shifts in water quality and zooplankton demography in two Finger Lakes (New York, USA)	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY			English	Article						Nutrient loading; Invasive species; Finger Lakes; Productivity; Stable isotopes; Cladoceran remains	ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE CONTROLS; ORGANIC-MATTER; CERCOPAGIS-PENGOI; LACUSTRINE CARBONATE; ISOTOPIC COMPOSITION; SEDIMENTARY CARBON; SURFACE SEDIMENT; RANGE EXPANSION; FRESH-WATERS; SENECA LAKE	We investigated the paleolimnology of Owasco and Seneca Lakes (New York, USA) and compiled water-quality monitoring data to describe environmental change during the past two centuries. Trophic shifts were detected in the oligotrophic to mesotrophic range and were likely driven by nutrient loading and species invasion. Based on box core reconstructions, primary production increased in both lakes during the last century, which is evidenced by the amount, type and isotopic composition of material preserved in the sediment. Organic matter accumulation and its stable carbon isotopic composition, as well as carbonate abundance, began to increase during the 1960s in Owasco Lake and the 1850s in Seneca Lake. Further, the abundance of phytoplanktivorous cladocera subfossils increased beginning in the 1910s in Seneca Lake and in the 1960s in Owasco Lake. The different timing and magnitude of the trophic shifts likely resulted from contrasts in lake residence time and species assemblages between the two lakes. The increases in primary and secondary production paralleled, and are interpreted to reflect, increased allochthonous nutrient loading. However, nutrient loading was not detected in the water-quality data, perhaps because of strong uptake of phosphates by phytoplankton or due to limited data collection. Rapid changes in cladoceran subfossils and water quality were also detected during the last decade. Concurrent with the establishment of non-native Cercopagis pengoi (fishhook waterflea), phytoplanktivorous cladocera remains declined, and the mucrone length of Bosmina increased, consistent with predictions of increased invertebrate predation. Additionally, the post-1990 decline in sediment carbonate, increased Secchi depth and decreased chlorophyll a concentrations followed the establishment of filter-feeding Dreissena spp. (zebra and quagga mussels). Collectively, paleolimnological data and water-quality monitoring provided a more complete and consistent record of shifts in the productivity of Owasco and Seneca Lakes, which were useful to understand environmental changes over different time scales. Physical, geochemical and biological changes were temporally consistent among three cores collected from different locations in each lake, but differed in magnitude for several variables (e.g., grain size and cladoceran subfossils), which could reflect near-shore to offshore gradients.

The Impact of Extreme Low Flows on the Water Quality of the Lower Murray River and Lakes (South Australia)	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Hydrological drought; Biogeochemistry; Climate change; Salinisation; Eutrophication	CLIMATE-CHANGE; DARLING BASIN; DROUGHT; ECOSYSTEMS; PHOSPHORUS; VARIABILITY; SALINITY; NITROGEN; COORONG; STREAMS	The impact of extreme low flows on the water quality of the Lower Murray River and Lower Lakes (Alexandrina and Albert) in South Australia was assessed by comparing water quality from five sites during an extreme low flow period (March 2007-November 2009) and a preceding reference period (March 2003-November 2005). Significant increases in salinity, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a and turbidity were observed in the Lower Lakes during the low flow period. Consequently, water quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic ecosystems were greatly exceeded. Principal Component Analysis, empirical and mass balance model calculations suggested these changes could be attributed primarily to the lack of flushing resulting in concentration of dissolved and suspended material in the lakes, and increased sediment resuspension as the lakes became shallower. The river sites also showed significant but more minor salinity increases during the extreme low flow period, but nutrient and turbidity concentrations decreased. The most plausible reasons for these changes were decreased catchment inputs and increased influence of saline groundwater inputs. The results highlight the vulnerability of arid and semi-arid lake systems to reduced flow conditions as a result of climatic changes and/or water management decisions.

Economic Valuation of Ecosystem Services Provided by Oyster Reefs	BIOSCIENCE			English	Article						ecosystem services; ecosystem management; oyster reef habitat; valuation	HABITAT DEGRADATION; CONSEQUENCES; CONSERVATION; RESTORATION; SEAGRASS; HYPOXIA; PHYTOPLANKTON; COLLAPSE; SESTON; FISHES	Valuation of ecosystem services can provide evidence of the importance of sustaining and enhancing those resources and the ecosystems that provide them. Long appreciated only as a commercial source of oysters, oyster reefs are now acknowledged for the other services they provide, such as enhancing water quality and stabilizing shorelines. We develop a framework to assess the value of these services. We conservatively estimate that the economic value of oyster reef services, excluding oyster harvesting, is between $5500 and $99,000 per hectare per year and that reefs recover their median restoration costs in 2-14 years. In contrast, when oyster reefs are subjected to destructive oyster harvesting, they do not recover the costs of restoration. Shoreline stabilization is the most valuable potential service, although this value varies greatly by reef location. Quantifying the economic values of ecosystem services provides guidance about when oyster reef restoration is a good use of funds.

Alex; Maberly, Stephen C.; May, Linda			Using models to bridge the gap between land use and algal blooms: An example from the Loweswater catchment, UK	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Catchment; Modelling; Water quality; Farming; Expert opinion	WATERSHED LOADING FUNCTIONS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; PHOSPHORUS; PERSPECTIVES; MANAGEMENT; SCIENCE; POLICY	The goods and services that lakes provide result from complex interactions between meteorology, hydrology, nutrient loads and in-lake processes. Hydrology and nutrient loads are, in turn, influenced by socio-economic factors such as human habitation, water abstraction and land-management, within their catchments. Models provide a means of linking these different domains and also of forecasting and evaluating the effects of different management scenarios on lakes. This paper describes the application of such models to Loweswater, a well-studied lake with water quality problems in the English Lake District, where a community-based approach to catchment management is being undertaken. Three models were linked. Firstly, PLANET (Planning Land Applications of Nutrients for Efficiency and the environmenT), an 'off the shelf farm nutrient budgeting model, was supplemented by local information on septic tanks and used to produce an annual nutrient load to the lake. Secondly, GWLF (Generalized Watershed Loading Function), a generic nutrient runoff model, was used to generate daily nutrient runoff values using input from PLANET plus additional information on land-cover, air temperature and rainfall within the catchment. Thirdly PROTECH (Phytoplankton RespOnses To Environmental CHange), driven by input from GWLF and locally measured meteorology, was used to forecast the abundance of different algal types within the lake. The linked models were used to describe the current impact of catchment management on lake water quality, validated by in situ measurements, and to explore the potential impact of a number of alternative catchment management scenarios. Issues surrounding the use of generic modelling applications for catchment management and relevance for stakeholders living in and/or managing land within the catchment are discussed.

Application of Qual2Kw model as a tool for water quality management: Certima River as a case study	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Modelling; Qual2Kw; Nutrients; Pollution; Certima basin	NUTRIENTS	Modelling can be a useful management tool because models allow the understanding of water body response to different pollution pressure scenarios which may help on the decision-making process and in prosecuting the Water Framework Directive objectives. This study aims to evaluate the usage of simple water quality models (Qual2Kw) applied to small river basins in order to better understand the response of a river to different loads of nitrogen and phosphorus. Qual2Kw model was applied to C,rtima River (Portugal), a small river that ends in a shallow lake called Pateira Fermentelos and represents a very important ecosystem to the local community. Along its pathway, C,rtima River has a significant enrichment in nutrients due to agriculture, livestock, domestic sewage and industrial effluents discharged into the river. In case of nitrogen, the highest loads are from domestic (44%) and diffuse (35%) sources. The main sources of phosphorous are domestic (46%), livestock (24%) and diffuse sources (20%). C,rtima River is strongly enriched with nutrients, and neither nitrogen nor phosphorous is limiting the algal growth. According to the criterion of Dodds et al. (Water Res, 32(5):1455-1462, 1998), the river is classified as eutrophic. By comparing in stream measurements with Qual2Kw simulations, it can be concluded that it would be necessary to decrease the actual pollutants loads of nitrogen and phosphorous 5 and 10 times, respectively, in order to change C,rtima River classification from eutrophic to mesotrophic.

Watershed models are generally used to evaluate the effectiveness of BMP performance in improving water quality as the basis for watershed management recommendations. This study evaluates 171 management practice combinations that incorporate nutrient management, vegetated filter strips (VFS) and grazing management for their performances in improving water quality in a pasture-dominated watershed with dynamic land use changes during 1992-2007 by using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). These selected BMPs were further examined with future climate conditions (2010-2069) downscaled from three general circulation models (GCMs) for understanding how climate change may impact BMP performance. Simulation results indicate that total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) losses increase with increasing litter application rates. Alum-treated litter applications resulted in greater TN losses, and fewer TP losses than the losses from untreated poultry litter applications. For the same litter application rates, sediment and TP losses are greater for summer applications than fall and spring applications, while TN losses are greater for fall applications. Overgrazing management resulted in the greatest sediment and phosphorus losses, and VFS is the most influential management practice in reducing pollutant losses. Simulations also indicate that climate change impacts TSS losses the most, resulting in a larger magnitude of TSS losses. However, the performance of selected BMPs in reducing TN and TP losses was more stable in future climate change conditions than in the BMP performance in the historical climate condition. We recommend that selection of BMPs to reduce TSS losses should be a priority concern when multiple uses of BMPs that benefit nutrient reductions are considered in a watershed. Therefore, the BMP combination of spring litter application, optimum grazing management and filter strip with a VFS ratio of 42 could be a promising alternative for use in mitigating future climate change.

Dissolved organic matter export from a forested watershed during Hurricane Irene	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							NEW-YORK; CATSKILL MOUNTAINS; UNITED-STATES; STORM EVENTS; CARBON; TRENDS; IMPACT; FLUX; TERRESTRIAL; REACTIVITY	We incorporate high-resolution time-series data to calculate the total amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) transported during Hurricane Irene in Esopus Creek in New York (August 2011). During this 200-yr event the Esopus Creek experienced a 330-fold discharge increase and a 4-fold increase in concentration, resulting in the export of roughly 43% and 31% of its average annual DOC and DON fluxes, respectively, in just 5 days. The source of this large dissolved organic matter (DOM) flux also shifted during its course and showed an increased contribution of aromatic organic matter. We conclude that more frequent large events due to climate change will increase the export of terrigenous dissolved organic matter, and potentially impact the water quality and biogeochemistry of lakes and coastal systems. In addition, we show that the use of conventional models for extreme events lead to erroneous flux calculations, unless supported by high resolution data collected during the events.

Contaminant losses in overland flow from dairy farm laneways in southern New Zealand	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Lane; Overland flow; Dairy; Water quality; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Escherichia coli (E. coli); Sediment	NITROGEN-FERTILIZER; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; WATER-QUALITY; PHOSPHORUS; CATCHMENT; MANAGEMENT; PASTURES; EFFLUENT; SYSTEMS	Runoff from dairy farms can be an important source of stream pollutants such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), faecal bacteria and sediment. Although much recent progress has been made in understanding the role of grazed pastures as sources of these pollutants, relatively little is known about the role of nonpasture areas such as stock lanes. Here we document the concentrations and loads of N, P. sediment and Escherichia coli (E. coli) in overland flow from 7 laneways sites located on 4 dairy farms in an intensively farmed catchment in southern New Zealand. Monitoring over a 2-year period indicated that on average 23% of incident rainfall was captured as overland flow discharging from the sites. Overland flow was very enriched in nutrients and faecal bacteria, with mean concentrations similar to those found in farm dairy effluent. Concentrations were observed to be higher at sampling sites close to the milking parlour, presumably due to the greater frequency of excreta depositions in these more highly trafficked lengths of the farm laneway network. Although assessments of laneway contributions to catchment scale discharges of stream pollutants suggested this source made a relatively minor contribution when expressed on an annualised basis, laneways were predicted to be a potentially important source of stream pollutants during summer when stream flows are relatively low and temperatures are warmer. These findings show the potential impacts that laneway overland flow may have on streams if poorly-sited and/or poorly designed lanes discharge directly to streams. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Macronutrient cycles and climate change: Key science areas and an international perspective	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Macronutrient cycles; Climate change; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Carbon; Water quality modelling	NITROGEN LIMITATION; CARBON; PHOSPHORUS; DYNAMICS; FEEDBACK; STREAM; EARTH; CO2	Human activities have doubled global cycles of Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) and elevated N and P have compromised ecosystem services through the degradation of natural resources of soils, freshwaters and marine waters with a subsequent loss of biodiversity. Elevated Carbon (C) levels in the atmosphere have been linked to global warming, with positive feedback mechanisms accelerating the warming process. In order to initiate nutrient control, both national and international mitigation measures have been implemented. However, many of these initiatives focus upon a single nutrient without considering cycle interactions. A sound understanding of processes and transformations involved in the interactions of macronutrient cycles is required to avoid inadvertently enhancing effects of one nutrient, during mitigation for impacts of another. Emerging research initiatives are addressing these research gaps, with programmes in the US (USGCRP) and the UK (Macronutrient Cycles) advocating integration between scientists and stakeholders, in order to deliver results directly to policy makers. Through these programmes the scales of nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes will be quantified, and a determination made of the nature of nutrient transformations in catchments under a changing climate and perturbed carbon cycle. The consideration of connectivity between multiple macronutrient cycles will help to minimise the threats to biodiversity, ecosystem dynamics, public water supplies and human health by improved management and better focused policy.

To improve our understanding of the effects of N fertilisation on potential N leaching, N concentrations in soil water below the root zone and potential losses were investigated after N fertiliser was applied as urea at 200 kg ha(-1) of N to 7-9 year-old operational plantations at 10 sites in New Zealand. A water balance model was used to estimate soil water drainage on a daily basis. Annual drainage ranged from 70 to 1,199 mm and was closely correlated with annual rainfall. Nitrate-N, ammonium-N and organic-N concentrations in unfertilised control plots ranged between 0.03-2.26 mg L-1, 0.06-0.49 mg L-1 and 0.44-0.95 mg L-1 respectively. Fertilisation significantly increased nitrate-N concentrations at four sites but did not affect ammonium-N or organic-N concentrations. In the 2 years after fertiliser application, fertiliser increased nitrate-N leaching at eight of the 10 sites by 0-15 kg ha(-1) (average 6.4 kg ha(-1) or 3.2% of the N applied). These values underestimate total nitrate-N loss as fertiliser enhanced leaching at two sites had not ceased after 2 years. Nitrogen fertilisation caused much greater increases in nitrate-N loss at a low productivity, high rainfall site (28 kg ha(-1) of N), and a coastal sand site (90 kg ha(-1) of N). To reduce losses at such sites, fertiliser should be applied at reduced rates in multiple applications. Factors that seem to have pre-disposed sites to nitrate-N leaching following N fertilisation include a pasture land-use history, the presence of a high component of the N-fixer Ulex europaeus in the understory, and soil C/N ratios of 15 or lower. Organic-N dominated leaching at 7 of the 10 sites, consistent with the pattern observed in unpolluted old-growth southern hemisphere forests, but mineral-N dominated at three sites, two of which had a recent land-use history of fertilised pasture.

The flux of different nitrogen species from land to surface waters is estimated using an export coefficient model employing catchment soil, land use and hydroclimatic characteristics, fitted to flux estimates derived from the Harmonised Monitoring Scheme between 2001 and 2007 for 169 UK catchments. In-stream losses of DON, nitrate and ammonium were estimated using a transit time filter in the fluvial network. Comparisons of modelled land to water N flux (2125 ktonnes N yr(-1)) with estimates of N fluxes to estuarine and ocean systems at the tidal limit (791 ktonnes N yr(-1)) suggest that significant in-channel N losses occur.

Eight MERIS full-resolution Level 1b images, acquired during late spring and summer 2010, were processed using five, neural network-based processors for optically Case 2 or coastal and inland waters: FUB, C2R, Eutrophic, Boreal, and standard MERIS Level 2. Results showed that the FUB processor provided the most accurate estimates of the concentration of chlorophyll a [R-2 = 69%; mean absolute errordMAE = 7.76 mg/m(3)] and TSM (R-2 = 89%; MAE 3.93 g/m(3)). In situ CDOM absorption was most accurately estimated using the Boreal processor (R-2 = 69%; MAE 0.20 1/m). We analyzed the factors that were most influential in explaining the differences in the accuracy and found that the Secchi depth and the sampling time were the most important factors. The greatest differences between satellite-derived and in situ values of water quality indicators were in correspondence with the lowest Secchi depth, suggesting that the plume zone created by freshwater coming from the hyper-eutrophic lagoon was the most sensitive region for the validation. The evident match between in situ measurements and satellite-based estimates was observed when field measurements were acquired 1-2 h before to approximately 2-4 h after the satellite overpass. Results of this validation work confirmed that remote sensing techniques are suitable for monitoring the changes of optical constituents in Lithuanian coastal waters.

In this regard, rather than picking the single "best-fit" model to predict future system responses, we can use Bayesian model averaging to synthesize the forecasts from different models. Does the combination of several models of different complexity improve our capacity to synthesize different perceptions of the ecosystem functioning and therefore the value of the modelling enterprise in the context of ecosystem management? Our study addresses this question using a complex (14 state-variable) eutrophication model along with a simpler modelling construct that considers the interplay among phosphate, detritus. and generic phytoplankton and zooplankton state variables. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate the relative mean standard error to assess the posterior support of the two models after considering the available data from the system. Predictions from the two models are then combined using the respective standard error estimates as weights in a weighted model average. The model averaging approach is used to examine the robustness of predictive statements made from our earlier work regarding the response of Hamilton Harbour (Ontario, Canada) to the different nutrient loading reduction strategies. In particular, we consolidate the finding that the existing total phosphorus goal (<17 mu g L-1) is most likely unattainable, and therefore we identify the most achievable ambient target under the most stringent (but realistic) nutrient loading reduction scenario. Finally, the discrepancy between the chlorophyll a predictions of the two models pinpoint the need to delve into the dynamics of phosphorus in the sediment-water column interface, as the internal nutrient loading can conceivably be a regulatory factor of the duration of the transient phase and the recovery resilience of the system.

Investigating the Sensitivity of U.S. Streamflow and Water Quality to Climate Change: U.S. EPA Global Change Research Program's 20 Watersheds Project	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Climate change; Water quality; Watershed modeling; Scenarios; Policy and management decision support	CARBON-DIOXIDE; CHANGE IMPACTS; EPIC MODEL; CATCHMENT; ELEVATION; RESPONSES; CO2	The U.S. EPA's Global Change Research Program (GCRP) recently began an effort to address gaps in the current knowledge of the sensitivity of U.S. streamflow, nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus), and sediment loading to potential future climate change, and the methodological challenges associated with integrating existing tools (e.g., climate models, land-use models, watershed models) and data sets to address these scientific questions. The study is based on watershed modeling in 20 large U.S. watersheds. The purpose of this paper is to describe the overall structure of this ongoing effort-methods, sites, models, and scenarios-and discuss preliminary results generated to date for a subset of the watersheds. Specifically, a representative set of modeling results are reviewed that encompass the full suite of sensitivity tests explored in this project. These results illustrate a number of key methodological issues, sensitivities, and uncertainties associated with carrying out these types of climate change/hydrologic impacts assessments, including: the sensitivity of simulated changes to the watershed model used; the sensitivity of simulated changes to climate model and downscaling approach used; and the interaction between climate change and other key forcing factors, specifically urbanization and change in atmospheric CO2 concentration. In addition, this suite of results provides an overview of the response to climate change in different geographic regions and the different sensitivities of a variety of flow and water quality end points.

J	Kovalova, N; Medinets, V				Kovalova, Nataliia; Medinets, Volodymyr			Comprehensive Assessment of Long-Term Changes of the Black Sea Surface Waters Quality in the Zmiinyi Island Area	TURKISH JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article						TRIX; Total N; total P; chlorophyll "a"; dissolved oxygen	ECOSYSTEM	On the basis of chlorophyll "a", dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations measurements values of the Trophic index TRIX for 2004-2010 in the Zmiinyi Island area in the Black Sea were calculated. Inter-annual dynamics of the Trophic index TRIX is analysed. It has been shown that TRIX index in the Zmiinyi Island area varied in wide range between 3.1 and 6.9 that corresponded to the trophicity categories from low to very high. Results of TRIX seasonal dynamics analysis showed that minimal monthly average values were most often found during winter and summer period and maximal in spring and autumn and were connected with intensity of river discharge. Modelling of TRIX for 1988-2003 is presented. Comparison with the results of other Black Sea researchers has shown that sea water quality near the Zmiinyi Island is much higher than in the other coastal areas of the Black Sea. It has been proposed to use the marine research station "Zmiinyi Island" as a background one for estimation of quality of marine waters in the western part of the Black Sea.

Naturally acidic waterways: conceptual food webs for better management and understanding of ecological functioning	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS			English	Review						stream; river; naturally acidic; catchment management; biodiversity; water quality; invertebrates; fish; phytoplankton; acidification; urban development	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; HUMIC LAKE; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LITTORAL-ZONE; 20 STREAMS; LOW PH; MATTER; ACIDIFICATION; CONSERVATION	Naturally acidic fresh waters have high conservation value, with their habitats supporting a high level of biodiversity as well as providing for rare organisms that are specially adapted to life in low-pH environments. Food webs within naturally acidic waterways are heavily reliant on the input of large amounts of organic matter from the surrounding terrestrial environment. Although these systems are found worldwide, the increasing threats of global climate change and urban developments are placing naturally acidic environments under threat of catastrophic changes to their ecology. Despite this, studies of these unique systems remain in their infancy, especially when compared with systems acidified by anthropogenic means. This paper aims to explore the varying influences on key food-web elements in naturally acidic waterways, particularly with regard to allochthonous organic matter (AOM). A conceptual model for the food webs of naturally acidic environments is presented, with the aim of providing a framework to understand the ecological functioning of these under-studied systems. This information will be critical in informing management decisions as naturally acidic streams are challenged by increasing environmental pressures. The possibility that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) can buffer organisms in naturally acidic environments against the toxicity caused by low pH is also explored.

SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE AND SUBIRRIGATION EFFECTS ON WATER QUALITY IN SOUTHEAST NORTH DAKOTA	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						Nutrient; Salinity; Subirrigation; Subsurface drainage; Water quality	TILE-DRAINAGE; MANAGEMENT; TABLE; SOIL; LOSSES; IMPACT	Rising water tables, increased soil salinity, and poor trafficability have prompted rapid expansion of subsurface drainage in the Red River Valley of the North in eastern North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota. A conventional subsullace drainage (CD) and subirrigation (SI) field study was conducted in southeast North Dakota from 2008 to 2010 to investigate drainage and subirrigation effects on water quality Water samples were collected biweekly from a sump pump structure (used as the water inlet and outlet) and 16 observation wells within the field. Water quality variables included chloride (Cl-), electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) sodium (Na+), orthophosphate (PO4-P), ammonium (NH4-N), nitrite and nitrate (NOx-N), Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and total nitrogen (TN). A three-factor partially nested design and a general linear model with random effects were employed to compare the effects of water management treatment, distance to drain, and well locations (soil heterogeneity) on water quality. The most significant water quality difference was found at the outlet structure, where a significant difference (p < 0.001) between the CD and SI water was found for all ten variables. The water quality of the drainage water was better than the subirrigation water from the aquifer; except for the NOx-N, EC, and TDS concentrations. Well water Cl- concentrations inside the field were significantly greater in SI compared with CD water: EC, TDS, SAR, and Na+ were not. In contrast, EC, TDS, SAR, and Na+ were significantly higher at two well locations, indicating that soil heterogeneity affected the water quality Due to SI practice, a significant difference for Cl-, SAR, and Na+ was found between the locations closest to and farthest from the drains during the SI practice, which implies that the SI process may cause soil properties to change in the future. Overall, well locations significantly affected PO4-P, NOx-N, and TN, indicating that the soil physical and chemical properties affected the water quality, and these effects could overcome the difference due to different water treatments.

Evaluation of model-based control strategy based on generated setpoint schedules for NH4-N removal in a pilot-scale A(2)/O process	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article						Model-based control strategy; ANN; Modified ASM3+Bio-P model; Scenario simulation; Setpoint schedules	ACTIVATED-SLUDGE PROCESS; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; DISSOLVED-OXYGEN CONTROL; WATER TREATMENT PROCESS; PREDICTIVE CONTROL; NITROGEN REMOVAL; OPERATING COSTS; TREATMENT-PLANT; SIMULATION; IDENTIFICATION	This paper proposes a model-based control strategy that can predict the influent and effluent as well as control the effluent water quality in the A(2)/O (Anaerobic/Anoxic/Oxic) process for 1 day in advance. In the model-based control strategy, ANN (Artificial neural network) and modified ASM3+Bio-P model were used to predict the influent and effluent for 1 day in advance, respectively. When the predicted effluent NH4-N concentration was higher than the target value, the optimal setpoint schedules of the DO (Dissolved oxygen) could be deduced using a scenario simulation. The scenario simulation was carried out to obtain DO setpoint schedules to reach the effluent NH4-N concentration under the target value. The deduced optimal setpoint schedules were used to control the operation of the process for the next day. The results of model prediction showed that the behavior of the influent and effluent could be predicted successfully. The proposed model-based control strategy was tested in a pilot-scale A(2)/O process for 2 weeks, which confirmed that the effluent NH4-N concentration could be maintained steadily lower than the target value of 5 mg/L. The air flow rate during control period was increased by 9% of that during without control period. On the other hand, their corresponding average effluent NH4-N concentrations were 4.42 and 13.89 mg/L, respectively, which highlight the significant effect of this control strategy with only a slight increase in air flow rate. These results show that the developed model-based control strategy can be used successfully in the A(2)/O process and possibly other processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Kim, H.

In the present article, recent progress in ion-exclusion/ion-exchange chromatography for the simultaneous determinations of inorganic anions and cations are reviewed. Firstly, the principle and the control for the simultaneous separation and detection of analyte ions using ion-exclusion/cation-exchange chromatography with a weakly acidic cation-exchange column are outlined. Then, advanced chromatographic techniques in terms of analytical time, selectively and sensitivity are summarized. As a related method, ion-exclusion/anion-exchange chromatography with an anion-exchange column could be used for the simultaneous determination of inorganic nitrogen species, such as ammonium, nitrite and nitrate ions. Their usefulness and applications to water-quality monitoring and related techniques are also described.

The environmental indicators of coastal phytoplankton biomass were determined and monitoring data for the bay from 2008 was used to train, test and build a three-layer BP artificial neural network with multi-input and single-output. Ten water quality parameters were used to forecast phytoplankton biomass (measured as chlorophyll-a concentration). Correlation coefficient between biomass values predicted by the model and those observed was 0.964, whilst the average relative error of the network was -3.46% and average absolute error was 10.53%. The model thus has high level of accuracy and is suitable for analysis of the influence of aquatic environmental factors on phytoplankton biomass. A global sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the influence of different environmental indicators on phytoplankton biomass. Indicators were classified according to the sensitivity of response and its risk degree. The results indicate that the parameters most relevant to phytoplankton biomass are estuary-related and include pH, sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, chemical oxygen demand and ammonium.

J	Sadgrove, NJ				Sadgrove, Nicholas John			A 'Cold-Case' Review of Historic Aboriginal and European-Australian Encounters with Toxic Blooms of Cyanobacteria	ECOHEALTH			English	Review						cyanobacteria; eutrophication; Australian explorers; Waugal; Nyungar; holistic environmentalism	CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; NITROGEN; BARCOO	Interest in preserving the cultural knowledge of Aboriginal Australians continues to rise. Various studies have erupted which aim to redefine knowledge that was once lost or obscured in writing and hitherto ignored. Recognising and acknowledging the traditional Aboriginal knowledge of the Australian environment helps to strengthen Aboriginal identity and gives credibility to the rising paradigm of ecotechnology in historic pre-European Australia. This review aims to establish knowledge of a traditional awareness of factors leading towards eutrophication in water resource management. Journals from pioneering explorers were examined for evidence of cyanobacterial blooms and examples of Aboriginal water resource management practices that aimed at avoiding health threats from poor water quality. Some cultural practices, focused on water resource management, are discussed with brief mentioned of the Waugal. It is concluded that in some cases the incorporation of scientific laws into mythology is a form of conceptual modelling compatible with science if examined carefully.

J	Shyu, GS; Cheng, BY; Fang, WT				Shyu, Guey-Shin; Cheng, Bai-You; Fang, Wei-Ta			The Effect of Developing a Tunnel across a Highway on the Water Quality in an Upstream Reservoir Watershed Area-A Case Study of the Hsuehshan Tunnel in Taiwan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						reservoir water quality; Hsuehshan Tunnel; phosphorus; non-point sources pollution	LAND-USE CHANGE; FEITSUI-RESERVOIR; EUTROPHICATION; MANAGEMENT; PHOSPHORUS; MODELS; IMPACT	Cities in Taiwan are so dependent on reservoir water that preservation of the upstream reservoir watershed has become a significant public concern. However, due to the high-density development of land, resulting in rapid urban expansion, the construction of tunnels and elevated highways across reservoirs to better utilize the surrounding land has become a global trend. Based on data from long-term observation of the reservoir, this study verifies the difference in water quality before and after the highway construction. The results indicate that the total phosphorus (TP) increased on average 14 mu g/L to 36.5 mu g/L per annum, and the water quality is expected to require 10 years to recover. During the highway development, the average TP was more than twice the normal level. During summer, the TP level increases 3.1-fold due to rainfall. As indicated by the results, the large-scale land development will harm the long-term preservation of the reservoir's water quality, and therefore should be avoided.

Risk of Phosphorus Desorption from Canadian Agricultural Land: 25-Year Temporal Trend	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							RELATING SOIL-PHOSPHORUS; WATER CONTAMINATION; RUNOFF PHOSPHORUS; CALCAREOUS SOILS; SURFACE WATERS; ARABLE SOILS; ACID; SATURATION; INDEXES; QUEBEC	Phosphorus (P) use in excess of crop needs may impact surface water quality and contribute to eutrophication. However, P loss from agricultural land to water has never been estimated at the Canadian national scale. In this paper, the risk of P desorption from Canadian agricultural land is assessed by the source component of the indicator of risk of water contamination by P (IROWC-P). The IROWC-P source component (P_source) characterized the mobilization potential of soluble P and integrated four models of P desorption by water for dominant agricultural soil series of Canada on the soil landscape of Canada polygon scale (1: 1,000,000). The objective of our study was to describe and evaluate a standardized method for deriving the P_source component. The P_source was assessed over 5-yr intervals from 1981 to 2006 for scientifically based knowledge by relating annual P balance values, soil test P (STP) analyses, soil P saturation index, and Self-Davis water extractable P extraction values. Results show trends of soil P enrichment for most Canadian provinces over the 25-yr period but also an increased percentage of farmland classified above the water extractable soil P environmental threshold of 4 mg P kg(-1). The Canadian Prairies and Ontario showed small P_source values and almost no farmland above the environmental threshold. Quebec and the Atlantic Provinces had P_source values that exceeded the environmental threshold in 2006; more than 33% of farmland is classified above the environmental threshold value.

Relations between Retired Agricultural Land, Water Quality, and Aquatic-Community Health, Minnesota River Basin	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							SCALE APPROACH; RIPARIAN; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; ZONE	The relative importance of agricultural land retirement on water quality and aquatic-community health was investigated in the Minnesota River Basin. Eighty-two sites, with drainage areas ranging from 4.3 to 2200 km(2), were examined for nutrient concentrations, measures of aquatic-community health (e. g., fish index of biotic integrity [IBI] scores), and environmental factors (e. g., drainage area and amount of agricultural land retirement). The relation of proximity of agricultural land retirement to the stream was determined by calculating the land retirement percent in various riparian zones. Spearman's rho results indicated that IBI score was not correlated to the percentage of agricultural land retirement at the basin scale (p = 0.070); however, IBI score was correlated to retired land percentage in the 50- to 400-m riparian zones surrounding the streams (p < 0.05), indicating that riparian agricultural land retirement may have more influence on aquatic-community health than does agricultural land retirement in upland areas. Multivariate analysis of covariance and analysis of covariance models indicated that other environmental factors (such as drainage area and lacustrine and palustrine features) commonly were correlated to aquatic-community health measures, as were in-stream factors (standard deviation of water depth and substrate type). These results indicate that although agricultural land retirement is significantly related to fish communities as measured by the IBI scores, a combination of basin, riparian, and in-stream factors act together to influence IBI scores.

J	Sen, S; Srivastava, P; Vadas, PA; Kalin, L				Sen, Sumit; Srivastava, Puneet; Vadas, Peter A.; Kalin, Latif			Watershed-level Comparison of Predictability and Sensitivity of Two Phosphorus Models	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							LITTER APPLICATION RATE; POULTRY-LITTER; DISSOLVED PHOSPHORUS; MANURE PHOSPHORUS; RUNOFF; SOIL; NITROGEN; LOSSES	Buildup of phosphorus (P) in agricultural soils and transport of P to nearby surface waters due to excessive, long-term application of poultry litter is an environmental concern in many poultry-producing states. Watershed models are oft en used to quantify soil and water quality impacts of poultry litter applications. However, depending on how P transport is simulated in watershed models, the anticipated impact could be quite different. The objective of this study was to determine the predictability and sensitivity of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) P model and a newly developed, state-of-the-art manure P model called SurPhos in a poultry litter-applied pasture watershed. A small, predominantly agricultural watershed in Randolph County, Alabama was used for this study. The SWAT model, calibrated for surface runoff and total stream flows (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of 0.70 for both), was used to provide runoff inputs to the SurPhos model. Total dissolved P (TDP) exports simulated by the SWAT P and SurPhos models from the hay hydrological response units of the watershed were compared for different poultry litter application rates and different initial soil Solution P levels. Both models showed sensitivity to poultry litter application rates, with SWAT simulating linear and SurPhos simulating nonlinear increases in TDP exports with increase in poultry litter application rates. SWAT showed greater sensitivity to initial soil Solution P levels, which can lead to overestimation of TDP exports, especially at low poultry litter application rates. As opposed to the SurPhos model simulations and contrary to recent studies, SWAT simulated excessive accumulation of Solution P in the top 10 mm of soil. Because SurPhos appears to simulate P transport and build-up processes from manure-applied areas more accurately, this study suggests that SWAT be replaced by SurPhos to more accurately determine watershed-level effectiveness of P management measures.

Livestock-Generated Nitrogen Exports from a Pastoral Wetland	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							SUSPENDED SEDIMENT; RIPARIAN WETLANDS; WATER-QUALITY; CATCHMENT; CATTLE; STREAM; TRANSPORT; TURBIDITY; SHEEP; SOIL	When wetlands are disturbed by cattle, pulses of contaminants may be released. We studied nitrogen exports from a small pastoral wetland (1725 m(2)) in the Lake Taupo Catchment, New Zealand, to which cattle and sheep had periodic access. Flow, turbidity, and water quality samples were collected at the wetland outlet over 2 yr. Turbidity was used to trigger sampling during livestock grazing and as a surrogate for organic N (OrgN) and total N (TN) in flux estimation. The wetland flowed throughout the study (median 0.285 L s(-1)) and was baseflow dominated (73%) but responded to rainfall (peak storm flow 166 L s(-1)). Organic N was the dominant N form exported (median OrgN: TN ratio 0.86). During cattle grazing periods, concentrations and fluxes of all forms of nitrogen at the outlet were elevated compared with storm and baseflow conditions during nongrazed periods. The TN fluxes were nine times greater when cattle grazed the wetland (306 g d(-1)) than under nongrazed baseflow conditions (32 g d(-1)). Cattle grazing occurred 9% of the time but accounted for 34% of TN export over 11 mo. Excluding cattle from small wetlands is likely to have immediate water quality benefits.

Suspended solids and particulate phosphorus emissions and their transport were modeled in two hilly agricultural watersheds (Wulka River in Austria and Zala River in Hungary) with an improved version of the catchment-scale PhosFate model. Source and transmission areas were ranked by an optimization method in order to provide a priority list of the areas of economically efficient (optimal) management alternatives. The model was calibrated and validated at different gauges and for various years. The spatial distribution of the emissions shows that approximately one third of the catchment area is responsible for the majority of the emissions. However, only a few percent of the source areas can transport fluxes to the catchment outlet. These effective source areas, together with the main transmission areas are potential candidates for improved management practices. In accordance with the critical area concept, it was shown that intervention with better management practices on a properly selected small proportion of the total area (1-3%) is sufficient to reach a remarkable improvement in water quality. If soil nutrient management is also considered in addition to water quality, intervention on 4-12% of the catchment areas can fulfill both aspects. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We tested the hypothesis that the degree of catchment imperviousness predicted the relative ecological condition of freshwater reaches within the network of streams and rivers in the partly urbanised Georges River catchment in temperate south-eastern Australia. The 2-year study involved two spring and two autumn assessments of water quality (chemical and physical) and ecological condition, using benthic macroinvertebrates, riparian vegetation and calculation of catchment imperviousness. The study revealed that highly urbanised streams had strongly degraded water quality and macroinvertebrate communities, compared to clean non-urban reference streams. We found three clear groups of sites with varying degrees of ecological condition, being categorised according to the level of catchment effective imperviousness (low < 5.0 %, moderate = 5.0-18.0 % and high > 18.0 %). Water pollution also varied according to these categories. A combination of two water chemistry attributes (total nitrogen and calcium), along with catchment imperviousness and riparian vegetation condition, were identified as being the factors most strongly associated with variation of macroinvertebrate communities. Based on our results, we recommend that protection of the ecological condition of streams should focus on not only water quality but also include catchment imperviousness and riparian vegetation condition.

Climate projections for 1961-2099 were combined with four nutrient load scenarios ranging from a pessimistic business-as-usual to a more optimistic case following the Helsinki Commission's (HELCOM) Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP). The model results suggest that in a future climate, water quality, characterized by ecological quality indicators like winter nutrient, summer bottom oxygen, and annual mean phytoplankton concentrations as well as annual mean Secchi depth (water transparency), will be deteriorated compared to present conditions. In case of nutrient load reductions required by the BSAP, water quality is only slightly improved. Based on the analysis of biogeochemical fluxes, we find that in warmer and more anoxic waters, internal feedbacks could be reinforced. Increased phosphorus fluxes out of the sediments, reduced denitrification efficiency and increased nitrogen fixation may partly counteract nutrient load abatement strategies.	[Meier, H. E.

High microcystin concentrations occur only at low nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios in nutrient-rich Canadian lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article							PHYTOPLANKTON; DOMINANCE; BLOOMS	Although the cyanobacterial toxin microcystin has been detected in Canadian fresh waters, little is known about its prevalence on a national scale. Here, we report for the first time on microcystin in 246 water bodies across Canada based on 3474 analyses. Over the last 10 years, microcystins were detected in every province, often exceeding maximum guidelines for potable and recreational water quality. Microcystins were virtually absent from unproductive systems and were increasingly common in nutrient-rich waters. The probable risk of microcystin concentrations exceeding water quality guidelines was greatest when the ratio of nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) was low and rapidly decreased at higher N:P ratios. Maximum concentrations of microcystins occurred in hypereutrophic lakes at mass ratios of N:P below 23. Our models may prove to be useful screening tools for identifying potentially toxic "hotspots" or "hot times" of unacceptable microcystin levels. A future scientific challenge will be to determine whether there is any causal link between N:P ratios and microcystin concentrations, as this may have important implications for the management of eutrophied lakes and reservoirs.

It is necessary to reveal the composing and distribution characteristics of nutrients for elucidating its complex removal and retention mechanisms in natural wetlands. In this study, the composition and the spatial distribution characteristics of nitrogen in a natural wetland in central China were illustrated and analyzed. The self-organizing map (SOM) model was used in this study to assess the water quality dataset of the wetland. The relationships between nitrogen and other water quality parameters were revealed by the visualization function of the SOM model with the pre-processed data; the modeling result was in agreement with the linear correlation analysis. The results indicated that the SOM model was suitable for the assessment of field-scale date of natural wetlands, and finally a potential approach for predicting the nutrients concentrations in natural wetlands was also found.

Using reference values to assess environmental sustainability of dairy farms	RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						sustainability; reference value; life-cycle assessment; dairy	IMPACT ASSESSMENT; WATER-QUALITY; AGRICULTURE; NITROGEN; MANAGEMENT; REQUIREMENTS; INDICATORS; FRAMEWORK; LOSSES; REGION	One challenge for the environmental assessment of agricultural systems is to progress from estimating whether one farming system has fewer impacts than another to estimating whether or not it can be considered environmentally sustainable. To this end, we developed reference values (RVs) of farm emissions or energy use per hectare that defined hypothetical sustainability thresholds in each of three impact categories: climate change, water-quality degradation and non-renewable energy use. We applied one RV per category to the potential impacts (estimated by life-cycle assessment) of 45 French dairy farms to identify farms below RVs in each impact category and then evaluated their management and production characteristics. Seventeen of the 45 farms lie below at least one of the three RVs. Groups of farms below RVs had a higher percentage of organic farms, larger mean usable agricultural area, longer mean pasture residence time and lower mean inputs of concentrate feed and nitrogen than those above the same RVs. In consequence, the groups below RVs also tended to have lower mean milk production per cow and per hectare. All milk production systems can move toward environmental sustainability even though, according to production mode and intensity, some potential impacts are easier to reduce than others. Most farms were unable to attain the lowest RVs, suggesting that policy-makers may need to consider less ambitious RVs for existing agricultural systems. Otherwise, the distance between normative RVs and indicator values of dairy farms suggest that production and consumption of agricultural products will need to change if sustainability goals do not.

Each of the decomposition products contributes differently to overall export of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) to water courses. Our aim was to study the quantity and composition of the released C and N as affected by the organic material and soil fauna, represented by enchytraeid worms. We measured the release rate of carbon dioxide, and calculated the release rates for DOC and dissolved N in soil from repeated measurements of DOC and N pools during laboratory incubation of litter (L), fermented (F) and humus (H) layers of boreal forest mor. The intermediate decomposition products, DOC and DON, were characterised according to the molecule size. The release rate of the decomposition products was higher for fresh than for old organic material. The majority of N and C were released as NH4-N and CO2, respectively. The amount of extractable organic N in soil decreased by time but DON increased. Enchytraeids stimulated N mineralisation and the release of large molecule size DOC, particularly in L layer. The results suggest that organic N in extractable form biodegrades effectively, and that soil fauna have an important role in the decomposition. The results were interpreted from the water quality point of view and the implications of the results to modelling of decomposition and export of DOC and dissolved N to recipient water bodies are discussed. In the modelling context, the novelty of the study is the description of the intermediate decomposition products and the division of the dissolved organic compounds into low molecular weight and high molecular weight fractions.

However, the relative contributions of loads entering Puget Sound from natural and anthropogenic sources, and the effects of exchange flow from the Pacific Ocean are not well understood. Development of a quantitative model of Puget Sound is thus presented to help improve our understanding of the annual biogeochemical cycles in this system using the unstructured grid Finite-Volume Coastal Ocean Model framework and the Integrated Compartment Model (CE-QUAL-ICM) water quality kinetics. Results based on 2006 data show that phytoplankton growth and die-off, succession between two species of algae, nutrient dynamics, and dissolved oxygen in Puget Sound are strongly tied to seasonal variation of temperature, solar radiation, and the annual exchange and flushing induced by upwelled Pacific Ocean waters. Concentrations in the mixed outflow surface layer occupying approximately 5-20 m of the upper water column show strong effects of eutrophication from natural and anthropogenic sources, spring and summer algae blooms, accompanied by depleted nutrients but high dissolved oxygen levels. The bottom layer reflects dissolved oxygen and nutrient concentrations of upwelled Pacific Ocean water modulated by mixing with biologically active surface outflow in the Strait of Juan de Fuca prior to entering Puget Sound over the Admiralty Inlet. The effect of reflux mixing at the Admiralty Inlet sill resulting in lower nutrient and higher dissolved oxygen levels in bottom waters of Puget Sound than the incoming upwelled Pacific Ocean water is reproduced. By late winter, with the reduction in algal activity, water column constituents of interest, were renewed and the system appeared to reset with cooler temperature, higher nutrient, and higher dissolved oxygen waters from the Pacific Ocean.

Bala Krishna			Nutrient stoichiometry and eutrophication in Indian mangroves	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Mangrove; Dissolved nutrients; Stoichiometry; Redfield ratio; India	PICHAVARAM MANGROVE; WATER-QUALITY; PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS; NITROGEN INPUTS; SOUTHEAST COAST; ORGANIC-CARBON; ANDHRA-PRADESH; EAST-COAST; ECOSYSTEM; RIVER	Stoichiometry of dissolved nutrients in five important mangrove ecosystems of India (Sundarban, Bhitarkanika, Coringa, Pichavaram and Mangalavanam) was analyzed to describe the ecological and nutrient status of the inter-tidal mangroves in response to increasing human perturbations. The stoichiometric proportions of dissolved nutrients in mangroves highly deviated from the standard Redfield ratio (Si:N:P = 16:16:1), primarily because of the allochthonous nutrients derived from anthropogenic activities. In all mangroves, Si:N ratios were > 1, which indicates that high silica is supplied from the terrestrial weathering to mangrove waters. Despite high phosphate loadings along with nitrogen from both point and non-point sources to mangrove waters, N:P ratios (Sundarban 11.43; Bhitarkanika 6.48; Coringa, 5.46; Pichavaram, 7.31 and Mangalavanam 4.64) demonstrate that phosphorus was a limiting nutrient in all mangrove ecosystems. The long-term nutrient analysis in Pichavaram mangrove water explains that the significant increase in dissolved nutrients since the 1980s is mainly derived from non-point sources (e.g., agriculture, aquaculture, etc.) that alter biogeochemical processes in this ecosystem. This study clearly reports that the ecological status of the Indian sub-continent mangroves is highly disturbed by anthropogenic impacts. Therefore, an appraisal of the nutrient ratios and sufficiency in mangroves facilitated an understanding of the current environmental conditions of coastal ecosystems, which further led to the proposal of the long-term observational research coupled with modeling to develop sustainable management strategies for conservation and restoration of mangroves.

This study aims to determine the main predictors of diatom community composition from 73 Swedish lakes. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed pH, phosphate, nitrite/nitrate levels, longitude and percentage of forest in the catchment to be the most important factors of 51 environmental variables for structuring diatom assemblages. Cluster analysis separated the lakes into three groups based on the diatom community composition. Lakes belonging to these groups were characterised as: (1) acidic, nutrient-poor; (2) circumneutral, nutrient-poor and (3) alkaline, nutrient-rich, according to the results of a discriminant function analysis and dominant diatom taxa revealed by similarity percentage analysis. Ecological guilds according to growth morphology and the ability of nitrogen-fixation were assigned to all diatom taxa. All three lake groups exhibited a distinct guild composition. Nitrogen-fixing diatoms were found in nutrient-rich lakes, only. Our results indicate that taxonomical composition of littoral diatom assemblages can be applied in the assessment of nutrient and acidity status of Swedish lakes. Differences in distribution of the ecological guilds were connected to several environmental factors such as nutrients, light and grazing; their application in assessment of trophic status of lakes is therefore precarious.

J	Hagerthey, SE; Newman, S; Xue, S				Hagerthey, Scot E.; Newman, Susan; Xue, Shi			Periphyton-based transfer functions to assess ecological imbalance and management of a subtropical ombrotrophic peatland	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						assessment; Everglades; phosphorus; salinity; wetland eutrophication	EPILITHIC ALGAL COMMUNITIES; DIATOM-BASED MODELS; FLORIDA EVERGLADES; WATER-QUALITY; ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES; NUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS; BIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT; INFERENCE MODELS; TOTAL PHOSPHORUS; BENTHIC ALGAE	1. To assess the biological status and response of aquatic resources to management actions, managers and decision-makers require accurate and precise metrics. This is especially true for some parts of the Florida Everglades where multiple stressors (e.g. hydrologic alterations and eutrophication) have resulted in a highly degraded and fragmented ecosystem. Biological assessments are required that directly allow for the evaluation of historical and current status and responses to implantation of large-scale restoration projects. 2. Utilising periphyton composition and water-quality data obtained from long-term (15 years) monitoring programmes, we developed calibrated and verified periphyton-based numerical models (transfer functions) that could be used to simultaneously assess multiple stressors affecting the Everglades peatland (e.g. salinity, nitrogen and phosphorus). Periphyton is an ideal indicator because responses to stressors are rapid and predictable and possess valued ecological attributes. 3. Weighted averaging partial least squares regression was used to develop models to infer water-quality concentrations from 456 samples comprising 319 periphyton taxa. Measured versus periphyton-inferred concentrations were strongly related for log-transformed salinity ( = 0.81; RMSEP 0.15 mg L-1) and log-transformed total phosphorus (TP; = 0.70; RMSEP 0.18 mg L-1), but weakly related for total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) ( = 0.46; RMSEP 0.12 mg L-1). Validation results using an independent 455 sample data set were similar (log(salinity) r2 = 0.78, log(TP) r2 = 0.65 and log(TKN) r2 = 0.38). 4. Water Conservation Area 1 (WCA-1), a large ombrotrophic subtropical peatland impacted by multiple water-quality stressors that has undergone major changes in water management, was used as a case study. The models were applied to a long-term periphyton data set to reconstruct water-quality trends in relation to restoration efforts to reduce nutrient loading to the Everglades. The combination of biologically inferred TP and salinity was used to identify the ecological status of periphyton assemblages. Periphyton assemblages were ecologically imbalanced with respect to salinity and TP. Salinity imbalance varied spatially and temporally, whereas TP was spatially restricted. Imbalances caused by water management were owing to salinity more so than to TP. 5. The transfer functions developed for the Everglades are trait-based quantitative numerical methods and are ideal because the abundances of species are modelled numerically in relation to a stressor. The resulting inferred value is a numerical representation of the stressors effect on biological condition that can be compared against the management of the stressor independent of other factors. The benefits are that biological lags or hysteresis events can easily be identified and environmental conditions can be estimated when measurements are lacking. Reporting biological assessments in terms of well-defined water-quality metrics (e.g. numeric criterion) increased the communicative ability of the assessment. The use of multiple metrics to assess ecological imbalance increased the ability to identify probable causes.

Fish food (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1 similar to g dosages tested) of different grain sizes (original; 0.147 similar to=similar to d similar to=similar to 0.85 similar to mm; d similar to=similar to 0.147 similar to mm) was added each into M-II culturing medium (nitrogen and phosphorus absent). During the experimental running period, the concentrations of total phosphorus (TP), orthophosphate phosphorus (PO43--P), total nitrogen and ammonia-nitrogen (NH4+-N) increased significantly with increasing fish food dosages regardless of their grain sizes. Furthermore, grain size had a negligible effect on nutrient release from fish food with the same dosage. Based on the above experiment, M. aeruginosa was introduced into the culturing media at different dosages (nitrogen and phosphorus absent) with 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 similar to g fish food to assess algae growth characteristics. Algae cell density significantly increased with the dosage ranging from 0 to 0.2 similar to g. NH4+-N and PO43--P were the main fractions of available nutrients used by M. aeruginosa in the fish food. In comparison to the growth dynamics of algae in M-II culturing medium, the lag phase for M. aeruginosa in the presence of fish food extended significantly when calculating the time from the addition of fish food and insignificantly when the time for nutrient release from fish food was excluded.

This study aimed to investigate the physico-chemical tolerance range of the noble and stone crayfish in the Czech Republic compared with those of the invasive spiny-cheek crayfish (Orconectes limosus Raf.). At 1008 sites with crayfish either absent or present, the following 18 physico-chemical variables were investigated: dissolved oxygen, pH, BOD5, CODCr, ammonia, ammonium ions, nitrite, nitrate ions, zinc, copper, iron, aluminium, calcium, sulphates, chlorides, total phosphorus, suspended solids, and conductivity. For the noble and stone crayfish, only minor differences in water quality were found. This indicates that the water quality requirements of these indigenous crayfish are likely to be very similar. However, significant differences in water quality were observed between locations inhabited by indigenous crayfish and those inhabited by the invasive spiny-cheek crayfish. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the invasive species is able to survive in locations with lower water quality. Simple logistic regression models were then used to examine relationships between the presence or absence of noble crayfish and each evaluated water quality variable. The presence of this species was related significantly with those variables that indicate nutrient enrichment (particularly ammonium, BOD5, and nitrite) and to iron. Overall, although the indigenous crayfish species were found at several sampling sites that had impaired water quality, the statistical analyses indicate that the indigenous species require water of high quality. Improvement in water quality is therefore an important step in sustaining indigenous crayfish populations. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Two models (principal components analysis (PCA), and positive matrix factorization (PMF)) were used to do the further quantitative source apportionment studying. The 27 inflow rivers in spatial were divided into three pollution levels (A, high; B, medium; C, low). The primary pollution pattern in spatial Clusters A, B, and C were point, urban non-point and agricultural non-point separately, in consideration of simultaneous land use types. Source apportionment results identified five typical factors in spatial Cluster A and six typical factors in spatial Cluster B and C as responsible for the data structure, explaining 80%-90% of the total variance of the dataset.

The maximum peak-height algorithm (MPH) uses a baseline subtraction procedure to calculate the height of the dominant peak across the red and near-infrared MERIS bands between 664 and 885 nm caused by sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SICF) and particulate backscatter. Atmospheric correction of the MERIS TOA reflectance data for gaseous absorption and Rayleigh scattering proved adequate given the spectral proximity of the relevant bands and the sufficiently large differential spectral signal. This avoided the need to correct for atmospheric aerosols, a procedure which is typically prone to large errors in turbid and high-biomass waters. A combination of switching algorithms for estimating chl-a were derived from coincident in situ chl-a and MERIS bottom-of-Rayleigh reflectance measurements. These algorithms are designed to cover a wide trophic range, from oligotrophic/mesotrophic waters (chl-a<20 mg m(-3)), to eutrophic/hypertrophic waters (chl-a>20 mg m(-3)) and surface scums or dry floating algae or vegetation. Cyanobacteria-dominant waters were differentiated from those dominated by eukaryote algal species (dinoflagellates/diatoms) on the basis of the magnitude of the MPH variable. This is supported by evidence that vacuolate cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa) possess enhanced chl-a specific backscatter which is an important bio-optical distinguishing feature. This enables these phytoplankton groups to be distinguished from space. An algorithm derived from cyanobacteria-dominant waters had a r(2) value of 0.58 for chl-a between 33 and 362 mg m(-3) and an error of 33.7% (N=17). The operational algorithm for eukaryote-dominant algal assemblages gave a coefficient of determination of 0.71 and a mean absolute percentage error of 60% for chl-a in the range 0.5-350 mg m(-3) (N=48). A flag based on cyanobacteria-specific spectral pigmentation and fluorescence features was used to identify cyanobacterial-dominance in eutrophic waters. Global applications demonstrate how the MPH algorithm can offer rapid and effective assessment of trophic status, cyanobacterial-dominance, surface scums and floating vegetation in inland and coastal waters.

ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINANTS OF WATER QUALITY IN BOREAL RIVERS BASED ON PARTITIONING METHODS	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						climate; hierarchical and variation partitioning; land use; physiography; water quality	LAND-COVER DATA; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS; CONSERVATION BIOLOGY; POTENTIAL IMPACTS; BUFFER ZONE; CATCHMENT; CHEMISTRY; TRENDS; ECOLOGY	Quantitative studies of the relationships between river water quality and environmental variables are needed to improve understanding of the impacts of natural and human factors on aquatic environments. However, multicollinearity between environmental variables can hinder the identification of key factors when water qualityenvironment relationship is studied using traditional regression methods. This study utilized two alternative statistical methods, variation and hierarchical partitioning, to address these difficulties in studies of river water quality. Using these methods, we explored the effects of catchment physiography, climate and land use variables on total phosphorus and nitrogen, pH, water colour and dissolved oxygen during the years 19952005 in 32 boreal rivers in Finland. Catchment physiography and land use explained most of the variation in water quality, especially in phosphorus, nitrogen and water colour data. The strong correlations (rs?>?0.8) between agricultural land use and phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations indicate that water quality is highly affected by agriculture in boreal regions. By determining the environmental drivers of different water quality variables, we can estimate the water quality of different catchments in response to environmental changes and identify areas that are sensitive to global changes. Our study shows that novel statistical methods integrated with geographic information system data and techniques provide deeper insights into water qualityenvironment relationships than traditional regression, and these should be considered when developing, for example, conservation planning for rivers.

A Monte Carlo approach to the inverse problem of diffuse pollution risk in agricultural catchments	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Diffuse pollution; Hydrological connectivity; Nutrients; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Modelling	CRITICAL SOURCE AREAS; LAND-USE CHANGE; WATER-QUALITY; PHOSPHORUS LOSS; SURFACE WATERS; RIVER; MANAGEMENT; NITRATE; IMPACT; MODEL	The hydrological and biogeochemical processes that operate in catchments influence the ecological quality of freshwater systems through delivery of fine sediment, nutrients and organic matter. Most models that seek to characterise the delivery of diffuse pollutants from land to water are reductionist. The multitude of processes that are parameterised in such models to ensure generic applicability make them complex and difficult to test on available data. Here, we outline an alternative - data-driven - inverse approach. We apply SCIMAP, a parsimonious risk based model that has an explicit treatment of hydrological connectivity. we take a Bayesian approach to the inverse problem of determining the risk that must be assigned to different land uses in a catchment in order to explain the spatial patterns of measured in-stream nutrient concentrations. We apply the model to identify the key sources of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) diffuse pollution risk in eleven UK catchments covering a range of landscapes. The model results show that: 1) some land use generates a consistently high or low risk of diffuse nutrient pollution; but 2) the risks associated with different land uses vary both between catchments and between nutrients; and 3) that the dominant sources of P and N risk in the catchment are often a function of the spatial configuration of land uses. Taken on a case-by-case basis, this type of inverse approach may be used to help prioritise the focus of interventions to reduce diffuse pollution risk for freshwater ecosystems.

Nutrient Balance and Use Efficiency in Sandy Soils Cropped with Tomato under Seepage Irrigation	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL			English	Article							TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTIONS; NITROGEN ACCUMULATION; FRUIT YIELD; PHOSPHORUS; POTASSIUM; MANAGEMENT; NITRATE; CITRUS; PLANT; FLORIDA	Decreasing groundwater and surface water quality relative to land use, poorly retentive sandy soils, frequent and intensive rainfalls, and shallow groundwater depths is a major concern in Florida. While the spatial and temporal distributions of N, P, and K in southwest Florida sandy soils cropped with seepage-irrigated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) were previously described, the objective of this study was to calculate seasonal nutrient balances and estimate potential nutrient losses for field conditions. Field experiments were conducted in 2006 spring and 2006/2007 winter growing seasons with 224 or 358, 61, and 553 kg ha(-1) of N, P, and K fertilizer, respectively. Total inorganic soil N in the root zone decreased with time, reaching minimum concentrations at the end of growing seasons. Total Mehlich-1 soil P fluctuated widely in the spring but remained relatively constant in the winter season, yet was slightly higher than the preplant values for both seasons. Total Mehlich-1 soil K decreased with time, but large concentrations remained in the soil at the end of both seasons. Potential nutrient loss from the root zone ranged from 35 to 38, 41 to 43, 0 to 2, and 15 to 37% for low N, high N, P, and K, respectively, for both seasons. Phosphorus probably underwent transformation from nonextractable to Mehlich-1 extractable forms during the season. Nutrient use efficiency ranged from 59 to 62, 52 to 55, 10 to 14, and 40 to 52% for low N, high N, P, and K, respectively, for both seasons. Leaching loss during the season was likely for N and K, and there is a post-harvest leaching risk for P and K on removal of the plastic mulch.

Water Quality Monitoring Using Remote Sensing and an Artificial Neural Network	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION			English	Article						Ecological restoration; Landsat TM; Neural network; Remote sensing	LANDSAT TM; KISSIMMEE RIVER; LAKE; CHLOROPHYLL; FLORIDA; RESTORATION; FLOW; CLASSIFICATION; DELINEATION; MODIS	In remotely located watersheds or large waterbodies, monitoring water quality parameters is often not feasible because of high costs and site inaccessibility. A cost-effective remote sensing-based methodology was developed to predict water quality parameters over a large and logistically difficult area. Landsat spectral data were used as a proxy, and a neural network model was developed to quantify water quality parameters, namely chlorophyll-a, turbidity, and phosphorus before and after ecosystem restoration and during the wet and dry seasons. The results demonstrate that the developed neural network model provided an excellent relationship between the observed and simulated water quality parameters. These correlated for a specific region in the greater Florida Everglades at R (2) > 0.95 in 1998-1999 and in 2009-2010 (dry and wet seasons). Moreover, the root mean square error values for phosphorus, turbidity, and chlorophyll-a were below 0.03 mg L-1, 0.5 NTU, and 0.17 mg m(-3), respectively, at the neural network training and validation phases. Using the developed methodology, the trends for temporal and spatial dynamics of the selected water quality parameters were investigated. In addition, the amounts of phosphorus and chlorophyll-a stored in the water column were calculated demonstrating the usefulness of this methodology to predict water quality parameters in complex ecosystems.

To examine the effects of land cover on bacteria indicator concentrations in streams, twenty small watersheds (<2500 ha) within the Middle Chattahoochee Watershed of western Georgia were chosen for investigation. Watersheds were selected to represent a gradient of impervious surface cover and also to represent a wide array of land covers, including urban, developing, pastoral, mixed species forests, and pine forests. Grab samples were collected from May 2002 to January 2006 and analyzed for fecal indicator bacteria, ammonium, nitrate, phosphorus, and total suspended solids. In general, urban watersheds revealed higher concentrations of fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli than other land covers. Fecal indicator bacteria concentrations and violations of bacteria state and federal standards were positively correlated with percent impervious surfaces. Furthermore, positive relationships between fecal indicator bacteria and ammonium and total suspended solids were found during stormflow. These results suggest that watershed land cover may impact the period of time that waters exceed the fecal coliform and E. coli standards. Additionally, these data reveal that the fecal coliform review criterion may be met, while simultaneously violating the E. coli standard. This study will help to clarify the effects of land development on the pathogen properties of stream water in the Georgia Piedmont and examine the ramifications of using fecal coliforms and E. coli as indicators of disease-causing pathogens within the region.

To reduce the phosphorus load on the lake, a phosphorus elimination plant (PEP) is situated at inflow #2. Moreover, the two inflows are short-circuited by a pipeline that transfers part of the inflow #1 water to the PEP and finally releases it into inflow #2. The pipeline and the PEP have contributed to a continuous reduction in the total phosphorus concentration of Lake Tegel in the past 25 years. We investigate the question of whether the existing lake pipeline can also be used to reduce the amount of pharmaceuticals in Lake Tegel originating from inflow #2 by dilution with water from River Havel, by diverting part of inflow #2 around the lake, or by a combination of both strategies. The circulation pattern of Lake Tegel is complicated by complex bathymetry and numerous islands and is therefore highly sensitive to winds. We tested seven different management scenarios by hydrodynamic modeling for a period of 16 years with the two-dimensional version of the Princeton Ocean Model (POM). None of the scenarios provided a strategy optimal for both pharmaceuticals and phosphorus. Nonetheless, compound regimes, such as alternating the pipe flow direction or adding another pipeline, allowed the most abundant pharmaceutical (carbamazepine) to be reduced while maintaining the current phosphorus level. This study demonstrates the ability of immediate lake regulation measures to maintain water quality. In the case of Lake Tegel, the pipeline can be fully effective with regard to pharmaceuticals only in combination with additional efforts such as advanced pharmaceutical treatment of wastewater and/or phosphorus reduction in the River Havel catchment.

J	Radomski, P; Perleberg, D				Radomski, Paul; Perleberg, Donna			Application of a versatile aquatic macrophyte integrity index for Minnesota lakes	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Aquatic plants; Macophytes; IBI; Minnesota lakes; Biological assessment	FISH-BASED INDEX; BIOTIC INTEGRITY; SPECIES RICHNESS; WATER-QUALITY; LAND-USE; BIOLOGICAL INTEGRITY; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; NORTHERN WISCONSIN; FLOATING-LEAF; BIODIVERSITY	The objective was to develop a Minnesota aquatic macrophyte integrity index that can use plant checklist data from existing and ongoing lake plant survey programs without alteration. Using the extensive lake survey data collected by numerous state programs, we created a suite of predictive models for macrophyte richness and floristic quality and identified aquatic macrophyte community outliers to set potential impairment thresholds. The highest-ranked predictive models included total phosphorus, disturbance indices, and ecoregion variables. Models with all in-lake macrophyte taxa generally performed better than those based on just submerged aquatic macrophyte or those based on submerged and floating-leaf taxa. The best generalized linear mixed model for aquatic macrophyte richness was a model containing total phosphorus, alkalinity, lake size, maximum depth, ecoregion, survey type, and several interactions. The best linear mixed effects model for floristic quality also included these predictive variables. Richness and floristic quality thresholds were calculated using these models with associated disturbance-response breakpoints. The approach took sampling protocol into account by providing different thresholds based on sample design. These thresholds then identify potentially biologically impaired lakes. There appeared to be no disturbance-response breakpoints between aquatic macrophyte richness and floristic quality for the Northern Lakes and Forest ecoregion of northeastern Minnesota.

The Programme was the first one in Japan to disseminate soft interventions in households, measurements to reduce pollutant discharge, in a large river basin with more than two million population. The soft interventions in households are similar to cleaner production in industrial sector because they are not the wastewater treatment and changing of lifestyles. This paper presents several methods for quantification of the pollutant discharge reduction. Two hypothetical soft intervention combinations were defined, the effects of 16 soft interventions were estimated using their proliferation rates, and estimated pollutant discharge reduction was compared with changes in river water quality during the Programme events. For the first method, environmental accounting housekeeping (EAR) books were applied to estimate a 38-53% reduction in biological oxygen demand (BOO), 26-40% reduction in total nitrogen (TN), and 21-32% reduction in total phosphorus (TP). These estimation results were comparable with the field survey results of approximately 100 person population, which were conducted in the late 1980s. Soft interventions were found to be several times more cost effective than hard interventions, such as development of municipal wastewater treatment and river water purification systems. The BOO discharge reduction effects of soft interventions initiated during Programme events increased from 0.3-2.3% in 2005-2007 to 2.4-4.7% in 2007-2009. The questionnaire surveys found that participants in the Programme events in average newly implemented three or four soft interventions in addition to those already implemented at normal times.

J	Demissie, Y; Yan, E; Wu, M				Demissie, Yonas; Yan, Eugene; Wu, May			Assessing Regional Hydrology and Water Quality Implications of Large-Scale Biofuel Feedstock Production in the Upper Mississippi River Basin	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							GULF-OF-MEXICO; CORN STOVER; ETHANOL-PRODUCTION; SOIL; EVAPORATION; RESIDUE; MISCANTHUS; YIELDS; RATES; SWAT	A recent U.S. Department of Energy study estimated that more than one billion tons of biofuel feedstock could be produced by 2030 in the United States from increased corn yield, and changes in agricultural and forest residue management and land uses. To understand the implications of such increased production on water resources and stream quality at regional and local scales, we have applied a watershed model for the Upper Mississippi River Basin, where most of the current and future crop/residue-based biofuel production is expected. The model simulates changes in water quality (soil erosion, nitrogen and phosphorus loadings in streams) and resources (soil-water content, evapotranspiration, and runoff) under projected biofuel production versus the 2006 baseline year and a business-as-usual scenario. The basin average results suggest that the projected feedstock production could change the rate of evapotranspiration in the UMRB by approximately +2%, soil-water content by about -2%, and discharge to streams by -5% from the baseline scenario. However, unlike the impacts on regional water availability, the projected feedstock production has a mixed effect on water quality, resulting in 12% and 45% increases in annual suspended sediment and total phosphorus loadings, respectively, but a 3% decrease in total nitrogen loading. These differences in water quantity and quality are statistically significant (p < 0.05). The basin responses are further analyzed at monthly time steps and finer spatial scales to evaluate underlying physical processes, which would be essential for future optimization of environmentally sustainable biofuel productions.

Fluorescence Tracking of Dissolved and Particulate Organic Matter Quality in a River-Dominated Estuary	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							NORTH-CAROLINA; AMINO-ACIDS; WASTE-WATER; CARBON; DYNAMICS; PHOTOREACTIVITY; SPECTROSCOPY; MISSISSIPPI; SUBSTANCES; PAMLICO	Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence was combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) to model base-extracted particulate (POM) and dissolved (DOM) organic matter quality in the Neuse River Estuary (NRE), North Carolina, before and after passage of Hurricane Irene in August 2011. Principle components analysis was used to determine that four of the PARAFAC components (C1-C3 and C6) were terrestrial sources to the NRE. One component (C4), prevalent in DOM of nutrient-impacted streams and estuaries and produced in phytoplankton cultures, was enriched in the POM and in surface sediment pore water DOM. One component (CS) was related to recent autochthonous production. Photoexposure of unfiltered Neuse River water caused an increase in slope ratio values (S-R) which corresponded to an increase in the ratio C2:C3 for DOM, and the production of C4 fluorescence in both POM and DOM. Changes to the relative abundance of C4 in POM and DOM indicated that advection of pore water DOM from surface sediments into overlying waters could increase the autochthonous quality of DOM in shallow microtidal estuaries. Modeling POM and DOM simultaneously with PARAFAC is an informative technique that is applicable to assessments of estuarine water quality.

In November, bromide (Br) and chloride (Cl) tracers were applied as solutes at 0-2.3 m, and 2.3-4.6 m from a tile drain, respectively, prior to a 9 h simulated precipitation event on a macroporous, silt loam soil. Tracer concentrations were monitored in the tile over the course of the year following tracer application. Results show that the tile drain captured 8% of the applied Br mass within 48 h and 27% within 21 days of tracer application. During a major winter melt event, the tile captured an additional 25% of the total Br mass in less than 10 days. Seven months after application, about 95% of the Br tracer had been captured; however, nearly all the Cl appeared to remain in the soil. Detailed hydrologic monitoring during the melt event indicated that a saturation threshold existed, beyond which, tile effluent tracer concentrations no longer rose in conjunction with discharge but instead dropped as the tile was inundated with dilute event water transmitted through the primarily vertical macropore network within the overlying soil. Although the tile's rapid capture zone was relatively small, conservative solutes applied post-harvest, and within approximately 2 m of the tile, readily moved to surface water prior to the following growing season. Seasonal melts were identified as the most influential climatic events for solute mobilization. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Impact of climate change on water management in Dutch peat polders	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Water management; Hydrology; Water quality; Nutrients; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Land use; Greenhouse gases; Climate change; Model	SOIL; EUTROPHICATION; EMISSIONS; MODEL; N2O; ECOSYSTEMS; BALANCES; WETLANDS; DITCHES; LAKES	A spatially explicit dynamic model was developed that combines water quantity and quality processes for an average Dutch peat polder. The model has been used to calculate the consequences of climate change for surface water level, groundwater level and nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes, based on time series (2036-2065) of the two most extreme climate change scenarios for the Netherlands (G and W+) developed by the Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute. It was calibrated using measured data from two existing polders. The results suggest that surface water levels will not change much in both scenarios. Hence, the current practice of letting extra water in during dry summer periods to maintain sufficient water levels will probably remain a viable solution to temporary summer droughts in the near future as the required water volumes are not likely to increase greatly. Late summer groundwater levels decrease substantially in the W+ scenario but not in the moderate G scenario. This drop in groundwater level would accelerate the on-going process of peat oxidation, resulting in increased soil subsidence, greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient release from mineralisation. The W+ scenario also led to higher nitrogen concentrations and lower phosphorus concentrations in the ditch network Probably the reduced stream velocity in the W+ scenario results in an increased sedimentation of (adsorbed) phosphate. Sedimentation is a less important process in the nitrogen cycle, and the increased nitrogen concentrations anticipated in summer according to the W+ scenario are therefore probably the consequence of a reduced outlet of water due to increased evaporation. Additionally, an increased delivery of nitrogen through mineralisation could also contribute to the increased nitrogen concentrations in summer. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Examination of the effects of nutrient regeneration mechanisms on plankton dynamics using aquatic biogeochemical modeling	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Planktonic food webs; Microbic loop; Nutrient recycling; Stoichiometry; Climate change; Aquatic biogeochemical models	PHOSPHORUS-DEFICIENT DIETS; SIZE-BASED DYNAMICS; MICROBIAL LOOP; PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES; EUTROPHICATION MODEL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER-QUALITY; FOOD WEBS; ZOOPLANKTON; LAKES	The prolonged stratification of lakes due to climate warming is expected to increase the dependence of planktonic food webs on internal nutrient regeneration mechanisms (i.e., microbial mineralization, zooplankton excretion). Our current conceptualization of aquatic communities, however, suggests that while the strength of the recycling feedback loop is indeed related to climate forcing, other biotic factors (e.g., zooplankton community composition) along with the system productivity may also be equally important. What do the contemporary operational models predict about the role of recycling rates in different trophic environments? How tight is the relationship between mineralization rates and lake warming? How realistically do modelers describe the mechanisms by which nutrients in non-living organic matter are recycled into inorganic forms? Our study addresses these questions using a complex biogeochemical model that simulates multiple elemental cycles (C, N, P, Si, O), multiple functional phytoplankton (diatoms, green algae and cyanobacteria) and zooplankton (copepods and cladocerans) groups. We relaxed the assumption of strict zooplankton homeostasis by allowing nutrient use efficiency to vary with food quality. Our analysis shows that the nutrient regeneration rates can play a major role in planktonic food webs, but their relative importance is somewhat inconsistent with the existing paradigm. We provide evidence that the recycled material and the associated energy fluxes can be significant drivers in low as well as in high-productivity ecosystems depending on the period of the year examined. Warmer climatic conditions and longer stratification periods will increase the dependence of lakes on nutrient regeneration rates. The lake productivity response, however, is non-linear and non-monotonic and is modulated by the type of nutrient limitation (nitrogen or phosphorus) experienced. Our study concludes by pinpointing some problems of the existing mathematical representation of the recycling rates, and emphasizes the need to improve our understanding of the interplay among microbial metabolism, trophic state, and lake thermal structure.

The likelihood of accomplishing the management objectives simultaneously is assessed using Bayesian networks. The objectives of good ecological status in winter-time total nitrogen and phosphorus, summer-time chlorophyll-a and summer-time Secchi depth have not been met yet. In addition, the results indicate that it is unlikely for them to be achieved in the near future, despite the decreasing trend in nutrient concentrations over the past few years. It was demonstrated that neither phosphorus nor nitrogen alone controls summertime plankton growth. Reaching good ecological status in nutrients does not necessarily lead to good ecological status of chlorophyll-a, even though a dependency between the parameters does exist. In addition, secchi-depth status is strongly related to chlorophyll-a status in three of the four study-areas.

J	Ciou, SK; Kuo, JT; Hsieh, PH; Yu, GH				Ciou, Shih-Kai; Kuo, Jan-Tai; Hsieh, Pin-Hui; Yu, Gwo-Hsing			Optimization Model for BMP Placement in a Reservoir Watershed	JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Best management practices (BMPs); Abatement and removal; Optimization model; Non-point-source pollution; Reservoir; Algorithm	NONPOINT-SOURCE POLLUTION; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; TAIWAN; DESIGN	The purpose of this study was to develop an optimization model for the optimal placement of structural best management practices (BMPs) at the watershed scale for a reservoir. In this research, the authors considered three types of structural BMPs (i.e., a wet detention pond, a grass swale, and an infiltration trench). The complete model consists of three interacting submodels: a watershed water quality simulation model [the Hydrologic Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF) model], a reservoir water quality model (the CE-QUAL-W2 model); and an optimization model that uses a well-developed genetic algorithm (GA) software. This research used the Feitsui Reservoir and its watershed in northern Taiwan as the area of application. For the optimization model, the objective function was to minimize the total annual cost of BMPs, within the constraints of achieving minimum water quality standards for the concentrations of phosphorus, ammonium, nitrate-nitrite and for the total suspended solids in the reservoir. The study first simulated the discharge and pollutant loads for the watershed in 2002-2003 by using HSPF. The reservoir model CE-QUAL-W2 was then used to simulate variations in pollutant concentrations in the reservoir on the basis of the input discharge and pollutant loads from HSPF. The optimization model was finally used to search for the near-optimal selection and placement of BMPs in the watershed. The results obtained from the completed model effectively demonstrate its viability in improving water quality in the reservoir by adopting optimal BMPs placement strategies.

Combining lake and watershed characteristics with Landsat TM data for remote estimation of regional lake clarity	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Water quality; Maine; New England; Remote sensing; Assessment tool	WISCONSIN; QUALITY; IMAGERY	Water clarity is a reliable indicator of lake productivity and an ideal metric of regional water quality. Clarity is an indicator of other water quality variables including chlorophyll-a, total phosphorus and trophic status; however, unlike these metrics, clarity can be accurately and efficiently estimated remotely on a regional scale. Remote sensing is useful in regions containing a large number of lakes that are cost prohibitive to monitor regularly using traditional field methods. Field-assessed lakes generally are easily accessible and may represent a spatially irregular, non-random sample of a region. We developed a remote monitoring program for Maine lakes >8 ha (1511 lakes) to supplement existing field monitoring programs. We combined Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) brightness values for TM bands 1 (blue) and 3 (red) to estimate water clarity (secchi disk depth) during 1990-2010. Although similar procedures have been applied to Minnesota and Wisconsin lakes, neither state incorporates physical lake variables or watershed characteristics that potentially affect clarity into their models. Average lake depth consistently improved model fitness, and the proportion of wetland area in lake watersheds also explained variability in clarity in some cases. Nine regression models predicted water clarity (R-2=0.69-0.90) during 1990-2010, with separate models for eastern (TM path 11; four models) and western Maine (TM path 12; five models that captured differences in topography and landscape disturbance. Average absolute difference between model-estimated and observed secchi depth ranged 0.65-1.03 m. Eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes consistently were estimated more accurately than oligotrophic lakes. Our results show that TM bands 1 and 3 can be used to estimate regional lake water clarity outside the Great Lakes Region and that the accuracy of estimates is improved with additional model variables that reflect physical lake characteristics and watershed conditions.

In a theoretical model, we extend the traditional Faustmann rotation model to include the possibility of leaving an unharvested riparian buffer zone between the clearcut area and the watercourse to reduce nutrient load damages to the watercourse and increase biodiversity benefits in the buffer zone. We then analyze how the optimal rotation age and the optimal size of the buffer zone are chosen simultaneously. In an empirical analysis, we use Finnish data including simulation results of nitrogen loads to find the socially optimal solution with a numerical model. Biodiversity is valuated as a willingness to pay for retention trees left in the buffer zone. According to the empirical results, in the social optimum it is not optimal to allocate any land to an unharvested buffer zone when we consider the reduction of the nitrogen load as the only benefit provided by the buffer zone. However, when we add the biodiversity benefits into the empirical analysis, the optimal size of the buffer zone is 4% of the area in the social optimum. FOR. Sci. 58(4):342-352.

Supervised and Unsupervised Artificial Neural Networks for Analysis of Diatom Abundance in Tropical Putrajaya Lake, Malaysia	SAINS MALAYSIANA			English	Article						Diatom; forecasting; recurrent artificial neural network; self organizing maps	PHYTOPLANKTON; RIVER; COMMUNITY	Five years of data from 2001 until 2006 of warm unstratified shallow, oligotrophic to mesothropic tropical Putrajaya Lake, Malaysia were used to study pattern discovery and forecasting of the diatom abundance using supervised and unsupervised artificial neural networks. Recurrent artificial neural network (RANN) was used for the supervised artificial neural network and Kohonen Self Organizing Feature Maps (SOM) was used for unsupervised artificial neural network. RANN was applied for forecasting of diatom abundance. The RANN performance was measured in terms of root mean square error (RMSE) and the value reported was 29.12 cell/mL. Classification and clustering by SOM and sensitivity analysis from the RANN were used to reveal the relationship among water temperature, pH, nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration, chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration and diatom abundance. The results indicated that the combination of supervised and unsupervised artificial neural network is important not only for forecasting algae abundance but also in reasoning and understanding ecological relationships. This in return will assist in better management of lake water quality.	[Sapiyan, B.

Several menus allow the user to choose the model type, to specify the input and output files, and to set all of the variables involved in the model parameterization and inversion. The optimization technique allows the user to retrieve the maps of chlorophyll concentration, suspended particulate matter concentration, coloured dissolved organic matter absorption and, in case of shallow waters, bottom depth and distributions of up to three different types of substrate, defined by the user according to their albedo. The software requires input image data that must be atmospherically corrected to remote sensing reflectance values. For both deep and shallow water models, a map of the relative error involved in the inversion procedure is also given. The tool was originally intended to estimate water quality in lakes: however thanks to its general design, it can be applied to any other aquatic environments (e.g., coastal zones, estuaries, lagoons) for which remote sensing reflectance values are known. BOMBER is fully programmed in IDL (Interactive Data Language) and uses IDL widgets as graphical user interface. It runs as an add-on tool for the ENVI+IDL image processing software and is available on request. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Chemical analyses and toxicity bioassays with elutriates were performed with sediments from the area where the three pillars of the viaduct will be located (CT1, CT2 and CT3) and a reference sediment (A2). Acute toxicity of the elutriate was evaluated in five species of three trophic levels (Isochrysis galbana, Paracentrotus lividus, Mytilus galloprovincialis, Venerupis pullastra and Siriella armata). The sediments of the pillars showed moderate levels of contamination by trace elements (Cu, Cr). Clam and sea urchin embryo-larval toxicity tests showed slightly higher sensitivity than mussel embryo tests, and toxicity was not detected for phytoplankton and mysid bioassays. The predicted no-effect environmental concentration (PNEC) was calculated from the arithmetic mean of the lowest calculated EC(50)s for each sampling site. The predicted environmental concentration (PEC) was estimated from a simple dilution model and the PEC/PNEC ratio was calculated according to different scenarios of resuspension. Negligible ecological risk in the water column is expected during construction of the pillars.

Approximate Water and Chemical Budgets for an Experimental, In-pond Raceway System	JOURNAL OF THE WORLD AQUACULTURE SOCIETY			English	Article							CHANNEL CATFISH PONDS; OREOCHROMIS-NILOTICUS; ICTALURUS-PUNCTATUS; AQUACULTURE SYSTEMS; STOCKING DENSITY; FISH; PHOSPHORUS; QUALITY; TURNOVER; NITROGEN	There is increasing interest in intensive production of Ictalurid catfish in the United States and a better understanding of water quality dynamics in intensive culture is needed. Budgets for water, nitrogen, and phosphorus were estimated over a production season (MarchNovember) for an In-pond Raceway System for channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, and hybrid catfish, I. punctatusXI. furcatus, with co-culture of paddlefish, Polyodon spathula, and Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. In addition to the rainfall and runoff, 70 cm of water was applied from a well to offset evaporation and seepage. Production of each kilogram of live catfish required 1.50 kg of feed and released 51.7 g nitrogen and 9.7 g phosphorus. Harvest of catfish accounted for 34.0% of nitrogen and 37.1% of phosphorus applied in feed. Seepage and overflow removed only small portions of nitrogen and phosphorus, while denitrification and ammonia volatilization removed large amounts of nitrogen. Some nitrogen accumulated in sediment. Phosphorus was harvested in fish and absorbed by pond sediment. Mechanical aeration aided in maintaining appropriate dissolved oxygen levels for fish production.

Parameter sensitivity analysis and prediction error in field-scale NO3-N modelling	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Hydrology; Water quality; NO3-N leaching; DRAINMOD-N; Sensitivity analysis; Prediction error; GLUE (Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimator)	FORECASTING UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT; GLUE METHODOLOGY; CATCHMENT-SCALE; DRAINMOD-N; NITRATE; GROUNDWATER; NITROGEN; WATER; CROP; IDENTIFICATION	The hydrologic and nitrate (NO3-N) leaching dynamics of a maize field were respectively modelled with DRAINMOD and DRAINMOD-N. Experimental data of a 3-year period were available for model calibration and evaluation. Data from the first two years were used for model calibration whilst data from the remaining year were used for an initial evaluation. Data collected before the 3-year experiment, during a 23-year period, were used for further "backward" (in time) evaluation. The hydrologic module was calibrated through a trial and error approach. The NO3-N leaching module was calibrated and evaluated with a Monte Carlo simulations based approach. Nine parameters describing the leaching process were studied. In total, 10,000 parameter sets were tried out. The analysis revealed an acceptable prediction of the observed drainage and NO3-N leaching time series throughout both the 3-year experimental period as well as the prior 23-year "backward" evaluation period. Nevertheless, the analysis revealed that no single set of optimal parameter values could be identified. It was found that the model performance is only sensitive to the rate of denitrification. Narrow NO3-N prediction intervals were obtained, even in the longer 23-year ("backward") evaluation period. Apparently, the behavioural DRAIN MOD-N simulations were able to acceptably reproduce the limited to moderate NO3-N leaching fluctuations that occur in the modelled system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, the effects of storm events on riverine nitrogen (N) dynamics are poorly understood. In this study, the riverine N dynamics and storm effects in a large subtropical river (North Jiulong River, southeastern China) were investigated through continuous sampling of two storm events which occurred in June 2010 and June 2011. The results disclosed a strong linkage between N dynamics and hydrological controls and watershed characteristics. The extreme storm in June 2010 resulted in more fluctuations in N concentrations, loads, and composition, compared with the moderate storm in June 2011. There were contrasting patterns (e.g., the hysteresis effect) between nitrate and ammonium behavior in storm runoff, reflecting their different supply source and transport mechanism. Overall, nitrate supply originated from subsurface runoff and was dominated by within-channel mobilization, while ammonium was mainly from over-land sources and flushed by surface runoff. Extreme storm runoff (2010) caused a four-fold increase in dissolved inorganic N fluxes (DIN), with a greater fraction of ammonium (up to 30% of DIN) compared with the moderate storm and background flow condition (less than 15%). Storm-driven sharp increases of N loads and changes in nutrient stoichiometry (more ammonium) might have been connected with algal blooms in the adjacent estuary and Xiamen Bay. Combined with the background flow measurement of N gradients along the main river and a stream together with anthropogenic N load information, the interactive effect of hydrological and biogeochemical process on riverine N was preliminarily revealed. Current results suggested that storm runoff N was controlled by rainfall, hydrological condition, antecedent soil moisture, spatial variability of land-based N source, and damming. These findings could be used as a reference for future water quality monitoring programs and the development of a pollution mitigation strategy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Kyeongan watershed in South Korea was investigated to evaluate the relationship between the total impervious area (TIA) and the aquatic ecosystem of the watershed, including water quality and aquatic life using a relatively high-resolution (0.4m) image. The TIA was found to be approximately 12% of the watershed, which indicates that the quality of its environment was being adversely affected by it. For water quality, Pearson correlation analyses showed that all water quality parameters studied were found to be positively correlated with TIA at p < 0.01, except for nitrate (NO3-). In addition, the zone with a higher TIA was found to have worse water quality. Some water quality parameters, such as nitrite (NO2-), total phosphorus, and phosphate (PO43-) were highly affected by discharges from wastewater treatment plants. Water quality data suggest that TIA could be used to predict the water quality of streams. For ecological parameters, the diatom index for organic pollution and trophic diatom index were found to be highly correlated with TIA, whereas physical habitat and benthic macroinvertebrates were poorly correlated with TIA. However, the results indicate that the extent of impervious cover can be a useful indicator for predicting the status of specific ecosystem of streams. Water Environ. Res., 84, 635 (2012).

Modeling the impacts of climate change on nitrogen retention in a 4th order stream	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article							WATER-QUALITY MODEL; CATCHMENT SCALE; RIVER; DENITRIFICATION; SEDIMENTS; POLLUTION; DYNAMICS; REMOVAL	Climate induced changes of temperature, discharge and nitrogen concentration may change natural denitrification processes in river systems. Until now seasonal variation of N-retention by denitrification under different climate scenarios and the impact of river morphology on denitrification have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study climate scenarios (dry, medium and wet) have been used to characterize changing climatic and flow conditions for the period 2050-2054 in the 4th order stream Weie Elster, Germany. Present and future periods of nitrogen turnover were simulated with the WASP5 river water quality model. Results revealed that, for a dry climate scenario, the mean denitrification rate was 71% higher in summer (low flow period between 2050 and 2054) and 51% higher in winter (high flow period) compared to the reference period. For the medium and wet climate scenarios, denitrification was slightly higher in summer (3% and 4%) and lower in winter (9% and 3% for medium and wet scenarios, respectively). Additionally, the variability of denitrification rates was higher in summer compared to winter conditions. For a natural river section, denitrification was a factor of 1.22 higher than for a canalized river reach. Besides, weirs along the river decrease the denitrification rate by 16% in July for dry scenario conditions. In the 42 km study reach, N-retention through denitrification amounted to 5.1% of the upper boundary N load during summer low flow conditions in the reference period. For the future dry climate scenario this value increased up to 10.2% and for the medium climate scenario up to 5.4%. In our case study the investigated climate scenarios showed that future discharge changes may have a larger impact on denitrification rates than future temperature changes. Overall results of the study revealed the significance of climate change in regulating the magnitude, seasonal pattern and variability of nitrogen retention. The results provide guidance for managing nitrogen related environmental problems for present and future climate conditions.

Recent studies have demonstrated that there is generally no unambiguous relationship between plant species composition and specific environmental conditions in rivers. Nevertheless, indices of environmental pressures based on macrophytes are flourishing, because of the requirements of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). 2. We first reviewed nine such indices against 13 criteria for bioindicators. Then, using data from France and England, we tested whether the IBMR (Macrophyte Biological Index for Rivers) and LEAFPACS (predictions and classification system for macrophytes) methods could reliably indicate nutrient and hydromorphological pressures. Finally, we used an improved bootstrapping method to estimate accuracy. 3. Currently, most indices lack ecological meaning for a variety of reasons, including partial sampling (backwaters are excluded); reliance on list of taxa (there are identification difficulties) rather than structure and functions; correlation rather than causation; application within a limited biogeographical area; reliance on expert judgement; high precision but poor accuracy; poorly defined reference conditions; lack of independent tests; and an inability to discriminate reliably between the target pressures of interest from confounding background variables. 4. IBMR was a far better indicator of pH (or HCO3-pCO2) than it was of soluble reactive phosphorus, SRP (or SRP-NH4). While there was a highly significant correlation between IBMR and SRP after removing the effect of pH, the relationship was weak (r2 = 0.08, n = 215, P < 0.001). 5. LEAFPACS is a multi-metric method summing up five individual indices, each compliant with the WFD. Its individual metrics were not better correlated with nutrient and hydromorphological pressures (with r2 < 0.1, n = 62, P < 0.05) than was the IBMR. The meaning of the overall metric is questionable. 6. There are problems in determining the precision of the indices, owing to uncertainties in recording, but they are less than the uncertainties in determining accuracy (because species optima and tolerances are sometimes poorly known). 7. Reliable information is needed to improve the state of our rivers. Macrophyte indices are able to detect statistically significant pressures from a large population of sites but cannot be applied at specific sites, as required by the WFD, owing to large uncertainties and low explanatory power. Typically, more than 90% of the variability in macrophyte indices is attributed to factors other than human pressure. The WFD would be better served by a simpler, holistic approach based on our current mechanistic understanding of river processes. These findings are likely to apply also to other taxonomic groups (macroinvertebrates, diatoms, fish) used in the assessment of purported ecological quality and to palaeolimnological measures of reference status.

The primary sources of pollution in Taihu Lake are its inflow rivers and their tributaries. Effective water quality improvement programs need to be implemented in these rivers to improve the water quality of Taihu Lake, and to ensure sustainable development in the region. To ensure effectiveness and efficiency, it is important that the optimal water quality improvement program for a specific situation be selected. The aim of this study was to facilitate the selection of this optimal program. The QUAL2K model for river and stream water quality was used to simulate the effects of a range of water quality improvement scenarios in the Hongqi River, which is a polluted tributary in the Taihu Lake Basin. These scenarios consisted of a series of three water treatment technologies in different configurations, from upstream to downstream. The results showed that the optimal scenario comprised a bio-contact oxidation system upstream, followed by an ecological floating bed, and a vertical moveable eco-bed downstream. The reduction rates achieved by this scenario for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) were 49.50%, 32.81%, 35.94%, and 45.27%, respectively. The QUAL2K model proved to be an effective tool in the comparative evaluation of potential water quality improvement programs. The method applied in this study can prevent the implementation of water quality improvement programs that would not achieve the desired goals. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Determining E. coli burden on pasture in a headwater catchment: Combined field and modelling approach	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Burden; Critical source area; Delivery; E. coli; Headwater catchment; Source; Water quality	ESCHERICHIA-COLI; WATER-QUALITY; PATHOGENIC BACTERIA; CATTLE EXCRETA; ENTEROCOCCI; PHOSPHORUS; INDICATOR; POLLUTION; FECES; SOIL	Empirical monitoring studies of catchment-scale Escherichia coli burden to land from agriculture are scarce. This is not surprising given the complexity associated with the temporal and spatial heterogeneity in the excretion of livestock faecal deposits and variability in microbial content of faeces. However, such information is needed to appreciate better how land management and landscape features impact on water quality draining agricultural landscapes. The aim of this study was to develop and test a field-based protocol for determining the burden of E. coli in a small headwater catchment in the UK. Predictions of E. coli burden using an empirical model based on previous best estimates of excretion and shedding rates were also evaluated against observed data. The results indicated that an empirical model utilising key parameters was able to satisfactorily predict E. coli burden on pasture most of the time, with 89% of observed values falling within the minimum and maximum range of predicted values. In particular, the overall temporal pattern of E. coli burden on pasture is captured by the model. The observed and predicted values recorded a disagreement of > 1 order of magnitude on only one of the nine sampling dates throughout an annual period. While a first approximation of E. coli burden to land, this field-based protocol represents one of the first comprehensive approaches for providing a real estimate of a dynamic microbial reservoir at the headwater catchment scale and highlights the utility of a simple dynamic empirical model for a more economical prediction of catchment-scale E. coli burden.

The model was developed to provide reasonable estimates across the whole of Europe based on readily accessible datasets, and that would be amenable to application within a gridded model of water quality loadings to surface waters. The export coefficient models for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphors (TP) were fitted to data from European Union European Environment Agency databases of 79106 selected river basins around Europe depending on the variable in question. Estimated export coefficients were on a reasonable level with estimates made by other methods within Europe. Firstly, it was shown that runoff, number of livestock and point load were common factors for BOD, TP and TN loads with runoff as the most important factor. Secondly, cropland area also contributed to diffuse TN load. Thirdly, average slope steepness and runoff, as a combined factor, had a negative effect on diffuse TP load. Fourthly, lake area reduced diffuse loads because of retention mechanisms in lakes. A larger set of data with higher spatial and temporal resolution and partitioning of the data based on, e.g. climate or spatial patterns would further improve the precision of the export coefficient estimates. When applied at the catchment scale, the parameters should be updated with local data. In the long run, adaptive modelling should be applied in order to fit the model to continuously accumulating data and experience, although the study showed that the export coefficients derived were stable over time. It is also advisable to integrate the administrative monitoring, modelling and management of river basins more closely to improve data availability, model predictions and cost efficiency of management measures and policies.

Loadings come from point (domestic effluent, manufacturing discharge and urban runoff) and diffuse (scattered settlements and land use) sources. The loads have been calculated on a countrywide basis using readily available data held by national and international bodies. These loads are downscaled to the grid cells (5 x 5') used in the model. The paper illustrates the general framework for making these calculations using biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and total dissolved solids (TDS), and estimated loads for periods representing 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005 are presented as maps. According to the model, in 2005, annual BOD loads came mostly from domestic effluent (3?Mt) and diffuse sources (5?Mt, mainly attributed to livestock). Manufacturing, urban runoff and scattered settlements contributed annual loads of 0.33, 0.15 and 1.2?Mt, respectively. For TDS, annual manufacturing loads were 65?Mt and annual domestic loads 28?Mt. Diffuse loadings (36?Mt) came from irrigated land and therefore showed a different spatial pattern from BOD. The total annual diffuse load of TDS was 56?Mt. Scattered settlements contributed only 9.6?Mt to the total pan-European load. Some limited comparison of the loads estimated in this study for BOD with those estimated by others for countries and large catchments in the area has been carried out.

Evaluation of targeting methods for implementation of best management practices in the Saginaw River Watershed	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Critical source area; Best management practice; Targeting method; Saginaw River Watershed; Relative sensitivity index	CRITICAL SOURCE AREAS; MODEL; SOIL; QUALITY; RUNOFF; TOOL	Increasing concerns regarding water quality in the Great Lakes region are mainly due to changes in urban and agricultural landscapes. Both point and non-point sources contribute pollution to Great Lakes surface waters. Best management practices (BMPs) are a common tool used to reduce both point and non-point source pollution and improve water quality. Meanwhile, identification of critical source areas of pollution and placement of BMPs plays an important role in pollution reduction. The goal of this study is to evaluate the performance of different targeting methods in 1) identifying priority areas (high, medium. and low) based on various factors such as pollutant concentration, load, and yield, 2) comparing pollutant (sediment, total nitrogen-TN, and total phosphorus-TP) reduction in priority areas defined by all targeting methods, 3) determine the BMP relative sensitivity index among all targeting methods. Ten BMPs were implemented in the Saginaw River Watershed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model following identification of priority areas. Each targeting method selected distinct high priority areas based on the methodology of implementation. The concentration based targeting method was most effective at reduction of TN and TP, likely because it selected the greatest area of high priority for BMP implementation. The subbasin load targeting method was most effective at reducing sediment because it tended to select large, highly agricultural subbasins for BMP implementation. When implementing BMPs, native grass and terraces were generally the most effective, while conservation tillage and residue management had limited effectiveness. The BMP relative sensitivity index revealed that most combinations of targeting methods and priority areas resulted in a proportional decrease in pollutant load from the subbasin level and watershed outlet. However, the concentration and yield methods were more effective at subbasin reduction, while the stream load method was more effective at reducing pollutants at the watershed outlet. The results of this study indicate that emphasis should be placed on selection of the proper targeting method and BMP to meet the needs and goals of a BMP implementation project because different targeting methods produce varying results.

Water quality targets and maintenance of valued landscape character - Experience in the Axe catchment, UK	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Water Framework Directive; SWAT; Modelling; Nitrate; Phosphorous; Landscape	PHOSPHORUS; MODEL; SEDIMENT; CAPABILITIES; AGRICULTURE; SIMULATIONS; RETENTION; NITROGEN; RISK; SOIL	The Water Framework Directive (WFD) (Directive 2000/60/EC) requires new ecological standards for rivers, lakes and coastal waters by 2015. In the United Kingdom the English Catchment Sensitive Farming Initiative has identified 40 catchments which are at risk of failing the European Commission WFD targets for good ecological status of water bodies because of a range of issues. The river Axe catchment situated in south-west England, with a mixture of diffuse and point sources of pollution, is one of these priority sites, as intensive dairy farming and cultivation of high risk crops (maize) cause problems with enhanced suspended sediment, nitrate and phosphorus levels in the river. Much of the Axe is under national and county landscape designations, making land use or management measures taken to achieve river status sensitive to these designations. For the purpose of this research the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT-2005) was used. The baseline scenario was based on field observation and interviews with the Environment Agency and farmers; it was run with and without point sources. Three different mitigation scenarios, designed to maintain the landscape of the catchment, were then tested. Field buffer strips (FBS), extensive land use management (EXT) and sheep land use management (SHP), were used to assess the effectiveness of the measures in reducing nutrient loads in the river Axe, UK. Management scenarios reduced the average annual loads at the main catchment outlet by 21.2% (FBS), 37.3% (EXT) and 45.0% (SHP), for total nitrogen and 47.7% (FBS), 60.6% (EXT) and 62.4% (SHP) for total phosphorus. The results of this study suggest that there may be a fundamental incompatibility between the delivery of WFD targets and the maintenance of viable agricultural systems necessary to maintain landscapes which are highly valued for their aesthetic, recreational and economic value.

Hydrological modeling of the Mun River basin in Thailand	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Nutrient; HSPF; Hydrology; Land use; River water quality; Mun River basin	HSPF; WATERSHEDS; SIMULATION; TRANSPORT; EXPORT; NITROGEN; RUNOFF	Sources of pollution in river basins are increasing due to rapid changes in land uses and excessive nutrient application to crops which lead to degraded instream water quality. In this connection, the Mun River basin, one of the important and largest river basins in Thailand, has been studied. Comparative figures of nutrients in the Mun's water over a decade showed an increased total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) ratio in the Lower Mun region (TN:TP > 14). Laboratory analysis of weekly water samples showed a realistic nutrient response when daily rainfall was compared to the seasonal water quality data collected by the Pollution Control Department (PCD). The Hydrologic Simulation Program - FORTRAN (HSPF) was calibrated and used to assess the effects of different land uses on river water quality. Model parameters related to hydrology and sediment were calibrated and validated using relevant measurements by the Royal Irrigation Department (RID). With a reasonable and acceptable model performance (r(2) = 0.62), the highest simulated runoff was observed in urban areas. The trend of agricultural land (as a percentage of total area) - total nitrogen showed a linear relationship of a good correlation (i.e. r(2) = 0.85). Based on the findings, it can be concluded that this model is expected to provide vital information for developing suitable land management policies and strategies to improve river water quality.

We used the biogeochemical model, PnET-BGC, to evaluate the effects of potential future changes in temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and atmospheric CO2 on pools, concentrations, and fluxes of major elements at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, United States. Future climate projections used to run PnET-BGC were generated specifically for the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest with a statistical technique that downscales climate output (e. g., air temperature, precipitation, solar radiation) from atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) to a finer temporal and spatial resolution. These climate projections indicate that over the twenty-first century, average air temperature will increase at the site by 1.7 degrees C to 6.5 degrees C with simultaneous increases in annual average precipitation ranging from 4 to 32 cm above the long-term mean (1970-2000). PnET-BGC simulations under future climate change show a shift in hydrology characterized by later snowpack development, earlier spring discharge (snowmelt), greater evapotranspiration, and a slight increase in annual water yield (associated with CO2 effects on vegetation). Model results indicate that under elevated temperature, net soil nitrogen mineralization and nitrification markedly increase, resulting in acidification of soil and stream water, thereby altering the quality of water draining from forested watersheds. Invoking a CO2 fertilization effect on vegetation under climate change substantially mitigates watershed nitrogen loss, highlighting the need for a more thorough understanding of CO2 effects on forest vegetation.

J	Chen, DJ; Dahlgren, RA; Shen, YN; Lu, J				Chen, Dingjiang; Dahlgren, Randy A.; Shen, Yena; Lu, Jun			A Bayesian approach for calculating variable total maximum daily loads and uncertainty assessment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Bayesian statistics; Total maximum daily load; Water quality variability; Uncertainty; Nonpoint source pollution; Total nitrogen	NONPOINT-SOURCE POLLUTION; PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY; NITROGEN; RIVER; ATTENUATION; VARIABILITY; MANAGEMENT; RETENTION; FRAMEWORK; DELIVERY	To account for both variability and uncertainty in nonpoint source pollution, one dimensional water quality model was integrated with Bayesian statistics and load duration curve methods to develop a variable total maximum daily load (TMDL) for total nitrogen (TN). Bayesian statistics was adopted to inversely calibrate the unknown parameters in the model, i.e., area-specific export rate (E) and in-stream loss rate coefficient (K) for TN, from the stream monitoring data. Prior distributions for E and K based on published measurements were developed to support Bayesian parameter calibration. Then the resulting E and K values were used in water quality model for simulation of catchment TN export load, TMDL and required load reduction along with their uncertainties in the ChangLe River agricultural watershed in eastern China. Results indicated that the export load. TMDL and required load reduction for TN synchronously increased with increasing stream water discharge. The uncertainties associated with these estimates also presented temporal variability with higher uncertainties for the high flow regime and lower uncertainties for the low flow regime. To assure 90% compliance with the targeted in-stream TN concentration of 2.0 mg L-1, the required load reduction was determined to be 1.7 x 10(3), 4.6 x 10(3), and 14.6 x 10(3) kg TN d(-1) for low, median and high flow regimes, respectively. The integrated modeling approach developed in this study allows decision makers to determine the required load reduction for different TN compliance levels while incorporating both flow-dependent variability and uncertainty assessment to support practical adaptive implementation of TMDL programs.

Predicting impacts of increased CO2 and climate change on the water cycle and water quality in the semiarid James River Basin of the Midwestern USA	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						CO2; Groundwater recharge; Nitrate nitrogen; Soil water content; SWAT	CHANGE SENSITIVITY ASSESSMENT; ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE; UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS; MODEL DEVELOPMENT; SOIL-MOISTURE; ELEVATED CO2; SWAT MODEL; LAND-USE; ET-AL; RUNOFF	Emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols from human activities continue to alter the climate and likely will have significant impacts on the terrestrial hydrological cycle and water quality, especially in arid and semiarid regions. We applied an improved Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to evaluate impacts of increased atmospheric CO2 concentration and potential climate change on the water cycle and nitrogen loads in the semiarid James River Basin (JRB) in the Midwestern United States. We assessed responses of water yield, soil water content, groundwater recharge, and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) load under hypothetical climate-sensitivity scenarios in terms of CO2, precipitation, and air temperature. We extended our predictions of the dynamics of these hydrological variables into the mid-21st century with downscaled climate projections integrated across output from six General Circulation Models. Our simulation results compared against the baseline period 1980 to 2009 suggest the JRB hydrological system is highly responsive to rising levels of CO2 concentration and potential climate change. Under our scenarios, substantial decrease in precipitation and increase in air temperature by the mid-21st century could result in significant reduction in water yield, soil water content, and groundwater recharge. Our model also estimated decreased NO3-N load to streams, which could be beneficial, but a concomitant increase in NO3-N concentration due to a decrease in streamflow likely would degrade stream water and threaten aquatic ecosystems. These results highlight possible risks of drought, water supply shortage, and water quality degradation in this basin. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Using the result of a water quality survey at the entrance and the outlet of a small pond receiving agricultural drainage water, the Seneque/Riverstrahler biogeochemical model was shown to accurately simulate the observed 30% reduction in nitrogen fluxes crossing this pond. The model was then used to simulate the effect of various scenarios of pond restoration (inspired by their 18th century geographical distribution as revealed by the Cassini map) on surface water nitrate contamination at different spatial scales. In regions with an impermeable lithological substrate, the restoration of ponds at a density of 5% of the agricultural area would reduce the riverine nitrogen export by up to 25% on an annual basis. It is suggested that such waterscape management, used in conjunction with more preventive measures, can be a useful means to reduce nitrate contamination of water resources. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Impact of suspended sediment and nutrient loading from land uses against water quality in the Hii River basin, Japan	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Annual load discharge; Lake water environment; Monthly load variations; Modeling approach; SWAT; Watershed management	FRESH-WATER; ASSESSMENT-TOOL; SURFACE WATERS; MODEL; EUTROPHICATION; MARINE; PHOSPHORUS; LAKES; ENVIRONMENTS; LIMITATION	Lake Shinji lies in eastern Shimane Prefecture, and is typical of brackish lakes in Japan. Water quality of the lake does not meet the expected environmental standards for total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), even though the national and prefectural governments have tried to improve water quality by developing maintenance scenarios for sewage, plant effluent, agricultural activity, and forestry. Consequently, detailed data of nutrient loading to the lake from river inflows is crucial to support strategies for improving the lake water environment. The Hii River contributes approximately 80% of the discharge flowing into the lake. In this study, we examine the Hii River catchment with a focus on land uses such as paddy fields, upland fields, residential areas, and forestry. Average annual discharges of suspended sediment (SS), TN, and TP loads were determined at Otsu, near the outlet of the basin into Lake Shinji. We also determined average yield per unit area of SS, TN, and TP loads from each land use. Yields per unit area from upland areas were the greatest, whereas yields from forests were the lowest. Forests were the largest contributor of SS, TN, and TP in the basin, because of its dominant land area. Upland fields had the second largest impact on these loads in the basin, because fertilizer applied to the fields is a major source of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). large differences in yields per unit area between fine and rainy day conditions were also observed, especially for SS and TP loads. Furthermore, we determined that a major pathway of N to the river was through groundwater, regardless of land use, whereas P was transported to the river with sediments, especially in paddy and upland fields. Based on these analyses, it will be difficult to reduce the SS load discharge in the basin in the future, because forestry is the major source. In contrast, N and P load reductions are straightforward, because the primary source is agricultural, and appropriate management of fertilizer application will be a key factor in reducing loads.

Using results from water quality monitoring at 24 sampling sites, we determined the first-order controls on these fluxes. Land cover with four classes (forest, agriculture, grassland and urban), dominant lithology (schist, marls, sandstone, limestone, alluvial sediments), physiographic indices (elevation, flow path length, ratio of flow path length to flow path gradient, topographic wetness index, and other), and a suite of hydrological indices (baseflow, flashiness index and runoff coefficient), were calculated and used as potential controls. Given the high co-dependence of the predictors, Partial Least Square Regression was used to shed light on the linkages between export fluxes and the metrics composed of the 19 selected catchment characteristics. The first-order controls were determined by calculating the Variable Influence on Projection (VIP). These values revealed that the overall dissolved inorganic nitrogen fluxes are controlled primarily by lithology, land cover, topographic wetness index and flow path length. The first-order controls of dissolved silica fluxes are runoff coefficient, average topographic slope and land cover. Fluxes of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved silica did not show any strong relation to catchment scale. Apart from the widely accepted effect of land cover, our results indicate that catchment topography has an essential impact on the fluxes of dissolved inorganic nitrogen. The ratio of flow path length and flow path gradient, previously suggested as a proxy of mean water transit time, exerted a relatively strong control on dissolved inorganic nitrogen fluxes (VIP > 1) with a negative relation to dissolved inorganic nitrogen fluxes, suggesting that dissolved inorganic nitrogen fluxes decrease with an increasing flow path gradient.

Irrigation water shortage is severe in North China Plain: however, livestock breeding farms have developed rapidly which generates a large number of livestock wastewater in this region. The majority wastewater without any treatment before discharging had caused serious pollution. Based on the swine wastewater treatment plant and the irrigation experiment of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) - summer maize (Zea mays L.) rotation conducted in Yangliuqing town. Tianjin. Parameters of Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) were calibrated and validated with obtained field data. The Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) of water contents and nitrate-N concentrations were at the range of 0.5% similar to 0.6% and 16.95 similar to 28.95 mg kg(-1), respectively. REs of wheat and maize yields and biomass were at the range of -16.1% similar to 10.53% and -48.17% similar to 13.19%, respectively. Compared with the former literatures, RZWQM model could simulate the soil moisture and nutrient dynamics and crop yield with swine wastewater irrigation in North China Plain. It could provide technical support for rational reuse swine wastewater resources. The pattern of treated livestock wastewater irrigation would not only alleviate the shortage of water resources and reduce the application of chemical fertilizers, but also control intensive livestock wastewater pollution effectively.

Adapting methodology to calculate contaminant loads of phosphorus in watersheds of Southern Brazil	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL			Portuguese	Article						Environmental licensing; TMDL; agricultural contamination	AGRICULTURAL PHOSPHORUS; ORGANIC-CARBON; EROSION; RUNOFF; SOIL; EUTROPHICATION; RAINFALL; NUTRIENT; LOSSES	The excess of phosphorus in the environment can cause several negative impacts, especially with regard to water quality. Hence adequate methodologies are needed for assessing this risk at the watershed scale, emphasizing that the non-point agricultural sources impose greater estimate difficulties. The objective of this work was to propose an adapted methodology to quantify the dissolved and total reactive phosphorus movement in agricultural areas, based on the influence of agricultural crops (arboreous and herbaceous size), native pasture and its management in the State of Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil). The methodology used was the study of reactive phosphorus release in plots covered by different crops and its relation to the methodology of calculation of maximum daily loads, currently accepted by the state environmental agencies for the environmental licensing of potentially polluting activities. The results show that the calculation of load of phosphorus contaminant currently in use, may be underestimating the Brazilian conditions, especially in Rio Grande do Sul, and that the new methodology allows one to include temporal variation as an element in the process of analysis, turning the licensing analysis into a dynamic and punctual process.

The ADAPT model is a daily time step, field-scale water table management model that was developed as an extension of the GLEAMS model. The GLEAMS algorithms were augmented with algorithms for subsurface drainage, subsurface irrigation, deep seepage, and related water quality processes. Recently, a frost depth algorithm was incorporated to enhance the model's capability to predict flow during spring and fall months. In addition to the normal GLEAMS output, ADAPT gives estimates of pesticides and nutrients in drainage. The model has four components: hydrology, erosion, nutrient transport, and pesticide transport. Predictions of surface runoff and subsurface drainage by ADAPT are very sensitive to hydrology input parameters, such as NRCS curve number, hydraulic conductivity, depth of the impeding layer, and hydraulic conductivity of the impeding layer In the erosion component, slope, hydraulic length, and crop management are the most sensitive factors. Nutrients generally follow the trends in surface runoff and subsurface drainage. In addition, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in soil horizons are sensitive to nutrient losses. Recently, the ADAPT model was further calibrated and validated in southern Minnesota to evaluate impacts of subsurface drain spacing and depth, rate and timing of nitrogen application, and precipitation changes on water quality. ADAPT is written in FORTRAN, and the source code is available to interested model users. Considering the limited technical support and text editor-based input files, development of a user-friendly interface to create input files would greatly enhance ADAPTS acceptability by users involved in modeling agricultural systems equipped with subsurface drains.

WATERSHED ASSESSMENT MODEL (WAM): MODEL USE, CALIBRATION, AND VALIDATION	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						GIS; Grid based; Hydrology; Land use; Nitrogen; Nutrient assimilation; Nutrient sources and cycling; Phosphorus; Water quality; Watershed modeling		The Watershed Assessment Model (WAM) is a GIS-based model that simulates the complex hydrology and water quality responses within a watershed based on detailed characterization data. The watershed is represented by a spatially scalable grid, for which one of three field-scale models determines the constituent (water, total suspended solids, biological oxygen demand, nitrogen, and phosphorus) balances of each cell on a daily basis. The constituents leaving each cell are subsequently transported via surface and subsurface flow to stream reaches using a topographic routing algorithm, accounting for the assimilative processes along the paths. The constituents reaching a stream are then routed through the reach network to the basin outfall. This algorithm handles dynamic water control structures, point sources, and complex branching and convergence. The outputs are reported at the source cell, as delivery to reaches, and as output from reaches. The application and calibration of the model for the C-139 basin in south Florida resulted in good matches between simulated and observed flows and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and loads at multiple outlet points around the basin, including multiple control structure operations and temporal TP concentration dynamics.

ROOT ZONE WATER QUALITY MODEL (RZWQM2): MODEL USE, CALIBRATION, AND VALIDATION	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						Hydrological modeling; Modeling; Model validation; Plant growth; RZWQM; Soil water movement	SOIL-NITROGEN BALANCE; FIELD-MEASURED DATA; SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE; LONG-TERM; TILE-DRAINAGE; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; ATRAZINE TRANSPORT; SIMULTANEOUS HEAT; APPLICATION RATES; NO3-N TRANSPORT	The Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) has been used widely for simulating agricultural management effects on crop production and soil and water quality. Although it is a one-dimensional model, it has many desirable features for the modeling community This article outlines the principles of calibrating the model component by component with one or more datasets and validating the model with independent datasets. Users should consult the RZWQM2 user manual distributed along with the model and a more detailed protocol on how to calibrate RZWQM2 provided in a book chapter Two case studies (or examples) are included in this article. One is from an irrigated maize study in Colorado to illustrate the use of field and laboratory measured soil hydraulic properties on simulated soil water and crop production. It also demonstrates the interaction between soil and plant parameters in simulated plant responses to water stresses. The other is from a maize-soybean rotation study in Iowa to show a manual calibration of the model for crop yield, soil water, and N leaching in tile-drained soils. Although the commonly used trial-and-error calibration method works well for experienced users, as shown in the second example, an automated calibration procedure is more objective, as shown in the first example. Furthermore, the incorporation of the Parameter Estimation Software (PEST) into RZWQM2 made the calibration of the model more efficient than a grid (ordered) search of model parameters. In addition, PEST provides sensitivity and uncertainty analyses that should help users in selecting the right parameters to calibrate.	[Ma, L.; Ahuja, L.

Howerver, because of the complexity of the lake water compositons and the interference between the different components, it is of great difficulty to get accurate results with the reflectance spectrum method developed recently. In the present paper, the authors firstly discussed the reflectance and polarization spectral feature of suspended sediment water body, found out the relations of the reflectance and the degree of polarization of water-leaving radiance and the concentration of suspended sediment at the sensitive bands. The authors also compared the effectiveness of the retrieval approaches based on reflectance and polarization in laboratory water body and Chaohu water body respectively. The results show that in the lake water body where the constituents are very complex, the polarization information has greater capacity of anti-jamming, therefore it will have great potential applictions in lake water quality remote sensing.

Using the Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender to develop and validate physically based indices for the delineation of critical management areas	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						APEX; critical areas; index; modeling; targeting	SOIL ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; TOPOGRAPHIC WETNESS INDEX; WATER-QUALITY; HYDRAULIC-PROPERTIES; HERBICIDE TRANSPORT; SPATIAL-PATTERNS; APEX MODEL; LONG-TERM; RUNOFF; PHOSPHORUS	Targeting critical management areas (CMAs) within cropped fields is essential to maximize production while implementing alternative management practices that will minimize impacts on water quality. The objective of this study was to develop physically based indices to identify CMAs in a 35 ha (88 ac) field characterized by a restrictive clay layer occurring within the upper 15 to 100 cm (6 to 40 in) and under a corn (Zea mays L.) soybean (Glycine max L.) crop rotation since 1991. Thirty-five subareas were defined based on slope, depth to claypan (CD), and soil mapping units. The Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) model was calibrated and validated from 1993 to 2002 using measured runoff, sediment, and atrazine loads, and crop yields. CMAs were delineated based on simulated subarea runoff, sediment, and atrazine loads. Correlation analysis was performed between simulated output by subarea and physical parameters, including CD, surface saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), and subarea slope (SL). Two indices were developed, the Conductivity Claypan Index (CCI; CD xKsat divided by SL) and the Claypan Index (CPI; CD divided by SL), to correlate with simulated crop yields, runoff, atrazine, and sediment loads. Together, these indices captured 100% of CMAs for simulated runoff and sediment yield and 60% of CMAs for simulated atrazine in surface runoff, as predicted by APEX. These critical areas also matched lower corn productivity areas. Management scenarios were simulated that differentiated the management of the CMAs from the rest of the field. Indices, such as these, for identifying areas of higher environmental risk and lower productivity could provide objective criteria for effective targeting of best management practices.

However, up to now, no environmental mechanism has been commonly accepted. Systematic and complete data sets of BGA blooms and environmental factors without any missing data are rare, which seriously affected previous studies. In this study, a bootstrapping based multiple imputation algorithm (EMB) was first applied to reconstruct a complete data set from the available data set with missing data, hence forming a basis for quantitatively relating BGA bloom to contributing factors. Then, the probability of RCA bloom outbreak was simulated using a binomial (or binary) logistic regression model, which is an effective tool for recognizing key contributing factors. The results suggest that 1) the outbreak frequency or probability of BGA bloom tends to first increase and then decrease with a turning point between June and September each year: 2) air temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation were significant positive factors correlated with outbreak frequency, whereas wind speed and the number of sunshine hours were negative factors: 3) water temperature had a strong positive effect on the probability of BGA bloom outbreak, whereas other water quality factors, such as concentrations of organics and nutrients, were not so significant. However, water quality factors, such as NO3-N, SD, pH, NH4-N. COD and DO, still need to be concerned, which had a potential to aggravate the outbreak of BGA bloom in Dianchi Lake, if they were out of control. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Sigua, GC; Coleman, SW; Chase, CC; Albano, J				Sigua, Gilbert C.; Coleman, Samuel W.; Chase, Chad C.; Albano, Joseph			Absence of negative environmental effects of increased soil P levels in cattle congregation zones	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Phosphorus; Total inorganic nitrogen; Phosphorus saturation; Landscape locations	SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; PHOSPHORUS SORPTION; SLOPE ASPECT; CARBON; PLANT; NITROGEN; HETEROGENEITY; PASTURES; WATER; VEGETATION	Determining soil nutrient distribution in pasture with beef cattle operation is critical to identifying which area is at risk of nitrogen or phosphorus buildup and loading. Characterizing spatial variability of soil nutrients in relations to landscape location is important for understanding the effects of future land use change on soil nutrients and water pollution. We hypothesized that cattle congregation site may have higher concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen than in the pasture and grazing site or the adjoining forest site. This study assessed levels of Mehlich-1 extractable P, total inorganic N, and soil P saturation in relation to landscape locations in subtropical beef cattle pasture. Soil samples were collected during the spring and fall of 2005 to 2007 from three 19 adjoining landscape sites that are associated with beef cattle operation. These sites consisted of three locations: congregation, grazing, and forest sites. The levels of extractable P, total inorganic N, and P saturation in soils varied with landscape location. Congregation site had the highest concentration of extractable P of 36.1 mg kg(-1), followed by grazing site of 17.7 mg kg(-1), and forest site of 8.2 mg kg(-1). Spatial distribution of total inorganic nitrogen across the landscape was higher for congregation site (2.3 mg kg(-1)) than forest site (0.9 mg kg(-1)) and grazing site (0.7 mg kg(-1)). The overall spatial distribution of extractable P from congregation site to forest site can be described by P = -4.2x + 45.8; (R-2 = 0.97**); the best-fit models for total inorganic N was 0.04x(2) - 0.6x + 3.5; (R-2 = 0.89**) and for soil P saturation was -3.6x + 36.2; (R-2 = 0.92**). Results show that the levels of extractable P, total inorganic nitrogen, and soil phosphorus saturation were decreasing from the congregation site to forest site. Although our results may have had supported our hypothesis that congregation site typical on Florida ranchers have greater concentrations of extractable P than in grazing site and forest site, the average extractable P at all three landscape locations did not exceed the crop requirement threshold of 36 mg kg(-1) and the water quality protection threshold of 150 mg kg(-1). Our current pasture management including cattle rotation in terms of grazing days and current fertilizer application had thus no negative environmental impact on landscape with cow-calf operation.

Nitrogen Dynamics in Irrigated Forage Systems Fertilized with Liquid Dairy Manure	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							OXIDE EMISSIONS; AMMONIA VOLATILIZATION; LIVESTOCK SLURRY; SOILS; CALIBRATION; FLUXES; CARBON; RZWQM; WATER	Optimal manure management that ensures adequate crop nutrition while avoiding pollution problems requires estimates of manure N availability. The present study was performed in the San Joaquin Valley (California) on three dairy forage production fields where liquid manure is applied together with flood irrigation water. The objective of this study was to determine the fate of manure N by combining field measurements with model simulations using the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM). The average annual N application to corn (Zea mays L.) and winter forage (oat [Avena sativa L.], triticale [xTriticosecale Wittmack], or Sudan grass [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench ssp. drummondii (Steud.) de Wet ex Davidse]) was 840 kg N ha(-1), while 490 kg N ha(-1) was removed with the harvested crops. The irrigation water input to corn ranged from 45 to 128 cm. The RZWQM described crop yield and N uptake well and accurately simulated the seasonal trends in soil moisture and mineral N content in the top 90 cm of the profile; however, the short-term changes and mineral N estimates for different soil layers were not accurate. For soil nutrient and water dynamics, sites-pecific calibration was an essential requirement. The model estimated that between 140 and 320 kg N ha(-1) was leached in a 12-mo period and up to 80 kg N ha-1 was volatilized as NH3, while losses due to denitrification were insignificant in these sandy soils. Field data and model estimates highlight the potential for a more efficient water and N use in the forage systems studied.

We evaluated effects of biochar rate and application method on soil properties, nutrient balance, biomass production, and water quality. Three replications of eight sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] treatments were installed in box lysimeters under greenhouse conditions. Treatments comprised increasing rates (0, 1.5, and 3.0 Mg ha(-1)) of topdressed or incorporated biochar supplemented with N fertilizer or N, P, and K fertilizer. Simulated rain was applied at 21 and 34 d after planting, and mass runoff loss of N, P, and K was measured. A mass balance of total N, P, and K was performed after 45 d. Returning 3.0 Mg ha(-1) of biochar did not affect sorghum biomass, soil total, or Mehlich-3-extractable nutrients compared to control soil. Yet, biochar contributed to increased concentration of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) and mass loss of total phosphorus (TP) in simulated runoff, especially if topdressed. It was estimated that up to 20% of TP in topdressed biochar was lost in surface runoff after two rain events. Poor recovery of nutrients during pyrolysis and excessive runoff loss of nutrients for topdressed biochar, especially K, resulted in negative nutrient balances. Efforts to conserve nutrients during pyrolysis and incorporation of biochar at rates derived from annual biomass yields will be necessary for biochar use in sustainable energy crop production.

The effects of wetland epuration from a mesotrophic to a nearly oligotrophic state were examined over a 15 km long reach of the St. Lawrence River under the direct influence of major farmland tributaries. We hypothesized that the nutrient-enriched zone would support a higher biomass of SAV, epiphytes, macroinvertebrates and fish than the nitrogen-deficient epurated zone located downstream of the wetland. Predictions included that the enriched habitat would support a richer fish assemblage, with higher biomass and growth of juvenile yellow perch than found in the epurated zone. Results supported these hypotheses, demonstrating the chain of effects of nutrient reduction on the biomass of SAV (fourfold drop), invertebrate prey (ninefold), small (threefold) and large (1.5-fold) fish between the two zones. In addition to the reduction in SAV biomass, the replacement of filamentous chlorophytes by benthic mats of filamentous cyanobacteria in the epurated zone resulted in a less complex 3-D habitat structure and a low invertebrate availability for fish. Oligotrophication by wetland epuration exerted negative effects on fish habitat quality, food quantity and availability, with an impairment of juvenile perch growth and recruitment. A generalized model of the changes in habitat carrying capacity occurring with epuration (oligotrophication) or eutrophication is presented, with examples of other aquatic systems in which strong linkages between trophic status, SAV, invertebrates and fish productivity were also demonstrated.

Hydraulic control of short-term successional changes in the phytoplankton assemblage in stratified reservoirs	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Phytoplankton behavior; Ecological model; Reservoir water quality management; Short-term prediction; Withdrawals; Disturbance	FRESH-WATER; MANAGEMENT; WITHDRAWAL; NUTRIENT; LIGHT; COMPETITION; PHOSPHORUS; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; LAKE	Earlier field studies conducted in reservoirs have shown that outlet selection may influence the abundance and composition of phytoplankton assemblages, and therefore, could be a promising technique for reservoir water quality management and restoration. However, the mechanisms by which phytoplankton assemblages are modified as a consequence of hydraulic regulation are not well understood. In this work, these mechanisms are analyzed. Outflow-driven changes in algal growth occur as a consequence either of water containing algal cells being withdrawn at or near the level of the outlets (flushing), or of changes in the environmental conditions (temperature, light and nutrient concentration) induced by such withdrawals. The study is based on simulations of phytoplankton growth in a small reservoir conducted with a simple physical-ecological model including two algal groups with different adaptations to environmental conditions. Our simulations suggest that the response of the phytoplankton assemblage to withdrawals depends on (a) the position of the layer hosting algal cells: (b) the depth of the water column; (c) the shape and size of the reservoir; (d) the relative position of the level of water extraction and the depth of the layer hosting algal cells; (e) the response of each algal group to environmental condition (in particular light availability); and (f) the outflow regime, identified in terms of the outflow rates and variability. Stratification conditions and meteorological forcing are also important in modulating the effects of outflows on algal growth. Outflow-driven changes of the dominant group in the algal assemblage mainly occur as a consequence of flushing (about 80% of the cases). Four scenarios are identified in which outflows induce changes in the dominant group of the algal assemblage purely as a result of environmental changes. The implications for reservoir water quality management are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Biogeochemistry of the Penobscot River watershed, Maine, USA: nutrient export patterns for carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Biogeochemistry; Carbon; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Watershed exports; Rivers; Cation denudation	LAND-USE; DISCHARGES; POLLUTION; SEDIMENT; INPUTS; FLUX	Watershed exports of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, major solutes, and suspended sediments were examined during five water years in the Penobscot River basin, which forms part of the Gulf of Maine watershed. Mean annual exports of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the Penobscot River were 58 kg C ha(-1) year(-1), whereas cumulative yearly watershed flux of DOC during the study period ranged from 8.6 to 16.1 x 10(10) g C year(-1) and averaged 11.7 x 10(10) g C year(-1). Watershed exports of total soluble N (TN) and total soluble P in the Penobscot River averaged 1.9 and 0.02 kg ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. Companion studies in two other major Maine rivers indicated that mean annual exports of DOC and TN in the Androscoggin River were 40 kg C ha(-1) year(-1) and 2.0 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), whereas exports in the Kennebec River were 43 kg C ha(-1) year(-1) and 2.2 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). Extrapolation of results from this investigation and a previous complementary study indicates that estuaries and coastal waters in the Gulf of Maine receive at least 1.0 x 10(10) g N year(-1) and 2.5 x 10(11) g C year(-1) in combined runoff from the four largest Maine river basins. Soluble exports of Ca + Mg + Na minus wet deposition inputs of cations in the Penobscot system were approximately 1,840 mol(c) ha(-1) year(-1), which represents a minimum estimate of cation denudation from the watershed. Based on its low N and P export rates, the Penobscot River watershed represents an example of reference conditions for use as a benchmark in ecological assessments of river water quality restoration or impairment. In addition, the biogeochemical metrics from this study provide an historical baseline for analysis of future trends in nutrient exports from the Penobscot watershed as a function of changing climatic and land use patterns.

Extensive studies have been carried out by various international wetland research communities to quantify the water quality improvement ability of the natural wetlands, in order to maintain such ability and wetland ecological health. This study aims to evaluate the purification function of Zhalong Wetland in China for removing total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP), based on ex-situ experiments and the development of a combined water quantity-quality model. Experiments and model predictions were carried out with different input TP and TN concentrations. Statistical analyses demonstrated that the relative errors between model simulations and experimental observations for TN and TP were 8.6% and 12.4%, respectively. With water retention time being maintained at 90 d, the removal rate of these pollutants could not reach the required Grade V standards, if the inflow TN concentration was over 42 mg L-1, or the input TP concentration was over 14 mg L-1. The simulation results also demonstrated that, even with Grade V quality standard compliance, when the water inflow from surrounding industries and agriculture lands into Zhalong Wetland reaches 0.3x108 m(3) a(-1), the maximum TN and TP loads that the reserve can cope with are 1.26x10(3) t a(-1) and 0.42x10(3) t a(-1), respectively. Overall, this study has produced a significant amount of information that can be used for the protection of water quality and ecological health of Zhalong Wetland.

However, the presence of nitrogen (N), in acidic soils amended with sludge, and its transport in runoff can lead to eutrophication of downstream surface water. This study assesses the effects of different application methods on N transport, via runoff from plots amended with SS (0 and 120 Mg ha(-1)). A lateritic red soil (pH 5.2) was selected for this study, using simulated rainfall conditions. When sludge was broadcasted and mixed with surface soils :BM), the concentrations and mass losses of total N in the mixed sample (MTN), total N in the settled sample (STN), total particulate N (TPN), total suspended N (TSN), total dissolved N (TON) and NH4+-N, in runoff water, were highest at 1 or 18 d after application. BM treatments showed initial pollution risks to surface waters, which diminished gradually with time. Whereas the concentrations and mass losses of NO3--N, in all sludge plots, appeared to have a declining trend, after an initial ascent. Hole-application (HA) and broadcast application with hay mulch (BH) treatments prevented N loss effectively, the runoff losses coefficient of MTN increased in the order BM (0.43%) > HA (0.15%) > BH (0.03%). For sludge treatments, N was largely lost in dissolved species, while a large portion of NH4+-N was lost in particulate fraction. Nitrogen (N) losses in runoff were greatly affected by the transformation of sludge N in the soil and the modification of soil properties, induced by sludge amendment. The risk associated with the application of sludge to sloping fields, in areas of acidic soil, is an important research subject that merits further study. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Johnson, KA; Polasky, S; Nelson, E; Pennington, D				Johnson, Kris A.; Polasky, Stephen; Nelson, Erik; Pennington, Derric			Uncertainty in ecosystem services valuation and implications for assessing land use tradeoffs: An agricultural case study in the Minnesota River Basin	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Ecosystem services; Uncertainty; Agricultural systems; Valuation; Scenarios	WATER-QUALITY; SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE; INTENSIFICATION; PHOSPHORUS; POLLUTION; BENEFITS; NITROGEN; WETLAND; NEED	Ecosystem services analysis can help recognize the full costs and benefits of land management decisions. Quantification and valuation of services can enhance policies and regulations and, if linked with payments or incentives, properly reward private decisions that yield public benefits. However, the field of ecosystem services research is relatively new and quantification and valuation remains highly uncertain. While there is significant uncertainty about the biophysical production of ecosystem services, there is additional uncertainty about the value of services. This paper explores how uncertainty associated with valuation of ecosystem services in agriculture affects the ranking of land use alternatives in terms of social net benefits. We compare the values of four land use scenarios in the Minnesota River Basin, USA, by combining a range of value estimates for these services with varying estimates for returns from agricultural production. Although variations in ecosystem service values are significant, fluctuations in agricultural returns more significantly determine how scenarios rank with regard to delivery of total value. This analysis suggests that addressing uncertainty in ecosystem service valuation is critical to accurately assessing tradeoffs in land use. (C) 2012 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

Phosphorus mobilisation and transport within a long-restored floodplain wetland	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Floodplain; Restoration; Wetland; Phosphorus; Redox; Biogeochemistry	IMPROVED WATER-QUALITY; UPPER KLAMATH LAKE; SOIL-PHOSPHORUS; VEGETATION DEVELOPMENT; DISSOLVED SUBSTANCES; RESTORATION WETLAND; PHOSPHATE RELEASE; ORGANIC-CARBON; REWETTED FENS; RETENTION	Re-wetting river floodplains as part of hydrological restoration can provide environmental, economic and social benefits. However, labile forms of nutrients have accumulated in many floodplains and enhanced nutrient mobility has been reported after re-wetting of some floodplain sediments. Increases in nutrient mobility could restrict the net benefit of floodplain restoration, although the long-term impacts of restoration on nutrient mobility are largely unknown. We used in situ hydrological and hydrochemical monitoring to examine the mobility of phosphorus (P) during a range of hydrological events within a long-restored (more than 20 years) floodplain in Norfolk, England. Our data suggest that P was released from sediments to porewater and surface water following inundation of the floodplain. The concentration of P exceeded 6.5 mg P L-1 in porewater and 0.5 mg P L-1 in surface water within six weeks of inundation, significantly higher than the concentration in rainwater (< 0.015 mg P L-1) or in floodwater from the adjacent river ((x) over bar = 0.11 mg P L-1) that inundated the floodplain. Sediment geochemistry was used to predict changes in the mobility of P following inundation, based on the molar ratio of redox-sensitive P to iron or the molar quantity of redox-sensitive P within the floodplain sediments. We found that short-term hydrological events, both external (tidal pulse) and internal (water-table drawdown) in origin, were associated with increases in the concentration of dissolved forms of P within the floodplain drainage network. These increases coincided with porewater movement to the drainage network, suggesting that advection along shallow sub-surface flowpaths was important for the transport of P. Our research indicates that some restored floodplains could inadvertently represent sources of P to adjacent streams and rivers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Surridge, Ben W.

Pollution evaluation in streams using water quality indices: A case study from Turkey's Sapanca Lake Basin	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Eutrophication; Regression analysis; Sapanca Lake Basin; Water pollution; Water Quality Index	DISSOLVED-OXYGEN; RIVER-BASIN; EUTROPHICATION; INDICATORS; IMPACT; MODEL	The stream water quality in Sapanca Lake Basin (Turkey) was investigated in terms of Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index (CCME - WQI), Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) and National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index (NSF - WQI). The main reason is to see the current pollution status in streams and also to compare leading three international water quality indices using domestic data. Also, a modified model that is adopted particularly from National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index (NSF-WQI) was prepared. Modified WQI incorporates the impact of temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), chloride (Cl), sulfate (SO4), orthophosphate-phosphorus (o-PO4-P), nitrate (NO3-N), nitrite (NO2-N), 5-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5), and the formation of chemical oxygen demand (COD). Developing modified indices in order to get sufficient results using limited amount of parameters is particularly useful for conserving the money required to measure huge number of parameters. Hence the aim of this research is to decrease the number of pollution parameters. For this aim, WQ1(min) (minimum)-which take into account temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), total suspended solid (TSS), and electrical conductivity (EC)-was generated. The same methodology was repeated using eutrophication parameters. An alternative index, named WQI(eut) (eutrophication), was developed using DO, o-PO4-P, NO3-N, NO-N. BOD5, and COD parameters. A good relationship was found between the developed indices and fifteen-parameter WQI. Finally, the research uncovered a threat of eutrophication for Sapanca Lake and streams feeding it.

Reflectance spectra and concurrent water quality parameters of 225 samples across the Shitoukoumen Reservoir, the drinking water resource for Changchun City, were used to retrieve Chl-a concentration with high total suspended matter (TSM) during 2006-2008. A combination of genetic algorithms and partial least square (GA-PIS) model was established for Chl-a retrieval through GA to select sensitive spectral variables and PLS for regression. To compare GA-PLS performances, the widely accepted three-band algorithm was implemented for Chl-a concentration estimation. Both GA-PLS and the three-band algorithm have stable performance for the aggregated dataset (R-2 = 0.85 and 0.81; RPD = 3.95 and 3.61; relative RMSE = 31.7% and 34.2%), with the GA-PLS model performing marginally better. The temporal transferability of the models was validated with the dataset collected in 2006 and 2007 respectively as independent dataset, showing that GA-PLS outperformed the three-band algorithm. Our result also indicated that relative error [(Chl-a(predicted) - Chl-a(measured))/Chl-a(measured)] showed good linear relation to TSM: Chl-a ratio (R-2 = 0.84), which implied that TSM concentration exerted significant impact on the accuracy of Chl-a estimation in this case study. As the results were derived from a large number of samples representing a wide range of spatiotemporal variations of pigment under TSM (3.7-472.8 mg/L) concentration influence, the GA-PLS model has great potential for Chl-a estimation for inland waters with similar backgrounds. Nevertheless, the three-band algorithm also has its own merit considering its simplicity for implementation. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Arsenic, cobalt and chromium food web biodilution in a Patagonia mountain lake	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY			English	Article						Stable nitrogen carbon isotopes; Metals trophodynamics; Biodilution; Patagonia; Argentina	STABLE-ISOTOPE ANALYSIS; FRESH-WATER FISH; SOUTH ANDES LAKE; TRACE-ELEMENTS; NORTHERN PATAGONIA; OPHRYDIUM-NAUMANNI; MIXING MODELS; HEAVY-METALS; BIOMAGNIFICATION; DELTA-N-15	Mussels, Diplon chilensis, from Lake Moreno, a double-basined mountain lake in southern Argentina, is known to have elevated concentrations of chromium (Cr, >25 mu g g(-1) dry weight DW) and arsenic (As, 35 mu g g(-1) DW), attributed to untreated sewage. To further understand the trophodynamics of Cr, As and cobalt (Co), we investigated concentrations and transfer throughout the food web in each basin of Lake Moreno. Each basin differs in morphology in that the gently-sloping Lake Moreno West has more littoral habitat than deeper Lake Moreno East with its higher proportion of pelagic habitat. Despite the morphological differences, both basins share similar water quality parameters and species assemblages. As a result, Lake Moreno provides an exceptional opportunity to compare trophodynamics of elements that enable us to hypothesize pelagic-littoral habitat coupling in response to lake morphology as the underlying factor influencing both Cr pathway and Co and As trophodynamic modeling. Using stable isotopes of nitrogen (delta N-15) and carbon (delta C-13) to characterize metals trophodynamics in each basin, biodilution of As, Cr and Co were indicated by negative regressions. This is confirmed by elevated As, Co and Cr concentrations in phytoplankton (11.3 +/- 5.7, 7.4 +/- 4.9, 44.5 +/- 40.7 mu g g(-1) DW respectively), while zooplankton and biofilm had the next elevated concentrations. Those elevated concentrations are in contrast with lower concentrations in sport fish such as rainbow trout (0.5 +/- 0.5, 0.2 +/- 0.3, 1.8 +/- 1.2 mu g g(-1) DW). Higher concentrations of Cr in fish were associated with higher proportion of benthic/littoral prey items in western basin, and were confirmed by significant correlation with delta C-13 values. Arsenic, Co and Cr concentrations in fish, while elevated, do not post health risks to human or wildlife consumers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Revenga, J.

Alex			Complexity and emergent properties in aquatic ecosystems: predictability of ecosystem responses	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						carrying capacity; catchments; ecosystem emergence; exergy flux; processing energy; water quality	PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES; MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; RETENTION TIME; ASSEMBLY RULES; NUTRIENT LOAD; WATER; LAKES; CARBON; FOOD; CLASSIFICATION	1. The paper explores the predictability of ecological conditions in aquatic systems and of their responses to catchment management schemes, in which the hydrological and material loads can be accurately and precisely quantified. Linkages between catchment hydrology and impacts on water quality are considered. 2. New approaches to modelling the complex biological behaviour of recipient systems are briefly reviewed. The case is made for simulating emergent outcomes based on the adaptive strategies and dynamic behaviours of species attempting to meet their material demands within the supportive capacities furnished by local environments. This bottom-up approach is justified by the fact that ecosystems are the sum of their smallest components; their behaviour is the aggregate of the activities of individuals. 3. A framework model template founded upon the emergent properties of high-performing organisms is developed within the context of exergy fluxes and their deployment and against axes representing the resource-carrying capacity versus the energy (photosynthetic and chemical) available to process it. 4. Some worked examples of simulated emergence in lakes are given, using the phytoplankton-community model, PROTECH, to demonstrate the acuity of predictions of the responses to quite subtle variations in biologically active solutes and suspensoids to simulated communities of the pelagic.

FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Review						catchments; complexity; restoration; rivers; uncertainty	WATER-QUALITY; MULTIPLE STRESSORS; LAND-USE; COMPLEXITY; PHOSPHORUS; MANAGEMENT; LAKE; RESTORATION; CATCHMENT; ECOSYSTEM	1. Considerable evidence from around the world shows that achieving good ecological outcomes in rivers from programmes of measures in catchments is difficult. There are a number of reasons for this, which we discuss, but here we focus primarily on the question, Is the knowledge base adequate? 2. We develop further the thesis that catchments and receiving waters are truly complex systems in which there are fundamental limits to knowledge. Our sampling and data analysis practices come with strong biases and inbuilt framing assumptions about the nature and values of ecosystem processes that underestimate complexity and uncertainty. 3. If we reframe our assumptions to think of the problem in terms of the properties of complex systems, then we can rethink our attitudes to uncertainty, causal thickets (multiple stressors) and cross-scale effects, and we can begin to develop new definitions of what constitutes a good ecological outcome. Dealing with inherent variability in data then becomes less of a problem with controlling noise and more of a problem of understanding system dynamics. The presence of adaptive dynamics and self-organisation in complex systems means that uncertainties will always be large and knowledge will be partial and that such systems are fundamentally not computable. 4. We show that small-scale noise in ecosystems is an inherent property of non-equilibrium systems with predominant advection, reactiondiffusion dynamics. Flow paths in catchments and the dynamics of receiving waters have fractal properties. Fractal dynamics indicate that multiple, cross-scale interactions are a characteristic of these systems. Small-scale connectivity is an important (and, from a management point of view, underused) aspect of pattern and process in such systems. 5. In an environment of such complexity, models will be flawed and predictions uncertain. It is therefore necessary to develop new indicators of connectivity and ecological complexity so that indicators of system-level progress may be found to assist with an improved process of adaptive management that is trend-orientated as well as outcome-orientated.

Managing the impacts of nutrient enrichment on river systems: dealing with complex uncertainties in risk analyses	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Review						ecological status; nutrients; rivers; uncertainty; Water Framework Directive	MULTIPLE STRESSORS; WATER-QUALITY; FRESH-WATER; THRESHOLD RESPONSES; PHOSPHORUS TRANSFER; PERIPHYTON BIOMASS; ECOLOGICAL STATUS; SHALLOW LAKES; TROPHIC STATE; STREAMS	1. Rivers and their catchments are complex, dynamic and non-equilibrium systems. Although the general functioning of these ecosystems is familiar, the characteristics of particular sites are often poorly known and accurate prediction of future behaviour to inform management decisions is extremely difficult. 2. Simple relationships between river nutrient concentrations and the health of river ecosystems do not exist. Natural variability and practical and technical constraints reduce our ability to set nutrient targets to protect river ecosystems. Particularly challenging is the use of simple doseresponse relationships as regulatory threshold targets, whereby sections of river are classified as either passing or failing to meet good ecological status. 3. Ecologically meaningful frameworks are needed that take account of the epistemic uncertainty associated with our predictions. Such frameworks should have clearly defined goals; be holistic; allow for natural variability; help to define ecologically acceptable environmental regimes; recognise that significant uncertainties mean that we will often be using indices rather than absolute measures; and use measures that explicitly include uncertainty estimates. Such approaches allow those outside the decision-making process to understand the level of environmental precaution included in the management of complex systems.	[Page, T.; Heathwaite, A.

Isotopic and microbial indicators of sewage pollution from Stone Town, Zanzibar, Tanzania	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article						Coral; Sewage pollution; Enterococcus; delta N-15; Zanzibar; Human health	WATER-QUALITY; FECAL-COLIFORM; CORAL-REEFS; SUSCEPTIBILITY; DELTA-N-15; EXAMPLES; NITROGEN	In Stone Town, Zanzibar, sewage treatment is minimal, with a biological oxygen demand reduction to 60% and no removal of bacteria or nutrients. Here, Stone Town's sewage pollution was studied by measuring Enterococci and NH4+ concentrations in seawater and delta N-15 of benthic organisms; samples were collected along the Stone Town shoreline and from offshore coral reefs. Public perceptions of sewage pollution were investigated via interviews. Enterococci from the Stone Town shoreline exceeded USEPA guidelines for recreational use. Benthic organisms from two of the four reefs were relatively enriched (delta N-15 > 10 parts per thousand), indicative of sewage derived N. delta N-15 values of organisms from Stone Town exceeded 16 parts per thousand. A strong correlation was found between Enterococci and delta N-15 across sites, while step-wise regression indicated rainfall and tidal stage as important predictors for bacterial concentrations. These data provide an important impact assessment from which the efficacy of future policy and management change can be assessed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hong, YST; Paik, BC				Hong, Yoon-Seok Timothy; Paik, Byeong-Cheon			Inference model derivation with a pattern analysis for predicting the risk of microbial pollution in a sewer system	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Fecal coliform bacteria; Water quality modeling; Multivariate inference model derivation; Neural network-based pattern analysis; Self-Organising Feature Maps; Evolutionary process model induction system; Grammar-based genetic programming	WATER TREATMENT-PLANT; FECAL-COLIFORM BACTERIA; NETWORK; QUALITY; INDUCTION; STREAMS; RIVER; LAND; USA	Developing a mathematical model for predicting fecal coliform bacteria concentration is very important because it can provide a basis for water quality management decisions that can minimize microbial pollution risk to the public. This paper introduces a hybrid modeling methodology which is a combined use of a neural network-based pattern analysis and an evolutionary process model induction system. The neural network-based pattern analysis technique is applied to extract knowledge on inter-relationships between fecal coliform concentrations and other measurable variables in a sewer system. Based on the result of neural network-based pattern analysis, an evolutionary process model induction system is used to derive mathematical inference models that can predict fecal coliform bacteria concentration from easily measurable variables instead of directly measuring fecal coliform bacteria concentration in a sewer system. The neural network-based pattern analysis extracts that temperature and ammonia concentration are the most important driving forces leading to an increase in fecal coliform bacteria concentration in the sewer system at Paraparaumu City, New Zealand. Fecal coliform bacteria concentration is also positively correlated with dissolved phosphorus and inversely with flow rate. The multivariate inference models that are able to predict fecal coliform bacteria concentration are successfully derived as functions of flow rate, temperature, ammonia, and dissolved phosphorus in the form of understandable mathematical formulae using the evolutionary process model induction system, even if a priori mathematical knowledge of the dynamic nature of fecal coliform bacteria is poor. The multivariate inference models evolved by the evolutionary process model induction system produce a slightly better performance than the multi-layer perceptron neural network model.

Phosphorus addition reverses the positive effect of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) on the toxic cyanobacterium, Microcystis aeruginosa	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Microcystis; Cyanobacteria; Phosphorus; Dreissena polymorpha; Eutrophication; Harmful algal bloom; HAB; Grazing; Zebra mussel	BLUE-GREEN-ALGAE; RELATIVE BIOMASS; FILTRATION-RATE; PHYTOPLANKTON; DOMINANCE; INVASION; DAPHNIA; LAKES; NITROGEN; LESSONS	We tested the hypothesis that zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) have positive effects on the toxin-producing cyanobacterium, Microcystis aeruginosa, at low phosphorus (P) concentrations, but negative effects on M. aeruginosa at high P, with a large-scale enclosure experiment in an oligotrophic lake. After three weeks, mussels had a significantly positive effect on M. aeruginosa at ambient P (total phosphorus, TP similar to 10 mu g L-1), and a significantly negative effect at high P (simulating a TP of similar to 40 mu g L-1 in lakes). Positive and negative effects were strong and very similar in magnitude. Thus, we were able to ameliorate a negative effect of Dreissena invasion on water quality (i.e., promotion of Microcystis) by adding P to water from an oligotrophic lake. Our results are congruent with many field observations of Microcystis response to Dreissena invasion across ecosystems of varying P availability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Assessing the condition of the Missouri, Ohio, and Upper Mississippi rivers (USA) using diatom-based indicators	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Diatoms; Great rivers; Monitoring; Transfer functions	LAURENTIAN GREAT-LAKES; WATER-QUALITY; MONITORING EUTROPHICATION; ECOLOGICAL STATUS; INFERENCE MODELS; BENTHIC DIATOMS; STREAMS; ASSEMBLAGES; VARIABILITY; DIVERSITY	Diatom-based indicators were developed to assess environmental conditions in the Missouri, Ohio, and Upper Mississippi rivers. Disturbance gradients, comprising the first two principal components derived from a suite of stressor variables, included a trophic gradient (Trophic) and a gradient reflecting agriculture and other development activities (Ag/Dev). Diatom-based indicators were developed by creating models using weighted average calibration and regression-based transfer functions to relate planktonic and periphytic diatom species assemblages to each disturbance gradient. The most predictive disturbance models combined phytoplankton and periphyton assemblages into a single bioindicator model (observed versus inferred: Trophic ; Ag/Dev ). The geographic applicability of bioindicators was assessed by limiting sample geographical range during model calibrations. Geographic scale was limited by creating bioindicators using samples from: (a) each river, and (b) combined Mississippi/Missouri samples excluding Ohio River sites which were chemically unique. Indicator performance decreased with geographically restrictive models, therefore river basin-wide models, developed across all three rivers, is recommended. The most effective diatom-based disturbance bioindicators for this great river ecosystem could be applied using phytoplankton, periphyton, or combined assemblages to infer both trophic and agriculture/development disturbances.

Redistribution of carbon and nitrogen through irrigation in intensively cultivated tropical mountainous watersheds	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						C and N flows; Flow proportional; Irrigation; Overland flow; Paddy fields; Vietnam; Water quality	SOIL-EROSION; NORTHERN VIETNAM; HYDROLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES; LANDSCAPE FRAGMENTATION; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; SOUTHEAST-ASIA; OVERLAND-FLOW; FIELD; LAND; CONSERVATION	This study aimed at tracing and quantifying organic carbon and total nitrogen fluxes related to suspended material in irrigation water in the uplands of northwest Vietnam. In the study area, a reservoir acts as a sink for sediments from the surrounding mountains, feeding irrigation channels to irrigate lowland paddy systems. A flow separation identified the flow components of overland flow, water release from the reservoir to the irrigation channel, direct precipitation into the channel, irrigation discharge to paddy fields and discharge leaving the sub-watershed. A mixed effects model was used to assess the C and N loads of each flow component. Irrigation water had an average baseline concentration of 29 +/- A 4.4 mg l(-1) inorganic C, 4.7 +/- A 1.2 mg l(-1) organic C and 3.9 +/- A 1.6 mg l(-1) total N. Once soils were rewetted and overland flow was induced, organic C and total N concentrations changed rapidly due to increasing sediment loads in the irrigation water. Summarizing all monitored events, overland flow was estimated to convey about 63 kg organic C ha(-1) and 8.5 kg N ha(-1) from surrounding upland fields to the irrigation channel. The drainage of various non-point sources towards the irrigation channel was supported by the variation of the estimated organic C/total N ratios of the overland flow which fluctuated between 2 and 7. Nevertheless, the majority of the nutrient loads (up to 93-99%) were derived from the reservoir, which served as a sediment-buffer trap. Due to the overall high nutrient and sediment content of the reservoir water used for irrigation, a significant proportion of nutrients was continuously reallocated to the paddy fields in the lowland throughout the rice cropping season. The cumulative amount of organic C and total N load entering paddies with the irrigation water between May and September was estimated at 0.8 and 0.7 Mg ha(-1), respectively. Therefore deposition of C and N through irrigation is an important contributor in maintaining soil fertility, and a process to be taken into account in the soil fertility management in these paddy rice systems.

J	Han, H; Allan, JD				Han, Haejin; Allan, J. David			Uneven rise in N inputs to the Lake Michigan Basin over the 20th century corresponds to agricultural and societal transitions	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Nitrogen; NANI; N export; River; Catchment; Nutrient budget; Nutrient loading; Lake Michigan	MISSISSIPPI RIVER-BASIN; GULF-OF-MEXICO; UNITED-STATES; WATER-QUALITY; ANTHROPOGENIC NITROGEN; NORTHEASTERN USA; TRENDS; EXPORT; PHOSPHORUS; HYPOXIA	By constructing nitrogen (N) budgets from 1880 to 2002 for watersheds that have undergone urbanization, intensive agricultural specialization or experienced minimal change, we document an uneven timeline of increase in anthropogenic N inputs. N loading to the watersheds of the Lake Michigan Basin grew six-fold from 1880 to 2002, peaking in 1987. Human activities influenced N inputs as early as 1880, and the magnitude and timing of increase differed markedly across regions in accord with population growth, land use, and type of agriculture. The greatest increase occurred from 1950 to 1980, corresponding with rapidly accelerating use of artificial fertilizers, but increases in atmospheric deposition and shifting patterns in crop and livestock production also affected trends. Net anthropogenic N inputs have changed little since about 1980, showing a modest decline due to a leveling out of fertilizer use and greater export of animal feed and products. Using a model that predicts riverine N export from watershed N loadings and river discharge, we found that river TN fluxes from all tributaries increased approximately threefold from 1900 to 2000 but have stabilized or declined over the past two decades, consistent with national surveys that show near-constant or declining riverine TN concentrations. For the LMB, the past two decades has been a period of relative stasis in N inputs to its terrestrial systems and N export from watersheds. This retrospective analysis also points to the challenge of forecasting future trends in N budget terms, which can both increase and decline in response to policy and societal transitions.

In this study, we link spatially explicit soil and stream data at the landscape scale to investigate import, export and transport of N in a 0.89 km(2) site at the alpine-subalpine ecotone in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, Colorado, U.S.A. For two of the major N inputs to our site, N deposition in the snowpack and N fixation, a complementary relationship was found across the study site, with greater abundance of N-fixing plants in areas with less snow and substantial snow inputs in areas with low N fixer abundance. During the initial phases of snowmelt, mixing model end members for oxygen isotopes in nitrate (NO3 (-)) indicated that a substantial quantity of NO3 (-) is transported downhill into the forested subalpine without being assimilated by soil microbes. After this initial pulse, much less NO3 (-) entered the stream and most but not all of it was microbial in origin. Rising delta N-15 in stream NO3 (-) indicated greater influence of fractionating processes such as denitrification later in the season. NO3 (-) from both atmospheric and microbial sources was not exported from our site because it was consumed within the first several hundred meters of the stream; ultimately, N exports were in the form of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and particulate N (PN). The results of this study suggest that the highest elevation dry alpine meadows rely more heavily on N fixation as an N source and experience less of the effects of anthropogenic N deposition than mid and lower elevation areas that have more snow. Our data also suggest that mid-elevation krummholz, moist meadows, and talus slopes are exporting N as NO3 (-) shortly after the onset of snowmelt, but that this NO3 (-) is rapidly consumed as the stream flows through the subalpine forest. This consumption by assimilation and/or denitrification currently provides a buffer against increased inorganic N availability downstream.

We calculate past and future trends in GWFs related to anthropogenic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) inputs into major rivers around the world. GWFs were calculated from past, current and future nutrient loads in river basins using the Global NEWS model. We present water pollution levels (WPLs), deduced from GWFs for more than 1000 rivers. The calculated GWFs and WPLs of the different river basins show a large variation among different periods. WPL values generally increased between 1970 and 2000. For the year 2000 about two-thirds of the basins have WPL values exceeding 1 for N or P. indicating that the pollution assimilation capacity has been fully consumed. Even though the other rivers have a WPL < 1, this does not guarantee that at sub-basin level or within particular periods of the year no eutrophication exists. High WPLs are generally found in rivers in tropical-subtropical areas. For dissolved organic N and P. the problems are located mostly in the southern hemisphere. The results indicate that many rivers may become more polluted with dissolved N and P in the future. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Parparov, A; Gal, G				Parparov, Arkadi; Gal, Gideon			Assessment and implementation of a methodological framework for sustainable management: Lake Kinneret as a case study	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Water resources; Sustainable management; Water quality quantification; Ecological modeling; Lake Kinneret; DYRESM-CAEDYM	WATER-QUALITY; PHYTOPLANKTON; SIMULATION; DYNAMICS	We outlined a methodological framework for sustainable water resource management comprising of ecological monitoring, quantified water quality and an ecosystem model. We tested the proposed framework on the subtropical Lake Kinneret (Israel), a major national water resource. Methodologically, this study linked the economic activities in Lake Kinneret and its watershed (i.e. nutrient loads and water supply regimes) with lake water quality, sustaining of which was considered as the management objective. Based on analysis of the monitoring data and model scenario simulations we established quantitative relationships between changes to lake water level and nutrient loading and water quality. We assessed a set of ranges of nutrient loads from the watershed and water levels that will allow conservation of the lake water quality within pre-defined limits thereby defining limits for a sustainable management policy for the lake water resources. The defined sustainable management policy is in good correspondence with the loads and water level permissible ranges estimated from the ecological monitoring of the lake. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In the organic-rich, low-salinity-water bay studied, the release of phosphorus from the sediments was sensitive to bioirrigation and oxygen conditions in the water. This was explained by the importance of hydrated iron oxides in binding phosphorus at the sediment surface, the sensitivity of iron-bound phosphorus to redox conditions, and the presence of soluble iron and sulphate. Chemical forms of phosphorus, especially phosphorus bound by redox-sensitive hydrated iron oxides, are regulated by the amount of degradable organic matter, availability of oxygen, iron and sulphate as well as bioirrigation by benthic fauna. To improve the short-term prediction of the water quality and particularly the dynamics of algal blooms in the coastal areas of the Gulf of Finland, sediment phosphorus and especially hydrated iron oxides should be included in water quality models.

Frequently, the best water quality correlate of the light attenuation coefficient is the total suspended solids, even in systems in which nutrient loading occurs primarily by groundwater input, that is, without strong river inputs of sediment. Alteration of bottom sediment texture, organic content, and bulk density by organic loading has been well documented. Here we report the effect of sediment re-suspension on near-bottom light attenuation using an array of in situ light sensors with very close spacing near the sediment-water interface and a radiative transfer (RT) modeling with the software "Hydrolight". We found that the light attenuation coefficient over 4.5 cm just above the bottom exceeded the attenuation found higher in the water column by a factor ranging from 1.6 to >30. RT modeling indicated that light received at the bottom could be overestimated by a factor 4 or more by extrapolating measurements not taking the near-bottom light attenuation into account. The results may help explain the wide range of seagrass light requirements observed in different systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hahn, C; Prasuhn, V; Stamm, C; Schulin, R				Hahn, Claudia; Prasuhn, Volker; Stamm, Christian; Schulin, Rainer			Phosphorus losses in runoff from manured grassland of different soil P status at two rainfall intensities	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Surface runoff; Phosphorus; Band applied manure; Eutrophication	MANAGING AGRICULTURAL PHOSPHORUS; SURFACE RUNOFF; DISSOLVED PHOSPHORUS; WATER-QUALITY; SIMULATED RAINFALL; SHORT-TERM; TRANSPORT; HYDROLOGY; CLIMATE; EXPLORATION	In many areas, excessive manure application on agricultural land has led to a substantial build-up of soil phosphorus (P) stocks, increasing the risks for diffuse pollution of surface waters. Recent studies highlight the need to differentiate between runoff types for better prediction of these risks. In a factorial field-plot experiment we investigated the role of soil-P status, band-applied manure and rainfall intensity on P losses from two Swiss grassland sites. Artificial rainfall was applied on each plot first at medium intensity using a sprinkler and then at high intensity using a watering can, simulating two different runoff conditions. Under both conditions, dissolved reactive P (DRP) in runoff increased linearly with water soluble P in the soil (WSP), but the extraction coefficients differed substantially between the two phases of runoff generation. It was 0.017 kg L-1 for runoff generated with the watering can (WCR), and 0.085 kg L-1 for runoff generated with the sprinkler (SR). Manure application increased DRP losses, but did not override the effect of soil P status. Phosphorus losses with runoff were more sensitive to soil P status for SR than for WCR. Reducing soil-P is therefore crucial to reduce runoff-P. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Gurdak, JJ; Qi, SL				Gurdak, Jason J.; Qi, Sharon L.			Vulnerability of Recently Recharged Groundwater in Principle Aquifers of the United States To Nitrate Contamination	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							DRINKING-WATER NITRATE; HIGH-PLAINS AQUIFER; NITROGEN-SOURCES; METHEMOGLOBINEMIA; SUSCEPTIBILITY; PROBABILITY; RISK	Recently recharged water (defined here as <60 years old) is generally the most vulnerable part of a groundwater resource to nonpoint-source nitrate contamination. Understanding at the appropriate scale the interactions of natural and anthropogenic controlling factors that influence nitrate occurrence in recently recharged groundwater is critical to support best management and policy decisions that are often made at the aquifer to subaquifer scale. New logistic regression models were developed using data from the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program and National Water Information System for 17 principal aquifers of the U.S. to identify important source, transport, and attenuation factors that control nonpoint source nitrate concentrations greater than relative background levels in recently recharged groundwater and were used to predict the probability of detecting elevated nitrate in areas beyond the sampling network. Results indicate that dissolved oxygen, crops and irrigated cropland, fertilizer application, seasonally high water table, and soil properties that affect infiltration and denitrification are among the most important factors in predicting elevated nitrate concentrations. Important differences in controlling factors and spatial predictions were identified in the principal aquifer and national-scale models and support the conclusion that similar spatial scales are needed between informed groundwater management and model development.

J	Wahman, DG; Speitel, GE				Wahman, David G.; Speitel, Gerald E., Jr.			Relative Importance of Nitrite Oxidation by Hypochlorous Acid under Chloramination Conditions	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							REDOX KINETICS; CHLORINATION; WATER; DECOMPOSITION; DICHLORAMINE	Nitrification can occur in water distribution systems where chloramines are used as the disinfectant. The resulting product, nitrite, can be oxidized by monochloramine and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), potentially leading to rapid monochloramine loss. This research characterizes the importance of the HOCl reaction, which has typically been ignored because of HOCl's low concentration. Also, the general acid-assisted rate constants for carbonic acid and bicarbonate ion were estimated for the monochloramine reaction. The nitrite oxidation reactions were incorporated into a widely accepted chloramine autodecomposition model, providing a comprehensive model that was implemented in AQUASIM. Batch kinetic experiments were conducted to evaluate the significance of the HOCl reaction and to estimate carbonate buffer rate constants for the monochloramine reaction. The experimental data and model simulations indicated that HOCl may be responsible for up to 60% of the nitrite oxidation, and that the relative importance of the HOCl reaction for typical chloramination conditions peaks between pH 7.5 and 8.5, generally increasing with (1) decreasing nitrite concentration, (2) increasing chlorine to nitrogen mass ratio, and (3) decreasing monochloramine concentration. Therefore, nitrite's reaction with HOCl may be important during chloramination and should be included in water quality models to simulate nitrite and monochloramine's fate.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the potential of a catchment-scale hydrologic model, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), to explain characteristics of stream fish assemblages and to enhance current field-based stream assessments. Stream fish assemblages, instream habitat, geomorphology, and water quality were surveyed in 16 study catchments in Ohio, USA. Subsequently, SWAT was used to model stream discharge, sediment flux and concentration, and nitrogen and phosphorus yields for each catchment. Principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regression were used to explore potential relationships between environmental factors (both reach-level measurements and SWAT-modelled catchment-scale processes) and fish assemblage descriptors assessed within the framework of an Ohio fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). Reach-level factors contributed to three of the four significant regression models, explaining 12% to 14% of the variation in fish species richness, the number of darter (Etheostoma) species, and the number of sensitive/intolerant species. SWAT-modelled parameters including minimum and mean annual flow and sediment yields explained significant variation in total IBI scores (57%), species richness (63%), the number of darter species (60%), and the number of sensitive/intolerant species (61%). The results support the utility of SWAT as a complement to field-based surveys. It is proposed that process-based catchment-modelling techniques such as SWAT could improve stream fish management and conservation efforts when used as a screening tool to target streams and catchments for subsequent field surveys and as a method to model potential impacts to stream ecosystems and fish assemblages in highly sensitive areas and/or inaccessible catchments.

J	Santos, MCR; Muelle, H; Pacheco, DMD				Santos, Maria C. R.; Muelle, Helena; Pacheco, Dina M. D.			Cyanobacteria and microcystins in lake Furnas (S. Miguel island-Azores)	LIMNETICA			English	Article						Water quality; cyanobacteria; blooms; microcystins	TROPHIC STATE INDEX; BLUE-GREEN-ALGAE; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN	This study investigated the changes in the cyanobacterial population and quantified the occurrence of microcystins in Lake Furnas during the first decade of the 21st century. The eutrophication of Lake Furnas has been recognized since the 1980s. The lake's phytoplankton population increased over the years in relation to this process of nutrient enrichment. Cyanobacteria began to dominate the phytoplankton and blooms of greater than 20 . 10(3) cells/ml occurred. After 2004, cyanobacterial blooms occurred regularly in the lake throughout the year. From 2000 through 2009, 30 blooms were detected. Of these blooms, 13 were dominated by Microcystis aeruginosa and 11 by Woronichinia naegeliana. In the other 6 blooms, the dominant cyanobacteria were Microcystis spp., Anabaena spp., Aphanocapsa spp. and Coelosphaerium kuetzingianum. A number of blooms involved more than 2 species simultaneously. The highest cell density (12.3 . 10(6) cells/ml) occurred during winter 2007. The predominant species in this bloom were M. aeruginosa (11.9 . 10(6) cells/ml) and W. naegeliana (83.8 . 10(3) cells/ml). Because almost all of the cyanobacteria cited were considered toxin producers, a search for microcystins, the hepatotoxins most often found in freshwaters, was initiated in 2001. Samples were collected at four depths: surface, 2.5 m, 5.0 m and 0.5 m above the sediments. From 2001 through 2009, soluble microcystins were detected six times during the summer, four times during the winter and autumn and three times during the spring (25 % of 129 samples). The average concentrations of soluble microcystins in the water column ranged from 0.1 mu g/l to 0.5 mu g/l. Intracellular microcystins were detected in 84 To of the samples. All samples collected after 2004 contained these cyanotoxins. The average concentrations of intracellular microcystins in the water column ranged from 0.1 mu g/l to 11.2 mu g/l. The highest value (154.5 mu g/l) was found in a water sample collected from the lake surface during the winter of 2009, during a bloom dominated by W naegeliana. The amounts of microcystins produced by cyanobacteria, expressed on a seston dry weight basis, varied between 24 mg/kg and 9737 mg/kg and showed an increase in 2008 and 2009. The concentrations of microcystins in samples from M. aeruginosa blooms ranged from 86 mg/kg to 1171 mg/kg and the highest values were recorded during the spring and summer of 2008.	[Santos, Maria C.

J	Hart, MR; Cornish, PS				Hart, M. R.; Cornish, P. S.			Available soil phosphorus, phosphorus buffering and soil cover determine most variation in phosphorus concentration in runoff from pastoral sites	NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Soil phosphorus; Phosphorus buffering index; Rainfall simulator; Surface runoff; Water quality; Pasture	NEW-SOUTH-WALES; REACTIVE PHOSPHORUS; RAINFALL SIMULATOR; GRASSLAND SOILS; SURFACE RUNOFF; FARM-SCALE; LAND-USE; WATER; AUSTRALIA; SEDIMENT	Phosphorus (P) runoff from agricultural land contributes to elevated P concentrations in surface water. Although P concentrations in runoff are often higher when soil P is increased, attempts to quantify this relationship in field studies have been inconclusive, either because of confounding within experiments or methodological differences between experiments. The present study attempted to address these issues using simulated rainfall at 15 pastoral locations with varied lithology, land-use intensity, plant cover and soil-P properties in SE Australia, at a total of 38 on-farm sites, each with paired plots. At 27 sites, one of each pair was covered with 70 % shade-cloth to reduce rainfall energy. Although these were uncultivated pastoral sites and surface soil erosion rates were all relatively low, eroded surface soil had sufficiently high concentrations of P to make a major contribution to total P in runoff from some sites, even when plant-available soil P was low. We conclude that greater vegetative cover is required to manage P in runoff than to manage soil erosion. When soil was adequately protected against erosion by either high vegetative cover or shade-cloth, greater than 90 % of the variation in both dissolved reactive P and total P was explained by two commonly measured soil variables: soil-test P (bicarbonate extract) and P-buffering index (where P was in the range where plants may respond to fertiliser). It appears that available soil P can be raised with fertiliser to improve agronomic production without fear of significantly increasing P losses in runoff provided soil test P remains below the agronomic critical concentration defined by the soil P-buffering index. These findings have broad relevance for environmental risk assessment and management where the data required for more complex procedures are unavailable.	[Hart, M. R.; Cornish, P.

Predicting the changes in environmentally and agronomically significant phosphorus forms following the cessation of phosphorus fertilizer applications to grassland	SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Productivity; soil test phosphorus; superphosphate; water quality	SOIL-TEST-P; SURFACE WATERS; PHOSPHATE RELEASE; KINETICS; DESORPTION; SOLUBILITY; NUTRIENT; LOSSES; RUNOFF	Phosphorus (P) loss from soil can impair surface water quality. Losses from soil are related to soil P concentrations, but agronomic measures such as Olsen P do not in many cases predict the potential for P loss. One possible strategy to decrease P loss is to stop applying P fertilizers. We examined the changes in both agronomic (Olsen P) and environmental [water-extractable P (WEP) and calcium chloride-extractable P (CaCl2-P)] P tests, and the potential implications following a halt to P fertilizer application to four long-term grassland field trials on different soil types. Exponential decreases in Olsen P and WEP concentration over time were observed in three of the four trials, but only in one trial for CaCl2-P. The rates of decrease in Olsen P (OP) and WEP concentration were best correlated with initial WEP (WEPi) concentration and the quotient of Olsen Pi/P retention (PR, a measure of Al- and Fe-oxides), respectively. The equation t = 1/(-0.035 X ln OPi/PR - 0.0455) X (ln WEPt - ln WEPi) was used to predict the time (t) taken for WEP concentrations at the sites to decrease to 0.02 mg/L (WEPt), which is proposed as a limit for dissolved reactive phosphorus in overland flow, and the result was 2344 yr. Results from a similar equation for Olsen P predicted a quicker rate of WEP. A significant decline in dry matter (DM) yield was observed at one trial site. For this site, the rate of decline in DM yield was of a similar magnitude to the rate of decline in WEP concentration. This suggests that halting P fertilizer application to decrease P loss as measured by WEP concentration may decrease farm productivity. An alternative, more financially acceptable, strategy is required, such as a negative P balance while maintaining yields with N fertilizer, but further work is required to assess both the agronomic and environmental implications of this strategy.

Estimated Trophic State Effects and Abatement Costs in Connection with Improved Urban Sewage Treatment in the Gulf of Riga	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Urban sewage treatment; Trophic state; Fish; Eutrophication	MASS-BALANCE MODEL; BALTIC SEA; FISH PRODUCTION; ECOSYSTEM; PHOSPHORUS; EUTROPHICATION; FISHERIES; NITROGEN; SCALE; CYCLES	Environmental conflicts of interest are important to account for when environmental policies are designed. This paper explores the quantitative connection between urban wastewater treatment, coastal eutrophication, and fish biomass in the mesotrophic Gulf of Riga (northern Europe). The probable effect on the water quality from one clearly defined abatement measure, improved urban sewage treatment, has been studied. The implementation cost and the likely effect on total fish biomass also have been assessed. Computer simulations by using the previously published model CoastMab suggested that good water quality according to the European Union (EU Marine) Strategy Framework Directive could be achieved if urban sewage treatment would be upgraded to Nordic and German standards, and not only around the Gulf of Riga but also in the whole Baltic Sea drainage basin. The Secchi depth would double according to these simulations, whereas total phosphorus and summer chlorophyll concentrations would decrease by 54% and 53%, respectively. The total fish biomass should be expected to decrease by approximately 42% if good water quality (as defined in EU directives) should be achieved. However, changes in total fish biomass also could be offset by changes in other important determinants, such as climate-related variables or fishing pressure. The study estimated that it could take approximately 20-40 years after abatement action for the trophic state in the Gulf to stabilise again. Upgrading urban sewage treatment to this extent would cost 468-1,118 million Euro per year. Treatment could have substantial positive effects on the water quality of the Gulf but could also have adverse side effects on the total fish biomass. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000510.

Identification of phosphorus export from low-runoff yielding areas using combined application of high frequency water quality data and MODHMS modelling	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Phosphorus transfer; Groundwater discharge; Overland flow; Groundwater-surface water interaction; Hysteresis	SWAN-CANNING-ESTUARY; SOIL SOLUTION; CATCHMENT; AUSTRALIA; SURFACE; TRANSPORT; DISCHARGE; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS; SCALE	In basins combining fiat-sandy valleys and hilly-bedrock sub-catchments, the assessment of nutrient (phosphorus) exports from low-runoff yielding environments is difficult. To overcome this issue hydrological modelling and high frequency phosphorus measurements were simultaneously employed. A coupled surface water-groundwater interaction model (MODHMS) was used to determine runoff from the low-runoff yielding part of the catchment. The modelling results indicated that the lower catchment contributed less than 10% of annual catchment discharge over a number of weeks during mid-winter. High frequency phosphorus (P) measurements showed a threefold increase in P concentration during this period in 2008, which lasted for 3 weeks. Concentration-discharge analysis suggested that the increase in P concentration was associated with runoff generation processes in the low-runoff yielding sub-catchment. It was estimated that this area contributed 32% of the annual P load though only 2% of total annual discharge in 2008. Both runoff and P contributions occurred during the period when the water table rose to the surface causing inundation. It was shown that the P concentrations in discharge from the low-runoff yielding sub-catchment were similar to those observed in the shallow groundwater layers.

J	Higgins, BT; Kendall, A				Higgins, Brendan T.; Kendall, Alissa			Life Cycle Environmental and Cost Impacts of Using an Algal Turf Scrubber to Treat Dairy Wastewater	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						algae; anaerobic digestion; bioenergy; industrial ecology; life cycle assessment (LCA); nutrient trading	GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; ANAEROBIC-DIGESTION; MANURE; BIOMASS; REMOVAL; ENERGY	Using algae to simultaneously treat wastewater and produce energy products has potential environmental and economic benefits. This study evaluates the life cycle energy, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, eutrophication potential, and cost impacts of incorporating an algal turf scrubber (ATS) into a treatment process for dairy wastewater. A life cycle inventory and cost model was developed to simulate an ATS treatment system where harvested algae would be used to generate biogas for process heat and electricity generation. Modeling results show that using an ATS significantly reduces eutrophication impacts by reducing chemical oxygen demand, nitrogen, and phosphorus in the wastewater. With low water recirculation rates through the ATS and high algae productivity, inclusion of the ATS results in net energy displacement and a reduction of GHG emissions compared to a system with no ATS. However, if high water recirculation rates are used or if algae biosolids from the digester are dried, the system results in a net increase in energy consumption and GHG emissions. The life cycle treatment cost was estimated to be $1.42 USD per cubic meter of treated wastewater. At this cost, using an ATS would only be cost effective for dairies if they received monetary credits for improved water quality on the order of $3.83 per kilogram of nitrogen and $9.57 per kilogram of phosphorus through, for example, nutrient trading programs.

In this study the performance of the pilot-scale and full-scale surface constructed wetlands for removing COD (chemical oxygen demand) and ammonium from polluted river water was evaluated. Results showed that the effluent COD and NH4+-N concentrations in the pilot scale wetland systems were 10.72 similar to 19.34 mg l(-1) and 0.18 similar to 0.90 mg l(-1), respectively, which met Grade-III (COD 20 mg l(-1), NH4+-N 1 mg l(-1)) of national surface water standards in China. The maximal COD and NH4+-N removal efficiency was 96.18% and 99.78%. COD and NH4+-N removal in spring and summer were better than that in fall and winter based on the k-C* model. Combined with research results of the two-year full-scale study, it indicated that the surface wetland system was a promising technology for treating polluted river water to meet the requirement of Grade-III water quality in northern China.

Recurrent artificial neural network (RANN) was used for the supervised ANNs and Kohonen Self Organizing Feature Maps (SOMs) for the unsupervised ANNs. The RANN was developed for the prediction of diatom abundance using variables selected by sensitivity analysis (water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity). The RANN model performance was measured using root mean squared error (19.0 cell/mL) and the r-value (0.7). SOM was used in this study for classification and clustering of diatom abundance in relation to selected water quality variables and was validated using a sensitivity curve of diatom abundance over the selected variable range generated from RANN. SOM has been employed in this study for pattern discovery of diatom abundance at Putrajaya Lake. The extracted patterns of diatom abundance in terms of propositional IF. . .else rules were tested and yielded an accuracy rate of 87%.

Surface ditch sediment samples were collected from headwater subcatchment of forestland, sloping cropland, paddy field, and residential area in a representative catchment in the central Sichuan Basin. These sediment samples were used for determination of P sorption-desorption characteristics by a batch equilibrium technique. Results showed that the maximum P sorption capacities (Q(m)) in the sediments ranged from 159.7 to 263.7 mg/kg, while higher Q(m) were observed in the ditch sediments from the paddy fields. The Q(m) was significantly and positively correlated with oxalate-extractable Fe and Al oxides (r=0.97 and 0.98, p < 0.01), clay fraction (r = 0.78, p < 0.05) and organic matter (r = 0.95, p < 0.01). Sediment pH, clay and organic matter influenced the P sorption through amorphous Fe and Al oxides. CaCO3 content was negatively correlated with the Q(m) (r = -0.83, p < 0.05), implying that saturated CaCO3 (> 50 g/kg) would not increase P sorption capacity in the ditch sediments. The ditch sediments featured a linear desorption curve, suggesting that P release risk would be enhanced with the increase of the P adsorption. The P desorption rate was positively correlated with Olsen P (r = 0.94, p < 0.01), but negatively related to the fine particle-size fractions (r = -0.92, p < 0.01), the sum of the amorphous Fe and Al oxides (r = -0.67, p < 0.05) and the P sorption capacity (r = -0.59, p < 0.05). The ditch sediments from residential area had a higher P release risk than that from the other ditches of forestland, sloping cropland and paddy field. The P sorption index (PSI) derived from single-point measurement was significantly correlated with the P sorption capacity (r = 0.99, p < 0.01), and could be used for estimating Q(m) as 1.64 times PSI plus 24.0 (Q(m) = 1.64 PSI + 24.0) for similar sediments with highly calcareous soils and sediments. Ditch cleaning and sediment removal for the ditch in residential area were recommended in this area to reduce the P release risk.

Likewise, the water turbidity trend was determined at a site near the Bay for each of four major tributaries to Tampa Bay (Hillsborough River, the Alafia River, the Little Manatee River, and the Manatee River). This study identifies consistent changes in LCLU across the Tampa Bay watershed and a decrease in water turbidity. LCLU change analysis as a percent of the total Tampa Bay watershed revealed an increase of 2.6% in developed area followed by a 0.9% in bare land and a 0.6% in water cover. A decrease of 1.8% of the total Tampa Bay watershed was found in agriculture, followed in order by 1.1% in wetland and 1.4% in scrub/shrub. Other land classes changed less than 0.2% of the total watershed. A linear mixed model (SAS procedure PROC MIXED) revealed an overall decreasing trend in water turbidity (p = 0.003, slope estimate = -0.02) across the four major Tampa Bay tributaries considered. This study suggests that development (urbanization) could be associated with decreasing water turbidity in Tampa Bay. Finally, although these results may help explain similar effects on other water bodies with similar conditions of adjacent urbanization and low slope, more analysis are needed considering a larger number of watersheds with similar scales and longer time period in order to confirm that the findings of this study are generally evident.

The system dynamic model is calibrated and validated by using data from a 1-year study of a constructed wetland in Tainan of southern Taiwan. Additionally, the major parameters that affect the simulation output are obtained via sensitivity analysis by using generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE). A high R (2) and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency between the simulated and measured outflow values indicate that in addition to reproducing the changing trends of dissolved oxygen (DO), 5-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5), total nitrogen (TN), total suspended sediment (TSS), and total phosphorous (TP) concentrations, the model can simulate the variations of DO, BOD5, and TSS. Taken into account the interactions among parameters, the GLUE method successfully obtained the model sensitive parameters from the Monte Carlo parameter sets. Sensitivity analysis results indicate that the parameters of microorganisms are sensitive factors that affect DO, BOD5, and TN, while sediment diameter largely influences TP and TSS. Further elucidating environmental microorganisms would increase the model accuracy and provide a valuable reference for constructed wetland management and design.

Modification, calibration and verification of the IWA River Water Quality Model to simulate a pilot-scale high rate algal pond	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Waste-water treatment ponds; Algal mixotrophy; Algal production; Nutrient removal	CARBON-DIOXIDE ADDITION; LIGHT; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; BIOMASS; PHYTOPLANKTON; LIMITATION; BACTERIA; GROWTH	We implemented the IWA River Water Quality Model No. 1 (Reichert et al., 2001. River Water Quality Model No. 1, IWA Scientific & Technical Report No. 12) to simulate water-quality characteristics in two pilot-scale High Rate Algal Ponds. Simulation results were compared with two years' of data from the ponds. The first year's data from one pond were used for model calibration; the remaining data were used for validation. As originally formulated and parameterized, the model consistently yielded summer-time algal biomass concentrations which were too low - with consequent failures in its reproduction of dissolved oxygen, pH and nutrient dynamics. We experimented with various structural/parametric changes to improve the model's performance. The most effective strategy was to greatly increase the respiratory losses suffered by the heterotrophic osmotrophs (thereby giving the algae access to a larger fraction of the incoming dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen). This suggests that CO2-bubbling alone cannot entirely preclude resource-limitation of algal production. We doubt that our parameterization of heterotrophic osmotrophs is correct and infer that the algae derive a large fraction of their nutrition by direct osmotrophic uptake of dissolved organic matter. This inference is supported by the literature concerning the physiology of the dominant algal species in our ponds. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Broekhuizen, Niall; Park, Jason B.

J	Wu, M; Demissie, Y; Yan, E				Wu, May; Demissie, Yonas; Yan, Eugene			Simulated impact of future biofuel production on water quality and water cycle dynamics in the Upper Mississippi river basin	BIOMASS & BIOENERGY			English	Article						Biofuel production; Upper Mississippi river basin; Nutrient loadings; Water resource; Corn stover; Switchgrass	CORN-STOVER; REMOVAL; CROP	We examined the impacts of increased biofuel feedstock production on regional water resource and water quality. We focused on the Upper Mississippi river basin, from which a majority of U.S. biofuel is produced at present. The production of biofuel from both conventional feedstock and cellulosic feedstock will potentially increase in the near future, and a significant portion of the cellulosic feedstock is expected to come from this region. In this work, we developed future scenarios of biofuel feedstock production in 2015 to assess the potential water quality and quantity changes associated with an increase in biofuel production through corn yield increase, harvesting a fraction of corn stover, and converting land to perennial grass (switchgrass). The estimates are accomplished by a watershed model SWAT. Results project a slight increase in phosphorus loading and decrease in nitrogen loading when corn yield is increased without cellulosic feedstock production. Harvesting a fraction of corn stover with improved management and efficient nitrogen use could lead to a decrease in nitrogen loading (up to 10%) and phosphorus loading (2%) when soil properties remain constant. Changes in sediment loadings are relatively minor. Growing switchgrass reduces soil erosion considerably and positively impacts nitrogen and phosphorus loadings at the projected yield and fertilizer input while switching from pasture to switchgrass would increase the water loss associated with ET (1% of total precipitation), decrease base flow (2%), and decrease the surface runoff flow to the basin. Major factors - including land use changes, feedstock types, fertilizer inputs, crop yield, and soil properties - were analyzed for their direct and composite impacts. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Decades of farming drainage from the EAA has led to accumulation of sediments in regional canals which may be transported to downstream ecosystems and act as potential internal source of P. Intact sediment cores were collected from three main conveyance and three farm canals within the EAA. Physicochemical assessment, mineralogy, P speciation, and storage were determined for surface and subsurface layers. The main conveyance canal sediments had higher total P (TP) concentrations (1,280 +/- 360 mg kg(-1)) than the farm canals (960 +/- 540 mg kg(-1)), while farm canal sediments showed higher organic matter content (28-53 %) compared to the main canal (24-27 %) sediments. The minerals found in main conveyance canal sediments were similar to those found in Lake Okeechobee. The labile KCl-P fraction comprised < 2 % of TP from all canal sediments, while NaOH-Pi (i = inorganic) fraction consisted of 1-14 % of TP. The majority of P in the canal sediments was contained in the HCl-P fraction (Ca-P and Mg-P), comprising > 50 % of TP in the main and farm canal sediments. An estimated 73 metric tons (mt) of P was stored in the 0-10-cm layer of the three main conveyance canals within the EAA boundary of which 57-mt P is reactive and potentially available for release at different time scales. The EAA canal sediments are highly organic with low bulk density and susceptible of being transported to downstream ecosystems. Many factors can impact the potential release of the reactive stored P, including redox potential of sediments as well as the overlying water column P concentration.

Safeguarding coastal coral communities on the central Great Barrier Reef (Australia) against climate change: realizable local and global actions	CLIMATIC CHANGE			English	Article							CO2 PARTIAL-PRESSURE; WATER-QUALITY; THERMAL TOLERANCE; RESILIENCE; TERRESTRIAL; TEMPERATURE; CATCHMENT; STRESSORS; EXPOSURE; HABITAT	The threats of wide-scale coral bleaching and reef demise associated with anthropogenic (global) climate change are widely known. Less well considered is the contributing role of conditions local to the reef, in particular reef water quality, in co-determining the physiological tolerance of corals to increasing sea temperatures and declining pH. Here, the modelled benefit of reduced exposure to dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in terrestrial runoff, which raises the thermal tolerance of coastal coral communities on the central Great Barrier Reef (Australia), is considered alongside alternative future warming scenarios. The simulations highlight that an 80% reduction in DIN 'buys' an additional similar to 50-60 years of reef-building capacity for No Mitigation ('business-as-usual') bleaching projections. Moreover, the integrated management benefits provided by: (i) local reductions of similar to 50% in DIN contained in river loads, (ii) global stabilisation of atmospheric CO2 below 450 ppm can help ensure the persistence of hard-coral-dominated reefscapes beyond 2100. The simulations reinforce the message that beyond the global imperative to mitigate future atmospheric CO2 emissions there still remains the need for effective local management actions that enhance the resistance and resilience of coral reef communities to the impacts of climate change.

Several empirical relationships between land use and in-lake water quality variables have been developed, but they are often weak, which can in part be attributed to lack of detailed information about land use activities or point sources. We examined a comprehensive data set comprising land use data, point-source information, and in-lake water quality for 414 Danish lakes. By excluding point-source-influenced lakes (n = 210), the strength in relationship (R-2) between in-lake total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and the proportion of agricultural land use in the watershed increased markedly, from 10-12% to 39-42% for deep lakes and from 10-12% to 21-23% for shallow lakes, with the highest increase for TN. Relationships between TP and agricultural land use were even stronger for lakes with rivers in their watershed (55%) compared to lakes without (28%), indicating that rivers mediate a stronger linkage between landscape activity and lake water quality by providing a "delivery" mechanism for excess nutrients in the watershed. When examining the effect of different near-freshwater land zones in contrast to the entire watershed, relationships generally improved with size of zone (25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 m from the edge of lake and streams) but were by far strongest using the entire watershed. The proportion of agricultural land use in the entire watershed was best in explaining lake water quality, both relative to estimated nutrient surplus at agricultural field level and near-lake land use, which somewhat contrasts typical strategies of management policies that mainly target agricultural nutrient applications and implementation of near-water buffer zones. This study suggests that transport mechanisms within the whole catchment are important for the nutrient export to lakes. Hence, the whole watershed should be considered when managing nutrient loadings to lakes, and future policies should ideally target measures that reduce the proportion of cultivated land in the watershed to successfully improve lake water quality.

J	Srebotnjak, T; Carr, G; de Sherbinin, A; Rickwood, C				Srebotnjak, Tanja; Carr, Genevieve; de Sherbinin, Alexander; Rickwood, Carrie			A global Water Quality Index and hot-deck imputation of missing data	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Water Quality Index; Distance-to-target; Hot-deck imputation; Environmental Performance Index	TOOL; MANAGEMENT; STATE	Water is an essential resource for life on Earth and available freshwater resources are emerging as a limiting factor not only in quantity but also in quality for human development and ecological stability in a growing number of locations. Water quality is a significant criterion in matching water demand and supply. Securing adequate freshwater quality for both human and ecological needs is thus an important aspect of integrated environmental management and sustainable development. The 2008 Environmental Performance Index (EPI) published by the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy (YCELP) and the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) at Columbia University includes a Water Quality Index (WATQI). The WATQI provides a first global effort at reporting and estimating water quality on the basis of five commonly reported quality parameters: dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, pH value, and total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. This paper explains the motivation and methodology of the EPI WATQI and demonstrates how hot-deck imputation of missing values can expand its geographical coverage and better inform decision-makers on the types and extents of water quality problems in the context of limited globally comparable water quality monitoring data.

Development of a Complex System Dynamic Eutrophication Model: Application to Karkheh Reservoir	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						CE-QUAL-W2 model; eutrophication; Karkheh Reservoir; object oriented; system dynamics; water quality simulation		The ever-increasing pollutant loads have significantly degraded the quality of receiving water bodies. High-resolution, spatially distributed water quality simulation models can be unsuitable at the planning/reconnaissance level of water resources decision making or for the rapid interactive analysis to support a participatory decision environment. This study presents a complex system dynamic (SD) eutrophication model in an object-oriented template to facilitate reservoir nutrient simulation process and assessment of alternative management strategies. The proposed model considers feedback and interactive loops between phytoplanktons, herbivorous zooplanktons, carnivorous zooplanktons, particulate organic matter, dissolved organic matter, ammonium, nitrate, phosphorus, total suspended solids, and dissolved oxygen in the simulation process. The reservoir SD eutrophication model is structured and expressed as a series of 30 differential equations for 10 state variables and three segmented layers. The model was applied to the Karkheh Reservoir in Iran to simulate the key epilimnion, thermocline, and hypolimnion temporal patterns of the system. The SD eutrophication model is quite suitable for rapid scenario analysis and preliminary management targets. Results of the proposed model compared well with those of a well-known two-dimensional process-based water quality simulation model (CE-QUAL-W2) and measured field data during the calibration and verification periods. Effects of reduction and/or increase in total incoming nutrient loads resulting from different load management scenarios were also examined. Results showed that the Karkheh Reservoir is phosphorus limited during the summer stratified periods.

This study quantified the relationship between land use and the total nitrogen (TN) load in a catchment using a mass balance model based on multivariate analysis. This model considered the spatial arrangement of observed data and the quantity of different land-use types to examine the relationship between the environmental improvement effects of various policy measures and the TN load in the Gyaku River basin, Japan. The distribution of the land uses was estimated from LANDSAT/TM data using ISODATA clustering. The aim was to develop concrete controls for improving the environment (i.e., an environmental improvement policy). The TN load was governed largely by the distribution of human-related factors such as industrial wastewater discharge, agricultural production, population density, and livestock density. The optimal environmental state was determined by examining various factors influenced by human activities and natural phenomena. The analysis incorporated previously published data from the early stages of stand development. First, the boundaries of the self-governing bodies that would enforce the proposed measures were located on maps of the environment and settlements in the study catchment. A proposed plan was then developed based on concrete procedures. The study catchment contained a predominantly agricultural area and an urban area. Thus the environmental improvement policy had to consider both urban and rural characteristics of the catchment. The qualitative effects of various measures and combinations of measures were simulated, considering inflows and outflows from both the agricultural and urban areas. This study is particularly useful because many visible aspects of Japanese environmental management are not those that rationally based paradigms of decision making would associate with environmental improvement and resilience.

J	Evans, R				Evans, R.			Reconnaissance surveys to assess sources of diffuse pollution in rural catchments in East Anglia, eastern England - implications for policy	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						exploratory survey; nutrient enrichment; policy; run-off; sedimentation; soil erosion	PARTICULATE PHOSPHORUS TRANSPORT; LOWLAND AGRICULTURAL CATCHMENTS; SUSPENDED SEDIMENT SOURCES; PROCESS-BASED MODEL; RIVER BANK EROSION; SOIL-EROSION; SEWAGE-EFFLUENT; HAMPSHIRE AVON; DELIVERY; UK	Reconnaissance surveys were made to assess sources of diffuse pollution in the Wissey, Blyth, Little Ouse and Wensum catchments in East Anglia, eastern England. Water-eroded fields and the state of watercourses, roads and tracks were noted and photographed along traverses made across the catchments. Volumes of soil moved were estimated. River nutrient concentrations and turbidity were examined. Nutrient enrichment of watercourses is mostly explained by effluent leaving small Sewage Treatment Works. Sediment in watercourses can come not only from eroded fields but also from roads and tracks and erosion of the channels themselves. Farmers and land managers are not the only ones who must be targeted to curtail enrichment and sedimentation of watercourses. Policy makers need to take such findings into account if water quality in East Anglia is to be improved. Exploratory surveys can indicate sources of pollutants and be a basis for further investigation or ameliorative action.

Surveys assessing pollutant sources in the Little Ouse, Blyth and Wensum catchments were supported by Natural England as part of the Catchment Sensitive Farming Initiative. The National River Flow Archive Service, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology at Wallingford provided graphs of daily mean flows over a year of various river flow gauges. I am grateful to the Environment Agency for supplying data on TON, OPh P and turbidity (FTU). Daily rainfall for Morley, Norfolk, was provided for 2003-2006 by The Arable Group and for Bradenham in the Wissey catchment for 2003-2009 by John Bradley. Tim Ellis, an angler, not only took me on an enlightening trip along the Wensum valley between Lyng and Fakenham but also provided me with much other useful information and images.

Distribution and regulation of urea in lakes of central North America	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						eutrophication; fertiliser; nitrogen; urea; wastewater	DISSOLVED ORGANIC NITROGEN; WATER-QUALITY; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; SPATIAL VARIATION; EUPHOTIC LAYER; BIOAVAILABILITY; DECOMPOSITION; PHOSPHORUS; CARBON	1. Urea accounts for similar to 50% of global nitrogen (N)-based fertiliser; however, little is known of the factors regulating its distribution and abundance in freshwaters. Improved understanding of urea biogeochemistry is essential because its use as fertiliser is expected to double by 2050 and because pollution with urea can promote outbreaks of toxic cyanobacteria in phosphorus (P)-rich lakes in regions with intensive agricultural or urban development. 2. Biweekly measurements of urea concentration and diverse limnological variables (water chemistry, hydrology, algae, zooplankton) were taken during two summers (2008, 2009) in a chain of seven productive lakes within a 52 000-km2 catchment in central Canada to quantify environmental and anthropogenic correlates of temporal and spatial patterns of urea occurrence. 3. Mean (+/-SD) urea concentrations varied between 29 +/- 14 and 132 +/- 65 mu g N L-1, generally increased from headwater to downstream sites and represented 1050% of bioavailable N (as sum of , and urea). Principal components analysis demonstrated that urea concentrations were elevated in agriculturally impacted lakes with abundant dissolved organic and inorganic nutrients (N, P, C) and low O2 concentrations, but were not correlated consistently with plankton abundance or community composition. Urea concentrations were more than twofold greater in lakes receiving N from cities than in agriculturally affected basins, despite low summer concentrations of urea in tertiary-treated urban effluent (c. 50% of lake values). Multiple regression models evaluated using Akaike Information Criterion showed that mean water-column O2 concentration was the single best predictor of in situ urea concentrations (r2 = 0.91, P = 0.002), but that urea concentrations were also correlated significantly with changes in longitudinal position and Secchi depth and with concentrations of , non-urea dissolved organic N (DON) and dissolved inorganic carbon. 4. Additional seasonal surveys of up to 69 closed-basin lakes within a 100 000-km2 region during 2004 and 2008 revealed that urea was abundant in 100% of measured sites and exhibited concentrations (81 +/- 48 mu g N L-1) similar to those observed in lakes with surface drainage (58 +/- 38 mu g N L-1). Further, non-urea DON accounted for 5099% of the total dissolved N pool in both open- and closed-basin lakes. 5. When combined with an extensive literature review and previous mass-budget analyses of the study lakes, these findings allowed the development of a first-generation model of the mechanisms regulating urea content of P-rich lakes of central North America. In this model, water-column concentrations of urea are predicted to be regulated mainly by algal decomposition in anoxic environments (sediments, hypolimnion), followed by redistribution into surface waters. Consequently, anthropogenic activities can increase the urea content of lakes by stimulating primary production, sedimentation and deepwater anoxia and by increasing influx of undegraded urea from agricultural and urban sources.

Simulated watershed scale impacts of corn stover removal for biofuel on hydrology and water quality	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						corn stover; biofuel sustainability; SWAT model; cellulosic ethanol; soil erosion; nonpoint source pollution	SOIL-EROSION; CROP RESIDUE; MANAGEMENT; MODEL; EVAPORATION; YIELD; PRODUCTIVITY; UNCERTAINTY; PLACEMENT; RAINFALL	Ethanol from corn stover is expected to play an important role in achieving the Energy Independence and Security Act 2007 target of 136.25 billion liters (36 billion gallons) of biofuel by 2022. The 2010 USDA biofuel strategic report estimates that 16.3 billion liters (4.3 billion gallons) of biofuel from crop residues such as corn stover and straw is possible. Corn stover is expected to provide the majority of the estimated biofuel from crop residues, especially from the Midwestern US Corn Belt. A major concern related to removing corn stover is potential negative hydrologic and water quality impacts. The overall goal of this study was to estimate the watershed scale environmental impacts of corn stover removal in an agricultural watershed in the Midwest US. Soil and Water Assessment Tool was used to simulate the impacts associated with three corn stover removal rates (38%, 52% and 70%). The stream flow, nitrate and mineral phosphorus loading were reduced, and sediment and organic nitrogen loading were increased at the watershed outlet with all three stover removal scenarios. The stream flow was reduced by 1.4%, 2.0% and 2.7% from the baseline scenario (no stover removed) at 38%, 52% and 70% stover removal rates, respectively. The sediment loading increased by 19.7%, 22.5% and 29.0%, organic nitrogen increased by 0.8%, 2.0% and 5.5%, mineral phosphorus decreased by 11.7%, 15.5% and 21.0%, and nitrate decreased by 2.0%, 3.2% and 5.3% from the baseline scenario at the watershed outlet with 38%, 52% and 70% stover removal rates, respectively. The model results also indicate that the watershed response to stover removal is sensitive to watershed characteristics and management inputs, such as, slope and amount of fertilizer applied.

Three nitrogen-models of varying hydrological complexity were considered. For each model, general sensitivity analysis (GSA) and Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) were applied, each based on 100,000 Monte Carlo simulations. The results highlighted the most complex structure as the most appropriate, providing the best representation of the non-linear patterns observed in the flow and streamwater nitrate concentrations between 1999 and 2002. Its 5% and 95% GLUE bounds, obtained considering a multi-objective approach, provide the narrowest band for streamwater nitrogen, which suggests increased model robustness, though all models exhibit periods of inconsistent good and poor fits between simulated outcomes and observed data. The results confirm the importance of the riparian zone in controlling the short-term (daily) streamwater nitrogen dynamics in this catchment but not the overall flux of nitrogen from the catchment. It was also shown that as the complexity of a hydrological model increases over-parameterisation occurs, but the converse is true for a water quality model where additional process representation leads to additional acceptable model simulations. Water quality data help constrain the hydrological representation in process-based models. Increased complexity was justifiable for modelling river-system hydrochemistry. Increased complexity was justifiable for modelling river-system hydrochemistry. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Assessing the spatial and temporal variations of water quality in lowland areas, Northern Germany	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Lowland; Best management practice; Nutrient; Pollution; SWAT; Modeling	HYDROLOGIC LANDSCAPE FUNCTIONS; LAND-USE PATTERNS; SURFACE-WATER; MODEL; GROUNDWATER; PHOSPHORUS; CATCHMENT; WETLANDS; FLOODPLAIN; RETENTION	The pollution of rivers and streams with agro-chemical contaminants has become one of the most crucial environmental problems in the world. The assessment of spatial and temporal variations of water quality influenced by point and diffuse source pollution is necessary to manage the environment sustainably in various watershed scales. The overall objectives of this study were to assess the transferability of parameter sets between lowland catchments on different scales using the ecohydrological model SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) and to evaluate the temporal and spatial patterns of water quality in the whole catchments before and after implementation of best management practices (BMPs). The study area Kielstau catchment is located in Northern Germany as typical example of lowland - flood plain landscape. Sandy, loamy and peat soils are characteristic for this area. Land use is dominated by arable land and pasture. In this study we examined two catchment areas including Kielstau catchment 50 km(2) and its subcatchment, namely Moorau, with the area of 7.6 km(2). The water quality of these catchments is not only influenced by diffuse sources from agricultural areas but also by point sources from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Diffuse sources as well as punctual entries from the WWTPs are considered in the model set-up. For this study, the calibration and validation of the model were carried out in a daily time step for flow and nutrients. The results indicate that the parameter sets could be transferred in lowland catchments with similar environmental conditions. Shallow groundwater is the major contributor to total nitrate load in the stream accounting for about 93% of the total nitrate load, while only about 7% originates in surface runoff and lateral flow. The study also indicates that applying a spatially distributed modeling approach was an appropriate method to generate source maps showing the spatial distribution of TN load from hydrologic response units (HRUs) as well as from subbasins and to identify the crucial pollution areas within a watershed whose management practices can be improved to control more effectively nitrogen loading to water bodies.

In this study, however, we attempted to find the positive role of these constructions in solving environmental problems. We explored the possibility for preventing downstream diatom blooms by using the water storage in the Danjiangkou Reservoir. And we developed a flushing strategy accessing the proper flushing time and water quantity to control the diatom growth. First, we set up a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to analyze the dynamics of the bloom-formation species, Stephanodiscus hantzschii, in response to the environmental variation. The model took into account the time lags between the biovolume and the environmental parameters. The model indicated that, air temperature explained the most variance in biovolume, followed by soluble reactive silicon (SRSi), turbidity, TP, dam release, PAR, pH and total nitrogen (GAM, R-2 = 0.759). Afterwards, we applied the model to a new predictive dataset, in which values were simulated according to the assumed dam release and air temperature. The GAM predicted fewer releases for flushing by using this dataset than the measured data, implying a prospect of saving water when using this strategy. Finally, we drew a contour map to present the operating procedure of this strategy. Our flushing strategy is to regulate the dam release above a critical value dependent on the air temperatures predicted over the following few days. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Effects of local climate and hydrological conditions on the thermal regime of a reservoir at Tropic of Cancer, in southern China	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Thermal regime; Hydrodynamic processes; Numerical simulation; Stratification; Water quality	PHYTOPLANKTON FUNCTIONAL-GROUPS; WATER; MANAGEMENT; LAKES; STRATIFICATION; EUTROPHICATION; RESTORATION; IMPACT; RIVER	Thermal regime is strongly associated with hydrodynamics in water, and it plays an important role in the dynamics of water quality and ecosystem succession of stratified reservoirs. Changes in both climate and hydrological conditions can modify thermal regimes. Liuxihe Reservoir (23 degrees 45'50 '' N; 113 degrees 46'52 '' E) is a large, stratified and deep reservoir in Guangdong Province, located at the Tropic of Cancer of southern China. The reservoir is a warm monomictic water body with a long period of summer stratification and a short period of mixing in winter. The vertical distribution of suspended particulate material and nutrients are influenced strongly by the thermal structure and the associated flow fields. The hypolimnion becomes anoxic in the stratified period, increasing the release of nutrients from the bottom sediments. Fifty-one years of climate and reservoir operational observations are used here to show the marked changes in local climate and reservoir operational schemes. The data show increasing air temperature and more violent oscillations in inflow volumes in the last decade, while the inter-annual water level fluctuations tend to be more moderate. To quantify the effects of changes in climate and hydrological conditions on thermal structure, we used a numerical simulation model to create scenarios incorporating different air temperatures, inflow volumes, and water levels. The simulations indicate that water column stability, the duration of the mixing period, and surface and outflow temperatures are influenced by both natural factors and by anthropogenic factors such as climate change and reservoir operation schemes. Under continuous warming and more stable storage in recent years, the simulations indicate greater water column stability and increased duration of stratification, while irregular large discharge events may reduce stability and lead to early mixing in autumn. Our results strongly suggest that more attention should be focused on water quality in years of extreme climate variation and hydrological conditions, and selective withdrawal of deep water may provide an efficient means to reduce internal loading in warm years.

Rapid effects of diverse toxic water pollutants on chlorophyll a fluorescence: Variable responses among freshwater microalgae	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Chlorophyll a fluorescence; Algae; Toxin; Rapid response; Photosystem II; Diuron (R); KCN; Glyphosate; Atrazine; F-v/F-m; Fluorometry; Pseudokirchneriella; Diatom; Cryptophyte; Chlorophyte; Chrysophyte; Water quality; Toxic water pollutant; Toxicity assessment	QUANTUM YIELD; GREEN-ALGAE; PHYTOPLANKTON; ATRAZINE; EXPOSURE; CYANIDE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; CYANOBACTERIA; FLUOROMETER; SENSITIVITY	Chlorophyll a fluorescence of microalgae is a compelling indicator of toxicity of dissolved water contaminants, because it is easily measured and responds rapidly. While different chl a fluorescence parameters have been examined, most studies have focused on single species and/or a narrow range of toxins. We assessed the utility of one chl a fluorescence parameter, the maximum quantum yield of PSII (F-v/F-m), for detecting effects of nine environmental pollutants from a range of toxin classes on 5 commonly found freshwater algal species, as well as the USEPA model species, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. F-v/F-m declined rapidly over <20 min in response to low concentrations of photosynthesis-specific herbicides Diuron (R) and metribuzin (both <40 nM), atrazine (<460 nM) and terbuthylazine (<400 nM). However, F-v/F-m also responded rapidly and in a dose-dependent way to toxins glyphosate (<90 mu M) and KCN (<1 mM) which have modes of action not specific to photosynthesis. F-v/F-m was insensitive to 30-40 mu M insecticides methyl parathion, carbofuran and malathion. Algal species varied in their sensitivity to toxins. No single species was the most sensitive to all nine toxins, but for six toxins to which algal F-v/F-m responded significantly, the model species P. subcapitata was less sensitive than other taxa. In terms of suppression of F-v/F-m within 80 min, patterns of concentration-dependence differed among toxins; most showed Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics, with half-saturation constant (K-m) values for the PSII inhibitors ranging from 0.14 mu M for Diuron (R) to 6.6 mu M for terbuthylazine, compared with a K-m of 330 mu M for KCN. Percent suppression of F-v/F-m by glyphosate increased exponentially with concentration. F-v/F-m provides a sensitive and easily-measured parameter for rapid and cost-effective detection of effects of many dissolved toxins. Field-portable fluorometers will facilitate field testing, however distinct responses between different species may complicate net F-v/F-m signal from a community. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Managing phosphorus fertilizer to reduce algae, maintain water quality, and sustain yields in water-seeded rice	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH			English	Article						Blue-green algae; Cyanobacteria; Fertilizer timing; Nostoc spongiaeforme; Phosphorus; Water-seeded rice	MODEL DEVELOPMENT; LOWLAND RICE; PADDY; PHOSPHATE; FIELDS	In water-seeded rice systems, cyanobacteria (Nostoc spongiaeforme) hinder early-season crop growth by dislodging and reducing light to seedlings. Since algae are often phosphorus (P) limited, we investigated whether changing the timing of P fertilizer application could reduce algal growth without reducing crop yields or increasing mid-season water P concentrations to levels of concern for water quality. Water P and algae were monitored in 10 and 12 (respectively) side-by-side fields (16-60 ha in size) where P fertilizer was applied pre-plant or where P application was delayed until after rice plants had emerged above the surface of the floodwater (2-5 weeks after seeding). Early-season water P concentration and algal occurrence were higher (P<0.001 and P=0.018, respectively) when P fertilizer was applied pre-plant as opposed to delayed. In fields receiving a delayed P application, water P increased to as high as 1.68 mg L-1 immediately following application and subsequently declined by 0.054 mg L-1 day(-1) (P=0.029). A separate study evaluated the effect of P fertilizer timing on crop productivity and P uptake. Triple-super-phosphate was either not applied or was applied to the soil surface in the fall prior to the cropping season, immediately prior to planting, 35 clays after seeding (DAS) and 49 DAS at a rate of 25 kg ha(-1) P. P uptake and agronomic P use efficiency (APUE) were similar when P was applied at seeding or 35 DAS. However, relative to P application at seeding, yields were reduced by 6% and there was lower APUE when P was applied after harvesting the previous crop or at 49 DAS (P<0.05). These results indicate that correctly timed, delayed fertilizer P applications can maximize rice yield while reducing early-season interference from algae. However, because delayed applications of P fertilizer also increased water P concentrations, drainage water must be managed carefully following application. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In general, plants that achieve high levels of nitrogen removal emit less N2O, indicating that no compromise is required between high water quality and lower N2O emissions. N2O emissions primarily occur in aerated zones/compartments/periods owing to active stripping, and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, rather than heterotrophic denitrifiers, are the main contributors. However, the detailed mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated, despite strong evidence suggesting that both nitrifier denitrification and the chemical breakdown of intermediates of hydroxylamine oxidation are probably involved. With increased understanding of the fundamental reactions responsible for N2O production in wastewater treatment systems and the conditions that stimulate their occurrence, reduction of N2O emissions from wastewater treatment systems through improved plant design and operation will be achieved in the near future.

A DRAINMOD-BASED METHOD TO ESTIMATE EFFECTS OF DRAINAGE WATER MANAGEMENT ON ANNUAL NITROGEN LOSS TO SURFACE WATER	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						Controlled drainage; DRAINMOD; DRAINMOD-NII; Environmental impact; Nutrient trading; Water quality	NITRATE LOSS; LOAMY SAND; MODEL; SUBIRRIGATION; STRATEGIES; SYSTEM; SOIL	Effects of drainage water management (DWM) on nitrogen (N) losses to surface waters can be estimated by multiplying the change in subsurface drainage and surface runoff, as predicted by DRAINMOD, by long-term mean nitrogen (N) concentration, which is a function of local site conditions (climate, soil, cropping system, farming practices, and drainage system). Consistent with experimental observations from several sources, this approximate method assumes that the effect of DWM on N losses is proportional to its effect on drainage and surface runoff volumes. The reliability of the method was evaluated by comparing estimated annual N losses for two sites (one in North Carolina and one in Illinois) to those predicted by the process-based nitrogen model DRAINMOD-NII. The long-term N concentrations used in the approximate method were based on DRAINMOD-NII predictions. DRAINMOD-NII simulations predicted that DWM would reduce long-term average N losses to surface waters by 35% for continuous corn (CC) and 33% for a corn-wheat-soybean (CWS) rotation in North Carolina and by 31% and 26% for CC and a corn-soybean (CS) rotation in Illinois. The approximate method estimated the annual effect of DWM on N losses within 3 kg ha(-1) of that predicted by DRAINMOD-NII in over 68% of the years for the CWS and CS rotations at both sites and in over 51% of the years for CC. Overestimated effects in some years were balanced by underestimated effects in others. However, relatively large errors occurred in about 25% of the years when N concentrations in the drainage water varied significantly from the long-term average. These errors typically occurred following periods when crop yields deviated significantly from the average. When these outliers were excluded from the analyses, the goodness of fit between annual N losses predicted by DRAINMOD-NII and annual losses estimated by the approximate method was substantially improved (Nash-Sutcliffe EF values ranging from 0.54 to 0.79). Although more research is needed to improve the approximate method when concentrations vary significantly from the long-term average, the results presented herein indicate that the method provides a reliable means of assessing impacts of DWM under normal conditions.

LABORATORY-SCALE EVALUATION OF ANIONIC POLYACRYLAMIDE AS AN EROSION AND SEDIMENT CONTROL MEASURE ON STEEP-SLOPED CONSTRUCTION SITES	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						Best management practices; Construction; Erosion control; Polyacrylamide; Turbidity	SILT LOAM SOIL; RUNOFF WATER-QUALITY; SPRINKLER IRRIGATION; RAINFALL CONDITIONS; PHOSPHORUS LOSS; PAM; AGRICULTURE; INFILTRATION; AMENDMENTS; CHEMISTRY	Suspended sediment is the primary pollutant prevalent in runoff waters exiting construction sites with exposed and disturbed land. In this research, the effectiveness of a chemical stabilizer, known as anionic polyacrylamide (PAM), to prevent erosion and promote sedimentation was examined using different application methods (i.e., dry granular vs. semi-dissolved solution). In this study, the effectiveness of Silt Stop 712, a proprietary PAM product, was tested using different application methods at three different rates, i.e., 16.8, 28, and 39.2 kg ha(-1) (15, 25, and 35 lbs acre(-1)), on bare, unseeded, unprotected 1.2 m x 0.6 m x 0.08 m (4 ft x 2 ft x 0.25 ft) laboratory-scale soil test plots. Laboratory-scale testing procedures using simulated rainfall were applied to mimic interrill erosion and sediment detachment scenarios similar to a highway embankment with a compacted 3H:1V fill slope. Our results showed that dry PAM treatments applied at the recommended rate of 39.2 kg ha(-1) (35 lbs acre(-1)) were capable of reducing turbidity by 97% and net soil loss by approximately 50% in comparison to the bare soil control. Conversely, semi-dissolved PAM treatments applied at the same rate, i.e., 39.2 kg ha(-1) (35 lbs acre(-1)), followed by a drying period of 48 h prior to the experiment, reduced turbidity by approximately 69% and soil loss by 76%. The lower application rates, i.e., 16.8 and 28 kg ha(-1) (15 and 25 lbs acre(-1)), of semi-dissolved PAM without a drying time were observed to lose effectiveness after about 40 min; however, the higher application rate of 39.2 kg ha(-1) (35 lbs acre(-1)) of semi-dissolved PAM provided consistent turbidity reductions throughout the entire experiment. Based on these results: (1) dry PAM applied directly to the surface at the manufacturer's recommended rate was more effective as a sediment control (i.e., turbidity reduction) measure, and (2) semi-dissolved PAM applied directly to the surface at the manufacturer's recommended rate and allowed to dry for 48 h prior to rainfall was a more effective erosion control (i.e., soil loss reduction) measure.

A GEOSPATIAL APPROACH TO TARGETING CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS FOR NITRATE REMOVAL IN AGRICULTURAL WATERSHEDS	APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						Constructed wetlands; Geographic Information System (GIS); Nitrate; Water quality; Watershed management	GULF-OF-MEXICO; MISSISSIPPI RIVER-BASIN; REDUCING NITROGEN; TILE DRAINAGE; HYPOXIA; PHOSPHORUS; NUTRIENT; RUNOFF; DENITRIFICATION; STRATEGIES	Constructed wetlands are an effective yet costly strategy for reducing nitrate loading from agricultural subsurface drainage in the Midwestern United States. Targeting wetland placement to sites that intercept high nitrate loads and where topography permits optimal wetland sizing can maximize wetland nitrate removal efficiency while maintaining productive agriculture. The goals of this work were first to determine targeted locations for constructed wetlands to remove nitrate by applying a geospatial approach within an Indiana study region, and second to estimate the nitrate removal efficiency of these proposed wetlands. Criteria were developed from previously published wetland siting criteria associated with the Iowa CR.EP program and adapted to Indiana-specific conditions. Final criteria included location on cropped land and not within open waterways, size of upland contributing area, presence of tile drainage, and wetland-like topography. Within the study region, 18 locations were found to meet the targeting criteria for strategic wetland placement, requiring land conversion of 0.08% of the study region and intercepting 2.7% of flow from tile-drained lands. Estimated wetland nitrate removal efficiency was on average 37%, including land conversion of wetland and surrounding buffers, resulting in the removal of approximately 1.0% of all nitrate currently exported from tile-drained land in the study area. Wetland placement was most influenced by criteria relating to contributing area, exclusion of streams where wetlands could be potentially located, and topography. Adjusting criteria could allow for a larger set of constructed wetlands and achieve greater overall nitrate reductions at the watershed scale, but this set would likely include less efficient wetlands.

A simple number given by any WQI model explains the level of water contamination. The objective was to develop a WQI for the water of the Luis L. Leon dam located in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico. Monthly water samples were obtained in 2009; January 10, February 12, March 8, May 20, June 10, July 9, August 12, September 10, October 11, November 15 and December 13. Ten sampling sites were randomly selected after dividing the study area using a geographic package. In each site, two samples at the top depth of 0.20 m and 1.0 m were obtained to quantify physical-chemical parameters. The following 11 parameters were considered to calculate the WQI; pH, Electrical Conductivity (EC), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), color, turbidity, ammonia nitrogen, fluorides, chlorides, sulfates, Total Solids (TS) and phosphorous (P). The data analysis involved two steps; a single analysis for each parameter and the WQI calculation. The resulted WQI value classified the water quality according to the following ranges: <2.3 poor water; from 2.3 to 2.8 good water; and >2.8 excellent water. The results showed that the WQI values changed from low levels (WQI < 2.3) in some points during autumn time to high levels (WQI > 2.8) most of the year and the variation was due to time of sampling generally rainy season.

Emerging Technologies for Removing Nonpoint Phosphorus from Surface Water and Groundwater: Introduction	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Editorial Material							CONSTRUCTED WETLAND SYSTEMS; COMBUSTION BY-PRODUCTS; COASTAL-PLAIN SOILS; SORBING MATERIALS; WASTE-WATER; DRAINAGE WATER; POULTRY LITTER; RUNOFF; MANURE; AMENDMENTS	Coastal and freshwater eutrophication continues to accelerate at sites around the world despite intense efforts to control agricultural P loss using traditional conservation and nutrient management strategies. To achieve required reductions in nonpoint P over the next decade, new tools will be needed to address P transfers from soils and applied P sources. Innovative remediation practices are being developed to remove nonpoint P sources from surface water and groundwater using P sorbing materials (PSMs) derived from natural, synthetic, and industrial sources. A wide array of technologies has been conceived, ranging from amendments that immobilize P in soils and manures to filters that remove P from agricultural drainage waters. This collection of papers summarizes theoretical modeling, laboratory, field, and economic assessments of P removal technologies. Modeling and laboratory studies demonstrate the importance of evaluating P removal technologies under controlled conditions before field deployment, and field studies highlight several challenges to P removal that may be unanticipated in the laboratory, including limited P retention by filters during storms, as well as clogging of filters due to sedimentation. Despite the potential of P removal technologies to improve water quality, gaps in our knowledge remain, and additional studies are needed to characterize the long-term performance of these technologies, as well as to more fully understand their costs and benefits in the context of whole-farm- and watershed-scale P management.

Economic Analysis of Best Management Practices to Reduce Watershed Phosphorus Losses	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							SOURCE AREA HYDROLOGY; AGRICULTURAL WATERSHEDS; LOADING FUNCTIONS; NUTRIENT LOSSES; SURFACE WATERS; BMP PLACEMENT; STREAM-FLOW; NEW-YORK; POLLUTION; QUALITY	In phosphorus-limited freshwater systems, small increases in phosphorus (P) concentrations can lead to eutrophication. To reduce P inputs to these systems, various environmental and agricultural agencies provide producers with incentives to implement best management practices (BMPs). In this study, we examine both the water quality and economic consequences of systematically protecting saturated, runoff-generating areas from active agriculture with selected BMPs. We also examine the joint water quality/economic impacts of these BMPs-specifically BMPs focusing on barnyards and buffer areas. Using the Variable Source Loading Function model (a modified Generalized Watershed Loading Function model) and net present value analysis (NPV), the results indicate that converting runoff-prone agricultural land to buffers and installing barnyard BMPs are both highly effective in decreasing dissolved P loss from a single-farm watershed, but are also costly for the producer. On average, including barnyard BMPs decreases the nutrient loading by about 5.5% compared with only implementing buffers. The annualized NPV for installing both buffers on only the wettest areas of the landscape and implementing barnyard BMPs becomes positive only if the BMPs lifetime exceeds 15 yr. The spatial location of the BMPs in relation to runoff producing areas, the time frame over which the BMPs are implemented, and the marginal costs of increasing buffer size were found to be the most critical considerations for water quality and profitability. The framework presented here incorporates estimations of nutrient loading reductions in the economic analysis, and is applicable to farms facing BMPs adoption decisions.

Manure nutrient management effects in the Leon River Watershed	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP); hydrologic modeling; Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT); subbasin; watershed modeling	SWAT MODEL; QUALITY	The Leon River Watershed (LRW) in central Texas is a Benchmark and Special Emphasis watershed within the Conservation Effects Assessment Project located in central Texas. Model simulations from 1977 through 2006 were used to evaluate six manure nutrient management scenarios that reflect realistic strategies that could be employed to reduce nutrient and sediment loadings in the LRW. Due to the presence of several dairies and a relatively large number of cows, special attention within this watershed is necessary to determine beneficial adjustments that can be made to protect water quality The nutrient management scenarios analyzed reduced total nitrogen (N) and total phosphorus (P) loading in nearly all of the subbasins. Total N and total P loading was also reduced at the watershed scale; sediment load reduction was minor due to effective management measures already existing within the LRW. The percentage change in total N and total P loadings varied from an increase of 3% to a decrease of 11% and an increase of 5% to a decrease of 12%, respectively. The percentage change in sediment loadings varied from an increase of 22% to a decrease of 12% per subbasin. Model simulations conducted over a 30-year period for six manure management scenarios indicated that both total N and total P can be significantly reduced by employing additional nutrient strategies. This is the case whether the nutrients are removed from the immediate vicinity of the dairy or are transported outside of the watershed.	[Rossi, C.

Nutrient losses in runoff from feedlot surfaces as affected by unconsolidated surface materials	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						beef cattle; feedlots; manure management; manure runoff; nutrient losses; water quality	RAINFALL SIMULATOR; CATTLE FEEDLOT; SPATIAL VARIATIONS; PLOT-SCALE; SOIL; TRANSPORT; EROSION; MANURE	Beef cattle feedlots contain unconsolidated surface materials (loose manure pack) that accumulate during a feeding cycle. The effects of varying amounts of unconsolidated surface materials on runoff nutrient losses are not well understood. The objectives of this study were to (1) compare runoff nutrient losses from feedlot surfaces containing varying amounts of unconsolidated surface materials, (2) determine if differences in runoff nutrient losses exist among rainfall simulation runs, (3) relate runoff nutrient losses to selected feedlot soil characteristics, and (4) identify the effects of varying runoff rate on nutrient loss rates from feedlot surfaces. This study was conducted on 0.75 m wide by 2 m long (2.47 ft wide by 6.58 ft long) plots containing 0, 6.7, 13.5, or 26.9 kg m(-2) (0, 1.37, 2.77, or 5.51 lb ft(-2)) of unconsolidated surface materials. Simulated rainfall was applied during three 30-minute events that were separated by 24-hour interval's. Inflow was added at the top of all plots during selected tests to examine the effects of varying flow rate on nutrient loss rates. No significant differences in the measured water quality parameters were found among the surfaces containing varying amounts of unconsolidated surface materials. Measurements of dissolved phosphorus, particulate phosphorus, total phosphorus, ammonium nitrogen, chloride, total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, and erosion consistently decreased during the three rainfall simulation runs. Runoff losses of ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), total nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen were all correlated to easily obtained soil EC measurements. All measured water quality parameters were significantly influenced by runoff rate. Thus, runoff rate, and not the amount of unconsolidated surface materials on the feedlot surface, significantly influenced nutrient losses in runoff.	[Gilley, J.

Data for electrical conductivity (EC), dry and suspended matter, residue on ignition, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD-5), ultraviolet extinction, dissolved oxygen (DO), oxygen saturation, pH, nitrates, total phosphorus, and nitrogen were collected between 1992 and 2006. The use of monthly medians combined with linear regression and two-sided t test has been proven to be the best approach for resolving trends from natural variability of investigated parameters and for determining trend significance. Patterns of temporal changes between different months were examined. It was also determined that spatial trends of some parameters oscillate in predictable manner, increasing in one part of the year and declining in the other. Regression slope coefficients, an excellent indicator for determining when the water quality is changing the most along the course of the Danube, reach their maximum during summer for temperature (t), electric conductivity, nitrates, and total N, while in the same season suspended matter, COD, BOD-5, DO, and oxygen saturation coefficients reach their minimum. Correlations for used data sets of selected parameters were analyzed for better understanding of their behavior and mutual relations. It was observed that as Danube flows through Serbia, its general eco-chemical status either stagnates or improves, but the rate of river self-purification often depends on the season of the year.

The hydraulic loading rate was 3.75 cm day(-1). Many of the monitored water quality parameters (biological oxygen demand [BOD], total suspended solids [TSS], total phosphorus [TP], total nitrogen [TN], total ammoniacal nitrogen [TAN], nitrate nitrogen [NO3], and Escherichia coli) were removed efficiently by the CWs, to the extent that the CW effluent was suitable for use on human food crops grown for raw produce consumption under Victorian state regulations and also suitable for reuse within aquaculture systems. The BOD, TSS, TP, TN, TAN, and E. coli removal in the A. donax and P. australis beds was 94%, 67%, 96%, 97%, 99.6%, and effectively 100% and 95%, 87%, 95%, 98%, 99.7%, and effectively 100%, respectively, with no significant difference (p > 0.007) in performance between the A. donax and P. australis CWs. In this study, as expected, the aboveground yield of A. donax top growth (stems + leaves) (15.0 +/- 3.4 kg wet weight) was considerably more than the P. australis beds (7.4 +/- 2.8 kg wet weight). The standing crop produced in this short (14-week) trial equates to an estimated 125 and 77 t ha(-1) year(-1) biomass (dry weight) for A. donax and P. australis, respectively (assuming that plant growth is similar across a 250-day (September-April) growing season and a single-cut, annual harvest). The similarity of the performance of the A. donax- and P. australis-planted beds indicates that either may be used in horizontal subsurface flow wetlands treating aquaculture wastewater, although the planting of A. donax provides additional opportunities for secondary income streams through utilization of the energy-rich biomass produced.

The case of Hungary's Lake Balaton (the largest shallow freshwater lake in Central Europe) and its catchment area was no exception. In the second part of the twentieth century it became clear that measures had to be taken to prevent further water quality deterioration. In order to do so, the Kis-Balaton Water Protection System (KBWPS) was established. To measure its effectiveness in filtering Lake Balaton's water input, total phosphorus and total nitrogen loads are regularly estimated. In this study the practice of temporal sampling frequency estimation is described using data series from the KBWPS in order to suggest a sampling frequency that is suitable for estimating annual nutrient loads and still produces a dataset from which environmental processes can be followed. In this case, temporal sampling frequency estimation was conducted using variogram analysis, before which trend removal was performed on four sampling sites and two daily sampled parameters for the years 1993-2007. Although the calculations were only carried out on two parameters they are applicable to other environmental parameters as well. Nutrient load estimation is used as a verification tool. The result of the variogram analysis pointed towards a three-day sampling frequency for the whole KBWPS in the case of total phosphorus and total nitrogen (if the purpose of the monitoring is nutrient estimation). This reduction in sampling frequency would make an approximately 50% cost reduction possible. The study gives an example of sampling frequency estimation which is a key question in every aspect of environmental science, so that hopefully it will be useful for scientists dealing with water protection issues.

Cyanobacteria blooms have been observed in a number of tributary bays and threaten the drinking water security of residents in the TGR region. To identify the key factors controlling phytoplankton blooms in tributary bays and propose an effective management strategy, a one-year water quality study (November 2009 to October 2010) was conducted in Xiangxi Bay (XXB) of TGR. The results show that a rapid decrease in mixing depth is associated with the spring bloom, fading of the fall bloom occurs with the rapid increase in mixing depth, and an extremely shallow mixing depth is associated with cyanobacteria blooms that predominate during the summer. Development of thermal stratification in XXB is the major cause of seasonal variation in mixing depth and density current intrusion from TGR is the major cause of short-term variation in mixing depth. The seasonal thermal stratification of XXB is disrupted by sufficiently large water level fluctuations in TGR. The density current is lifted from mid-depths to the surface and chlorophyll a concentrations rapidly decrease in response. Based on these findings, a conceptual model is proposed for a management strategy to control phytoplankton blooms in tributary bays via controlled releases from TGR. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Spectroradiometric Monitoring of Nannochloropsis salina Growth	ALGAL RESEARCH-BIOMASS BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS			English	Article						algal biofuel; algal growth; remote sensing; hyperspectral; reflectance	REMOTE-SENSING REFLECTANCE; INHERENT OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; CHLOROPHYLL-A CONCENTRATION; ARACHIDONIC-ACID CONTENT; OCEAN COLOR; WATER-QUALITY; PHYTOPLANKTON PIGMENTS; DIFFUSE-REFLECTANCE; SPECTRAL ABSORPTION; LIGHT ATTENUATION	The high productivity of fluidically mixed open ponds for algal biofuel production is accompanied by high environmental and temporal variability. Therefore, a recognized need exists for rapid monitoring of open ponds to quantify algal growth rates, assess algal stress, detect the presence of invading species, and determine the optimum time for harvesting. Multispectral/hyperspectral approaches are now being used to optimize conventional agriculture practices and similar remote sensing techniques can potentially be used for monitoring algal ponds. In this work, we assess the application of remote techniques for algal biofuel production by using a dual-channel spectroradiometer to monitor the laboratory-scale growth of Nannochloropsis sauna, a popular microalgal candidate for biofuels. One channel of the spectroradiometer measures the downwelling irradiance while the second channel simultaneously monitors the upwelling radiance, and the reflectance is calculated by ratioing these two signals. A detailed reflectance model is developed to interpret the acquired spectra, enabling a remote assessment the culture's optical depth as well as the relative optical activity of different algal pigments in N. salina.

J	Schmidt, CA; Clark, MW				Schmidt, Casey A.; Clark, Mark W.			Efficacy of a denitrification wall to treat continuously high nitrate loads	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Permeable reactive barrier; Bioreactor; Nitrate removal; Groundwater; Denitrification wall; DEA	MICROBIAL BIOMASS; EXTRACTION METHOD; CARBON DYNAMICS; ORGANIC-CARBON; REMOVAL; GROUNDWATER; NITROGEN; RATES; AQUIFER; CONTAMINATION	Denitrification walls have been proven as an effective, long-term method for remediating nitrogen in groundwater underneath agricultural lands. Utilizing walls to provide large N load reductions requires targeting a significant portion of agricultural effluent. One approach for more efficient application of walls is to locate them adjacent to zones with high groundwater flow, although treatment efficacy in these conditions is uncertain. In this study, a large wall (168 m(3)) receiving high N loads was assessed using a well transect array for hydraulic and water quality evaluations and media were collected from within the wall to evaluate enzyme activity with flow distance. Porewater velocity through the wall was rapid (1.7 m day(-1)) with short detention times (1.7-1.9 days), yet the wall treated 100 +/- 28 m(3) of groundwater per day, effectively removing 228 +/- 155 kg of total N per year. Maximum nitrate-N removal rates per media volume (4.9-5.5 g-N m(-3) d(-1)) were at the upper end of published values. Rapid reduction of potential denitrification rates in media samples from 4.89 g N m(-3) d(-1) to undetectable within a quarter of the wall length suggests that nitrate-N depletion drove a rapid reduction in denitrifying enzymes. Based on a carbon mass balance, dissolved organic C leaching was initially the largest C export process and the longevity of total bioavailable C was estimated as 23 +/- 5.9 years. These results indicate the ability of walls to reduce high N-loads over long timespans. Published by Elsevier B.V.

HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Sediment resuspension; Phosphorus budget; Internal phosphorus loading	PHOSPHORUS RELEASE; PHOSPHATE RELEASE; WATER-QUALITY; SHALLOW; BIOMANIPULATION; VESIJARVI; PH; PARTICLES; COMMUNITY; DYNAMICS	The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of sediment resuspension, a common phenomenon in many lakes, on the phosphorus budget of a eutrophicated lake. We used two different approaches, mass balance calculations and spatially comprehensive resuspension measurements, to determine the level of phosphorus loading from which rehabilitation action is started in a dimictic north temperate lake. The effect of resuspension was assumed to be significant, since it often is a governing process for cycling of material in lakes. Internal loading was multifold to that of external loading as determined by the budget calculation. Spatially comprehensive sedimentation and resuspension measurements were necessary, since deep site versus spatially comprehensive measurements had a marked difference in their results. Resuspension of P slightly exceeded the internal loading assessed by budget calculations and thereby proved its significance as a governing in-lake process that influences P cycling strongly. The shallow areas were of importance, since most of the total P load originated from there. The fate of P after resuspension depends on the retention capacity of resuspended particles in addition to prevailing biological and physico-chemical conditions. Therefore, sediment resuspension can either strengthen or diminish internal nutrient load and the processes of the shallow zones are of importance.

Reports of fish kills and water quality impairment are also becoming more frequent in many coastal waters. Water quality managers and regulatory agencies rely on numerical modeling tools to quantify the relative contributions of anthropogenic and "natural" pollutant loads (nutrients and biochemical oxygen demand) on dissolved oxygen levels and use the results for remedial activities and source control. The ability to conduct season-long simulations with sufficient nearshore resolution is therefore a key requirement. Mesh flexibility and the ability to increase site specific resolution without disturbing the larger domain setup and calibration are critical. The objective of this effort was to develop a robust biogeochemical model suitable for simulation of water quality dynamics including dissolved oxygen in complex coastal environments with multiple tidal channels, tidal flats, and density-driven circulation using unstructured-grid formulation. This paper presents an offline unstructured biogeochemical model that uses the Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) discretization of the study domain and the corresponding hydrodynamic solution to drive biogeochemical kinetics based on a water quality model CE-QUAL-ICM. In this paper, the linkage between selected hydrodynamic and water quality models is subjected to several scalar transport and biogeochemical module tests (plume transport and dilution, BOD/DO sag, and phytoplankton/nutrients reaction), and results are compared to their analytical solutions as part of model validation. A preliminary application of the biogeochemical model with a year-long simulation of Hood Canal basin in Puget Sound, USA, is presented as an example and a test of the tool in a real estuary setting. The model reproduced the dynamics and seasonal variations in the biogeochemical state variables and was used to test short-term wind-driven dynamics that could influence dissolved oxygen concentrations in Hood Canal.

Land Cover and Rainfall Interact to Shape Waterbird Community Composition	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CHESAPEAKE BAY; COASTAL URBANIZATION; NITROGEN EXPORT; MARINE; NUTRIENT; ABUNDANCE; CLIMATE; EUTROPHICATION; INDICATORS; INTEGRITY	Human land cover can degrade estuaries directly through habitat loss and fragmentation or indirectly through nutrient inputs that reduce water quality. Strong precipitation events are occurring more frequently, causing greater hydrological connectivity between watersheds and estuaries. Nutrient enrichment and dissolved oxygen depletion that occur following these events are known to limit populations of benthic macroinvertebrates and commercially harvested species, but the consequences for top consumers such as birds remain largely unknown. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) and structural equation modeling (SEM) to understand how land cover and annual variation in rainfall interact to shape waterbird community composition in Chesapeake Bay, USA. The MDS ordination indicated that urban subestuaries shifted from a mixed generalist-specialist community in 2002, a year of severe drought, to generalist-dominated community in 2003, of year of high rainfall. The SEM revealed that this change was concurrent with a sixfold increase in nitrate-N concentration in subestuaries. In the drought year of 2002, waterbird community composition depended only on the direct effect of urban development in watersheds. In the wet year of 2003, community composition depended both on this direct effect and on indirect effects associated with high nitrate-N inputs to northern parts of the Bay, particularly in urban subestuaries. Our findings suggest that increased runoff during periods of high rainfall can depress water quality enough to alter the composition of estuarine waterbird communities, and that this effect is compounded in subestuaries dominated by urban development. Estuarine restoration programs often chart progress by monitoring stressors and indicators, but rarely assess multivariate relationships among them. Estuarine management planning could be improved by tracking the structure of relationships among land cover, water quality, and waterbirds. Unraveling these complex relationships may help managers identify and mitigate ecological thresholds that occur with increasing human land cover.

J	Yu, C; Gao, B; Munoz-Carpena, R				Yu, Congrong; Gao, Bin; Munoz-Carpena, Rafael			Effect of dense vegetation on colloid transport and removal in surface runoff	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Colloids; Dense vegetation; Transport; Adsorption; Surface runoff; Drainage	STREAM-SUBSURFACE EXCHANGE; FECAL-COLIFORM TRANSPORT; FILTER STRIPS; POROUS-MEDIA; SEDIMENT; PHOSPHORUS; POLLUTION; RELEASE; DEPOSITION; KAOLINITE	Widely distributed in aquatic environment, colloids can pose risks to water quality, particularly when loaded in surface runoff, which can facilitate fast distribution of contaminants. It is unclear whether densely vegetated areas, which are known to be effective to reduce solutes and sediment from runoff, can be used to remove colloidal contaminants. In this paper, laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate effects of dense vegetation on colloid transport and removal in surface runoff. First, batch experiments were conducted to obtain the sorption isotherms of colloids (fluorescent microspheres) onto different vegetation parts (grass leaf, stem, and root). Then, a laboratory rainfall/runoff system was used to compare the transport behaviors of a tracer (bromide) and colloids in overland and drainage flows during a simulated rainfall event (64 mm/h). The system was equipped with Bahia grass growing on sandy soil containers with one surface flow and four vertical drainage sampling outlets. We found that all grass parts can sorb aqueous colloids with the Langmuir maximum sorption capacity between 455.3 and 1188.3 mg kg(-1). Runoff experimental results demonstrated that both the surface vegetation and the soil (including plant root) underneath can effectively remove colloids from surface and subsurface flows. Only about 33% of the applied colloids were recovered from the outflows, with about 29% and 4% from overland flow and drainages, respectively. Our results suggest that well designed and maintained areas of dense vegetation, like vegetative filter strips, can be used as an effective best management practice to reduce colloidal contaminants in surface runoff.

Modelling in-stream temperature and dissolved oxygen at sub-daily time steps: An application to the River Kennet, UK	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Modelling; QUESTOR; Dissolved oxygen; Water temperature; Kennet	WATER-QUALITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; PHOSPHORUS REMEDIATION; CARBON-DIOXIDE; LOWLAND RIVERS; SEWAGE INPUTS; CHALK STREAM; THAMES; DYNAMICS; IMPACTS	The River Kennet in southern England shows a clear diurnal signal in both water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations through the summer months. The water quality model QUESTOR was applied in a stepwise manner (adding modelled processes or additional data) to simulate the flow, water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations along a 14 km reach. The aim of the stepwise model building was to find the simplest process-based model which simulated the observed behaviour accurately. The upstream boundary used was a diurnal signal of hourly measurements of water temperature and dissolved oxygen. In the initial simulations, the amplitude of the signal quickly reduced to zero as it was routed through the model; a behaviour not seen in the observed data. In order to keep the correct timing and amplitude of water temperature a heating term had to be introduced into the model. For dissolved oxygen, primary production from macrophytes was introduced to better simulate the oxygen pattern. Following the modifications an excellent simulation of both water temperature and dissolved oxygen was possible at an hourly resolution. It is interesting to note that it was not necessary to include nutrient limitation to the primary production model. The resulting model is not sufficiently proven to support river management but suggests that the approach has some validity and merits further development.

J	Alam, MJ; Goodall, JL				Alam, Md Jahangir; Goodall, Jonathan L.			Toward disentangling the effect of hydrologic and nitrogen source changes from 1992 to 2001 on incremental nitrogen yield in the contiguous United States	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							GULF-OF-MEXICO; NUTRIENT; DELIVERY; STREAMS; REGRESSION; HYPOXIA; EXPORT; LOADS	The goal of this research was to quantify the relative impact of hydrologic and nitrogen source changes on incremental nitrogen yield in the contiguous United States. Using nitrogen source estimates from various federal data bases, remotely sensed land use data from the National Land Cover Data program, and observed instream loadings from the United States Geological Survey National Stream Quality Accounting Network program, we calibrated and applied the spatially referenced regression model SPARROW to estimate incremental nitrogen yield for the contiguous United States. We ran different model scenarios to separate the effects of changes in source contributions from hydrologic changes for the years 1992 and 2001, assuming that only state conditions changed and that model coefficients describing the stream water-quality response to changes in state conditions remained constant between 1992 and 2001. Model results show a decrease of 8.2% in the median incremental nitrogen yield over the period of analysis with the vast majority of this decrease due to changes in hydrologic conditions rather than decreases in nitrogen sources. For example, when we changed the 1992 version of the model to have nitrogen source data from 2001, the model results showed only a small increase in median incremental nitrogen yield ( 0.12%). However, when we changed the 1992 version of the model to have hydrologic conditions from 2001, model results showed a decrease of approximately 8.7% in median incremental nitrogen yield. We did, however, find notable differences in incremental yield estimates for different sources of nitrogen after controlling for hydrologic changes, particularly for population related sources. For example, the median incremental yield for population related sources increased by 8.4% after controlling for hydrologic changes. This is in contrast to a 2.8% decrease in population related sources when hydrologic changes are included in the analysis. Likewise we found that median incremental yield from urban watersheds increased by 6.8% after controlling for hydrologic changes-in contrast to the median incremental nitrogen yield from cropland watersheds, which decreased by 2.1% over the same time period. These results suggest that, after accounting for hydrologic changes, population related sources became a more significant contributor of nitrogen yield to streams in the contiguous United States over the period of analysis. However, this study was not able to account for the influence of human management practices such as improvements in wastewater treatment plants or Best Management Practices that likely improved water quality, due to a lack of data for quantifying the impact of these practices for the study area.

Local parameterization of remote sensing algorithms is useful to cope with the variability and specificity of optically-active in-water constituents. Using the Bay of Biscay coastal waters, affected by Basque river runoffs, as a case study, the objectives of this investigation are to: 1. develop an empirical algorithm to estimate water surface chl-a for the optically-complex Basque coastal waters; 2. explore the influence of suspended matter, phytoplankton species, and pigment content on the algorithm developed for medium resolution imaging spectrometer instrument (MERIS) imagery; 3. compare the local algorithm to three ocean color algorithms (OC4v6, Gitelson's algorithm, and the OC5); and 4. apply the local algorithm to the MERIS images. For this purpose, two surveys were undertaken within the study area, the Batel-1 survey in 2007, and the Batel-2, in 2009. The empirical algorithm was developed with remote sensing reflectances (R-rs), undertaken with a TriOS field spectrometer, and chl-a measured in situ from the Batel-2 survey. The algorithm was not affected by different concentrations of suspended matter in surface waters, within the range from 0.0 to 6.6 g . m(-3). There was no significant effect of 23 accessory pigments found in the area on the algorithm. Eighty-four R-rs and chl-a measurements from the Batel-1 survey were used to validate the local algorithm and to compare it with output of the other algorithms. The local algorithm provided the lowest root-mean-square difference (RMS = 1.7 mg . m(-3)), the best correlation with the observed data (R = 0.8), together with the best slope-intercept combination between predicted and observed chl-a (slope = 0.5, intercept = 0.6). The chl-a algorithm developed here for MERIS imagery can assist in the assessment of water ecological status in the southeastern part of the Bay of Biscay, in a cost-effective manner.

Thus, it is significant to carry out integrative evaluation on NPS pollution loading from soil erosion. Pollutants nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) were chosen as assessment indices, and the method of export coefficient model was adopted for statistical calculation of the pollutants loading distribution across the country. The results showed that the total NPS pollution loading in 2007 achieved 2.44 x 10(10)kg in the country, of which COD contributed the largest proportion (83.3%), followed by total N and P. There were huge differences existed on the 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. Spatial variability of pollutants loading and intensity was caused by many influencing factors including regional social economy levels, agriculture conservation practices, climate, hydrological factors and so on. Our study showed that it was much more rigorous in the west than in the east of China, especially in the northwestern Loess Plateau. This study is the first national scale evaluation of the main non-point source pollution loads, and provides some references on environmental protection and sustainable development.

J	Tota-Maharaj, K; Scholz, M				Tota-Maharaj, Kiran; Scholz, Miklas			Artificial Neural Network Simulation of Combined Permeable Pavement and Earth Energy Systems Treating Storm Water	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article						Permeable pavement; Storm water management; Neural networks; Water quality models; Urban drainage; Geothermal heat pump	SOURCE HEAT-PUMPS; QUALITY PARAMETERS; URBAN RUNOFF; MODEL; PREDICTIONS; PERFORMANCE; ALGORITHMS; LEVEL	Artificial intelligence techniques, such as neural networks, are modeling tools that can be applied to analyze urban runoff quality issues. Artificial neural networks are frequently used to model various highly variable and nonlinear physical phenomena in the water and environmental engineering fields. The application of neural networks for analyzing the performance of combined permeable pavement and earth energy systems is timely and novel. This paper presents the application of back-propagation neural networks and the testing of the Levenberg-Marquardt, Quasi-Newton, and Bayesian Regularization algorithms. The neural networks were statistically assessed for their goodness of prediction with respect to the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), ammonia-nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen, and ortho-phosphate-phosphorus by numerical computation of the mean absolute error, root-mean-square error, mean absolute relative error, and the coefficient of correlation for the prediction compared with the corresponding measured data. The three neural network models were assessed for their efficiency in accurately simulating the effluent water quality parameters from various experimental pavement systems. The models predicted all key parameters with high correlation coefficients and low minimum statistical errors. The back-propagation and feed-forward neural network models performed optimally as pollutant removal predictors with regard to these two sustainable technologies.

Assessing a bioremediation strategy in a shallow coastal system affected by a fish farm culture - Application of GIS and shellfish dynamic models in the Rio San Pedro, SW Spain	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article						Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture; Bioremediation; Geographic information systems; Carrying capacity; Carbon and nitrogen mass balance; Eutrophication	GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT; MULTI-TROPHIC AQUACULTURE; INTENSIVE AQUACULTURE; ESTUARINE MACROALGAE; DISSOLVED NUTRIENTS; CRASSOSTREA-GIGAS; SITE SELECTION; SEA BASS; BIOFILTERING EFFICIENCY	An integrated multi-trophic aquaculture assessment for Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) aquaculture as a bioremediation strategy in areas impacted by fish farm effluents in Rio San Pedro was assessed by combining geographic information system with carrying capacity models. Sites of 0.44 km(2) were evaluated considering constraints; physical factors, growth and survival factors, environmental quality factors, water and sediment quality criteria, factor suitability ranges, and Multi-Criteria Evaluation. Isleta and Flamenco are promising sites for oyster production, and Dorada is of marginal interest. Carbon and nitrogen removal from the water by algae and through detritus filtration was estimated. The biodeposition of organic material from longline leases was found to have little negative impact on sediment. The eutrophication results indicate that phytoplankton removal had a positive impact on water quality at the Dorada. This case study quantified the direct profitability and bioremediative environmental service advantages that fish-shellfish farms can have relative to fish monocultures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Using multivariate analyses, we defined relationships between sub-fossil chironomid assemblage composition and environmental variables in 26 shallow lakes of northeastern USA and quantified how differences in taxonomic resolution affect transfer function model performance. Using redundancy analysis, we found that chironomid assemblages are best explained by turbidity, dissolved inorganic carbon and drainage basin/lake area ratio. Turbidity explained the greatest proportion of variance found in the chironomid assemblage (10.4%), followed by total nitrogen. Through ordination analyses and an analysis of similarity, we found that macrophyte density was also a significant predictor of chironomid assemblages. We used partial least squares analysis to develop a robust model for quantitative reconstruction of turbidity, with r (jack) (2) = 0.62. When using a more coarsely resolved taxonomic dataset, we found that model performance statistics were weaker, suggesting the need for fine-resolution taxonomy. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of variables related to lake trophic state in structuring chironomid assemblages in shallow, temperate lakes and provide tools for inferring past ecological changes in these ecosystems.

Site-Specific Simulation of Nutrient Control Policies: Integrating Economic and Water Quality Effects	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS			English	Article						nitrogen; nutrient policy; phosphorus; water quality	RACCOON RIVER; EUTROPHICATION; INSTRUMENTS; POLLUTION; WASTE; RISK	A watershed-based modeling system is developed to assess alternative nutrient abatement policies, including fertilizer taxes, application caps, and uniform reductions. A microeconometric model of nutrient use is estimated using farm-level data, prices, and spatially detailed soil and land characteristics. Results are interfaced with a physical watershed model to predict water quality changes. Simulations demonstrate differences in water quality effects across policies. For nitrate loads at the watershed outlet, an application cap provides slightly superior performance for small reductions, but a tax is more efficient under larger reductions. Phosphorus reductions at the sub-watershed level vary but provide information about policy tradeoffs.

Application of the WFD cost proportionality principle to diffuse pollution mitigation: A case study for Scottish Lochs	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Water Framework Directive; Disproportionality; Phosphorus pollution; Lochs; Screening tool; Scotland	WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; WATER-QUALITY; PHOSPHORUS; RIVER; CONTEXT; IMPLEMENTATION; IMPROVEMENTS; AGRICULTURE; MANAGEMENT; BENEFITS	The Water Framework Directive (WFD) aims to deliver good ecological status (GES) for Europe's waters. It prescribes the use of economic principles, such as derogation from GES on grounds of disproportionate costs of mitigation. This paper proposes an application of the proportionality principle to mitigation of phosphorus (P) pollution of 544 Scottish lochs at national and local water body scales. P loading estimates were derived from a national diffuse pollution screening tool. For 293 of these lochs (31% of the loch area), GES already occurred. Mitigation cost-effectiveness was assessed using combined mitigation cost curves for managed grassland, rough grazing, arable land, sewage and septic tank sources. These provided sufficient mitigation (92% of national P load) for GES to be achieved on another 31% of loch area at annualised cost of 2.09 pound m/y. Mitigation of the residual P loading preventing other lochs achieving GES was considered by using a "mop-up" cost of 200 pound/kg P (assumed cost effectiveness of removal of P directly from lochs), leading to a total cost of 189 pound m/y. Lochs were ranked by mitigation costs per loch area to give a national scale marginal mitigation cost curve. A published choice experiment valuation of WFD targets for Scottish lochs was used to estimate marginal benefits at national scale and combined with the marginal cost curve. This gave proportionate costs of 5.7 pound m/y leading to GES in 72% of loch area. Using national mean marginal benefits with a scheme to estimate changes in individual loch value with P loading gave proportionate costs of 25.6 pound m/y leading to GES in 77% of loch area (491 lochs).

Hydrochemistry and thermal activity of damt region, Yemen	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Hydrochemistry; Thermal water; Yemen; Pollution; Water quality	WATER	The aim of this study was to identify the complex hydrogeological and hydrochemistry conditions of Damt region, through determining hydrochemical properties of groundwater in the study area. According to the results of hydrochemical analyses, sampled waters can be divided into three groups: cold, thermal, and mixed waters. Thermal waters in the area are characterized by Na-HCO3, while the cold waters by CaHCO3 facies. HCO3 indiscriminate cation and/or Na-indiscriminate anion are present in many places in the region and indicate generally mixing water. Only three villages with dental fluorosis observed using water elevated in F- for drinking. Agricultural and liquid waste disposal are the main sources of pollution, leads to increase of Na, Cl, NO3, Cd, and Iron. The groundwater flow is from north, northwest, and northeast to the south. Within this regional trend, structural controlling groundwater flow along Wadis and it flows from upper reaches of tributaries toward the main channel, then downward to the south of the study area. The similarity of TDS and Cl concentration at Qa'a Al Haql and Al Nadirah between aquifers indicates hydraulic continuity between alluvial and the underlying volcanic, while at Damt no hydraulic continuity found between alluvial, volcanic and Sandstone aquifers. The temporal variation shows slight decrease in the concentration of nitrate and sulfate of thermal water indicating previously high gas content of nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide in the thermal active region. The developed conceptual model of water circulation indicates flood waters infiltrate slowly through the wadi bottoms in the East where Sandstone aquifer outcrops. These waters flow westward, following the westerly dip of the Sandstone through the effects of gravity, gains heat and dissolve materials as it comes in contact with the numerous dykes, which are the feeders to the overlying volcanoes and sputter cones. All thermal water samples from Damt region fall into immature water field in NA-K-Mg diagram. Therefore, the results obtained from the cation geothermometers should be taken into account as doubtful.

The analyses target three organic pollution factors, that is, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), for understanding their time series influence pattern and responses among the various water quality parameters. After model matching of the many vectors, the optimal matching model combination, VARMA(1,0,1)-GARCH(1,1), was selected for depicting the time series dependence of the selected pollutant factors. Results of impulse response analyses reveal that BOD responds immediately to changes of current DO and that the consumption of DO is not obvious during the initial stage of NH3-N decomposition. During the one time lag period, NH3-N is further oxidized into nitrite and nitrate to cause obvious increase of DO consumption. In this article, the statistical technology is used to develop the VARMA-GARCH integration model for simulating and predicting the water quality using data collected in the watershed of northern Taiwan. Therefore, the internal mechanism and the significance represented by the process of constructing the model can be expanded. The model proposed in this research will allow the user to grasp the instantaneous changes of the time series water quality in the watershed. Results will provide valuable references for the water quality authority to implement timely and effective water management measures in response to changes of water quality.

It has created a major water quality problem worldwide. The laboratory batch experiments were conducted to investigate the feasibility of HCl-treated zero-valent iron (Fe-0) combined with different adsorbents as hybrid systems for simultaneous removal of nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) ions from aqueous solution. The maximum NO3- removal in combined Fe-0-granular activated carbon (GAC), Fe-0-filtralite and Fe-0-sepiolite systems was 86, 96 and 99%, respectively, at 45 degrees C for 24 h reaction time. The NO3- removal rate increased with the increase in initial NO3- concentration. The NO3- removal efficiency by hybrid systems was in the order of sepiolite > filtralite > GAC. The NH4+ produced during the denitrification process by Fe-0 was successfully removed by the adsorbents, with the removal efficiency in the order of GAC > sepiolite > filtralite. Results of the present study suggest that the use of a hybrid system could be a promising technology for achieving simultaneous removal of NO3- and NH4+ ions from aqueous solution.

Development and evaluation of equations in the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System to predict nitrogen excretion in lactating dairy cows	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						nitrogen excretion; dairy cow; modeling	MILK UREA NITROGEN; FED GRASS-SILAGE; METABOLIZABLE PROTEIN; RUMINAL FERMENTATION; UNDEGRADABLE PROTEIN; NUTRIENT EXCRETION; DIETARY-PROTEIN; AMINO-ACIDS; RED-CLOVER; BALANCE	Nitrogen excretion is of particular concern on dairy farms, not only because of its effects on water quality, but also because of the subsequent release of gases such as ammonia to the atmosphere. To manage N excretion, accurate estimates of urinary N (UN) and fecal N (FN) are needed. On commercial farms, directly measuring UN and FN is impractical, meaning that quantification must be based on predictions rather than measured data. The purpose of this study was to use a statistical approach to develop equations and evaluate the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System's (CNCPS) ability to predict N excretion in lactating dairy cows, and to compare CNCPS predictions to other equations in the literature. Urinary N was over-predicted by the CNCPS due to inconsistencies in N accounting within the model that partitioned more N to feces than urine, although predicted total N excretion was reasonable. Data to refine model predictions were compiled from published studies (n = 32) that reported total collection N balance results. Considerable care was taken to ensure the data included in the development data set (n = 104) accounted for >90% of the N intake (NI). Unaccounted N for the compiled data set was 1.47 +/- 4.60% (mean +/- SD). The results showed that FN predictions could be improved by using a modification of a previously published equation: FN (g/d) = [{[NI (g/kg of organic matter) x (1 - 0.842)] + 4.3} x organic matter intake (kg/d)] x 1.20, which, when evaluated against the compiled N balance data, had a squared coefficient of determination based on a mean study effect (R-MP(2)) of 0.73, concurrent correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.83 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 10.38 g/d. Urinary N is calculated in the CNCPS as the difference between NI and other N excretion and losses. Incorporating the more accurate FN prediction into the current CNCPS framework and correcting an internal calculation error considerably improved UN predictions (RMSE = 12.73 g/d, R-MP(2) = 0.86, CCC = 0.90). The changes to FN and UN translated into an improved prediction of total manure N excretion (RMSE = 12.42 g/d, R-MP(2) = 0.96, CCC = 0.97) and allows nutritionists and farm advisors to evaluate these factors during the ration formulation process.

Temporal and Spatial Simulation of Adsorbed Nitrogen and Phosphorus Nonpoint Source Pollution Load in Xiaojiang Watershed of Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article						Three Gorges Reservoir area; uncertainty; adsorbed nonpoint source pollution; blind number; rainfall erosivity factor; sediment delivery ratio	SOIL LOSS EQUATION; PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS; YANGTZE-RIVER; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; MODELING SYSTEM; LAND-USE; EROSION; SEA; PREDICTION; CHANGJIANG	The presence of nonpoint source (NPS) pollution due to agricultural activities at the Three Gorges Reservoir Area in China has been of concern to the public in recent years. Due to the extent of the polluted area and seasonal dispersion mode, sediments have greatly impacted the water quality in the area. Generation and formation of adsorbed NPS pollution involves great uncertainty, which makes monitoring and controlling pollution very difficult. Rainfall erosivity factors, which are calculated by surface rainfall data from watershed hydrological simulation, and sediment delivery ratios were both selected and determined as the dynamic factors, whereas blind number theory was introduced and used to describe and deal with the factors' uncertainty of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Through the integration among blind number theory, dynamic factors, and pollution load model, parameter uncertainty and model dynamics could be better understood in the new and comprehensive pollution load model using GIS technology. Results indicated that rainfall runoff and sediment delivery ratio had significantly affected the uncertainty of final adsorbed NPS pollution load simulation results; the magnitude of adsorbed nitrogen and phosphorus loads from different land use types in descending order in turn was glebe, grassland, paddy fields, forestland, and urban land. This work provides a theoretical basis for control and management of soil loss and NPS pollution in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, and these data are also useful in evaluating potential soil loss and NPS pollution loads in the watershed.

J	Elliott, JA				Elliott, J. Alex			Is the future blue-green? A review of the current model predictions of how climate change could affect pelagic freshwater cyanobacteria	WATER RESEARCH			English	Review						Lake modelling; Nitrogen limitation; Phenology; Water quality; Eutrophication	NUTRIENT LOAD; PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES; LAKE RESTORATION; TEMPERATURE; SIMULATION; EUTROPHICATION; SENSITIVITY; MANAGEMENT; DOMINANCE; RESPONSES	There is increasing evidence that recent changes in climate have had an effect on lake phytoplankton communities and it has been suggested that it is likely that Cyanobacteria will increase in relative abundance under the predicted future climate. However, testing such a qualitative prediction is challenging and usually requires some form of numerical computer model. Therefore, the lake modelling literature was reviewed for studies that examined the impact of climate change upon Cyanobacteria. These studies, taken collectively, generally show an increase in relative Cyanobacteria abundance with increasing water temperature, decreased flushing rate and increased nutrient loads. Furthermore, they suggest that whilst the direct effects of climate change on the lakes can change the timing of bloom events and Cyanobacteria abundance, the amount of phytoplankton biomass produced over a year is not enhanced directly by these changes. Also, warmer waters in the spring increased nutrient consumption by the phytoplankton community which in some lakes caused nitrogen limitation later in the year to the advantage of some nitrogen-fixing Cyanobacteria. Finally, it is also possible that an increase in Cyanobacteria dominance of the phytoplankton biomass will lead to poorer energy flow to higher trophic levels due to their relatively poor edibility for zooplankton.

J	Reichwaldt, ES; Ghadouani, A				Reichwaldt, Elke S.; Ghadouani, Anas			Effects of rainfall patterns on toxic cyanobacterial blooms in a changing climate: Between simplistic scenarios and complex dynamics	WATER RESEARCH			English	Review						Climate change; Rainfall; Cyanobacteria; Cyanobacterial toxins; Algal blooms; Review	BLUE-GREEN-ALGAE; ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN DEPOSITION; LAND-USE CHANGE; WATER-QUALITY; CYLINDROSPERMOPSIS-RACIBORSKII; MICROCYSTIN-LR; FRESH-WATER; PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS; SPECIES COMPOSITION; WET DEPOSITION	Toxic cyanobacterial blooms represent a serious hazard to environmental and human health, and the management and restoration of affected waterbodies can be challenging. While cyanobacterial blooms are already a frequent occurrence, in the future their incidence and severity are predicted to increase due to climate change. Climate change is predicted to lead to increased temperature and changes in rainfall patterns, which will both have a significant impact on inland water resources. While many studies indicate that a higher temperature will favour cyanobacterial bloom occurrences, the impact of changed rainfall patterns is widely under-researched and therefore less understood. This review synthesizes the predicted changes in rainfall patterns and their potential impact on inland waterbodies, and identifies mechanisms that influence the occurrence and severity of toxic cyanobacterial blooms. It is predicted that there will be a higher frequency and intensity of rainfall events with longer drought periods in between. Such changes in the rainfall patterns will lead to favourable conditions for cyanobacterial growth due to a greater nutrient input into waterbodies during heavy rainfall events, combined with potentially longer periods of high evaporation and stratification. These conditions are likely to lead to an acceleration of the eutrophication process and prolonged warm periods without mixing of the water column. However, the frequent occurrence of heavy rain events can also lead to a temporary disruption of cyanobacterial blooms due to flushing and de-stratification, and large storm events have been shown to have a long-term negative effect on cyanobacterial blooms. In contrast, a higher number of small rainfall events or wet days can lead to proliferation of cyanobacteria, as they can rapidly use nutrients that are added during rainfall events, especially if stratification remains unchanged. With rainfall patterns changing, cyanobacterial toxin concentration in waterbodies is expected to increase. Firstly, this is due to accelerated eutrophication which supports higher cyanobacterial biomass. Secondly, predicted changes in rainfall patterns produce more favourable growth conditions for cyanobacteria, which is likely to increase the toxin production rate. However, the toxin concentration in inland waterbodies will also depend on the effect of rainfall events on cyanobacterial strain succession, a process that is still little understood. Low light conditions after heavy rainfall events might favour non-toxic strains, whilst inorganic nutrient input might promote the dominance of toxic strains in blooms. This review emphasizes that the impact of changes in rainfall patterns is very complex and will strongly depend on the site-specific dynamics, cyanobacterial species composition and cyanobacterial strain succession. More effort is needed to understand the relationship between rainfall patterns and cyanobacterial bloom dynamics, and in particular toxin production, to be able to assess and mediate the significant threat cyanobacterial blooms pose to our water resources.

The influence of tidal forcing on groundwater flow and nutrient exchange in a salt marsh-dominated estuary	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Wetlands; Nutrient cycling; Spartina; Tides; Numerical models; Groundwater	SPARTINA-ALTERNIFLORA; SPATIAL PATTERNS; WATER-MOVEMENT; UNITED-STATES; NITROGEN; SEDIMENTS; WETLANDS; SEEPAGE; BALANCE; RIVERS	Data from salt marshes in the U.S. Southeast show that long-term variations in mean water level (MWL) correlate strongly with salt marsh productivity and porewater salinity. Here we used numerical models of tidally-driven groundwater flow to assess the effect of variations in tidal amplitude and MWL on porewater exchange between salt marshes and tidal creeks. We modeled homogeneous and layered stratigraphy and compared flat and sloped topography for the marsh surface. Results are consistent with field observations and showed that increases in tidal amplitude increased groundwater flushing, particularly when increasing the tidal amplitude caused the marsh platform to be inundated at high tide. Increases in MWL caused groundwater flushing to increase if that rise caused greater areas of the marsh to be inundated at high tide. Once the marsh was fully inundated at high tide, further increases in MWL caused groundwater flushing to decrease. Results suggest that small increases in MWL associated with sea level rise could increase nutrient export significantly in marshes with elevations that are equilibrated near mean high water, but rising sea level could decrease the export of nutrients to, and thus fertility in, estuaries adjacent to marshes that are equilibrated lower in the tidal frame. Likewise, macrotidal estuaries are predicted to be subject to much larger groundwater and nutrient exchange than similar microtidal estuaries. We speculate that the early stages of rising relative sea level may significantly impact water quality in estuaries that are not river-dominated by raising the discharge of nutrients from coastal wetlands.

Changes in amorphous silica sequestration with eutrophication of riverine impoundments	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Biogenic silica; Trapping efficiency; Mississippi River; Eutrophication; Riverine lake	UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER; WATER-QUALITY TRENDS; ST-CROIX RIVER; DISSOLVED SILICATE; BIOGENIC SILICA; PHOSPHORUS; SEDIMENT; MINNESOTA; FLUXES; BIOGEOCHEMISTRY	The effect of eutrophication on particulate amorphous silica (ASi) sequestration was isolated and quantified in Lake St. Croix and Lake Pepin, two natural, human-impacted impoundments of the upper Mississippi River. In contrast to impoundments behind engineered dams, where silica (Si) fluxes may be changed by various aspects of dam construction, these two riverine lakes have long (9,000+ years) sedimentary sequences that record the entire span of cultural eutrophication and the resulting silica sequestration. The concentrations of dissolved silicate (DSi) and ASi in the lake inflows were measured for 1 year to obtain the total flux of bioavailable silica (TSib = DSi + ASi) to each impoundment. Historical rates of Si sequestration in each lake were determined using ASi burial in multiple sediment cores and modeled estimates of historical TSib fluxes. The Si trapping efficiency of each lake was found to have increased exponentially with cultural eutrophication (estimated two- to fivefold increase in Lake St. Croix and 9- to 16-fold increase in Lake Pepin over the last 100 years), indicating the degree to which eutrophication of impoundments can reduce silica export to downstream coastal and marine ecosystems. Because these two lakes presently exhibit different degrees of eutrophication, together they depict a relationship between phosphorus concentration and Si trapping efficiency that may be applied to other impoundments, including human-made reservoirs.

RESULTS: The accuracy of the model was validated by monitoring data over the Hanjiang River. The validated model was then used to evaluate the effects of the Reforestation of Cultivated Land (RFCL) initiative. The simulation results showed that RFCL would cause an obvious decrease in surface runoff (-23.6%, P < 0.01) but an increase in groundwater (71.8%, P < 0.01) and percolation out of the soil (24.7%, P < 0.01). The total water yield does not change significantly (-4.4%), but the decrease in total sediment loading is substantial (-56.2%, P < 0.01). The simulation results also show that RFCL would greatly decrease the organic N (-42.6%, P < 0.01), NO3 yield in surface flow (-37.1%, P < 0.01), and the NO3 yield in subsurface flow (-25.5%, P < 0.01), whereas the NO3 yield in groundwater flow would increase (107%, P < 0.01). In terms of phosphorus, RFCL would cause both organic phosphorus (-38.2%, P < 0.01) and the phosphorus yield from the soil (-33.3%, P < 0.01) to decrease. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that RFCL is an effective policy for watershed environment management, which might have a relatively small effect on river discharge but that the purification effects on water quality in the river would be remarkable.

Feed loadings ranged from 1.6 to 6.3 kg feed/m(3) make-up water, with a constant make-up water renewal of 4.7% of total water volume per day in all twelve RAS. Fish densities ranged from 14 to 92 kg/m(3) during the prolonged trial of 10 weeks. Selected water quality parameters were measured during two intensive sampling campaigns, evaluating biofilter nitrification performance and diurnal patterns of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) and nitrite concentrations. No fish mortality occurred during the study. Feed conversion ratios varied between 0.91 +/- 0.04 and 0.95 +/- 0.02, and were unaffected by feeding load. Mean nitrate-nitrogen levels ranged from 54 +/- 7 to 196 +/- 10 mg/L at steady state, and the concentration of nitrogenous compounds and organic matter were all positively correlated to feed loading. The TAN loading to the RAS from the specific feed type was assessed in a separate mass-balance study and used as input in a descriptive mathematical model (AQUASIM (R) software) developed to simulate processes affecting N mass-balances in the RAS. Nitrification kinetic rate constants were applied to the biofilter, and fractions of nitrifiers in suspended solids in the water phase were estimated based on existing information from waste water treatment processes. Two model scenarios successfully simulated the measured TAN concentration in the experimental RAS. The first model scenario applied a first-order area-based nitrification rate (k(1a)) constant of 0.2 m/d, estimating a fraction of active nitrifiers (f(N)) in the water phase of 4% of the total suspended solids. The second model scenario used a k(1a) of 0.1, estimating a f(N) of 8% with similar predictability as in the first scenario. Overall, this study provided new information on fish performance and resulting water quality during steady state RAS operation. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that kinetic modeling can be applied to simulate measured TAN concentrations in experimental RAS. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Anomalous rise in algal production linked to lakewater calcium decline through food web interactions	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						palaeolimnology; lakewater calcium decline; Cladocera; chlorophyll a; trophic interactions	PHOSPHORUS CHLOROPHYLL RELATIONSHIPS; SHIELD LAKES; NOVA-SCOTIA; BODY-SIZE; ACIDIFICATION; DAPHNIA; CANADA; PHYTOPLANKTON; PREINDUSTRIAL; PREDICTIONS	Increased algal blooms are a threat to aquatic ecosystems worldwide, although the combined effects of multiple stressors make it difficult to determine the underlying causes. We explore whether changes in trophic interactions in response to declining calcium (Ca) concentrations, a water quality issue only recently recognized in Europe and North America, can be linked with unexplained bloom production. Using a palaeolimnological approach analysing the remains of Cladocera (herbivorous grazers) and visual reflectance spectroscopically inferred chlorophyll a from the sediments of a Nova Scotia (Canada) lake, we show that a keystone grazer, Daphnia, declined in the early 1990s and was replaced by a less effective grazer, Bosmina, while inferred chlorophyll a levels tripled at constant total phosphorus (TP) concentrations. The decline in Daphnia cannot be attributed to changes in pH, thermal stratification or predation, but instead is linked to declining lakewater [Ca]. The consistency in the timing of changes in Daphnia and inferred chlorophyll a suggests top-down control on algal production, providing, to our knowledge, the first evidence of a link between lakewater [Ca] decline and elevated algal production mediated through the effects of [Ca] decline on Daphnia. [Ca] decline has severe implications for whole-lake food webs, and presents yet another mechanism for potential increases in algal blooms.

Spatiotemporal Patterns and Ecophysiology of Toxigenic Microcystis Blooms in Lake Taihu, China: Implications for Water Quality Management	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							REAL-TIME PCR; HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; CYANOBACTERIUM MICROCYSTIS; GREEN-ALGAE; AERUGINOSA; PHOSPHORUS; GROWTH; PHYTOPLANKTON; NITROGEN; LIGHT	Whole lake monitoring of hypertrophic Lake Taihu, China, was conducted during the summers of 2009-2010, with the intent of identifying environmental factors influencing Microcystis bloom formation and promoting the growth of toxigenic strains (mcyE possessing). Low N:P ratios (replete N & P) appeared to select for toxigenic populations of Microcystis spp., whereas nontoxic Microcystis spp. strains were dominant in more nutrient limited regions of the lake. Chlorophyll a (Adj. R-2 = 0.83, p < 0.0001) was equally predicative of microcystin variance across the lake as fluorescence based realtime quantitative PCR (qPCR) measurements of microcystin synthetase E (mcyE) gene equivalents (Adj. R-2 = 0.85, p < 0.0001). Interestingly, chlorophyll a was identified as a more robust and useful metric for predicting microcystin concentrations than qPCR measurements enumerating the total Microcystis population based on c-phycocyanin (alpha subunit; cpcA) gene equivalents (Adj. R-2 = 0.61, p < 0.0001). Overall, the lakewide composition of Microcystis spp. was highly variable over time and space, and on average the population consisted of 36 +/- 12% potentially toxic cells. On the basis of this study's findings, a framework for the design and implementation of a water safety plan for Taihu water quality managers and public health officials is proposed.	[Otten, T.

Determining the effects of ammonia on fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) reproduction	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Ammonia; Toxicology; Flow-through; Reproduction; Promelas	FRESH-WATER FISH; CHRONIC TOXICITY; END-POINTS; ENDOCRINE; VITELLOGENIN; EFFLUENT; LEVEL; RAFINESQUE	Ammonia can cause adverse reproductive and mortality effects in individual fish by interacting with the central nervous system. The last published study that assessed the effects of ammonia on fathead minnow reproduction was a lifecycle study conducted in 1986. Our study's main goal was to re-evaluate ammonia toxicity on fathead minnow Pimephales promelas reproduction using a 20-day fecundity flow-through diluter method. Flow-through diluter systems have been used by regulatory agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in the past as an effective way to estimate acceptable levels of contaminants. There was a significant difference in cumulative egg production among treatments (ANOVA: F = 10.167, p <= 0.01, df = 3). All three concentrations of ammonia tested in this study significantly reduced fecundity after 20 days of exposure (Dunnett's, p <= 0.05 for each treatment). The lowest un-ionized ammonia concentration (0.06 mg/L at a pH of 7.3 and temperature of 25.1 degrees C) tested during this study resulted in a 29% decrease in cumulative fecundity. Because all tested ammonia concentrations caused an effect on P. promelas reproduction, the no effect concentration was estimated to be 0.025 mg/L un-ionized ammonia (2.19 mg/L total ammonia-nitrogen). This estimate was determined using the U.S. EPA Toxicity Relationship Analysis Program to calculate the 10% effect concentration of ammonia on P. promelas reproduction. This value is much lower than the previous reported no effect concentration on P. promelas reproduction (0.37 mg/L un-ionized ammonia or 6.43 mg/L total ammonia-nitrogen) as determined from the 1986 study, which was used to determine the ammonia water quality criteria by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Variability in specific-absorption properties and their use in a semi-analytical ocean colour algorithm for MERIS in North Sea and Western English Channel Coastal Waters	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Case 2 waters; Inherent optical properties; North Sea; Ocean colour remote sensing; Phytoplankton; Western English Channel	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; INHERENT OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; BIOOPTICAL PROPERTIES; LIGHT-ABSORPTION; BALTIC SEA; CHLOROPHYLL-A; PHYTOPLANKTON PIGMENTS; ATMOSPHERIC CORRECTION; TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION; MARINE PARTICLES	Coastal areas of the North Sea are commercially important for fishing and tourism, and are subject to the increasingly adverse effects of harmful algal blooms, eutrophication and climate change. Monitoring phytoplankton in these areas using Ocean Colour Remote Sensing is hampered by the high spatial and temporal variations in absorption and scattering properties. In this paper we demonstrate a clustering method based on specific-absorption properties that gives accurate water quality products from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). A total of 468 measurements of Chlorophyll a (Chla), Total Suspended Material (TSM), specific- (sIOP) and inherent optical properties (IOP) were measured in the North Sea between April 1999 and September 2004. Chla varied from 0.2 to 35 mg m(-3). TSM from 0.2 to 75 g m(-3) and absorption properties of coloured dissolved organic material at 442 nm (a(CDOM)(442)) was 0.02 to 0.26 m(-1). The variation in absorption properties of phytoplankton (a(ph)) and non-algal particles (a(NAP)) were an order of magnitude greater than that for a(ph) normalized to Chla (a(ph)*) and a(NAP) normalized to TSM (a(NAP)*). Hierarchical cluster analysis on a(ph)*, a(NAP). and a(CDOM) reduced this large data set to three groups of high a(NAP)*-a(CDOM). low a(ph)* situated close to the coast, medium values further offshore and low a(NAP)* a(CDOM), high a(ph)* in open ocean and Dutch coastal waters. The median sIOP of each cluster were used to parameterize a semi-analytical algorithm to retrieve concentrations of Chla, TSM and a(CDOM)(442) from MERIS data. A further 60 measurements of normalized water leaving radiance (nL(w)), Chla, TSM, a(CDOM)(442) and a(NAP)(442) collected between 2003 and 2006 were used to assess the accuracy of the satellite products. The regionalized MERIS algorithm showed improved performance in Chla and a(CDOM)(442) estimates with relative percentage differences of 29 and 8% compared to 34 and 134% for standard MERIS Chla and a(dg)(442) products, and similar retrieval for TSM at concentrations >1 g(-3).

Studies are lacking in effectively integrating watershed models and reservoir models to explore nutrient dynamics and eutrophication pattern. A water quality model specific to small prairie water bodies is also desired in order to highlight key biogeochemical processes with an acceptable degree of parameterization. This study presents a Multi-level Watershed-Reservoir Modeling System (MWRMS) to simulate hydrological and biogeochemical processes in small prairie watersheds. It integrated a watershed model, a hydrodynamic model and an eutrophication model into a flexible modeling framework. It can comprehensively describe hydrological and biogeochemical processes across different spatial scales and effectively deal with the special drainage structure of small prairie watersheds. As a key component of MWRMS, a three-dimensional Willows Reservoir Eutrophication Model (WREM) is developed to addresses essential biogeochemical processes in prairie reservoirs and to generate 3D distributions of various water quality constituents; with a modest degree of parameterization, WREM is able to meet the limit of data availability that often confronts the modeling practices in small watersheds. MWRMS was applied to the Assiniboia Watershed in southern Saskatchewan, Canada. Extensive efforts of field work and lab analysis were undertaken to support model calibration and validation. MWRMS demonstrated its ability to reproduce the observed watershed water yield, reservoir water levels and temperatures, and concentrations of several water constituents. Results showed that the aquatic systems in the Assiniboia Watershed were nitrogen-limited and sediment flux played a crucial role in reservoir nutrient budget and dynamics. MWRMS can provide a broad context of decision support for water resources management and water quality protection in the prairie region. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Benthic diatom assemblages as indicators of water quality in the Everglades and three tropical karstic wetlands	FRESHWATER SCIENCE			English	Article						Caribbean; Belize; Mexico; Jamaica; periphyton; phosphorus; weighted averaging models	EXPERIMENTAL PHOSPHORUS ENRICHMENT; FLORIDA EVERGLADES; PERIPHYTON RESPONSES; CYANOBACTERIAL MATS; SUBTROPICAL WETLAND; COMMUNITY RESPONSE; TEMPORAL PATTERNS; AQUATIC ORGANISMS; NUTRIENT GRADIENT; EUTROPHICATION	Limestone-based (karstic) freshwater wetlands of the Everglades, Belize, Mexico, and Jamaica are distinctive in having a high biomass of CaCO3-rich periphyton mats. Diatoms are common components of these mats and show predictable responses to environmental variation, making them good candidates for assessing nutrient enrichment in these naturally ultraoligotrophic wetlands. However, aside from in the Everglades of southern Florida, very little research has been done to document the diatoms and their environmental preferences in karstic Caribbean wetlands, which are increasingly threatened by eutrophication. We identified diatoms in periphyton mats collected during wet and dry periods from the Everglades and similar freshwater karstic wetlands in Belize, Mexico, and Jamaica. We compared diatom assemblage composition and diversity among locations and periods, and the effect of the limiting nutrient, P, on species composition among locations. We used periphyton-mat total P (TP) as a metric of availability. A total of 176 diatom species in 45 genera were recorded from the 4 locations. Twenty-three of these species, including 9 that are considered indicative of Everglades diatom flora, were found in all 4 locations. In Everglades and Caribbean sites, we identified assemblages and indicator species associated with low and high periphyton-mat TP and calculated TP optima and tolerances for each indicator species. TP optima and tolerances of indicator species differed between the Everglades and the Caribbean, but weighted averaging models predicted periphyton-mat TP concentrations from diatom assemblages at Everglades (R-2 = 0.56) and Caribbean (R-2 = 0.85) locations. These results show that diatoms can be effective indicators of water quality in karstic wetlands of the Caribbean, but application of regionally generated transfer functions to distant sites provides less reliable estimates than locally developed functions.

Nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton composition and density were evaluated at 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. Estimated filtration rates were 1.48-3.14 mL mg DW-1 h(-1). Grazing pressure by the mussel was not associated with algal taxonomy or cell size. After 24 h, L. fortunei removed 84% of the particulate nitrogen, and 49% of the particulate phosphorus. Nutrient regeneration was very significant as well: ammonium was produced at a rate of 3 mu M NH(3)g DW-1 h(-1), whereas production of phosphates was 0.42 mu M PO(4)g DW-1 h(-1). It is concluded that the impact of L. fortunei on phytoplankton and nutrient cycling can be as significant as that reported for another invasive bivalve - the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha in Europe and North America, but the overall effect of this impact on the biota may differ strongly under different environmental settings.

Factors Diminishing the Effectiveness of Phosphorus Loading from Municipal Effluent: Critical Information for TMDL Analyses	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						phosphorus; loads; bioavailability; settling velocity; plunging inflows	RECOVERING URBAN LAKE; ONONDAGA LAKE; AVAILABLE PHOSPHORUS; SETTLING VELOCITY; PATTERNS; WATER; DEPOSITION; PHOSPHATE; CONSTITUENTS; DISCHARGE	Factors that diminish the effectiveness of phosphorus inputs from a municipal wastewater treatment facility (Metro) in contributing to phosphorus levels and its availability to support algae growth in a culturally eutrophic urban lake (Onondaga Lake, NY) were characterized and quantified. These factors included the bioavailability and settling characteristics of particulate phosphorus from this effluent, the dominant form (70%) of phosphorus in this input, and the plunging of the discharge to stratified layers in the lake. Supporting studies included: (1) chemical and morphometric characterization of the phosphorus-enriched particles of this effluent, compared to particle populations of the tributaries and lake, with an individual particle analysis technique; (2) conduct of algal bioavailability assays of the particulate phosphorus of the effluent; (3) conduct of multiple size class settling velocity measurements on effluent particles; and (4) determinations of the propensity of the discharge to plunge, and documentation of plunging through three-dimensional monitoring of a tracer adjoining the outfall. All of these diminishing effects were found to be operative for the Metro effluent in Onondaga Lake and will be integrated into a forthcoming phosphorus "total maximum daily load" analysis for the lake, through appropriate representation in a supporting mechanistic water quality model. The particulate phosphorus in the effluent was associated entirely with Fe-rich particles formed in the phosphorus treatment process. These particles did not contribute to concentrations in pelagic portions of the lake, due to local deposition associated with their large size. Moreover, this particulate phosphorus was found to be nearly entirely unavailable to support algae growth. While substantial differences are to be expected for various inputs, the effective loading concept and the approaches adopted here to assess the diminishing factors are broadly applicable.

IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE HYDROLOGY AND NITROGEN POLLUTION IN A TILE-DRAINED AGRICULTURAL WATERSHED IN EASTERN CANADA	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						Climate change; Cold climate; Drainage; Hydrology; Modeling; Nitrogen	RIVER-BASIN; STREAM-FLOW; VARIABILITY; TRENDS; MODEL; PREDICTION; QUALITY; LOSSES; YIELD; CYCLE	The potential effects of climate change on the hydrology and nitrogen pollution of an agricultural watershed are predicted using the DRAIN-WARMF model. This newly developed, physically based hydrological model is applied on the St. Esprit watershed in southwestern Quebec, Canada. Under the assumption of no changes in land cover and land management, the model is applied in order to simulate annual, seasonal, and monthly changes in surface and subsurface flows and NO3-N loads at the outlet of the watershed under current and future climate conditions. The climate scenario under consideration in this study for 1961 to 2100 is based on projections from the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM). The simulation results from the CRCM model suggest an increase in temperature and precipitation in the region being studied. These changes result in a significant increase in simulated mean annual and seasonal flow in the watershed. Moreover; water quality simulations under future climatic conditions show a significant increase in annual and seasonal NO3-N losses.	[Dayyani, S.; Prasher, S.

A 1.4 m wide strip of actively growing winter wheat was located at the bottom of selected 0.75 m wide by 4.0 m long plots. Three 30 min simulated rainfall events, separated by 24 h intervals, were applied at an intensity of 70 mm h(-1) to the plots. The wheat strips were effective in reducing runoff loads of NO3-N, NH4-N, and total nitrogen (TN). Runoff loads of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DP), particulate phosphorus (PP), total phosphorus (TP), NH4-N, and TN were significantly influenced by manure application rate. The application of manure to meet a 2-year rather than a 1-year corn P requirement did not significantly increase DP PP, or TP loads. However application of manure to meet a 4-year P requirement resulted in DP PP and TP loads that were significantly greater than those obtained for a 2-year P requirement. Runoff rate significantly affected each of the measured water quality parameters. The actively growing wheat strips were much less effective than grass hedges in reducing runoff nutrient loads.

J	Jyvasjarvi, J; Aroviita, J; Hamalainen, H				Jyvasjarvi, Jussi; Aroviita, Jukka; Hamalainen, Heikki			Performance of profundal macroinvertebrate assessment in boreal lakes depends on lake depth	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY			English	Article						bioassessment; ecological status; reference condition approach; shallow lakes; Water Framework Directive	WATER-QUALITY; TROPHIC STATE; COMMUNITIES; ASSEMBLAGES; FINLAND; SHALLOW; EUTROPHICATION; POLLUTION; SEDIMENT; HISTORY	Profundal macroinvertebrates (PMI) are commonly used in assessment and monitoring of lakes. Traditional PMI community typologies and indices have been developed and tested for large and deep lakes with well-defined pelagic and profundal zones, whereas small lakes have received less attention; despite their large number. We evaluated the performance of PMI assemblage assessments in boreal lakes with data from 255 Finnish lake basins, which were divided into four lake mean depth categories (shallow, intermediate, deep and very deep). We first described natural community variation with DCA ordination and then, within each depth category using ANO-SIM, compared community composition between minimally disturbed reference (REF) basins and basins impacted mainly by nutrient enrichment (IMP). We assessed the status of PMI assemblages using three metrics (Benthic Quality Index, Percent Model Affinity and Shannon diversity) that aimed to meet the normative criteria set by the EU Water Framework Directive. Judging by conventional criteria, there was a consistent improvement in bioassessment performance of PMI with lake depth. Assemblages in shallow REF and IMP sites were similar and measures of ecological status showed neither difference between REF and IMP sites nor response to nutrient pollution. In deep and very deep IMP lakes the communities differed significantly from those in REF lakes and community and metric variation was more strongly related to phosphorus concentration. Our results suggest that PMI assemblages of deeper boreal lakes respond predictably to anthropogenic nutrient enrichment, whereas assemblages of shallow lakes are either 'naturally eutrophic' and thus resistant to change or unpredictably variable making it difficult to detect any impacts of anthropogenic nutrient enrichment on communities. Future studies are thus needed to evaluate the performance of littoral macroinvertebrate assemblages for shallow lake bioassessment.

Another source is the soil. One way of immobilising DRP in runoff before discharge to a surface waterbody, is to amend soil within the edge of field area with a high phosphorus (P) sequestration material. One such amendment is iron ochre, a by-product of acid mine drainage. Batch experiments utilising two grassland soils at two depths (topsoil and sub-soil), six ochre amendment rates (0, 0.15, 1.5, 7.5, 15 and 30 g kg(-1) mass per dry weight of soil) and five P concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg L-1) were carried out. A proportional equation, which incorporated P sources and losses, was developed and used to form a statistical model. Back calculation identified optimal rates of ochre amendment to soil to ameliorate a specific DRP concentration in runoff. Ochre amendment of soils (with no further P inputs) was effective at decreasing DRP concentrations to acceptable levels. A rate of 30 g ochre kg(-1) soil was needed to decrease DRP concentrations to acceptable levels for P inputs of <= 10 mg L-1, which represents the vast majority of cases in grassland runoff experiments. However, although very quick and sustained metal release above environmental limits occurred, which makes it unfeasible for use as a soil amendment to control P release to a waterbody, the methodology developed within this paper may be used to test the effectiveness and feasibility of other amendments.

A REVIEW OF PHOSPHORUS AND SEDIMENT RELEASE FROM IRISH TILLAGE SOILS,THE METHODS USED TO QUANTIFY LOSSES AND THE CURRENT STATE OF MITIGATION PRACTICE	BIOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT-PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL IRISH ACADEMY			English	Review							CRITICAL SOURCE AREAS; SOIL-EROSION; WATER EROSION; PARTICULATE PHOSPHORUS; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; SURFACE RUNOFF; LOAMY SAND; AGRICULTURAL CATCHMENTS; NUTRIENT CONCENTRATIONS; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES	Throughout the European Union (EU), agricultural soils with high phosphorus (P) status due to surplus fertiliser input have been identified as a landscape pressure impacting on water quality. In RI:public of Ireland, approximately 80% of agricultural land is devoted to grass, 11% to rough grazing, and 9% to arable cereal and crop production. Consequently, the majority of erosion research has focused on quantifying nutrient and sediment losses from grassland. Tillage soils are, however, more susceptible to erosion than grassland soils and, in general, have higher levels of soil P. This paper reviews the current state of research and the regulatory regime relating to diffuse P and sediment loss for tillage soils. It identifies the key threats to soil quality associated with cultivated soils, and proposes the targeting and remediation of critical source areas for effective mitigation of P losses from tillage soils. A multiscaled approach is recommended, in which catchment and field-scale monitoring is complemented with controlled laboratory and small plot-scale rainfall simulation experiments to identify areas where P loss and soil erosion are at critical levels and nay pose a threat to water quality. Catchment scale research will help to link critical source areas of sediment and P loss with hydrological pathways to surface waters in the catchment area. These areas can then be targeted for remediation in the river basin management plans.	[Regan, J. T.; Healy, M.

An innovative multidisciplinary approach was applied to a power station discharge in Lake Macquarie, Australia, using benthic diatoms, water quality, satellite imagery and temperature loggers. Triplicate sediment samples at five sites across a thermal gradient in one plume affected and two control bays were analysed for benthic diatoms. Multivariate analysis indicated that diatom assemblages and environmental gradients in the receiving water embayment were significantly different to control bays. The plume affected benthic assemblages to greater depths (similar to 4.7 m) than observed by previous studies and this is likely to have implications for estimates of estuarine productivity and nutrient cycling. Of the 244 diatom taxa identified, Navicula rhaphoneis appeared to best identify areas of the lake bed exposed to temperatures 3 -4 degrees C above ambient (Delta T). Tryblionella lanceola, Tryblionella littoralis, Grammatophora spp. and Psammodictyon panduriformis also contributed to gradients and might be used as plume indicator species. Temperature, ammonia, oxidised nitrogen and selenium significantly explained gradients in the species data (p = 0.02). Satellite imagery indicated that receiving bay temperature gradients (<7 degrees C) were greatest in winter, whereas loggers showed Delta T was greatest in autumn then winter. These analyses highlighted that seasonality is an important factor when considering the effects of thermal plumes on receiving environment ecology. Analyses of imagery and logger data are effective techniques for managers to routinely assess plume intensity and extent. This study demonstrates that both benthic diatoms and satellite imagery are valuable tools for the monitoring and assessment of thermal pollution in coastal environments.

Catchment Phosphorous Losses: An Export Coefficient Modelling Approach with Scenario Analysis for Water Management	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Reservoir ecosystems; Semi-arid region; Total phosphorus; Export coefficient modelling; Scenario analysis; Water management	LAND-USE CHANGE; SURFACE WATERS; MULTISCALE APPROACH; NITROGEN; QUALITY; RESERVOIRS; IMPACT; INPUTS; SCALE; BASIN	This paper presents the development of an export coefficient model to characterise the rates and sources of P export from land to water in four reservoir systems located in a semi-arid rural region in southern of Portugal. The model was developed to enable effective management of these important water resource systems under the EU Water Framework Directive. This is the first time such an approach has been fully adapted for the semi-arid systems typical of Mediterranean Europe. The sources of P loading delivered to each reservoir from its catchment were determined and scenario analysis was undertaken to predict the likely impact of catchment management strategies on the scale of rate of P loading delivered to each water body from its catchment. The results indicate the importance of farming and sewage treatment works/collective septic tanks discharges as the main contributors to the total diffuse and point source P loading delivered to the reservoirs, respectively. A reduction in the total P loading for all study areas would require control of farming practices and more efficient removal of P from human wastes prior to discharge to surface waters. The scenario analysis indicates a strategy based solely on reducing the agricultural P surplus may result in only a slow improvement in water quality, which would be unlikely to support the generation of good ecological status in reservoirs. The model application indicates that a reduction of P-inputs to the reservoirs should first focus on reducing P loading from sewage effluent discharges through the introduction of tertiary treatment (P-stripping) in all major residential areas. The fully calibrated export coefficient modelling approach transferred well to semi-arid regions, with the only significant limitation being the availability of suitable input data to drive the model. Further studies using this approach in semi-arid catchments are now needed to increase the knowledge of nutrient export behaviours in semi-arid regions.

J	Flores, JP; Tracy, B				Flores, Joao Paulo; Tracy, Benjamin			Impacts of winter hay feeding on pasture soils and plants	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Pastures; Hay feeding; Forage production; Soil fertility; Winter grazing	SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; MANAGED GRASSLANDS; GRAZED PASTURES; TALL FESCUE; KURA CLOVER; COMPACTION; POTASSIUM; NITROGEN; PRODUCTIVITY	In temperate regions, feeding livestock year round on pasture is usually limited by weather conditions and livestock must be fed hay, or other stored feeds, at least part of the year when pasture forage runs Out. On many farms, hay must be fed during winter and hay feeding is typically confined to pastures that are sacrificed for this purpose. The concentrated use of pasture during winter hay feeding could negatively impact subsequent forage production from soil compaction and possibly create water quality degradation from manure runoff. In 2008, we initiated a field experiment to address how winter hay feeding on pasture might have affected forage and soil variables in VA, USA. Variables were compared between 12 paired pastures each with and without hay feeding sites. Forage accumulation, forage mass, nutritive value and plant species composition along with soil penetration resistance, soil respiration and soil nutrient concentrations were monitored for 2 years. The presence of winter hay feeding sites in pastures had neutral to positive effects on forage productivity and forage nutritive value. Hay feeding pastures were not weedier than control pastures as we predicted, and they did contain more white clover through the grazing season (P < 0.05), which may have benefited forage production and nutritive value. As expected, soils from winter hay feeding pastures were more compacted compared with pastures without winter use. Soil compaction did not negatively affect forage production or soil respiration, however. By the end of this study, soil P. K and organic matter concentrations were 59%, 55% and 10% higher, respectively, in hay feeding pastures compared with control pastures. Our findings suggest that well-managed hay feeding in winter could benefit pasture forage production.

Farm-level economic impact of no-till farming in the Fort Cobb Reservoir Watershed	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						economic impact; no-till; conventional tillage; Farm-level Economic Model; winter wheat yield; diesel price	ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES; WINTER-WHEAT; SOIL-WATER; CONSERVATION; SORGHUM; CALIBRATION; PHOSPHORUS; RESOLUTION; ROTATION; FALLOW	No-till farming has been identified as an important conservation practice with potential to improve soil quality and protect water quality However, adoption of new tillage and production practices is determined by numerous economic and noneconomic factors in addition to land stewardship. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of fuel costs and crop yield on farm-level economics in no-till systems in comparison with other tillage systems for wheat production in southwestern Oklahoma. The Farm-level Economic Model, an annual economic simulation model, was used in conjunction with survey data from the Fort Cobb Reservoir Watershed in southwestern Oklahoma to determine impacts of alternative tillage practices on farm profits. Sensitivity analysis was performed using plausible ranges in diesel prices, winter wheat grain yields, herbicide costs, labor wages, and farm size. The results indicate that if winter wheat grain yields are not significantly impacted by tillage systems, no-till would be more profitable than conventional tillage or the current mix of tillage practices in the watershed. Only when there is a significant wheat yield penalty associated with no-till (10% or greater) might no-till be less profitable than conventional tillage or the status quo at reasonably high fuel prices. In general, for each 1% improvement in wheat yields under no-till relative to conventional tillage, no-till farm profits improve by US$7 ha(-1) (US$3 ac(-1)) on farms that produce only winter wheat and an average of US$2.50 ha(-1) (US$1 ac(-1)) if averaged across all farms in the Fort Cobb Reservoir Watershed, including those that do not produce winter wheat. The study also finds that higher diesel prices, higher labor wages, lower herbicide costs, and smaller farm sizes are all relatively advantageous to no-till.

Scale-of-measurement effects on phosphorus in runoff from cropland	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						phosphorus indices; phosphorus runoff losses; scale of measurement; sediment losses; field vs. small plot; water quality	EXTRACTABLE SOIL-PHOSPHORUS; CORN PRODUCTION SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; SIMULATED RAINFALL; OVERLAND-FLOW; PLOT SCALE; LOSSES; FERTILIZER; EROSION; MANURE	Phosphorus (P) risk loss assessment tools such as P indices are usually developed from small-plot scale data showing the relationships between various site and management variables and runoff P losses. Little information is available on how small-plot runoff composition compares with field-scale measurements. This study was conducted to compare runoff volume and composition measurements at the field scale with those obtained from natural runoff at the small-plot (1 m(2) [10.8 ft(2)]) scale. Sediment, dissolved P, and total P in natural runoff from small plots located in two fields (7.2 and 12 ha [17.8 and 29.6 ac]) were compared with similar measurements from the fields over an 18-month period. Runoff from small-plot rainfall simulations in both fields was also analyzed for P and sediment. The fields, cropped with either corn (Zen ways L.) or alfalfa (Medicago sativa L) interseeded with bromegrass (Browns inermis), were located on a Tama silt loam soil (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiudoll) in southwest Wisconsin (42 degrees 42' N, 90 degrees 22'W). Statistical analysis using repeated measures showed no significant differences between the two scales of measurements for dissolved P concentrations in runoff Total P concentrations in small-plot runoff were, greater than those in field runoff. Runoff volume and dissolved P concentrations were greater in winter than in summer, but summer runoff had higher sediment concentrations. Small plots had greater cumulative runoff volumes per unit area in both seasons compared to the fields. The dissolved P concentration relationships between the two scales of measurement for individual runoff events were very good in the corn field (r(2) = 0.90) but, not in the alfalfa field (r(2) = 0.09). Sediment P enrichment ratios varied by crop and were similar in the small-plot and field runoff. Cumulative runoff-dissolved P concentrations were strongly related (r(2) = 0.95) to average soil-test P at both scales. The agreement of small-plot and field runoff-dissolved P concentrations during the 18-month measurement period supports use of small-plot data in P loss risk assessment tools.	[Bormann, N. L.

However, costs and effectiveness of measures vary both within and between catchments, depending on factors such as land use and topography. The aim of this study was to develop a cost-effectiveness analysis framework for integrating estimates of phosphorus (P) losses from land-based sources, potential abatement using riparian buffers, and the economic implications of buffers. Estimates of field-by-field P exports and routing were based on crop risk and field slope classes. Buff er P trapping efficiencies were based on literature metadata analysis. Costs of placing buffers were based on foregone farm gross margins. An integrated optimization model of cost minimization was developed and solved for different P reduction targets to the Rescobie Loch catchment in eastern Scotland. A target mean annual P load reduction of 376 kg to the loch to achieve good status was identified. Assuming all the riparian fields initially have the 2-m buff er strip required by the General Binding Rules (part of the WFD in Scotland), the model gave good predictions of P loads (345-481 kg P). The modeling results show that riparian buffers alone cannot achieve the required P load reduction (up to 54% P can be removed). In the medium P input scenario, average costs vary from 38 pound to 176 pound kg(-1) P at 10% and 54% P reduction, respectively. The framework demonstrates a useful tool for exploring cost-effective targeting of environmental measures.

A Simple Model to Assess Nitrogen and Phosphorus Contamination in Ungauged Surface Drainage Networks: Application to the Massaciuccoli Lake Catchment, Italy	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							AGRICULTURAL LAND; NUTRIENT FLUXES; STREAM WATER; RIVER BASIN; PEAT SOIL; RETENTION; TRANSPORT; DYNAMICS; DIFFUSE; GERMANY	Modeling is a common practice to evaluate factors affecting water quality in environmental systems impaired by point and nonpoint losses of N and P. Nevertheless, in situations with inadequate information, such as ungauged basins, a balance between model complexity and data availability is necessary. In this paper, we applied a simplified analytical model to an artificially drained floodplain in central-western Italy to evaluate the importance of different nutrient sources and in-stream retention processes and to identify critical source areas. We first considered only a set of chemical concentrations in water measured from February through May 2008 and from November 2008 through February 2009. We then broadened available data to include water discharge and hydraulic-head measurements to construct a hydrogeological model using MODFLOW-2000 and to evaluate the reliability of the simplified method. The simplified model provided acceptable estimates of discharge (ranging from 0.03-0.75 m(3) s(-1)) and diffuse nutrient inputs from water table discharge and in-stream retention phenomena. Estimates of PO4-P and total P retention (ranging from 1.0 to 0.6 mu g m(-2) s(-1) and from 1.18 to 0.95 mu g m(-2) s(-1) for PO4-P and total P, respectively) were consistent with the range of variability in literature data. In contrast, the higher temporal variability of nitrate concentrations decreased model accuracy, suggesting the need for more intensive monitoring. The model also separated the dynamics of different reaches of the drainage network and identified zones considered critical source areas and buff er zones where pollutant transport is reduced.

Water Quality, Sediment, and Soil Characteristics near Fargo-Moorhead Urban Areas as Affected by Major Flooding of the Red River of the North	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; PHARMACEUTICALS; CONTAMINANTS; VEGETABLES; PHOSPHORUS; EXCHANGE; NUTRIENT; STREAMS; BASIN	Spring flooding of the Red River of the North (RR) is common, but little information exits on how these flood events affect water and overbank sediment quality within an urban area. With the threat of the spring 2009 flood in the RR predicted to be the largest in recorded history and the concerns about the flooding of farmsteads, outbuildings, garages, and basements, the objectives of this study, which focused on Fargo, ND, and Moorhead, MN, were to assess floodwater quality and to determine the quantity and quality of overbank sediment deposited after floodwaters recede and the quality of soil underlying sediment deposits. 17 beta-Estradiol was detected in 9 of 24 water samples, with an average concentration of 0.61 ng L-1. Diesel-range organics were detected in 8 of 24 samples, with an average concentration of 80.0 mu g L-1. The deposition of sediment across locations and transects ranged from 2 to 10 kg m(-2), and the greatest mass deposition of chemicals was closest to the river channel. No gasoline-range organics were detected, but diesel-range organics were detected in 26 of the 27 overbank sediment samples (maximum concentration, 49.2 mg kg(-1)). All trace elements detected in the overbank sediments were within ranges for noncontaminated sites. Although flooding has economic, social, and environmental impacts, based on the results of this study, it does not appear that flooding in the RR in F-M led to decreased quality of water, sediment, or soil compared with normal river flows or resident soil.

J	Kominami, H; Lovell, ST				Kominami, Hisashi; Lovell, Sarah Taylor			An adaptive management approach to improve water quality at a model dairy farm in Vermont, USA	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Agroecology; Buffer; Constructed wetland; Farm design; Multifunctional landscape; Phosphorus; Stormwater runoff; Water quality	CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; WASTE-WATER; PERFORMANCE; RUNOFF; REMOVAL; FLOW	Shelburne Farms is a non-profit environmental education center and working dairy farm located in Shelburne, Vermont, on the shores of Lake Champlain. Ecological and recreational functions of Lake Champlain have been increasingly threatened by high inputs of contaminants such as phosphorus, a high proportion of which is contributed by non-point sources including agriculture. Concerns about agricultural pollution motivated Shelburne Farms to set an example of good stewardship by applying an adaptive management process to investigate and improve water quality. The purpose of this paper is to describe both the process and outcomes as they evolved through a collaborative effort between Shelburne Farms, local stakeholders, and researchers at the University of Vermont. The adaptive management process included: (1) assessing conditions based on four years of water quality monitoring, (2) identifying and prioritizing potential solutions, (3) implementing a solution by installing a stormwater treatment system, (4) evaluating start-up performance of the treatment system, and (5) adjusting the strategy based on the results. Pre-implementation monitoring indicated that unacceptable levels of phosphorus and Escherichia coli entered the lake in runoff during storm events and that the dairy barnyard area was a significant contributor of pollutants. The stormwater treatment system, installed to treat runoff from the dairy barnyard area, reduced TSS and P concentrations within the first few months of operation on average by 25% and 43%, respectively, across all storm events. E. coli concentrations were highly variable with a mean reduction of 1% and median reduction of 78%.

By using a k-means clustering analysis to first partition the nutrient data into a user-specified number of subsets, it is possible to discover the spatiotemporal patterns of nutrient distribution in the bay and capture the inherent linkages of hydrodynamic and biogeochemical features. Such patterns may then be combined with a gravity model to link the nutrient source contribution from each coastal watershed to the generated clusters in the bay to aid in the source proportion analysis for environmental management. The clustering analysis was carried out based on 1 year (2008) water quality data composed of 55 sample stations throughout Tampa Bay collected by the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County. In addition, hydrological and river water quality data of the same year were acquired from the United States Geological Survey's National Water Information System to support the gravity modeling analysis. The results show that the k-means model with 8 clusters is the optimal choice, in which cluster 2 at Lower Tampa Bay had the minimum values of total nitrogen (TN) concentrations, chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations, and ocean color values in every season as well as the minimum concentration of total phosphorus (TP) in three consecutive seasons in 2008. The datasets indicate that Lower Tampa Bay is an area with limited nutrient input throughout the year. Cluster 5, located in Middle Tampa Bay, displayed elevated TN concentrations, ocean color values, and Chl-a concentrations, suggesting that high values of colored dissolved organic matter are linked with some nutrient sources. The data presented by the gravity modeling analysis indicate that the Alafia River Basin is the major contributor of nutrients in terms of both TP and TN values in all seasons. With this new integration, improvements for environmental monitoring and assessment were achieved to advance our understanding of sea-land interactions and nutrient cycling in a critical coastal bay, the Gulf of Mexico.

The need to reduce nitrogen losses in this region can be addressed with the development and validation of robust, new assessment tools that can be used to quickly evaluate management practices and their effects on the environment in terms of potential nitrogen losses and other factors. The recently developed concept of trading nitrogen in air and water quality markets can be used in conjunction with field studies to assess the potential benefits of nitrogen management. In 2008 and 2009, field studies were conducted to collect data to test the new Nitrogen Loss and Environmental Assessment Package (NLEAP) and its ability to simulate nitrate dynamics for different cropping systems grown in three different locations in the Arkansas Delta. Simulation by the NLEAP conducted for cotton, soybean, and corn grown in the Arkansas Delta showed that the model was able to simulate the effects of management on residual soil nitrate (P < 0.01). The simulation showed that residual nitrate can range from about 10 to 240 kg NO3-N ha(-1) in the top 1.5 m of soil, in agreement with measured values. In addition, long-term NLEAP simulation analysis showed that rotations of soybeans into corn systems significantly reduced emissions of N2O across this region and reduced NO3-N leaching losses at the field level.

Hence, for mitigating the eutrophication, it is important to understand the quantity of P flows of the different components of local socioeconomic ecosystems, and how the components interlink. In this study, the static substance flow analysis (SFA) model was used to determine the P flows in the socioeconomic ecosystem of Feixi County in 2008, which has typical features of central China. Based on the model. the P flows of six subsystems were identified and quantified: product manufacturing, crop farming, large-scale breeding, domestic breeding, rural consumption and urban consumption. The data and parameters, required for the calculation of P flows in the study, were obtained from official statistical database, questionnaires, face to face interviews and published literature. The study showed that the three largest P flows were imports to the large-scale breeding subsystem, P loss into water of crop farming subsystem, and excrement of large-scale livestock applied to farmland. Moreover, the total amount of P drained from Feixi to the surrounding water environment was mostly originated from the crop farming and large-scale breeding subsystems. Furthermore, due to the low efficiency in P recycling and reuse recorded in this study and the high levels of eutrophication caused by P flows in Feixi, corresponding environmental management strategies to reduce P loss to surrounding water environment have been suggested, which include reducing the application of chemical fertilizers, applying the livestock excrement effectively for planting, substituting the crop feed for the chemical feed, improving the infrastructure for wastes disposal of breeding enterprises, developing livestock manure for other use, purchasing P-chemical materials and products with lower P-containing rate, constructing waste treatment facilities, investing and researching for developing technology on eutrophication reduction, etc. Finally, the quantifiable science-based methods used in this study may be applied toward improving the ecological management efficiency of cities/counties and water quality of the surrounding area.

Long-term nitrate loss along an agricultural intensity gradient in the Upper Midwest USA	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Water quality; Drainage; No-till; Organic; Cover crops	PREFERENTIAL FLOW; SOIL-NITROGEN; NO-TILL; MANAGEMENT; YIELD; CROP; VARIABILITY; CARBON; MODEL; ECOSYSTEMS	Nitrate (NO3-) loss from intensively farmed cropland is a long-standing, recalcitrant environmental problem that contributes to surface and groundwater pollution and coastal zone hypoxia. Here nitrate leaching losses are reported from nine replicated cropped and unmanaged ecosystems in southwest Michigan, USA. Ecosystems include four annual corn-soybean-winter wheat rotations under conventional, no-till, reduced-input, and organic/biologically-based management, two perennial cropping systems that include alfalfa and hybrid poplar trees, and three unmanaged successional communities including an early successional community analogous to a cellulosic biofuel system as well as a mature deciduous forest. The organic, alfalfa, and unmanaged systems received no synthetic, manure, or compost nitrogen. Measured nitrate concentrations were combined with modeled soil water drainage to provide estimates of nitrate lost by leaching over 11 years. Among annual crops, average nitrate losses differed significantly (p<0.05) and followed the order conventional (62.3 +/- 9.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) > no-till (41.3 +/- 3.0) > reduced-input (24.3 +/- 0.7) > organic (19.0 +/- 0.8) management. Among perennial and unmanaged ecosystems, nitrate loss followed the pattern alfalfa (12.8 +/- 1.8 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) = deciduous forest (11.0 +/- 4.2) >> early successional (1.1 +/- 0.4) = mid-successional (0.9 +/- 0.4) > poplar (<0.01 +/- 0.007 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) systems. Findings suggest that nitrate loss in annual row crops could be significantly mitigated by the adoption of no-till, cover crops, and greater reliance on biologically based inputs, and in biofuel systems by the production of cellulosic rather than grain-based feedstocks.

Jeffrey			Predicting plausible impacts of sets of climate and land use change scenarios on water resources	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Climate change; Land use change; Hydrologic regime; Water quality; CA-Markov; HSPF	BALANCE MODEL; RIVER; ADAPTATION; PATTERNS; QUALITY; BASIN; GIS	Our world is changing at an unprecedented rate in terms of climate and land use, but these changes can affect our water resources. Hence, we need a methodology that can predict both their individual and agglomerative ramifications. Using the Little Miami River (LMR) watershed as a case study, this paper describes a spatial analytical approach integrating mathematical modeling and geographical information sciences to quantitatively examine the relative importance of the separate and combined hydrologic and water quality impacts of climate and land use changes. The Hydrologic Simulation Program - Fortran (HSPF) model was chosen in this study to simulate stream flow and nutrient transport process. Five hypothetical climate change scenarios were used to cover the possible ranges of variability in the year 2050. An enhanced population-coupled Markov-Cellular Automata (CA-Markov) land use model was developed to predict the 2050 land use pattern. When these scenarios were incorporated into the HSPF model, the future conditions in the LMR basin were postulated. The findings demonstrated that: 1) the LMR watershed would experience an increase in flow and nutrients under the 2050 land use projection, 2) stream flow and water quality impacts would be amplified when both climate and land use changes were simultaneously considered, 3) land use change (and in the case of the LMR watershed, urbanization) could help to alleviate water shortage during the dry years, 4) total phosphorus and nitrogen would increase under all future climate and land use scenarios; the highest increase was found under the combined wettest and future land use scenarios, and 5) the described approach is effective in simulating the hydrologic and water quality effects of climate and land use changes in a basin scale. These results are relevant to planners; they can be useful in formulating realistic watershed management policies and mitigation measures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Simulation of spatial and temporal distribution on dissolved non-point source nitrogen and phosphorus load in Jialing River Watershed, China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						SLURP hydrological model; Jialing River Watershed; Non-point source pollution; Dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus; Spatial and temporal distributing simulation	CRITICAL SOURCE AREAS; MAJOR INPUT RIVERS; 3 GORGES RESERVOIR; DISTRIBUTION CHARACTERS; POLLUTION; IMPACT; SOIL	Jialing River, which covers a basin area of 160,000 km(2) and a length of 1,280 km, is the largest tributary of the catchment area in Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China. In recent years, water quality in the reservoir area section of Jialing River has been degraded due to land use and the rural residential area induced by non-point source pollution. Therefore, the semi-distributed land-use runoff process (SLURP) hydrological model has been introduced and used to simulate the integrated hydrological cycle of the Jialing River Watershed (JRW). A coupling watershed model between the SLURP hydrological model and dissolved non-point source pollution model has been proposed in an attempt to evaluate the potential dissolved non-point source pollution load; it enhances the simulation precision of runoff and pollution load which are both based on the same division of land use types in the watershed. The proposed model has been applied in JRW to simulate the temporal and spatial distribution of the dissolved total nitrogen (DTN) and dissolved total phosphorus (DTP) pollution load for the period 1990-2007. It is shown that both the temporal and spatial distribution of DTN and DTP load are positively correlated to annual rainfall height. Land use is the key factor controlling the distribution of DTN and DTP load. The source compositions of DTN and DTP are different, where average DTN pollution load in descending order is land use 67.2%, livestock and poultry breeding 30.5%, and rural settlements 2.2%; and for DTP, livestock and poultry breeding is 50%, land use 48.8%, and rural settlements 1.2%. The contribution rates of DTN and DTP load in each sub-basin indicate the sensitivity of the results to the temporal and spatial distribution of different pollution sources. These data were of great significance for the prediction and estimation of the future changing trends of dissolved non-point source pollution load carried by rainfall runoff in the JRW and for studies of their transport and influence in the Three Gorges Reservoir.

A Novel Method to Determine Buffer Strip Effectiveness on Deep Soils	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							VEGETATIVE FILTER STRIPS; (H2O)-O-18 TRANSPORT MODEL; NONPOINT-SOURCE POLLUTION; SHALLOW GROUND-WATER; STABLE-ISOTOPE HDO; RIPARIAN BUFFERS; NITROGEN REMOVAL; NITRATE REMOVAL; SURFACE-WATER; SISPAT-ISOTOPE	Unfertilized buff er strips (BS) generally improve surface water quality. High buff er strip effectiveness (BSE) has been reported for sloping shallow aquifers, but experimental data for plain landscapes with deeply permeable soils is lacking. We tested a novel method to determine BSE on a 20-m-deep, permeable sandy soil. Discharge from soil to ditch was temporarily collected in an in-stream reservoir to measure its quantity and quality, both for a BS and a reference (REF) treatment. Treatments were replicated once for the first, and three times for the next three leaching seasons. No significant BSE was obtained for nitrogen and phosphorus species in the reservoirs. Additionally, water samples were taken from the upper groundwater below the treatments. The effect of BS for nitrate was much bigger in upper groundwater than in the reservoirs that also collected groundwater from greater depths that were not influenced by the treatments. We conclude that measuring changes in upper groundwater to assess BSE is only valid under specific hydrogeological conditions. We propose an alternative experimental set-up for future research, including extra measurements before installing the BS and REF treatments to deal with spatial and temporal variability. The use of such data as covariates will increase the power of statistical tests by decreasing between-reservoir variability.	[Heinen, Marius; Heesmans, Hanneke I.

Phosphorus Retention and Remobilization in Vegetated Buff er Strips: A Review	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Review							RIPARIAN BUFFER; WATER-QUALITY; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; SOIL-PHOSPHORUS; ORGANIC-MATTER; SURFACE RUNOFF; FILTER STRIPS; CENTRAL IOWA; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES; GRASSLAND SOIL	Diff use pollution remains a major threat to surface waters due to eutrophication caused by phosphorus (P) transfer from agricultural land. Vegetated buff er strips (VBSs) are increasingly used to mitigate diffuse P losses from agricultural land, having been shown to reduce particulate P transfer. However, retention of dissolved P (DP) has been lower, and in some cases VBSs have increased delivery to surface waters. The aims of this review were (i) to develop a conceptual model to enhance the understanding of VBS functioning in terms of DP, (ii) to identify key processes within the model that affect DP retention and delivery, and (iii) to explore evidence for the controls on these processes. A greater understanding in these areas will allow the development of management strategies that enhance DP retention. We found evidence of a surface layer in buff er strip soils that is enriched in soluble P compared with adjacent agricultural land and may be responsible for the reported increased DP delivery. Through increased biological activity in VBSs, plants and microorganisms may assimilate P from particulates retained in the VBSs or native soil P and remobilize this P in a more soluble form. These conclusions are based on a limited amount of research, and a better understanding of biogeochemical cycling of P in buff er strip soils is required.

Water quality and dissolved inorganic fluxes of N, P, SO4, and K of a small catchment river in the Southwestern Coast of India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Manimala river; Small catchment rivers; Solute fluxes; South western coast of India; Water quality	SEDIMENT DISCHARGE; TROPICAL RIVER; PARTICULATE; CHEMISTRY; EXPORT; OCEAN	The southwestern coast of India is drained by many small rivers with lengths less than 250 km and catchment areas less than 6,500 km(2). These rivers are perennial and are also the major drinking water sources in the region. But, the fast pace of urbanization, industrialization, fertilizer intensive agricultural activities and rise in pilgrim tourism in the past four to five decades have imposed marked changes in water quality and solute fluxes of many of these rivers. The problems have aggravated further due to leaching of ionic constituents from the organic-rich (peaty) impervious sub-surface layers that are exposed due to channel incision resulting from indiscriminate instream mining for construction-grade sand and gravel. In this context, an attempt has been made here to evaluate the water quality and the net nutrient flux of one of the important rivers in the southwestern coast of India, the Manimala river which has a length of about 90 km and catchment area of 847 km(2). The river exhibits seasonal variation in most of the water quality parameters (pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, HCO3, NO2-N, NO3-N, P-inorg, P-tot, chloride, SO4, and SiO2). Except for NO3-N and SiO2, all the other parameters are generally enriched in non-monsoon (December-May) samples than that of monsoon (June-November). The flux estimation reveals that the Manimala river transports an amount of 2,308 t y(-1) of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, 87 t y(-1) dissolved inorganic phosphorus, and 9246 t y(-1) of SO4, and 1984 t y(-1) K into the receiving coastal waters. These together constitute about 23% of the total dissolved fluxes transported by the Manimala river. Based on the study, a set of mitigation measures are also suggested to improve the overall water quality of small catchment rivers of the densely populated tropics in general and the south western coast in particular.

Modeling of plankton community dynamics characterized by algal toxicity and allelopathy: A focus on historical Prymnesium parvum blooms in a Texas reservoir	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Harmful algal blooms; Water quality model; Allelopathy; Algal toxins; Zooplankton grazing	POPULATION-DYNAMICS; FRESH-WATER; GOLDEN ALGA; PHYTOPLANKTON POPULATION; EURYTEMORA-AFFINIS; EGG-PRODUCTION; HARMFUL ALGAE; GROWTH; NUTRIENT; COMPETITION	A model is formulated to explore the dynamics of the harmful alga Prymnesium parvum, in a reservoir typical of those in the south-central U.S. where fish-killing blooms of this species frequently occur. Based on a previous model of growth in a well-mixed system, P. parvum competes for nutrients with cyanobacteria, which also excrete allelopathic cyanotoxin(s) that inhibit the growth of P. parvum. A new feature added here is a population of small-bodied zooplankton grazing on both types of algae, with the grazing rate on P. parvum inhibited by dissolved toxin(s) excreted by this species. In contrast to previous models that did not produce convincing calibrations, the new model is successfully calibrated using one year of forcing data on hydraulic flow, water temperature, salinity and nutrient supply from Lake Granbury, Texas. The calibrated model successfully reproduces the seasonal dynamics of P. parvum. Both allelopathy from cyanobacteria and toxic inhibition of grazers are necessary for fitting the calibration data, and produce dynamics in which blooms of P. parvum occur at low temperatures, below those optimal for growth. Long-term historical simulations of the new, calibrated model predict the observed occurrence of P. parvum blooms in cool weather, and suggest that low water flows during the late 1980s and early 2000s predisposed reservoirs to having such blooms. Respectively, these time periods correspond to the first known fish kills due to P. parvum in Texas, and to a series of annually recurrent blooms in several reservoirs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the fact that significant gaps remain in our understanding, it is known that agricultural stewardship can be highly effective in controlling water pollution at the plot and field scales. Knowledge at the catchment scale is, to a large extent, entirely lacking though and this is of paramount concern given that the catchment is the management unit used by regulatory authorities. The few studies that have examined the impact of agricultural stewardship at the catchment scale have found that Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs) in the UK have resulted in little improvement in water quality which concurs with the current catchment study. In addition to NVZs, there was little evidence to suggest that the England Catchment Sensitive Farming Delivery Initiative had impacted water quality and suggestions have been made for improvements, such as ensuring that stewardship measures are used in key pollution source areas and their implementation and impacts are monitored more closely. This will be essential if agricultural catchment management schemes are going to provide the benefits expected of them. Nevertheless, more intensive monitoring than that carried out by regulators showed a significant trend in decreasing winter nitrate peaks in some streams which is hypothesised to be due to recent reduced inorganic fertiliser application as a result of increasing prices. It was concluded that, collectively, these findings indicate that agricultural stewardship measures have the potential to improve water quality at the catchment scale but that voluntary schemes with insufficient financial reward or regulatory pressure are unlikely to be successful.

Water Content and Soil Type Effects on Accelerated Leaching after Slurry Application	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL			English	Article							PREFERENTIAL FLOW; SOLUTE TRANSPORT; VADOSE ZONE; BROMIDE; PHOSPHORUS; MACROPORES; ADSORPTION; TRACER	Preferential flow is a well recognized mechanism for the accelerated leaching of nutrients and pollutants through soil, contributing to the contamination of surface-and groundwater bodies. This study assessed the risks associated with slurry spreading and the potential effects of preferential flow, under natural rainfall, on four soil types with contrasting textures under wet and dry initial conditions. Breakthrough patterns of bromide were analyzed to quantify water flow patterns, and the data were compared to leachate nutrient composition. Bovine slurry, spiked with bromide, was applied to lysimeters (3 per treatment and 4 soil types) each under wet and dry initial soil conditions. Bromide served well as an indicator of the potential occurrence of preferential flow. Preferential flow was found to be most likely to occur in the soil with the finest texture under wet initial conditions and least likely in the soil with the coarsest texture. Leaching of relatively high concentrations of total reactive phosphorous was found to occur simultaneously with bromide under wet initial conditions, but no other relationships were observed between nutrients and bromide. Dye was applied to one lysimeter of each soil type at the end of the experiment to compare qualitative information about the infiltration mechanisms. Preferential flow was found to occur primarily in the form of macropore flow. Water quality considerations must be taken into account when promoting the spreading of organic manures on wet soils in early spring to improve nutrient efficiency.

Effects of production intensity and production strategies in commercial Atlantic salmon smolt (Salmo salar L.) production on subsequent performance in the early sea stage	FISH PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Atlantic salmon; Aquaculture; Fish welfare; Water quality; Stocking density; Production intensity	CARBON-DIOXIDE; PARR-SMOLT; STOCKING DENSITY; WATER-QUALITY; FRESH-WATER; COHO SALMON; HYPEROXIA; GROWTH; ALUMINUM; EXPOSURE	A data set from commercial Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) producers on production intensity and production strategies in smolt tanks (N = 63-94) was obtained during 1999-2006. The effects of production intensity on subsequent fish mortality and growth during the early sea phase (90 days) were examined by principal component analysis and subsequent generalized linear model analysis. Levels of accumulated metabolites (CO2, total ammonia nitrogen and NH3), and information provided by producers (production density (kg fish m(3-1)), specific water use (l kg fish(-1) min(-1)) and oxygen drop (mg l(-1)) from tank inlet to tank outlet), were used as predictor variables. In addition, several other welfare relevant variables such as disease history, temperature during freshwater and sea stage; season (S1) or off-season (S0) smolt production; and the use of seawater addition during the freshwater stage were analyzed. No strong intensity effects on mortality or growth were found. CO2 levels alone (P < 0.001, R-2 = 0.16), and in combination with specific water use (R-2 = 0.20), had the strongest effect on mortality. In both cases, mortality decreased with increasing density. For growth, the intensity model with the most support (R-2 = 0.17) was O-2 drop, density and their interaction effects, resulting in the best growth at low and high intensity, and poorer growth at intermediate levels. Documented viral disease outbreaks (infectious pancreatic necrosis and two cases of pancreas disease) in the sea phase resulted in significantly higher mortalities at 90 days compared with undiagnosed smolt groups, although mortalities were highly variable in both categories. The temperature difference between the freshwater stage and seawater had a small, but significant, effect on growth with the best growth in groups stocked to warmer seawater (P = 0.04, R-2 = 0.06). S0 and S1 smolt groups did not differ significantly in growth, but the mortality was significantly (P = 0.02) higher in S1 groups. Seawater addition as a categorical variable had no significant effects, but when analyzed within the seawater addition group, intermediate salinities (15-25 ppt) gave the best results on growth (p = 0.04, R-2 = 0.15). Production intensity had small explanatory power on subsequent seawater performance in the analyzed smolt groups. If anything, the analysis shows a beneficial effect of intensive production strategies on subsequent performance. Analysis of the various production strategies indicates better survival of S0 compared with S1 smolt groups, improved growth when stocked in seawater warmer than freshwater, and a negative effect of viral disease outbreaks on survival. The results clearly demonstrate the difficulty of extrapolating results from experimental work on fish welfare and production intensity variables to commercial production. On the other hand, the presented results may simply demonstrate that the traditional fish welfare criteria growth and mortality may not suffice to evaluate welfare consequences of suboptimal water quality or production strategies in the aquaculture industry.

The system was primarily designed to observe the fate of metal ions and nutrients. The following three experiments were conducted: (1) flow through saturated soils only, which simulates indirect discharge where water is directly applied to groundwater; (2) flow through unsaturated soil followed by saturated flow, which simulates vadose then saturated zone transport; and (3) saturated flow only using ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid-metal chelates, which determined effects of metal organic complexes on metal mobility through the soil. Metal ion attenuation was substantial but not complete in experiments 1 and 2 (removal: 68% Cu2+, 43% Ni2+, 98% Pb2+, and 96% Hg2+), which was somewhat contrary to modeling results. Cyanide attenuation was also monitored (92% removal). In experiment 3, lead attenuation was somewhat reduced (92% removal) and delayed (requiring additional residence time); copper attenuation was significantly reduced (38% removal) and delayed; and nickel concentrations were higher in the 28-day sample (>80 mu g/L) than in the column feed water (58 mu g/L). Near-complete denitrification and total phosphorus attenuation were observed. For the water quality constituents studied, unsaturated (vadose zone) transport did not appear to add additional benefit.

Extending results from agricultural fields with intensively monitored data to surrounding areas for water quality management	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Nitrogen; Nitrate; Tile drainage; Tileflow; Simulation model; Decision support system	TILE-DRAINAGE; CROP YIELD; LOSSES; SYSTEMS	A 45% reduction in riverine total nitrogen flux from the 1980-1996 time period is needed to meet water quality goals in the Mississippi Basin and Gulf of Mexico. This paper addresses the goal of reducing nitrogen in the Mississippi River through three objectives. First, the paper outlines an approach to the site-specific quantification of management effects on nitrogen loading from tile drained agriculture using a simulation model and expert review. Second, information about the net returns to farmers is integrated with the nitrogen loading information to assess the incentives to adopt alternative management systems. Third, the results are presented in a decision support framework that compares the rankings of management systems based on observed and simulated values for net returns and nitrogen loading. The specific question addressed is how information about the physical and biological processes at Iowa State University's Northeast Research Farm near Nashua, Iowa, could be applied over a large area to help farmers select management systems to reduce nitrogen loading in tile drained areas. Previous research has documented the parameterization and calibration of the RZWQM model at Nashua to simulate 35 management system effects on corn and soybean yields and N loading in tileflow from 1990 to 2003. As most management systems were studied for a 6 year period and in some cases weather had substantial impacts, a set of 30 alternative management systems were also simulated using a common 1974-2003 input climate dataset. To integrate an understanding of the economics of N management, we calculated net returns for all management systems using the DevTreks social budgeting tool. We ranked the 35 observed systems in the Facilitator decision support tool using N loading and net returns and found that rankings from simulated results were very similar to those from the observed results from both an onsite and offsite perspective. We analyzed the effects of tillage, crop rotation, cover crops, and N application method, timing, and amount for the 30 long term simulations on net returns and N loading. The primary contribution of this paper is an approach to creating a quality assured database of management effects on nitrogen loading and net returns for tile drained agriculture in the Mississippi Basin. Such a database would systematically extend data from intensively monitored agricultural fields to the larger area those fields represent. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Doole, GJ				Doole, Graeme J.			Cost-effective policies for improving water quality by reducing nitrate emissions from diverse dairy farms: An abatement-cost perspective	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Agricultural production; Catchment modelling; Environmental policy; Farm modelling; Nitrate leaching	ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT; POLLUTION-CONTROL; LAND-USE; NITROGEN; COWS; ECONOMICS; CURVES; MODELS; CHOICE	A flexible and replicable approach for the appraisal of the cost-effectiveness of various policy instruments for the regulation of nonpoint pollution from heterogeneous farms is presented. The framework is employed to evaluate three regulatory instruments for achieving reductions in nitrate leaching among a large population of dairy farms in the Waikato region of New Zealand. These instruments are (1) a differentiated policy that allows individual abatement effort to vary among farms to satisfy a catchment-wide reduction in leaching load, (2) a uniform policy that requires all farms to reduce emissions by a constant proportion, and (3) a threshold policy that requires all farms to emit beneath a given threshold leaching load. A 30% reduction in leaching will cost around 1.4, 1.96, and 4.41 million dollars across the catchment with a differentiated, uniform, and threshold policy, respectively. In comparison, a 50% reduction in leaching will cost around 7.77, 8.58, and 11.24 million dollars across the catchment with a differentiated, uniform, and threshold policy, respectively. Thus, a differentiated policy achieves required environmental outcomes at least cost. This result highlights the value of modelling heterogeneous farms in policy evaluation for nonpoint pollution control. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effects of loading, resting period, temperature, porous media, vegetation and aeration on performance of pilot-scale vertical flow constructed wetlands	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article						Constructed wetlands; Vertical flow; Loading rate; Resting period; Temperature; Porous media; Vegetation; Aeration; Organic matter; Nitrogen; Phosphorus	DOMESTIC WASTE-WATER; ON-SITE TREATMENT; REMOVAL EFFICIENCY; PHOSPHORUS REMOVAL; SLUDGE TREATMENT; TOTAL NITROGEN; REED BED; DESIGN; PARAMETERS; PHOSPHATE	Ten pilot-scale, cylindrical, vertical flow constructed wetlands (area 0.57 m(2)) were constructed and operated continuously for three years in parallel experiments, treating synthetic wastewater, simulating the first treatment stage of full-scale systems. The wetland units were planted with two plant species (i.e., common reeds and cattails), had different porous media material composition (i.e., carbonate, igneous, zeolite and bauxite) and three different total substrate thicknesses and gradations. Three loading/resting schedules were used. Water quality samples were collected at the inlet and the outlet of each unit. and were analyzed in the laboratory for the determination of various pollutants. The VFCW units were quite efficient in organic matter (BOD5 and COD) and nitrogen (TKN and NH4+-N) removal, with mean removal efficiencies exceeding 78% and 58%, respectively. Mean phosphorus (TP and OP) removal was lower (37%). The units were found to provide significant pollutant removal under high organic loads, up to 200 gCOD/m(2) d. The presence of reeds and aeration tubes was found to improve the performance, while plant species did not affect efficiency. The use of special materials, aiming at enhancing the adsorption of different constituents, did not improve the wetland efficiency, probably due to limited contact time between material and wastewater, and is not recommended.

The algorithms were calibrated and validated by in situ measurements, collected on 27 and 28 October, 2003, in Taihu Lake, China. Both two algorithms produced well performance in estimating NC and PC in Taihu Lake, but the PC retrieval model had a superior performance to NC retrieval model. The RE (Relative Error) of the PC and NC retrieval models were 11.7% and 35.6%, respectively. According to no more than 30% accuracy requirements of water quality estimation for remote-sensing technology, the accuracy of PC retrieval model is more acceptable than the NC retrieval mode's. Finally, the PC and NC were estimated from Landsat/TM imagery, collected on 28 October, 2003. The retrieval results showed that the NC and PC were higher in the south, east and center of the lake (>18 mg/l and >2 mg/l for NC and PC, respectively) and lower in the west and north of the lake (<18 mg/l and <2 mg/l for NC and PC, respectively). Although it was a special case study of this paper, the modeling procedures of NC and PC estimation algorithms could give us the implication when we used the remote-sensing technology to estimate the NC and PC from similar or dissimilar aquatic environments	[Chen, Jun] Minist Land & Resources Peoples Republ China, Qingdao Inst Marine Geol, Key Lab Marine Hydrocarbon Resources & Environm G, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China	Chen, J (corresponding author), Minist Land & Resources Peoples Republ China, Qingdao Inst Marine Geol, Key Lab Marine Hydrocarbon Resources & Environm G, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.	cjun@cgs.cn; cloudy1112@gmail.com			China Ministry of Land and Resource of the Key Laboratory of Marine Hydrocarbon Resources and Environment Geology [MRE201109]; Program of the China National Great Geology Survey [GZH200900504]	This work was supported by the open fund of China Ministry of Land and Resource of the Key Laboratory of Marine Hydrocarbon Resources and Environment Geology (MRE201109) and The Program of the China National Great Geology Survey (GZH200900504).

However, water quality sampling frequencies are rarely adjusted to the actual variation of the monitoring area. Manual sampling, for example, is often limited by the level of funding and not by the optimal timing to take samples. Restrictions in monitoring methods therefore often determine their ability to estimate the true mean and variance values for a certain time period or season. Consequently, we estimated how different sampling intervals determine the mean and standard deviation in a specific monitoring area by using high frequency data from in situ automated monitoring stations. Raw fluorescence measurements of chlorophyll a for three automated monitoring stations were calibrated by using phycocyanin fluorescence measurements and chlorophyll a analyzed from manual water samples in a laboratory. A moving block bootstrap simulation was then used to estimate the standard errors of the mean and standard deviations for different sample sizes. Our results showed that in a temperate, meso-eutrophic lake, relatively high errors in seasonal statistics can be expected from monthly sampling. Moreover, weekly sampling yielded relatively small accuracy benefits compared to a fortnightly sampling. The presented method for temporal representation analysis can be used as a tool in sampling design by adjusting the sampling interval to suit the actual temporal variation in the monitoring area, in addition to being used for estimating the usefulness of previously collected data.

The prediction since 2000 were 100% +/- 6% (mu +/- 1 SE) of the actual value. The predicted in 2010 was 99% of that actual value, suggesting that the net effect of the 2010 oil spill on the hypoxic zone size was negligible. A tropical storm, however, may have reduced the potential size of the hypoxic zone. Lowering the May nitrogen load to about 70,000 mton N nitrate + nitrite would bring the model's predicted hypoxic zone size down to the management goal of 5000 km(2) and restore hypoxic waters to normoxic conditions.

Biological Nitrogen Fixation in Periphyton of Native and Restored Everglades Marl Prairies	WETLANDS			English	Article						Acetylene reduction; Calcareous; Nitrogenase; Restoration; Stable isotopes; Phosphorus; N-15	FLORIDA EVERGLADES; WATER-QUALITY; FRESH-WATER; NORTHERN EVERGLADES; CYANOBACTERIAL MATS; N-2 FIXATION; WETLAND EUTROPHICATION; NUTRIENT LIMITATION; MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; NATURAL-ABUNDANCE	Periphyton mats are an important component of the Everglades ecosystem. These mats are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen; however little attention has been paid to this function throughout much of the Everglades system. The objective of this study was to characterize and quantify periphyton N-2 fixation in the Hole-in-the-Donut (HID) region of the southern Everglades, where farmed marl prairie wetlands have been restored through complete soil removal to reduce nutrient levels. Significantly higher N-2 fixation rates (measured acetylene reduction) were found in periphyton of the areas cleared in 2000 and 2003 (3-10 nmol g(-1) DW h(-1)) compared to the reference wetland site (less than 1 nmol g(-1) DW h(-1)). Overall rates were stimulated by light (similar to 2 times the measured dark rates). Areal estimates of fixed N were low compared to other Everglades, ranging from 0.1-0.2 g N m(-2) yr(-1) in the restored sites to 0.05 g N m(-2) yr(-1) in the reference area. Stable N isotopic ratios (i.e., delta(15) N) ranged from -1.0aEuro degrees to 0.2aEuro degrees and were correlated with nitrogenase activity and TN:TP ratios. These findings suggest that periphyton nitrogenase activity and delta(15) N could serve as indicators of nutrient status and restoration success in these systems.

This paper uses a set of hydrological and hydrochemical variables to explain concentration-discharge loops and hysteresis of NO3-, NH4+ and total suspended solids in a brook dewatering a small upland agricultural catchment in the Czech Republic. Our study is based on data collected by a continuous monitoring approach provided by an automatic ISCO sampler both from snow thawing and rainfall runoff events. Methods of correlation, regression and principal component analysis (PCA) were employed to reveal possible relationships among the variables. For NO3- and NH4+, we found several types of concentration-discharge loops due to the loop rotation direction and also the loop curvature shape, in mutual combinations, no matter which type of a hydrological event it was related to. PCA indicated that NO3- loops correlated mostly with the length of a rising hydrograph limb and with the slope of the initial phase of a falling hydrograph limb, 5-day amount of precipitation and runoff coefficient. In case of NH4+, the concentrations usually increased with elevated discharge, whereas PCA did not detect any closer linkages. For suspended solids, an unambiguous positive monotonic relationship was discovered. Although no definite pattern was found, this study showed the necessity of a continuous water quality monitoring system as an approach for capturing and understanding relationships between solute concentrations and runoff formation for tracing and modelling catchment pollution sources and describing transport processes.

Biomass removal scenarios were derived from a management-oriented large-scale forest model based on data from national forest inventories. Forest ecosystem sustainability was assessed by evaluating soil base cation balances as well as temporal changes (2010-2050) in soil base saturation and lake water acid neutralising capacity, using a dynamic hydro-geochemical model. The harvesting scenarios had very different effects on biomass and element removal as well as soil and water quality; only harvesting of above-ground woody biomass (stem-only or stem-and-branches harvesting scenarios) was predicted to be sustainable, i.e. not depleting the soil base cation pools in the long term. The most intensive scenario-whole-tree harvesting (including the removal of stumps and roots)-doubled the removal of biomass, tripled the removal of base cations from the catchment soils, and increased nitrogen removal fourfold. Climate change was predicted to have a positive impact by increasing the future supply of base cations from weathering, thus compensating their removal by biomass harvesting. However, additional inputs of nitrogen and potassium will be required to ensure sustained forest growth under intensive biomass harvesting.

Smayda. It celebrates the brief, but productive, period in which we collaborated on the formulation of the principles and mechanisms of community assembly in plankton. The topics considered then provide the structure of the present paper - the origin of communities (nascence), the common and differential requirements of phytoplankton species that might affect their selection, the general and specialist adaptive traits that differentiate their performances and their relative successes, and the sensitivity of performances to sub-ideal or hostile environmental conditions. In all these instances, it is the reactivity of the net dynamic responses of the species present to imposed environmental variations that shapes the structure of the assemblage and the composition of the community. These are the high-level properties that emerge from the behaviour of low-level components. The patterns that emerge at the community level - selection by performance or competition, dominance and temporal succession - are qualitatively predictable and, at the assemblage level, are amenable to quantitative modelling. In turn, it is theoretically possible to make deductions about the likelihood of biological events that involve species occurring in abundances sufficient to affect water quality and/or constitute risks to human health (harmful algal blooms).

Forty years of monitoring water quality in Grasmere (English Lake District): separating the effects of enrichment by treated sewage and hydraulic flushing on phytoplankton ecology	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						climate change; flushing; nutrient enrichment; phytoplankton; stoichiometric model	RETENTION TIME; CONSTRAINTS; ABUNDANCE	1. Grasmere is a small lake (area: 0.64 km2; mean depth 7.7 m) in a catchment with high rainfall (typically 23 m annually), which subjects the lake to intermittent episodes of rapid flushing. 2. An overview of the trends in water quality and of phytoplankton of Grasmere is presented, covering almost 40 years of observations following the construction and commissioning of a waste-water treatment plant to serve a nearby village. 3. There was a threefold increase in annual areal phosphorus loading during the 25 years following commissioning. Moving the original outfall of the sewage works from the River Rothay, just above its inflow into Grasmere, to a point in the lake, 7.5 m below the surface and, normally, below the summer thermocline, mitigated direct biomass response to epilimnetic enrichment. Maximum concentrations of chlorophyll a increased about twofold, but the annual mean concentrations altered little; interannual variability seems to relate more to flushing than to changing fertility. Cyanobacterial blooms occurred during years of relative summer drought. 4. Since 1996, nutrient loadings have been alleviated by better wastewater management and tertiary treatment of effluents discharged during dry weather. Recent chlorophyll a maxima have declined with the reduced supportive capacity of phosphorus availability. 5. An updated annotated list of phytoplankton species known to have occurred in Grasmere is provided. The incidence and abundance of species supposed to indicate eutrophication probably reflect the enrichment that has occurred, while others, mostly associated with oligo-mesotrophic lakes, seem to have declined. Inherently slow-growing species (of Ceratium, Microcystis) have been unable to establish a significant presence in the lake. A group of algae in Grasmere that indicate nutrient-poor, acidic habitats are suggested to originate in the catchment and flourish briefly in the wake of flushing events.

Long-term variation and regulation of internal phosphorus loading in Loch Leven	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Sediment; Phosphorus; Internal loading; Weather; Water quality; Recovery; Eutrophication	NORTH-ATLANTIC OSCILLATION; EUTROPHIC LAKE; SHALLOW LAKE; SEDIMENT; RELEASE; LIGHT; WIND; REDISTRIBUTION; MACROPHYTES; ECOSYSTEM	Long-term monitoring data (1968-2008) were used to investigate internal phosphorus (P) loading following external P loading reduction in shallow Loch Leven, Scotland. A whole-lake sediment P inventory (upper 3 cm of sediment; 2005) suggested a release-potential of 29.7 tonnes (t) from the release sensitive sediment P pools. 18.5 t was contained within shallow water sediments (< 4.5 m water depth) with 7.6 t in deeper water sediments below the photic zone (> 5 m water depth). The "observed" release (< 5.1 t), estimated using a water column P mass balance approach (1989-2008), was < 5.1 t, indicating the presence of regulating mechanisms. Observed P release declined between 1989 and 2008, with the exception of 2003-2006. Observed P release estimates were positively correlated with annual average water column P concentration after 1989, highlighting the role of internal loading in maintaining poor water quality conditions after management intervention. Multiple regression analysis suggested that internal loading was driven by the wave mixed depth in spring (positive driver), summer water temperature (positive driver) and spring water clarity transparency (negative driver). The potential importance of biological and physico-chemical feedback mechanisms in the regulation of benthic-pelagic coupling and water quality in Loch Leven are discussed.	[Spears, B.

Water quality of Loch Leven: responses to enrichment, restoration and climate change	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Lake; Recovery; Chlorophyll a; Phosphorus; Nitrogen; Temperature; Rainfall; Daphnia	FRESH-WATER; SHALLOW LAKE; EUTROPHICATION; PHYTOPLANKTON; CATCHMENT; SCOTLAND; SUBJECT	It is usually assumed that climate change will have negative impacts on water quality and hinder restoration efforts. The long-term monitoring at Loch Leven shows, however, that seasonal changes in temperature and rainfall may have positive and negative impacts on water quality. In response to reductions in external nutrient loading, there have been significant reductions in in-lake phosphorus concentrations. Annual measures of chlorophyll a have, however, shown little response to these reductions. Warmer spring temperatures appear to be having a positive effect on Daphnia densities and this may be the cause of reduced chlorophyll a concentrations in spring and an associated improvement in water clarity in May and June. The clearest climate impact was the negative relationship between summer rainfall and chlorophyll a concentrations. This is highlighted in extreme weather years, with the three wettest summers having very low chlorophyll a concentrations and the driest summers having high concentrations. To predict water quality impacts of future climate change, there is a need for more seasonal predictions from climate models and a greater recognition that water quality is the outcome of seasonal responses in different functional groups of phytoplankton and zooplankton to a range of environmental drivers.

J	Jang, HJ; Choi, YJ; Ro, HM; Ka, JO				Jang, Hyun-Jung; Choi, Young-June; Ro, Hee-Myong; Ka, Jong-Ok			Effects of Phosphate Addition on Biofilm Bacterial Communities and Water Quality in Annular Reactors Equipped with Stainless Steel and Ductile Cast Iron Pipes	JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						biofilm; phosphate; disinfection by-products; drinking water distribution system; stainless steel pipe; ductile cast iron pipe	DRINKING-WATER; HETEROTROPHIC BACTERIA; DISTRIBUTION-SYSTEM; ORGANIC-CARBON; POTABLE WATER; PHOSPHORUS; MODEL; DISINFECTION; REGROWTH; GROWTH	The impact of orthophosphate addition on biofilm formation and water quality was studied in corrosion-resistant stainless steel (STS) pipe and corrosion-susceptible ductile cast iron (DCI) pipe using cultivation and culture-independent approaches. Sample coupons of DCI pipe and STS pipe were installed in annular reactors, which were operated for 9 months under hydraulic conditions similar to a domestic plumbing system. Addition of 5 mg/L of phosphate to the plumbing systems, under low residual chlorine conditions, promoted a more significant growth of biofilm and led to a greater rate reduction of disinfection by-products in DCI pipe than in STS pipe. While the level of THMs (trihalomethanes) increased under conditions of low biofilm concentration, the levels of HAAs (halo acetic acids) and CH (chloral hydrate) decreased in all cases in proportion to the amount of biofilm. It was also observed that chloroform, the main species of THM, was not readily decomposed biologically and decomposition was not proportional to the biofilm concentration; however, it was easily biodegraded after the addition of phosphate. Analysis of the 16S rDNA sequences of 102 biofilm isolates revealed that Proteobacteria (50%) was the most frequently detected phylum, followed by Firmicutes (10%) and Actinobacteria (2%), with 37% of the bacteria unclassified. Bradyrhizobium was the dominant genus on corroded DCI pipe, while Sphingomonas was predominant on non-corroded STS pipe. Methylobacterium and Afipia were detected only in the reactor without added phosphate. PCR-DGGE analysis showed that the diversity of species in biofilm tended to increase when phosphate was added regardless of the pipe material, indicating that phosphate addition upset the biological stability in the plumbing systems.

J	Huang, JC; Gao, JF; Hormann, G				Huang, Jiacong; Gao, Junfeng; Hoermann, Georg			Hydrodynamic-phytoplankton model for short-term forecasts of phytoplankton in Lake Taihu, China	LIMNOLOGICA			English	Article						Hydrodynamic-phytoplankton model; Lake Taihu; Chlorophyll-alpha; Model calibration	COASTAL ALGAL BLOOMS; WATER-QUALITY; EUTROPHICATION MODEL; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; ECOLOGICAL MODELS; SHALLOW; CHLOROPHYLL; PREDICTION; RESERVOIRS; ECOSYSTEM	Phytoplankton biomass is an important factor for short-term forecasts of algal blooms. Our new hydrodynamic-phytoplankton model is primarily intended for simulating the spatial and temporal distribution of phytoplankton in Lake Taihu within a time frame of 1-5 days. The model combines two modules: a simple phytoplankton kinetics module for growth and loss; and a mass-transport module, which defines phytoplankton transport horizontally with a two dimensional hydrodynamic model. To adapt field data for model input and calibration, we introduce two simplifications: (a) exclusion of some processes related to phytoplankton dynamics like nutrient dynamics, sediment resuspension, mineralization and nitrification, and (b) use of monthly measured data of the nutrient state. Chlorophyll-a concentration, representing phytoplankton biomass, is the only state variable in the model. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify the most sensitive parameter set in the phytoplankton kinetics module. The model was calibrated with field data collected in 2008 and validated with additional data obtained in 2009. A comparison of simulated and observed chlorophyll-a concentration for 33 grid cells achieved an accuracy of 78.7%. However, mean percent error and mean absolute percent error were 13.4% and 58.2%, respectively, which implies that further improvement is necessary, e.g. by reducing uncertainty of the model input and by an improved parameter calibration.

To evaluate the effect of TPLMS on water quality improvement, we analyzed the water qualities in rivers and bay during 2005-2010, targeting chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended sediment (SS), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) loads. Land-based pollutant loading all decreased during this period, with a significant reduction in COD and SS loads (p < 0.01). The COD reduction in seawater, following the TPLMS implementation, was also significant (p < 0.01). Time-lagged responses in COD and Chl-a supported an estimated seawater residence time of similar to 1 month. Land-based nutrient loads were also significantly reduced for TN (p < 0.01) and TP (p < 0.05), however, significant reductions were not observed in the bay, indicating potential alternative nutrient inputs from non-point sources into the bay system.

Phytoplankton composition, growth and production in the Guadiana estuary (SW Iberia): Unraveling changes induced after dam construction	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Phytoplankton; Dam construction; Estuaries; Nutrients; Light; Anthropogenic impacts	NEUSE RIVER ESTUARY; CHLOROPHYLL-A; ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES; CYANOBACTERIA BLOOMS; LIGHT AVAILABILITY; NITROGEN-CONTENT; TURBID ESTUARY; NORTH-CAROLINA; CELL-VOLUME; CARBON	Water quality and quantity problems in the Guadiana estuary due to a recently built dam have been predicted. including an enhancement of cyanobacteria blooms. The main goal of this work was thus to describe the present phytoplankton dynamics in relation to its environmental drivers and to evaluate the effects of damming on phytoplankton in the Guadiana estuary. Sampling campaigns were conducted during 2007-2009 in 4 locations of the Guadiana estuary, covering the salinity gradient Phytoplankton-related and physical-chemical variables were analyzed. Throughout our study, light availability was mainly controlled by suspended sediments and it was much lower than saturating intensities described for phytoplankton growth. Therefore, light was probably limiting to phytoplankton growth throughout the year, especially in the middle and upper estuarine zones. Nitrogen limitation of phytoplankton growth occurred occasionally throughout the study period, especially during spring and summer. Overall, light and nutrient availability were mainly controlled by river flow; anthropogenic sources of nutrients to the estuary were negligible. Phytoplankton showed a unimodal cycle with biomass maximum in late spring/early summer, and the typical seasonal succession of freshwater phytoplankton (diatoms, green algae, cyanobacteria) was observed. Diatoms were the main component of the phytoplankton community and their variability closely followed nitrate and river flow variability. The relative abundance of the main phytoplankton groups changed in relation to the period before dam construction, with a decrease on cyanobacteria contribution to total abundance. The environmental perturbation induced by dam construction has now stabilized and resulted in an overall decrease in nutrient concentrations, an increase in light availability and a decrease in cyanobacteria abundance.

Spain) has recently undergone a regime shift from a phytoplankton-dominated to a macrophyte-dominated system. This shift is well known in shallow lakes but apparently it has never been documented in rivers. Two initial hypotheses to explain the collapse of the phytoplankton were considered: a) the diminution of nutrients (bottom-up); b) the filtering effect due to the colonization of the zebra mussel (top-down). Data on water quality, hydrology and biological communities (phytoplankton, macrophytes and zebra mussel) was obtained both from existing data sets and new surveys. Results clearly indicate that the decrease in phosphorus is the main cause of a dramatic decrease in chlorophyll and large increase in water transparency, triggering the subsequent colonization of macrophytes in the river bed. A Generalized Linear Model analysis showed that the decrease in dissolved phosphorus had a relative importance 14 times higher than the increase in zebra mussel density to explain the variation of total chlorophyll. We suggest that the described changes in the lower Ebro River can be considered a novel ecosystem shift. This shift is triggering remarkable changes in the biological communities beyond the decrease of phytoplankton and the proliferation of macrophytes, such as massive colonization of Simulidae (black fly) and other changes in the benthic invertebrate communities that are currently investigated.

Planktonic and periphytic diatoms as indicators of stress on great rivers of the United States: Testing water quality and disturbance models	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Diatoms; Bioassessment; Great rivers; Indicators; Periphyton; Phytoplankton	MONITORING EUTROPHICATION; BENTHIC DIATOMS; LAKES; ALGAE; BASIN; ASSEMBLAGES; ECOLOGY; INDEXES	Planktonic and periphytic diatom assemblages were investigated as potential biological indicators of ecological conditions in the Ohio, Missouri and Upper Mississippi rivers. Diatoms were analyzed to determine which of the two assemblage types was most appropriate for monitoring environmental conditions. The comparative effectiveness of diatom data format was similarly evaluated, testing relative and absolute abundance data. Stressor gradients for the rivers were created using principal components analysis for suites of water quality variables, landscape disturbance variables, and combined variables. Diatom-based weighted averaging transfer functions were developed for these integrated stressor gradients using each habitat and data format. Representing the diatoms as relative abundance data provided optimal tracking of environmental stress, and both periphyton and phytoplankton showed potential as indicators of disturbance. These results reinforce the use of relative abundance data, often used for diatom water quality monitoring, over more labor intensive data formats. Diatom-based models were also created to infer water quality measures and to compare measured and diatom-inferred water quality to landscape stressors. In most instances, diatom-inferred water quality data were more strongly related to watershed-based stressors. This investigation supports the value of diatoms in assessing landscape stressors in large rivers as well as the more traditionally applied water quality conditions. The findings further suggest both planktonic and periphytic diatom assemblages may be used as bioindicators of river condition and may provide unique stressor response information.

Algal Uptake of Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Dissolved Organic Nitrogen in Effluent from Biological Nutrient Removal Municipal Wastewater Treatment Systems	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							PREPARATIVE ISOLATION; PHOSPHORUS FRACTIONS; RECLAIMED WATER; BIOAVAILABILITY; CARBON; FLUORESCENCE; TRANSFORMATION; IMPACT; FATE	Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) accounts for a large fraction of the total nitrogen discharged to surface waters by municipal wastewater treatment plants designed for biological nutrient removal (BNR). Previous research indicates that some but not all of the DON in wastewater effluent is available to bacteria and algae over time scales that are relevant to rivers and estuaries. To separate bioavailable DON from nitrate and less reactive DON species, an XAD-8 resin coupled with an anion exchange treatment was employed prior to chemical analysis and algal bioassays. Analysis of effluent samples from a range of municipal BNR plants (total DON concentrations ranging from 0.7 to 1.8 mg NIL) employing a range of technologies indicated that hydrophilic DON, which typically accounted for approximately 80% of the total DON, stimulated algal growth, whereas hydrophobic DON, which accounted for the remaining DON, remained at nearly constant concentrations and had little or no effect on algal growth during a 14-day incubation period. The hydrophobic DON exhibits characteristics of humic substances, and is likely to persist for long periods in the aquatic environment. The distinct differences between these two classes of DON may provide a basis for considering them separately in water quality models and effluent discharge regulations.

J	Nolan, BT; Malone, RW; Gronberg, JA; Thorp, KR; Ma, LW				Nolan, Bernard T.; Malone, Robert W.; Gronberg, Jo Ann; Thorp, Kelly R.; Ma, Liwang			Verifiable Metamodels for Nitrate Losses to Drains and Groundwater in the Corn Belt, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							WATER-QUALITY MODEL; NEURAL-NETWORKS; AGRICULTURAL SETTINGS; CROP YIELD; CONTAMINATION; VULNERABILITY; PREDICTION; PROBABILITY; POLLUTION; BALANCES	Nitrate leaching in the unsaturated zone poses a risk to groundwater, whereas nitrate in tile drainage is conveyed directly to streams. We developed metamodels (MMs) consisting of artificial neural networks to simplify and upscale mechanistic fate and transport models for prediction of nitrate losses by drains and leaching in the Corn Belt, USA. The two final MMs predicted nitrate concentration and flux, respectively, in the shallow subsurface. Because each MM considered both tile drainage and leaching, they represent an integrated approach to vulnerability assessment. The MMs used readily available data comprising farm fertilizer nitrogen (N), weather data, and soil properties as inputs; therefore, they were well suited for regional extrapolation. The MMs effectively related the outputs of the underlying mechanistic model (Root Zone Water Quality Model) to the inputs (R-2 = 0.986 for the nitrate concentration MM). Predicted nitrate concentration was compared with measured nitrate in 38 samples of recently recharged groundwater, yielding a Pearson's r of 0.466 (p = 0.003). Predicted nitrate generally was higher than that measured in groundwater, possibly as a result of the time-lag for modern recharge to reach well screens, denitrification in groundwater, or interception of recharge by tile drains.

Nitrate concentrations in groundwater under contrasting agricultural management practices in the low plains of Italy	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Nitrogen; Shallow groundwater; Upward water movement; Gas losses; Leaching; Nitrate Vulnerable Zone	SHALLOW GROUNDWATER; CONTROLLED DRAINAGE; CROPPING SYSTEMS; WATER-QUALITY; SOIL-WATER; MAIZE; MODEL; CONTAMINATION; BALANCE; LOSSES	In groundwater vulnerability assessment, it is assumed that groundwater closer to the soil surface is at greater risk of contamination by pollutants, including nitrate. However, this is not always the case, since low nitrogen (N) concentrations and losses from cultivated fields have been measured in shallow ground waters. This study aimed to evaluate the water and N balances in two low plain areas of the Veneto Region (NE Italy), characterized by a shallow water table (<5 m) and identified as Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs). In each of the two NVZs, three fields were managed with conventional (C), integrated (I) and organic (0) farming systems. Water and N fluxes through the vadose zone were monitored during the years 2004-2006. Water samples were collected from water-table wells and suction microlysimeters, whereas soil moisture and tension were measured with sets of TDR probes and dial-gauge tensiometers installed along the soil profiles. Surface runoff was also collected by gutters and diverted into containers where water volumes were quantified and sampled for chemical analysis. Water was analyzed for total N bound to sediment (only runoff) and total N and nitrate in solution. To evaluate the N in/out fluxes of the root zone (0.9 m depth), the upflux/percolation volumes were quantified by applying the water balance method. Upflux was one of the most important items of the water balance. The highest values were observed during summer (>200 mm), when upflux contributed an average of up to 65% of the evapotranspiration (ET). Percolation volumes were reduced as a consequence, with a net flux ranging from 118 to 292 mm y(-1) on average. Upflux also strongly influenced the N balance, reducing potential leaching. We estimated that, on average, 59% of the leached N returned to the root zone by upward movement. Shallow groundwater conditions also affected the proportions of N forms. Nitrate fraction decreased markedly in groundwater with respect to percolation water, most probably due to the enhancing effect of denitrification processes. Following the indications in the EU 91/676 Directive, large areas of the central and low plain of the Veneto Region have been designated as NVZs. However, agricultural impact on water quality does not appear to be very high in many parts of these areas, as evidenced by the N balance of these experimental fields. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Impact of the spatial arrangement of land management practices on surface runoff for small catchments	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						distributed model; MHYDAS; water particle routine; plug-in; Mediterranean climate; vineyard; weeding practices	CRITICAL-SOURCE AREAS; FLOOD EVENTS; HYDROLOGICAL BEHAVIOR; HERBICIDE LOSSES; PHOSPHORUS LOSS; DIFFUSIVE WAVE; WATER-QUALITY; SOIL; FIELD; CONNECTIVITY	Predicting the impact of land use changes on the hydrological response is crucial for water resource management. In the particular case of small catchments (1-10 km2), distributed models could provide useful answers regarding the effects of cultivation practices and man-made works on water fluxes. However, the impacts of specific land use spatial arrangements are difficult to predict because of the prohibitive number of possible cases to consider. Focusing on surface runoff, this article describes a strategy based on a water particle tracking routine to be plugged-in a distributed model that is designed to determine the spatial arrangements of land management practices that have the greatest impact on volume, peak discharge and lag time at the catchment outlet. A case study is described; the hydrological response of the Roujan catchment (Herault, France) is simulated with the MHYDAS model. The Roujan catchment contains a vineyard in a Mediterranean climate in a landscape in which weeding practices highly influence the partition between soil infiltration and runoff. Results showed that the proposed strategy is much more efficient than a random approach to design the spatial arrangements of the vineyard weeding practices with the greatest impact. Therefore, the proposed strategy may lead to innovative policies for the spatial planning of land management practices. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Modeling water, carbon, and nitrogen dynamics for two drained pine plantations under intensive management practices	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Forest hydrology; C and N dynamics; Silvicultural practices; Forest ecosystem modeling; DRAINMOD-FOREST	SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER; LOBLOLLY-PINE; FOREST MANAGEMENT; SPRUCE FORESTS; UNITED-STATES; LEAF-AREA; TAEDA L.; QUALITY; HYDROLOGY; BIOMASS	This paper reports results of a study to test the reliability of the DRAINMOD-FOREST model for predicting water, soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in intensively managed forests. The study site, two adjacent loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L) plantations (referred as D2 and D3), are located in the coastal plain of North Carolina, USA. Controlled drainage (with weir and orifice) and various silvicultural practices, including nitrogen (N) fertilizer application, thinning, harvesting, bedding, and replanting, were conducted on the study site. Continuous collection of hydrological and water quality data (1988-2008) were used for model evaluation. Comparison between predicted and measured hydrologic variables showed that the model accurately predicted long-term subsurface drainage dynamics and water table fluctuations in both loblolly pine plantations. Predicted mean and standard deviation of annual drainage matched measured values very well: 431 +/- 217 vs. 436 +/- 231 mm for D2 site and 384 +/- 152 vs. 386 +/- 160 mm for D3 site. Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients (NSE) were above 0.9 for drainage predictions on annual and monthly basis and above 0.86 for predictions of daily water table fluctuations. Compared to measurements in other similar studies, the model also reasonably estimated long-term dynamics of organic matter pools on forest floor and in forest soil. Predicted mean and standard deviation of annual nitrate exports were comparable to measured values: 1.6 +/- 1.3 vs. 1.5 +/- 1.5 kg ha(-1) for D2 site, and 1.4 +/- 1.3 vs. 1.3 +/- 1.1 kg ha(-1) for D3 site, respectively. Predicted nitrate export dynamics were also in excellent agreement with field measurements as indicated by NSE above 0.90 and 0.84 on annual and monthly bases, respectively. The model, thus successfully tested, was applied to predicted hydrological and bio-geochemical responses to drainage water management and silvicultural practices. Specifically, the model predicted reduced rainfall interception and ET after clear cutting, both of which led to increased water yield and elevated water table, as expected. The model also captured temporary changes in nitrogen transformations following forest harvesting, including increased mineralization, nitrification, denitrification, and decreased plant uptake. Overall, this study demonstrated that DRAINMOD-FOREST can predict water, C and N dynamics in drained pine forests under intensive management practices. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This is particularly relevant in ecologically vulnerable areas, where mitigation options include a complete redefinition of farming systems. This paper presents an assessment of mitigation options of a coastal agricultural watershed affected by algal proliferations (Lieue de Greve, western France). We developed a methodology based on two existing assessment approaches, an agrarian system diagnosis and an environmental assessment, to identify connections between farming systems and risky nitrogen-agricultural practices and to explore potential ways to reduce the environmental impact of farms while respecting their economic viability and technical feasibility. To understand the functioning of farming systems and calculate key indicators of economic performance, the agrarian system diagnosis combines landscape, historical, and techno-economic aspects of a farm. The environmental assessment includes (i) calculation of farm-gate nitrogen (N) budgets and N-use efficiency and (ii) use of a spatially explicit biophysical model, which simulates the effect of agricultural practices on water and N dynamics at the watershed scale and on N fluxes at the outlet. At the farm scale, the main outputs of the approach were (i) the identification of 11 farming-system types and factors influencing them in the past and present, (ii) the assessment of their techno-economic performances and (iii) for the main dairy systems, the assessment of their potential environmental impacts. Insights about the capacity of some systems to adapt to new constraints linked with environmental objectives were also brought out. Grass-based systems appeared to be the best alternative for existing farming systems since they display good economic results while limiting N emission risks. Scenarios of changes in agricultural practices at the watershed scale were tested with the biophysical model, comparing them to a reference scenario based on the continuation of current agricultural practices. The main results indicated that: (i) current water quality was in equilibrium with current agricultural practices, (ii) the response time of the watershed to changes in agricultural practices was relatively short (6-7 years) and (iii) the expansion of an agro-environmental incentive based on low-input practices and grass-based fodder proposed by local stakeholders to the whole watershed would result in a significant decrease in N fluxes but would not fulfill water-quality objectives. This integrated assessment approach demonstrated its ability to promote the emergence of mitigation solutions and to improve decision support. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Since most of the microorganisms involved in water clarification are unknown it is challenging to operate the process accounting for the permanent varying abiotic parameters and the complex composition and unrevealed metabolic capacity of a wastewater microbial community. Fulfilling the demands for water quality irrespective of substrate inflow conditions may emit severe problems if the limited management resources of municipal wastewater treatment plants are regarded. We used flow cytometric analyses of cellular DNA and polyphosphate to create patterns mirroring dynamics in community structure. These patterns were resolved in up to IS subclusters, the presence and abundances of which correlated with abiotic data. The study used biostatistics to determine the kind and strength of the correlation. Samples investigated were obtained from a primary clarifier and two activated sludge basins. The stability of microbial community structure was found to be high in the basins and low in the primary clarifier. Despite major abiotic changes certain subcommunities were dominantly present (up to 80% stability), whereas others emerged only sporadically (down to 3% stability, both according to equivalence testing). Additionally, subcommunities of diagnostic value were detected showing positive correlation with substrate influxes. For instance blackwater (r(s) = 0.5) and brewery inflow (both r(s) = 0.6) were mirrored by increases in cell abundances in subclusters 1 and 6 as well as 4 and 8, respectively. Phosphate accumulation was obviously positively correlated with nitrate (r(s) = 0.4) and the presence of denitrifying organisms (Rhodacyclaceae). Various other correlations between community structure and abiotic parameters were apparent. The bacterial composition of certain subcommunities was determined by cell sorting and phylogenetic tools like T-RFLP. In essence, we developed a monitoring tool which is quick, cheap and causal in its interpretation. It will make laborious PCR based technique less obligatory as it allows reliable process monitoring and control in wastewater treatment plants.

To also account for feedback relationships between plant growth and uptake from soil, abovementioned fertigation models must be coupled with crop models predicting dry matter production and yield as function of nutrients content in plant. Protected cultivation differs from open field production in several aspects: (i) both the above and below ground growth conditions can be controlled; (ii) plants grow in substrates of limited volume; and (iii) greenhouse leachate can be recirculated to save water and reduce soil pollution. Simulating crop growth in closed loop irrigation systems, particularly under conditions of high transpiration rate and low tap water quality, poses a new modeling challenge not existing under open field growth conditions. The objectives of this review are to evaluate current knowledge gaps in greenhouse fertigation modeling, and discuss the role of crop-substrate models in decision support systems designed to optimize growth conditions in semi-closed greenhouses. Discussed knowledge gaps include nitrate/ammonium nutrition and its impact on solution pH, salinity damage mechanisms, roots growth and proliferation in substrate, root uptake characteristics, and simulating water transport in growth substrates.

This model allows the simulation of diffuse pollution caused by nitrate concentration in a small hydrographical basin (located in the demarcated region of the Port wine). The model allows the creation of a set of scenarios aiming at an effective planning of the basin under study. The available data for the drainages calculation were the monthly average effective rainfall between the years of 1960 and 2008. The Climate-change was predicted by the scenarios created in SIAM II and were simulated with the HadRM3 model. The limit quantities of nitrate present in the water should not contain over 25 mg/l; this is the maximum recommended value, and should not exceed 50 mg/l, this is the maximum allowable value by Portuguese law. We created simulation scenarios using the fertilizers produced by the bovine cattle and change of the agricultural uses or crops in this basin. For 2010 the fertilizers used were comprised between the recommended and the allowable maximum values. For 2071 the fertilizers were above the maximum allowable value. With these scenarios we found a 40% increase in nitrate levels due to climate change between the years 2010 and 2071.

The eroded soil itself and the adsorbed chemicals in it are regarded as non-point source pollution that leads to water quality degradation. The major source of chemicals is the result of increasing application of chemical nutrients and pesticides in excess amounts in order to maximize crop production. Increased levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, along with higher sediment loads, are the leading contributors to reduced water quality. Nitrogen and phosphorus move from fields to surface water when sediment is transported through runoff and soil erosion. As a result of the nitrogen- and phosphorus-enriched sediments, eutrophication - the growth of algae and other aquatic plants - occurs, decreasing dissolved oxygen levels. The valuable tools for assessment of the behavior of chemicals in the environment are simulation models. Soil erosion models can simulate erosion processes in the watershed and may be able to take into account many of the complex interactions that affect rates of erosion. This contribution is focused on the suggestion of the model for predicting the total nitrogen and phosphorus content in the Tisovec river catchment, which is situated in the east of Slovakia.

The model takes fairness, efficiency and feasibility as basic principles. By introducing a weighted lexicographic minimization of the maximum initial discharge permit shortage rate for different industrial point sources, this paper proposes a quota allocation model and furnishes a solution procedure for determining initial discharge permits for multiple pollutants involving a finite number of initial discharge permits. A case study is developed to examine a single-period allocation problem of initial ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) discharge permits among 27 key industries in Lake Tai in jinagsu, China. A comparative study is conducted to assess the impact on industrial pollution control by different solutions based on the proposed approach and two other models. Analytical results demonstrate that the proposed lexicographic quota model achieves the lowest average shortage rate of 46.13% across industries, helps to enhance efficient implementation of the allocation scheme among multiple stakeholders and feasibility of adjusting industrial planning for the lake basin. In addition, the proposed model maximizes the average industrial allocation control benefits. Empirical analyses also indicate that appropriate changes in model weights can effectively affect intial discharge permit shortage rates and industrial pollution control results, thereby attaining the goal of fair, efficient, and feasible allocation.

J	Jagus, A; Rzetala, M				Jagus, Andrzej; Rzetala, Mariusz			Hydrochemical Consequences of Feeding Flow-through Reservoirs with Contaminated Water	ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA			Polish	Article							SURFACE SEDIMENT; HEAVY-METALS; QUALITY; LAKE	The research concerned flow-through reservoirs fed with contaminated river water. The aim of the research was to recognize the impact of reservoirs on fluvial transportation of contaminants. Three reservoirs, situated in the Upper-Silesian region (southern Poland) and operating in different environmental conditions, were selected for the research: Pogoria I reservoir - operating in the quasi-natural direct catchment (with fluvial load of industrial-municipal wastewater), Przeczyce reservoir - under agricultural anthropopressure, and Dzierzno Due reservoir - under urban-industrial anthropopressure. The research included analyses of the quality of river water flowing into and leaving the reservoirs and calculation of contaminant loads at the inflows and outflows. The research showed that Pogoria I reservoir neutralised inflowing contaminants, thus purifying the river water. Nitrogen and phosphorus compounds were particularly efficiently retained. Electrolytic conductance of water in Pogoria was reduced by up to 50%. Przeczyce reservoir was alimented with eutrophic water (especially rich in biogenic elements) from agricultural land. The reservoir accumulated contaminants at the initial stage of the research. After several years, however, it started releasing some of the accumulated substances, causing an increase in contamination of river water with e.g. organic substances. The data concerning Przeczyce reservoir revealed that reservoirs can purify water from some substances and simultaneously cause an increase in contamination with other substances. Selectivity of hydrochemical impact of reservoirs was particularly visible in case of Dzierzno Due reservoir, which received wastewater from the urban-industrial catchment. It largely reduced the loads of suspended matter, phosphates or zinc, among other substances, at the same time causing secondary contamination with substances like ammonia, lead or cadmium. The results of the research show individuality of reservoirs in terms of their impact on fluvial transportation of substances. It might be believed, however, that each reservoir which is fed with contaminated water will have at least partly (selectively) contaminating impact in the course of time. That should be related to increasing eutrophication in conditions of limited capacity of accumulation of contaminants in the limnic environment. Detailed assessment of transfer of substances by a particular reservoir would require individual research for that reservoir.

In summer 2011 we monitored nutrient concentrations, physical conditions, and conducted nutrient uptake and primary productivity experiments before, during, and after two major storm events to evaluate the extent to which storms can affect phytoplankton communities in the James River. After the storms, we observed changes in phytoplankton community composition, nutrient concentrations, and nutrient uptake. There was an uncoupling between primary productivity and chlorophyll biomass subsequent to storm events likely due to washout of algal communities. Rapid response sampling ("storm chasing") may be key to determining the triggers, sustenance, and demise of algal blooms. With climate models predicting increases in both total precipitation as well as storm frequency, these questions are of growing importance.

The heavy metals cannot be decomposed but can be transferred and accumulated with food chains [1, 2]. Many heavy metals are toxic to human beings. It is very important to measure the heavy metal concentration in the coastal waters for water quality investigation, environmental management and for security of aquaculture products. The remote sensing technology has been successfully applied for estimation of many parameters of water quality, such as the suspended sediments [3], chlorophyll a, [4-6], CDOM (colored dissolved organic matter) [7-8], eutrophication [9-10], salinity [11], and water quality grades [12]. The remote sensing technology has many advantages over the conventional investigation of water quality for its high spatial and temporal resolution, low cost, big coverage of data and synchronization. With its development, the remote sensing technique is expected to retrieve more parameters of water quality. As the heavy metals in water exist in three forms[13-14], each of which is respectively controlled by optically-significant parameters, suspended sediments, dissolved organic matters and phytoplankton. Previous work showed the possibility of detecting heavy metal concentration from remote sensing data[15]. Eight cruises were conducted for in-situ data collection in the Pearl River estuary in August, October, November, December 2009 and February, March, July and October 2010, respectively. An above-water method was used for the measurement of remote sensing reflectance (Rrs). The water-leaving radiance, the radiance reflected by a reference panel with 25% reflectance and the sky radiance were measured in turn for 3 times using the Ocean Optics USB4000 spectrometer (wavelength range from 346 to 1037 nm with a spectral resolution of 0.22 nm) at 128 sampling points, where the water samples were synchronously collected for lab analysis of concentration for three heavy metals (Cu, Pb and Zn) and other water components (suspended sediments, chlorophyll-a and CDOM). The in-situ measured Rrs data were calculated to match the bands of EO-1 Hyperion and the Landsat-TM band 1 to 4. The relationships between the concentration of the three heavy metals (Cu, Pb and Zn) and the remote sensing reflectance were analysed. The results showed that all the three heavy metals have good correlative relation with Rrs data. The correlative relation could be improved if it was analyzed respectively from data collected in dry season or wet season, and the correlative relation could be improved with the band ratio of Rrs. Algorithms for estimation of heavy metal concentration were developed using the ratio band combination, which has the maximum correlative coefficient with heavy metals. Then the algorithms were applied to Landsat TM data for estimation of the heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Zn) concentration. The results showed that the distribution of the three heavy metals' concentration is reasonable.

In-situ observational data for physical and biological parameters were collected from Calcutta University during 2010 are assimilated using multiscale objective analysis (OA) and incorporated in Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) to develop a four-compartment (Nutrient (N), Phytoplankton (P), Zooplankton (Z) and Detritus (D)) bio-physical model. The sensitivity of chlorophyll a (chl-a) biomass on the changing effect of salinity is dominating and a drastic decrease in chl_a (less than 2 mg/m(3)) has been observed in Haldia Station where the influence of high nitrate (above 32 ug/l) is predominant and thus effects water quality.

In addition, like winter forage crops, they could contribute considerable water quality contaminants via surface runoff. However, it may be possible to manage farms without spring forage crops. Two Southland daily farms were used to show: 1) flow-weighted mean concentrations of many water quality contaminants in surface runoff from a spring-grazed forage crop were similar to those found in studies of winter-grazed forage crops; and 2) that, using growth rate data for 2007-2012, in no year was the modelled forage crop beneficial from a feed supply perspective, and in all years the farms had similar financial performances and fewer feed deficits under all-grass management. Hence, good pasture management (e.g. avoiding treading damage using a stand-off pad and short grazing times) may negate the need for a spring forage crop, decreasing contaminant losses while not impairing farm profitability.

Recently, coupled lake-atmosphere models have also been developed to resolve the spatial distribution of the thermal behavior in lakes and to assess the feedback mechanisms at the air-water interface. In the studies summarized in this paper, the 3D Estuary and Lake Computer Model (ELCOM) acts as the hydrodynamic driver that provides temperature, salinity, and the transport fields that, if coupled with the Computational Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics Model (CAEDYM), simulates nutrients, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and benthic habitat. This study presents a summary of the performance of ELCOM, and in an indirect form, serves as well as a corroboration of the strength or weakness of the coupled modeling and its ability to reproduce the thermal structure and circulation patterns, with examples from the Laurentian Great Lakes (Erie and Ontario), Northern Great Lakes (Great Slave Lake and Great Bear Lake), and Lake Winnipeg in Central Canada.

J	Huang, YT; Pierson, D				Huang, Yongtai; Pierson, Don			Identifying parameter sensitivity in a water quality model of a reservoir	WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA			English	Article						coefficients; Morris method; sensitivity analysis; water quality model		Sensitivity analysis can provide useful insights into how a model responds to the variations in its parameter values (i.e. coefficients). The results can be very helpful for model calibration, refinement and application. A one-dimensional model has been set up to simulate the hydrothermal and water quality conditions of Cannonsville Reservoir, which provides water supply for New York City. This paper aims at identifying the most influential parameters in the model through sensitivity analysis. Firstly, the Morris method (a screening method) is used to identify influential parameters. It is found that 18 parameters are important in simulations of variables that include temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a (Chla). Secondly, the method is enhanced to investigate the global sensitivity of the parameters. It highlights 20 parameters that are sensitive in the simulations of the above-mentioned variables. The 18 parameters identified by the original Morris method are among the 20 parameters and the other two parameters are not very sensitive.

The results show that the kinetic characteristics of phosphate, nitrate-nitrogen, ammonia-nitrogen and nitrite-nitrogen of Nitzschia sp. are all generally in accord with the function of Michaelis-Menten equation. The Km of them are 1.81 mg/L, 1.75 mg/L, 0.20 mg/L and 4.53 mg/L, respectively. The maximum uptake rates of nitrate-nitrogen and ammonia- nitrogen are higher than that of nitrite-nitrogen, which indicates that nitrate-nitrogen and ammonia- nitrogen can be uptaken more preferential than that of nitrite-nitrogen. In conclusion, Nitzschia sp. has a fast utilized rate of ammonia-nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen and phosphorus. This indicates that Nitzschia sp. has a good effect on water quality and it could be applied potentially to purify waste water.

Combining with routine monitoring data of the five sub-catchments of the Chaohu Lake, emission of nonpoint source pollution from these catchments were described and estimated with the reformative practical-mean concentration method. The results indicated that nonpoint source pollution contributed 79 % total phosphorus and 58 % total nitrogen to total loading. Thus, nonpoint source pollution was the primary cause of degrading water quality of the Chaohu Lake. The total nitrogen and total phosphorus were mainly from Hangbu-fengle River and Nanfei-dianbu River. Therefore, among five effluents of the Chaohu Lake, Hangbu-fengle River and Nanfei-dianbu River were the dominant sources for degrading water quality of the Chaohu Lake.

Like most intermittent rivers in the Mediterranean area, this stream is not well monitored; only few water quality data are available. Thus, due to high variability in streamflow and nutrient concentrations, which characterizes this type of rivers, it is difficult to estimate accurately nutrient loads from point and non point sources and consequently anthropogenic activities impact on the river. In this work, a detailed study was carried out on the Celone river to identify the chemical characteristics of the water and to quantify the annual nutrient loads delivered to the downstream reservoir. An automatic sampler and a flow module were set up in a section of the river. Continuous measures of flow were carried out using a different frequency for water sampling when floods occurred and during normal or low flow state. Nutrient concentrations in the water samples were accurately determined in laboratory. Water quality of the river was found to vary considerably along the year in,terms of nutrient concentration. Nitrate and total phosphorus are the main cause of water pollution. Nutrient losses by surface runoff were essentially a winter process. The contribution per hectare of non point sources can be estimate at about 39 kg/ha of total nitrogen and 2.4 kg/ha of total phosphorus. Estimates of loads in terms of TN and TP for the 21-day period of flood were calculated in 55 and 81% of annual loads, respectively. This study clearly demonstrates the importance of flood event contribution to the annual nutrient load.

HYDROCHEMISTRY OF VARNA BAY (2000-2008)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						the Varna bay; nutrients; eutrophication; the Black Sea		The Varna bay is affected by anthropogenic activities - industry, transport, agriculture and urban processes for a long term after the 60's of the last century. The aims of this paper are to analyse the variations of nutrients and oxygen content as indicators of the eutrophication during the 2000-2008 period and to estimate the water quality changes tendency. The study is based on the data obtained by bimonthly monitoring of nutrients - nitrogen, silica and phosphorous (N, Si and P), salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO) in the north part of the Varna bay during 2000-2008 period. The samples were collected from surface waters and analysed for chemical parameters by standard methods. The seasonal dynamics are characterised by high oxygen and nutrients content in winter.

Modelling nutrient retention function of ecosystem - a case study in Baoxing County, China	18TH BIENNIAL ISEM CONFERENCE ON ECOLOGICAL MODELLING FOR GLOBAL CHANGE AND COUPLED HUMAN AND NATURAL SYSTEM	Procedia Environmental Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	18th Biennial ISEM Conference on Ecological Modelling for Global Change and Coupled Human and Natural Systems	SEP 20-23, 2011	Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	Int Soc Ecol Modelling	Beijing Normal Univ	Nutrient retention; Ecosystem service; Land use; Critical source area; Critical sink area; Baoxing	VEGETATIVE FILTER STRIPS; MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN; RUNOFF; LOAD	Non-point source pollution is one of the crucial causes leading to degradation of rivers and lake water quality; therefore, it has been studied in depth worldwide. However, few studies exploring the effect of terrestrial ecosystem nutrient retention function on water quality have been conducted to date. Natural ecosystems such as forests and grassland can hold runoff and sediment, thereby reducing the nutrients entering nearby aquatic systems, which is very important to improving water quality. Based on the landscape source-sink theory, this study assessed the nutrient retention function of ecosystems. The results showed that terrestrial ecosystems retained 78% of the Total Nitrogen (TN) within the system, thereby significantly reducing the TN entering the water. The nutrient retention function of different ecosystems varied significantly. Forests had the greatest potential capacity to maintain TN, but the actual retained TN was only about 10% of that applied to cropland. Because of irrational land use patterns, the potential forest intercepting nutrient function was not fully utilized. Specifically, nutrient retention function varied with altitude and slope. When the altitude was in the range of 1000 m or between 4000 m and 4500 m, the highest function could be attained, resulting to increases or decreases between regions. The nutrient retention function decreased as slope increased. The critical source area (CSA) was primarily distributed along the river bank. However, the critical sink area which made a high contribution to nutrient reduction did not appear that similar distribution like CSA. The critical sink area scatted in the whole basin mainly and only overlapped with the critical source areas in some place. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B. V.

In the SPA model, the Classification Standard of Lake Eutrophication and evaluation indices of monitoring sites in Baiyangdian Lake were considered as a set pair, and the eutrophication levels of monitoring sites were depicted by a five-element connection degree. Our results demonstrated that the key limiting factors that caused eutrophication were TN, COD and SD. According to the principle of the maximum membership degree and the analysis of the set pair situation, we concluded that Nanliuzhuang experienced hypereutrophy, Zaolinzhuang eutrophy, and the others upper-mesotrophy. Furthermore, the water quality of the seven observation spots was, from better to worse, Caiputai, Duancun, Wangjiazhai, Shaochedian, Guangdianzhangzhuang, Zaolinzhuang and Nanliuzhuang. The SPA adequately deals with the uncertainty problem in the eutrophication evaluation, and our evaluation results can be directly applied to lake restoration and treatment efforts.

Currently, simulation programs have been shown to be less effective in short-term and detailed simulations. Therefore, this study advanced an integrated framework for simulation by combining the modelling and monitoring methods. A case study was conducted to identify the spatial and temporal distribution of nitrogen (N) in the upstream watershed of a typical drinking water reservoir, in the city of Ningbo, Zhejiang province, China. In this study, a watershed model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), was used to estimate N load for the 254 km(2) upper stream watershed; while storm runoff samples were also collected to illuminate more detailed processes in the storm event. Based on the model output, the critical N source in Baixi watershed was identified as the forest. The potential nonpoint source (NPS) pollution risk areas were also illustrated as Sub-basin 21, 20 and 26. In addition, the model simulation proved that the Qingshui River contributed more N load than the other two tributaries. Conversely, the short-term and detailed trends were obtained through storm sampling. By analyzing the storm samples, it was clear that the N load into the drinking water reservoir results from a combination of land-use, agricultural activities, as well as atmospheric deposition, especially in the acid rain control region. It could be further inferred that modelling and monitoring could serve as a framework to provide information for N load prediction and protection of drinking water. Using the integrated simulation-monitoring framework, the SWAT model could be used as an effective tool to foretell the potential risk of detrimental NPS conditions, while monitoring could provide an inventory and detailed means to further study short-term trends.

For sandy river management, it is necessary to determine the contributing factors for the ecosystem functions of alternate bar segments. In recent years, it has been reported that sandbars have a water purification function involving denitrification driven by sub-surface flow, but the details are still unknown. The objective of this study was to develop a model that could be used to examine how the nitrogen is trapped and retained by several elements of a sandbar in an alternate bar reach. We also developed a framework to analyze the temporal change in the denitrification by using a numerical simulation, aerial photos, and a water quality information system. The numerical simulation was performed under the discharge and morphological conditions of the Yahagi River in the Chubu region of Japan. The main results of this study are that the temporal change in the denitrification ecosystem function in a sandbar reach can be quantified using the proposed model and the denitrification activity has increased over the past 40 years. In addition, it was clearly shown that differences in the vegetation distribution and sandbar shape affect the nitrogen dynamics. Thus, the numerical simulation has made it possible to determine the most effective vegetation patterns to maximize the ecosystem function in a sandbar. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In order to solve the existing problems of traditional methods, such as rarely considering water quality and ecosystem status, a new method was developed to assess the environmental flows of wetland that will reflect the synergistic effect of water quality and quantity on ecosystems. The proposed method was applied to the Baiyangdian wetland, the largest shallow lake and wetland complex in the North China Plain. The main steps are as follows: 1) Based on the maximum distance cluster results of water quality data and organism data, the Baiyangdian wetland was divided into five regions. The key species were distinguished by a series of simulated removal experiments using the Ecosim model. 2) Integrating the typical monthly average water level and the surface water quality standards of Classes.,., and., 21 integrated scenarios were designed. Aquatox model was applied to analyze the response of phytoplankton, zooplankton, zoobenthos under different circumstances of water levels, NH3, NO3-, PO43-, BOD5 and other environmental factors, illustrating the temporal and spacial distribution of biomass, the status of structure and functions of ecosystem under the synergistic effect of water quality and quantity scenarios. 3) Based on the variation trend of assessment indicators such as total primary production/total respiration, total biomass/total production, biomass of zooplankton/biomass of phytoplankton in different regions, and the weighting factors for each region, finally we concluded that 6.70m can serve as the minimum ecological water level in Baiyangdian, and 7.19-9.55m can serve as the range of appropriate ecological water levels. These ecological water level results can guarantee the stability of the ecosystem structure and balance without having the reverse succession, which also has an ecological significance.

Water environmental capacity calculation based on uncertainty analysis: a case study in the Baixi watershed area, China	18TH BIENNIAL ISEM CONFERENCE ON ECOLOGICAL MODELLING FOR GLOBAL CHANGE AND COUPLED HUMAN AND NATURAL SYSTEM	Procedia Environmental Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	18th Biennial ISEM Conference on Ecological Modelling for Global Change and Coupled Human and Natural Systems	SEP 20-23, 2011	Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	Int Soc Ecol Modelling	Beijing Normal Univ	Water environmental capacity; Monte Carlo simulation; uncertainty analysis	SOURCE POLLUTED RIVER; QUALITY; PROVINCE; MODELS	Water environmental capacity (WEC) is an important concept in environmental science. A basic theory applied in EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment), WEC is also an indispensable factor in District Environmental Planning and total water pollutant control planning. The results of most calculating methods for WECs are fixed values that correspond to designed conditions and are not practical WECs. Instead of a fixed value in calculating WEC, confidence probability and uncertainty analysis should be combined with the river model. Consequently, the feasible WEC in different hydrological periods can ensure the precision and reliability of the load allotment. In this study, a useful method, Monte Carlo simulation, was combined with a water quality model to calculate the WEC and quantify the impact of a range of input values on the WEC. A case study of nitrogen and phosphorus WEC calculation was conducted in the Baixi Reservoir watershed area in Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, China. The results show that the WEC values of TN under 90% confidence probability were 5.30 T/period during the wet period, 8.35 during the dry period, and 9.83 during the middle period. In comparison, the values under 80% and 70% were 10.80, 16.39, 18.79, and 15.94, 23.99, 27.71 T/period, respectively. The WEC values of TP were also obtained. The uncertainty analysis-based WEC could help policy makers to set better goals for different hydrological periods, especially in an area dominated by non-point source pollutants.

Simulation and Validation of Non-point Source Nitrogen and Phosphorus Loads under Different Land Uses in Sihu Basin, Hubei Province, China	18TH BIENNIAL ISEM CONFERENCE ON ECOLOGICAL MODELLING FOR GLOBAL CHANGE AND COUPLED HUMAN AND NATURAL SYSTEM	Procedia Environmental Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	18th Biennial ISEM Conference on Ecological Modelling for Global Change and Coupled Human and Natural Systems	SEP 20-23, 2011	Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	Int Soc Ecol Modelling	Beijing Normal Univ	Sihu basin; L-THIA model; non-point source pollution; different land uses; validation	WATERSHED-SCALE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MODEL; RUNOFF; IMPACT; FRAMEWORK; RIVER	Many water quality models have been extensively used to evaluate non-point source pollution, such as SWMM (Storm Water Management Model), AnnAGNPS (Annualized Agricultural Non-point Source), HSPF (Hydrological Simulation Program- Fortran), SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) and so on. However, these models' construction tended to be complex, only used well in the condition of many parameters and normative data can be obtained. There were much problem to use these models in tidal plain, where topography were flat, stream network were complex and controlled by many water conservancy systems. The L-THIA (Long-Term Hydrologic Impact Assessment) model can be used in the areas with uncompleted data, evaluate the effects of land use on non-point source pollution, because it only needs land use, soil types and some rainfall data. But the output results of L-THIA model are the annual average runoff volume and pollution load, which cannot be obtained easily in in-site observation. In this paper, one of typical tidal plain, Sihu basin in Hubei province of China, was studied. The annual average runoff volume and the non-point source nitrogen and phosphorus load of each grid (16m*16m) and the spatial distribution were estimated by L-THIA model. The average load of non-point source nitrogen and phosphorus at each exit of the units were calculated based on the suppose that the pollution load is inverse to the distance of water flow. Model validation was executed by comparing calculated results and observed water quality data for study area. The results demonstrated that there were highly significant linear correlation between the calculated average load of non-point source nitrogen and phosphorus and the measured concentrations of TP and TN (TN: R=0.828; TP: R=0.957). These suggested that the average load of non-point source nitrogen and phosphorus were reliable to evaluate non-point source pollution. Moreover, the simulation results illustrated that the non-point source nitrogen and phosphorus loads under different land uses were quite different. The impact of dry lands on the non-point source nitrogen and phosphorus was the highest; that of paddy fields and residential areas were secondary; and the impact of woodlands to non-point source nitrogen and phosphorus was the minimum.

Hydrodynamic model was established with node level method to solve the discrete form of Saint-Venant equation. Finite-volume was also applied to solve the one-dimensional convection-dispersion equation. The reaction terms in the pollutant mass transport equation are illustrated via the principle of eco-chemical cycling processes of nitrogen, phosphorus, dissolved oxygen and phytoplankton. The results showed that the concentration calculation errors of Ammonia and COD in the model were in the ranges of -15%-13% and -14%-17%, respectively, which met the requirement of practical needs. Therefore, the coupled model can be applied to the simulation of water quality for Suzhou river network and similar river networks as well. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Lou, IC; Zhao, YY				Lou, Inchio; Zhao, Yuchao			Sludge Bulking Prediction Using Principle Component Regression and Artificial Neural Network	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							MULTIPLE LINEAR-REGRESSION; FILAMENTOUS BULKING; STORAGE	Sludge bulking is the most common solids settling problem in wastewater treatment plants, which is caused by the excessive growth of filamentous bacteria extending outside the flocs, resulting in decreasing the wastewater treatment efficiency and deteriorating the water quality in the effluent. Previous studies using molecular techniques have been widely used from the microbiological aspects, while the mechanisms have not yet been completely understood to form the deterministic cause-effect relationship. In this study, system identification techniques based on the analysis of the inputs and outputs of the activated sludge system are applied to the data-driven modeling. Principle component regression (PCR) and artificial neural network (ANN) were identified using the data from Chongqing wastewater treatment plant (CQWWTP), including temperature, pH, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solids (SSs), ammonia (NH4+), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSSs). The models were subsequently used to predict the sludge volume index (SVI), the indicator of the bulking occurrence. Comparison of the results obtained by both models is also presented. The results showed that ANN has better prediction power (R-2 = 0.9) than PCR (R-2 = 0.7) and thus provides a useful guide for practical sludge bulking control.

J	Rzepecki, M				Rzepecki, Marek			DYNAMICS OF PHOSPHORUS IN LACUSTRINE SEDIMENTS: THE PROCESS OF UPTAKE/RELEASE OF DISSOLVED PHOSPHORUS BY SEDIMENTS IN DIFFERENT HABITATS AND LAKES	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						eutrophication; uptake/release of dissolved reactive phosphorus; sediments; littoral; profundal; river/lake ecotone; wetland	WATER VEGETATION INTERACTIONS; MARSH GARCINES NORD; ORGANIC-MATTER; NUTRIENT RETENTION; PHOSPHATE RELEASE; HUMIC LAKE; SHALLOW; IRON; TEMPERATURE; CATCHMENT	Lake eutrophication and its consequences is still an important water quality problem being an effect of nutrient input to surface waters. In most lakes of the temperate zone, phosphorus is the nutrient responsible for eutrophication. Bottom sediments are the main pool involved in the retention and cycling of this element. Bottom sediments, depending on their chemical composition and aeration of the overlying water, may take up or release dissolved phosphorus i.e. the form easy utilizable by the plants. This study was aimed at comparing the exchange (uptake/release) of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in experiments that simulated natural conditions in various types of bottom sediments originating from different river-lake habitats typical of Masurian Lakeland (north-east Poland). Several river-lake systems typical for postglacial landscape were selected like river Jorka (15 km long, 5 lakes in cascade) and river Krutynia (similar to 100 km long flowing through 17 lakes). Sediments used in experiments were taken from the littoral and profundal zones of four lakes (meso- meso-eu-, eutrophic and hypertrophic), from a humic lake and from ecotone zones at the land-water border and at the border between lake and river (from through-flow lakes). In total, 154 experiments were performed to assess the intensity of P exchange at a high (>8 mg O-2 L-1) and low (<2 mg O-2 L-1) concentration of oxygen in water overlying undisturbed sediment cores. The following P fractions were isolated using the sequential extraction method and their importance was further analysed: easily exchangeable P (NH4Cl-RP - loosely bound, most available P; BD-RP - redox-dependent P associated with metal (Fe, Mn) hydroxides; NaOH-RP - phosphorus adsorbed mainly on metal (Fe, Al) oxides), hardly exchangeable P (BD-NRP - mainly organic P, whose stability depends on redox potential; NaOH-NRP - phosphorus in microorganisms, polyphosphates and part of organic P bound to detritus and humic substances) and non-exchangeable P (HCl-P - phosphorus bound to carbonates, apatite-P and phosphorus released during total dissolution of metal oxides; P-residual - non-exchangeable P together with part of organic P). The effect of various factors (i.e. Fe, Mn, Mg, Al, Ca, organic matter, total P content and its fractions) on the intensity of DRP uptake/release was analysed with Pearson correlation and multiple regression. In sediments (both littoral and profundal) from lakes of the Jorka River trophic gradient, high oxygen conditions were always accompanied by P uptake (from -0.9 to -2.8 mg P m(-2) d(-1)) while reduced oxygen concentrations were followed by DRP release (from 2.3 to 18.6 mg P m(-2) d(-1)). These values were several dozen times higher than those noted for sediments from humic lake. Profundal sediments released more P than the littoral ones. In profundal sediments of all lakes of the Jorka River, the intensity of DRP release to overlying water under reduced O-2 concentrations was higher than the uptake rate under aerobic conditions. It means that DRP release prevailed over its uptake. Release rate of DRP tended to be higher from sediments of eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes than from those of meso- and meso-eutrophic lakes both in the two studied habitats (littoral, profundal) and seasons (spring and summer). Sediments of humic lake (from both littoral and profundal zones) showed a low dynamics of DRP uptake/release with a small prevalence of the latter (0.02 to 0.08 mg P m(-2) d(-1)). River-lake-river sediments (from the inflows and outflows of the Krutynia River to a lake) were different in comparison with typical lake sediments they released DRP to aerated overlying water in both meso- and meso-eutrophic lake. Phosphorus was released from in-shore bog sediments at reduced oxygen concentration in overlying water in both seasons (spring and summer) while under aerobic conditions DRP was weakly taken up and/or released. Fe, Mn, Mg, total P content and redox-dependent easily exchangeable BD-RP fraction had a significant effect on the intensity of P uptake at high concentration of oxygen and P release under reduced oxygen concentration (Pearson correlation, P<0.01). Factor analysis showed that at a high O-2 concentration the intensity of DRP uptake by sediments was determined by redox-dependent fraction of P bound to Fe and Mn hydroxides (BD-RP) and the P fraction bound to carbonates and apatite (HCl-P) (r(2) = 0.48). At reduced O-2 concentration in overlying water the intensity of DRP release was affected by redox-dependent fraction of P associated with Fe and Mn hydroxides (BD-RP), P fraction bound to metal oxides (NaOH-RP), organic P in detritus, P in microorganisms and combined in humic substances (NaOH-NRP) and P fraction bound to carbonates and apatites (HCl-P) (r(2) = 0.63). Sediments from eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes in the lower course of the Jorka River are most intensively eutrophicated. They showed the highest values of DRP release and the predominance of P release over P uptake was the highest (up to seven fold). Sediments of these lakes contained the highest amounts of redox-dependent elements Fe and Mn. Hence, these lakes easily accumulate phosphorus at high concentrations of oxygen but equally easily release it when oxygen in water is depleted. More stable are meso- and meso-eutrophic lakes situated higher in the Jorka River system. Sediments of these lakes released smaller amounts of DRP than eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes and the prevalence of DRP release over uptake was threefold. In-shore bog sediments form a stable system when overlying waters are rich in oxygen. Under reduced oxygen concentrations, however, these habitats become an important P source (comparable with profundal sediments) for lake littoral zone in case of their close contact with lake waters. A system able to bind phosphorus stronger and faster will hamper the delivery of available P to lake water and thus will delay lake eutrophication; that able to release P will accelerate eutrophication. In this case, internal loading may have a decisive effect on the lake trophic status. Profundal mid-lake sites, in-shore bogs and to a smaller extent littoral sediments (gyttja type) are the systems accelerating eutrophication. Humic lake sediments (dy type) are more equilibrated among the studied systems the differences between uptake and release are small there.

The three methods were used to build consensus around the significance of the apparent declines in total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations following two interventions: (1) point-source phosphorus loading reductions of about 50% to the upper bay in the winter of 19771978 and (2) the establishment of Zebra Mussels (Dreissena spp.) in the early to mid-1990's. The methods were applied to May to October monthly means and included: (1) nonparametric tests that accounted for persistence and seasonality and determined the statistical significance of step-trends, (2) ARIMA-Intervention modelling that produced forecasts into post-intervention time periods that were compared statistically to measured data and (3) regime shift detection for identifying the significance of persistent steps after removal of the seasonal components of the data series (modelled as periodic functions). Strong gradients in total phosphorus (TP) and Chl-a concentrations between the upper and lower Bay of Quinte still existed three decades after reductions in point-source loadings of TP to the upper bay, where, during 20002008, May-October average TP was 3.8 times higher and Chl-a, 2.9 times higher than in the lower bay. The Remedial Action Plan May-October TP objective of 0.030 mg l-1 for the upper Bay of Quinte was not achieved consistently in recent years. Concurrence among the data analysis methods suggests that the relative decreases in the upper bay TP (31%) and Chl-a (37%) after phosphorus loading reductions were greater than in the lower bay (0% and 10%, respectively). The relative decreases in the upper bay TP (0%) and Chl-a (29%) associated with Dreissena establishment were less than those measured in the lower bay (20% and 50%, respectively).

The pollution has caused widespread concern. Although the water quality of South Lake has been improved after being taken a series of measures, the eutrophication problem still plagues researchers. In this paper, the laboratory simulation method was applied to study the sorption isotherms of sediments in South Lake, as well as the release characteristics of ammonia and TN under different temperatures and pH. The result shows that: When the ammonia of the overlying water was less than 10 mg/L, the adsorption presented linear trend. When the ammonia was over 10 mg/L, the adsorption presented a parabola. When the initial ammonia concentration was 17.9mg/L, the adsorption of nitrogen in the sediments of lotus pond reached the maximum 437.54mg/kg; When the initial ammonia concentration was 18.45mg/L, the adsorption of nitrogen in the sediments of the bridge reached the maximum 520.89mg/kg. The higher the temperature, the larger the release amount of TN and ammonia sediment was; The largest release of TN appeared at pH of 7, and for the ammonia, the peak emerged at pH of 10.

The Lake Ontario Nearshore Study: Introduction and summary	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Editorial Material						Nearshore zone; Water quality; Cladophora; Models	CLADOPHORA; PHOSPHORUS; NUTRIENTS	Intensive sampling of seven 100-km(2) nearshore sites and a lake circumnavigation using geo-spatially linked, continuous-measuring sensors allowed unprecedented detail on the structure of the nearshore of Lake Ontario in the post-dreissenid era. The 23 manuscripts describe the wide variability in nearshore nutrients, suspended solids, and organic wastewater correlated with proximity to the shoreline and among geographic areas. Although 7.71 x 10(5) mT of dreissenids exist in the nearshore, phosphorus regenerated was not enough to sustain populations of Cladophora. The phosphorus load of tributaries to Lake Ontario was 234% higher than of wastewater treatment plants and 67.5% of the 1982 Niagara phosphorus load. Phosphorus loading from local watersheds appeared to be the underlying driver for the spatial nearshore variability in Cladophora biomass. Such research has implications for the nearshore of other large lakes and is a necessary prerequisite to more fully understand how the nearshore functions in the post-dreissenid era. Consistent monitoring should be conducted on the major tributaries and representative smaller water courses in Ontario and New York to obtain ongoing information on the spectrum of influences that shoreline runoff has on the nearshore and the lake as a whole. We believe, however, that this falls short of what is needed to effectively manage nearshore water resources. We suggest that nearshore management might be advanced by a more purposeful coupling of the knowledge that exists in the field of watershed science with that of the limnology of large lakes to predict explicit nearshore conditions in the face of potential future environmental management regimes.

Trends in nutrients, phytoplankton, and chloride in nearshore waters of Lake Ontario: Synchrony and relationships with physical conditions	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						Lake Ontario; Diatoms; Eutrophication; Chloride; Nitrate; Silica	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; LONG-TERM TRENDS; GREAT-LAKES; LOADING REDUCTIONS; TOTAL PHOSPHORUS; ICE COVER; CHLOROPHYLL; IMPACTS; ERIE; COMMUNITIES	Consistent routine monitoring at four municipal water treatment plant intakes revealed dramatic long-term Changes in water quality in the nearshore waters of Lake Ontario over the last three decades. Total P concentrations decreased significantly, but concentrations leveled off at around 0.01 mg/L after 1996. Silica (Si) and nitrate + nitrite-N (NO2 (+) (3)) concentrations increased and chloride concentrations decreased until the mid-1990s after which they began to increase. There were significant decreasing trends in chlorophyll a and algal cell densities, the greatest rate of decrease being observed in diatom abundance. Interannual and seasonal variations in all parameters were synchronous between stations, indicating the influence of drivers such as climate and hydrology operating at a broad scale. The interannual variations in NO2 + 3 and Si concentrations were significantly related to snow depth, and in Si were also related to annual climate indices, the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI) and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), the two most dominant large-scale atmospheric circulation models controlling climate in large parts of the northern hemisphere. The relationships indicated that Si concentrations were lower in the milder, drier years and higher when winters were colder and precipitation and snow depth were greater.

Human activities arc the dominant factor for water quality in the mouth of the Sanya River. This region exhibited the maximum influence of discharge from the Saya estimated by higher nutrient levels and chlorophyll a (Chl a). Natural processes are the dominant factor regarding water quality in outer bay. Both human activities and natural processes play important roles on water quality in Sanya Bay. Each hydrologic and ecological zone has a specific water quality response associated with the relative importance of both human activities and natural processes. Therefore, the information would be useful for regional agencies in developing a strategy to carry out scientific plans for resource use based on marine system functions.

Evaluation of spatial variability on hydrology and nutrient source loads at watershed scale using a modeling approach	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH			English	Article						hydrology; nutrient; spatial variability; stream flow; SWAT; watershed	AGRICULTURAL WATERSHEDS; ASSESSMENT-TOOL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FRESH-WATER; SWAT MODEL; SIMULATION; EUTROPHICATION; QUANTIFICATION; PHOSPHORUS; MANAGEMENT	Understanding the effects of spatial variability on hydrologic parameters and nutrient source load distribution is essential to develop water quality improvement programs. The objective of this research was to evaluate spatially distributed hydrologic variability, nutrient sources, and their loadings at the watershed scale using a modeling approach. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to assess spatial variability of annual average water, sediment, total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) yields from the Upper Pearl River Watershed (UPRW) in Mississippi, USA. The SWAT model was successfully calibrated, validated, and verified with good model efficiency (R-2 = 0.70 and E = 0.59) using monthly measured stream flow, daily observed flow, sediment, TP, and TN yields. The SWAT model results determined that spatial variability of annual average pollutant loads of water yield ranged from 877 to 206 mm, sediment yield ranged from 1.71 to 0.17 t ha(-1), TP ranged from 1.39 to 0.02 kg ha(-1), and TN ranged from 10.22 to 0.69 kg ha(-1) in the watershed sub-basins. Understanding of the spatial variability of hydrologic and nutrient source loads distribution helps watershed managers focus their management efforts to the most needy watershed sub-basins.

In order to predict its vulnerability to climate change, the Integrated Catchments Model for Nitrogen (INCA-N) has been applied to the whole of the River Thames. The model was calibrated from 1999 to 2006, to simulate streamflow and nitrate (NO3-N) concentrations. Despite the highly variable land use and river flows within the catchment, INCA-N reproduced both the hydrological regime and NO3-N dynamics in the river. A sensitivity analysis was performed on measured flow and in-stream nitrogen transformation rates. it showed that simulated NO3-N concentrations were sensitive to denitrification rates and flow velocity. Measured parameter values were generally within the range of behavioural model simulations. Temperature and precipitation scenarios from the UK Climate Projections 2009 climate model outputs were used to project possible future flow and NO3-N concentration changes. Results showed generally drier hydrological conditions, increased river NO3-N concentration in winter and decreases in summer. An assessment of the planned new reservoir at Abingdon showed that, if managed appropriately, it may help offset the impact of climate change on riverine NO3-N concentrations and London's water supply.

THE VARIATION TREND OF NUTRIENT FLUX FROM YANGTZE RIVER AND RELATED IMPACT ON YANGTZE ESTUARY	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON APAC 2011			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Asian and Pacific Coasts (APAC)	DEC 14-16, 2011	Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	K C Wong Educ Fdn, Guangdong Prov Changda Highway Engn Co., Ltd, Croucher Fdn, Dragages Hong Kong Ltd, Nishimatsu Construct Co Ltd, Scottish Dev Int, World Sci Publishing Co Pte Ltd	Univ Hong Kong		CHANGJIANG RIVER	Due to climate change and mankind actives, especially reservoirs' operation such as Three Gorge reservoirs (TGP) and pollutions from industry, agriculture and domestic sewage in the Yangtze River basin, the nutrient flux at Datong hydrological station has significant changes in recent years. Based on the data measured at Datong station in different period, the changing trend of nutrient flux including discharge, suspended solids (SS), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN) are analyzed. Then a three-dimensional water quality model based partially on the open source code of Elfe, Wasp and EFDC are developed to simulate the C, N, P, Si cycling processes. The model is applied to the region from 120.6 degrees E to 124.5 degrees E and from 29.5 degrees N to 32.5 degrees N, including Yangtze estuary, Hangzhou bay and two important fishing grounds named Zhoushan and Lvsi. The upstream boundary condition at the Tianshenggang station in the 3D model are obtained by a 1D river water quality model which covers the region from Datong to Wusong using the related inflow at the Datong station. The downstream boundary conditions at open sea are given reasonably by a coarse grid model which including East China Sea. The measured data of Yangtze Estuary and Hangzhou Bay from 2004 to 2005 after TGP project are used to verify the model. The results show that the suspended sediment decreases continuously from annual value 4.6x10(8) to 2.6x10(8) in 2003 and then fall further to 1.3x10(8) ton in 2008. TP and TN have a rising trend because of increasing pollution load, especially from the middle and lower reach of Yangtze River in recent years. The variation of inflow flux of nutrient matter has great influence on the concentration of nutrients in the front of Yangtze delta where confluence region of Yangtze main inflow and upwelling from the out sea exists.

Several techniques of aeration are presented in this study, to describe their effectiveness in control of physical and chemical parameters, that compromising the balance ecological and the thermal stratification in water supplies. As a result, we demonstrate that the most efficient hypolimnetic aeration system is the bubble plume diffuser; although an accidental destratification may occur. In hypolimnetic aeration systems, the aeration system by bubble plume appears to be the most economic and perhaps the simplest among the systems used in Stanley lake (Colorado, U.S.A), even as other researches select Speece Cone aeration system, or the full airlift systems, or the TVA line diffuser. The purpose of this study is to show the oxygen transfer efficiencies in the different methods used in the technique of hypolimnetic aeration, and their effect on the preservation of the thermal stratification. As well, this study concentrate on the economic and technical sides associated to these aeration systems.

Total nitrogen in water was modelled using an artificial neural network system. In the proposed system, water temperature, depth, saturated oxygen, dissolved oxygen, pH, chlorophyll-a, salinity, turbidity and conductivity were considered as input data, and the total nitrogen in water was considered as output. The weights and biases for various systems were obtained by the quick propagation, batch back propagation, incremental back propagation, genetic and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithms. The proposed system uses 144 experimental data points; 70% of the experimental data are randomly selected for training the network and 30% of the data are used for testing. The best network topology was obtained as (9-5-1) using the quick propagation method with tangent transform function. The average absolute deviation percentages (AAD%) are 2.329 and 2.301 for training and testing processes, respectively. It is emphasized that the results of the artificial neural network (ANN) model are compatible with the experimental data.

J	Djodjic, F; Spannar, M				Djodjic, Faruk; Spannar, Malin			Identification of critical source areas for erosion and phosphorus losses in small agricultural catchment in central Sweden	ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA SECTION B-SOIL AND PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						Erosion; eutrophication; modeling; monitoring; phosphorus; risk assessment	SOIL-PHOSPHORUS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; MANAGEMENT; RUNOFF; SATURATION; TOOLS; MODEL; LAND	Identification of main contributing sources and critical source areas is a precondition for a cost-effective abatement strategy. This task is even more complicated in small ungauged catchments where inadequate amount of input, calibration, and validation data exists and thereby limit the application of process-based, parameter-heavy models. In this study, we present methodology to assess spatial variations in erosion and P losses, and based on source-apportionment and erosion modeling, to develop a base for source-and site-specific abatement countermeasures. Water quality monitoring program was developed to cover spatial variability in erosion and phosphorus (P) losses. Conducted soil survey detected high variations in soil P content within the catchment and strong correlation between soil P test and easily soluble P. A simple water balance model, calibrated for the comparable catchment with existing water flow measurements, was applied to determine water discharge, providing necessary input data for calculations of loads and source-apportionment. Source-apportionment modeling based on results from water discharge modeling, water quality monitoring program and soil survey identified P losses from arable fields as main source of P to two small lakes situated in the catchment, contributing roughly a half of total P load to the lakes. Inclusion of an assumed but previously undocumented point source considerably improved the performance of source-apportionment model. Existence of such a point-source was afterwards confirmed by results from detailed water quality monitoring program. Erosion modeling based on high-resolution digital elevation data identified areas most prone to erosion, and model results were compared to farmers' observations and analyses of Cs-137. Use of a spectrum of models and assessment tools formed a broad support for further steps in abatement efforts, and created concrete discussion base for implementation of detailed site-specific countermeasures.

We used an indoor rainfall simulation to monitor concentrations of dissolved reactive P (DRP) and faecal coliforms in runoff and percolation water from different paddock footings. Drainage water was also monitored from two paddocks constructed of woodchips. Sand retained more DRP (p<0.0001) and coliforms from percolation water than woodchips. Some of the footings were amended with P-sorbing materials, such as [Ca(OH)(2)], [Fe-2(SO4)(3)], or Fe-gypsum, to retain DRP. High DRP concentrations (17-18 mg l(-1)) were observed in runoff from a woodchip footing amended earlier with Ca(OH)(2) and in sand footing amended with CaCO3. However, application of Fe-gypsum to woodchips decreased the DRP load in percolation water by 83% compared to the footing without Fe-gypsum. Fe compounds were better than Ca compounds. The decrease in coliforms was usually small due to the modest pH changes in the water.

J	Iho, A; Laukkanen, M				Iho, Antti; Laukkanen, Marita			Gypsum amendment as a means to reduce agricultural phosphorus loading: an economic appraisal	AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD SCIENCE			English	Article						dynamic optimization; phosphorus fertilization; gypsum amendment; phosphorus loading; eutrophication	SOIL TEST PHOSPHORUS; BALTIC SEA; POLLUTION-CONTROL; RUNOFF; EFFICIENCY; NUTRIENTS; BENEFITS; POLICIES; FINLAND; LOSSES	This study analyzes the economic feasibility of gypsum amendment as a means to reduce particulate and dissolved phosphorus loads from arable areas. To this end, an optimization model is developed that includes gypsum amendment as well as matching phosphorus fertilization to crop need and the level of soil phosphorus reserves as phosphorus load mitigation measures, with soil phosphorus reserves measured by soil test phosphorus (STP). The optimal extent of gypsum amendment is then determined simultaneously with optimal fertilization use as a function of field STP level. The results indicate that whether or not gypsum amendment is economically feasible depends on field erosion susceptibility and STP level. When accounting for the costs and benefits to the society on the whole, gypsum treatment suits best to mitigation of phosphorus losses from soils with excessively high phosphorus reserves; once a threshold STP level is reached, gypsum amendment is optimally given up. This threshold level depends on field slope and on society's willingness to pay for water quality.

Optical characterization and tests of closure for Oneida Lake, New York, USA	INLAND WATERS			English	Article						absorption; optics; optical closure; remote sensing; scattering	REMOTE-SENSING REFLECTANCE; LIGHT-ABSORBING COMPONENTS; DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; EASTERN ENGLISH-CHANNEL; ABSORPTION-COEFFICIENTS; BACKSCATTERING RATIO; MARINE PARTICLES; COASTAL WATERS; ONONDAGA LAKE; CHLOROPHYLL-A	Optical characteristics are a central feature of water quality and are increasingly used as a basis for monitoring concentrations of optically active constituents (OACs) through satellite-based remote sensing. This study presents a robust optical characterization of the near-surface waters of eutrophic Oneida Lake, New York, USA, that features in situ spectral measurements of inherent optical properties (IOPs) and remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)), an apparent optical property (AOP) critical to remote sensing initiatives. The IOP measurements included the absorption coefficient, (a(lambda)), and particulate scattering (b(p)(lambda)) and backscattering (b(bp)(lambda)) coefficients. Supporting measurements included Secchi depth (SD), the OACs, chlorophyll a, phycocyanin, suspended particulate material, and laboratory determinations of components of a(lambda) (a(x)(lambda)), including colored dissolved organic matter, nonalgal particles, and phytoplankton. The strong spectral patterns of a, a(x), and R-rs, and more modest wavelength dependencies of b(p) and b(bp), are documented. The credibility of the optical characterizations is demonstrated through (1) the consistency of relationships between SD-1 and b(p), and a(x) and the OACs; (2) the extent of closure between in situ and laboratory measurements of a and a(x); and (3) the extent of closure between predicted R-rs spectra, based on the observed IOP (a and b(bp)) spectra and application of a widely used radiative transfer relationship, and observations. Major temporal and substantial spatial variations in OACs, IOPs, SD, and R-rs(lambda) are documented. Much of the variability in the OACs and SD were well predicted by system- specific empirical relationships that used R-rs values at specified wavelengths (consistent with the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrophotometer [MERIS]) as the independent variables, supporting the potential for effective monitoring of these features through remote sensing in the future.

Reactive phosphorus: Surface transport under simulated rainfall for different vegetation cover	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL			Portuguese	Article						small rural watersheds; management of the agricultural environment; contaminants from agricultural sources	DIFFERENT SOIL MANAGEMENTS; WATER EROSION; ORGANIC-CARBON; RUNOFF; LOSSES; CORN	Phosphorus is a chemical element considered key to water quality, mainly acting as a trigger of algal blooms. The main source of phosphorus in small rural basins is agriculture practiced in the slopes of the basins. This phosphorus can come in various forms to the water body, but the most striking ones are the total and dissolved reactive phosphorus. The dissolved form has higher risks, because it can cover distances comparatively larger than the reactive phosphorus in suspension which can be deposited along the path. This study sought to determine if different coverage of annual crops can interfere in the transport of these forms of phosphorus, affecting the risk of degradation of water resources of small rural watersheds. Although there was no significant difference between treatments, but seasonality was verified along the experiment representing a growing season. This means that there was also some variation in the level of risk, since, in the first third of the first rains, the risk of entrainment of phosphorus in runoff was higher in relation to rainy periods more distant from the planting/fertilization period, making possible to assess the risk to the watershed in a seasonal way rather than annual.

Based on runoff paddocks and leaching pipes construction, the volumes of runoff and leaching water, and the corresponding concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus were measured and estimated. The results indicated that, under the experimental conditions, N and P losses through runoff and leaching occurred mainly in the period of rain season from June to October, and leaching was the dominating pathways for N loss while runoff was the main pathways for P loss. Compared with the conventional irrigation and fertilization system, under the consistency of crop yields, the drip fertigation system could decrease the total amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus losses through runoff and leaching by 36.4% and 16.5%, and reduce the total amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus consumptions of chemical fertilizer application by 73.4% and 61.1%, respectively.

Water quality is of central importance to the tourism industry, as a minimum level of water clarity is required to make the water attractive for swimming and bathing. Rampant development of coastal resorts in Varna Bay has led to water-quality deterioration because the tourism capacity has expanded without concurrent increases in the capacity to collect and treat sewage. We used a numerical model to simulate the Secchi depth (as a proxy for transparency) as a function of the nitrogen loading and total suspended solids. The SAF proved valuable for illustrating the relationship between bathing water quality and the capacity of sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants, and it was helpful in evaluating policy options, even though it does not yet allow precise quantitative prediction of water quality. Results indicate that a combination of storm water management by sewer system improvement (reducing direct runoff by 80%) with construction and upgrading of wastewater treatment plants to 75% nitrogen removal could achieve the improved water quality needed to prevent a failure of recent major investments in the tourist industry, with consequent loss of jobs and profits.

An integrated coastal zone management approach has become an important requirement of future development plans to protect this fragile bay ecosystem. One of the main indicators of deterioration of the Izmit Bay coastal system is the decreasing water quality resulting from increased nutrient loads from the surrounding land. The consensus during the initial stakeholder meeting confirmed the widespread awareness of this phenomenon and "improvement of water quality in Izmit Bay" was determined as the main policy issue at stake. Public perception of and satisfaction with water quality were measured by a willingness to pay (WTP) survey. The WTP for improved water quality was analyzed using the contingent valuation method. According to the questionnaire survey, 55% of the participants are willing to pay to increase the water quality. Impact of water quality on real-estate values was evaluated by hedonic pricing method, which is suitable for estimating direct and indirect use values of water resources. These results were used in a simulation model to assess coupled ecosystem, social, and economic system functioning of the Izmit Bay in response to various scenarios, and thus, to permit the necessary actions to be taken proactively. Two scenario simulations, for which domestic and runoff nitrogen loads are reduced independently, showed that hypothetical domestic wastewater treatment resulted in an improvement in simulated water transparency. The results suggest that domestic wastewater treatment should be a first priority for local administrations.

Pond-Level Risk Factors Associated with Columnaris Disease on Mississippi Commercial Catfish Farms	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH			English	Article								A large commercial catfish enterprise encompassing over 500 food fish ponds from five farms covering multiple counties in the Mississippi Delta was included in this analysis of columnaris risk factors. A gram-negative bacterium, Flavobacterium columnare, is the cause of columnaris disease and is considered the second-most prevalent bacterial disease in farm-raised catfish. The objective of this study was to determine if pond-level risk factors reported by farm personnel were associated with columnaris disease mortalities. To identify risk factors affecting susceptibility of farm-raised channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus to columnaris disease, a Catfish Management database was developed. Logistic regression was used to model the relationships between probability of columnaris in ponds and risk factors examined. Generalized linear mixed models incorporating hierarchically structured random effects of ponds and one or more fixed-effects risk factors were fitted. In the screening process, each risk factor was evaluated in the basic model as a single fixed-effects factor, and if associated with the outcome (P <= 0.20), was retained for development of multivariable models. Two multivariable logistic regression models were constructed from data collected at the pond level by producers. The first was constructed from data in which water quality was not considered. Pond depth and reduced feed consumption for a 14-d period prior to disease outbreaks measured on a per hectare basis were significantly (P <= 0.05) associated with columnaris disease. The second, in which water quality variables were also considered, pond depth, reduced feed consumption, shorter intervals from stocking to disease outbreaks, and total ammonia nitrogen were significantly (P <= 0.05) associated with columnaris occurrence. This study showed some commonly recorded production variables were associated with columnaris disease outbreaks and, if monitored, could help identify "at risk" ponds before disease outbreaks occur.

J	Li, JM				Li, Junmin			AN OBSERVATION-BASED UNCERTAINTY EVALUATION COUPLING AUTOMATIC CALIBRATION APPROACH FOR ECOLOGICAL MODEL OF SHALLOW LAKE	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN			English	Article						Uncertainty evaluation; Automatic calibration approach; Ecological model; Shallow lake; Stochastic model	WATER-QUALITY; DYNAMIC-MODEL; PHYTOPLANKTON; RESTORATION; ZOOPLANKTON; SENSITIVITY; SIMULATION; MACROPHYTES; STABILITY; REFUGE	Uncertainty evaluation of ecological model is critical for improving prediction and identifying effective management strategies of shallow lakes. In this study, an automatic calibration approach was developed to precisely evaluate the values of uncertainties. In the approach, the inherent and environmental uncertainties are reflected from the evaluation of parameter values and the input of boundary conditions, respectively. By the approach, both the optimal values of parameters and the uncertainty levels of parameters and boundary conditions are accurately calibrated against observation data. The approach was coupled with an ecological model and applied to a case study. Modeling results showed good agreement between simulations and observation data in the total trends as well as the detailed distributions. Comparing with deterministic modeling and arbitrary stochastic modeling, the calibrated stochastic modeling supported by the approach predicted the potential risk of remediation measures in a more reasonable form. These results suggest that the proposed approach and its coupling model are useful tools for uncertainty assessment and environmental management in shallow lake systems.

Then nonlinear functions of water quality and quantity scheduling were constructed by Origin software. The optimal influent load was determined adopting prediction results of the models as constraint conditions of the functions. Thus the water quality and quantity scheduling scheme of the wetland was established. The results show that optimal influent load for Feb. similar to May: the influent water quantity is no more than 8560m(3)/d, CODCr is 25.47mg/l similar to 26.37mg/l, ammonia nitrogen 0.11mg/l similar to 1.0mg/l, TN 10.28mg/l similar to 10.51mg/l, TP 0.16mg/l; for Jun. similar to Sept.: the water quantity is no more than 31750m(3)/d, CODCr is 26mg/l similar to 32.36mg/l, or 37.15mg/l similar to 45.37mg/l, ammonia nitrogen 0.48 mg/l similar to 1.78mg/l, TN 5.15mg/l similar to 6.18mg/l, TP 0.07mg/l similar to 0.09mg/l; for Oct. similar to Dec.: the water quantity is no more than 11070m(3)/d, CODCr is 24.55mg/l similar to 26.91mg/l, ammonia nitrogen no more than 0.75, TN no more than 8.61 mg/l, TP 0.10mg/l similar to 0.12mg/l, or 0.16mg/l similar to 0.17mg/l.

Phosphorus accumulating organisms were enriched at the anaerobic condition for 2h/aerobic for 3h after activated sludge were inoculated. Then denitrifying polyphosphate-accumulating organisms were enriched by inserting an anoxic phase into the aerobic phase. The lengths of anaerobic time, anoxic time and aerobic time were adjusted and the nitrogen and phosphorus removal effect of (AO)(2)SBR system were observed. The (AO)(2)SBR system was started successfully with 80d of training and domesticating. The nitrogen and phosphorus removal effect was performed preferably at the condition of anaerobic(2h)-aerobic(1.5h)-anoxic(1.5h)-aerobic(0.5h). The removal rate of COD, NH4+-N, TN and TP reached 90%, 97%, 88% and 92% respectively. And 33% of energy was saved when aerobic time was shortened from 3h to 2h, while the treating effect dropped off rarely. The results show that (AO)2SBR is applicable for simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal, and the effluent water quality meets the first level B criteria specified in Discharge Standard of Pollutants for Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant(GB 18918-2002). The system can also reach the aim of saving energy and providing theoretical basis for the nitrogen and phosphorus removal in single SBR systems.

Design and testing of a novel hypolimnetic oxygenation system to improve water quality in Lake Bard, California. Lake Reserv Manage. 28:245-254. Hypolimnetic oxygenation, the engineered addition of oxygen gas to the bottom of lakes and reservoirs, can improve water quality by repressing the accumulation of nutrients, metals, and toxic compounds in bottom waters. This study designed and tested an oxygenation system in Lake Bard, California. Hypolimnetic oxygen demand, a key design parameter, was estimated through the combination of sediment-water chamber incubations and numerical analysis of water column dissolved oxygen (DO) profiles. Chamber incubations showed that increased water velocity near the sediment-water interface substantially increased the rate of sediment oxygen uptake, and this observation was incorporated into system sizing. The chamber study also confirmed that maintenance of oxygenated conditions repressed sediment release of phosphate, ammonia, manganese, and sulfide. Phosphorus and manganese release rates were 6-8 mg/m(2)/d and 2-5 mg/m(2)/d under anoxic conditions, respectively, but negligible or negative under oxic conditions. The novel hypolimnetic oxygenation system used a waste product, oxygen-rich off-gas from an ozone contactor at a nearby water treatment plant, to sustainably improve source water quality. The system was tested over a 2 week period in June 2004. Oxygen addition averaged 380 kg/d and increased bottom water DO from 1-2 to 5-6 mg/L with a concurrent drop in water column phosphate and iron, and a delay in sediment release of ammonia. Manganese, with its slow oxidation kinetics, remained in bottom waters during the oxygenation test, indicating that the oxygenation system needs to be turned on earlier in the season to better control manganese accumulation in bottom waters.

This paper describes the preliminary evaluation of the Xinanjiang-Phosphorus (XAJ-P) model for suspended sediment (SS) and phosphorus (P) estimation in the Xitiaoxi catchment in south-eastern China. It estimates the sediment yields and phosphorus loads on a cell-by-cell basis with a daily time step. The results show that an average of 127.4 ton/yr P was exported to the river in the catchment. Spatial distribution of P loads indicates that the non-point source load from arable land had a dominant contribution with an export rate of 1.63 to 4.92 kg/(ha.yr). It is also found that an annual average P load of 63.7 t was exported from point sources to the rivers. P budget analysis indicate that average P input and output were 71.3 kg/(ha.yr) and 46.2 kg/(ha.yr) respectively, while the total P utilization efficiency was 59.3%, leading to an average P surplus of 25.1 kg/(ha.yr) in the arable land of the Xitiaoxi catchment. The application of XAJ-P in the catchment shows that the developed model can be used as a major tool to simulate long-term daily P loads at the catchment scale.

Atmospheric deposition as a source of carbon and nutrients to an alpine catchment of the Colorado Rocky Mountains	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; EXCITATION-EMISSION MATRIX; GREEN LAKES VALLEY; HIGH-ELEVATION; FRONT RANGE; DUST DEPOSITION; NIWOT RIDGE; COMMUNITY COMPOSITION; MEDITERRANEAN REGION; NITROGEN DEPOSITION	Many alpine areas are experiencing deglaciation, biogeochemical changes driven by temperature rise, and changes in atmospheric deposition. There is mounting evidence that the water quality of alpine streams may be related to these changes, including rising atmospheric deposition of carbon (C) and nutrients. Given that barren alpine soils can be severely C limited, atmospheric deposition sources may be an important source of C and nutrients for these environments. We evaluated the magnitude of atmospheric deposition of C and nutrients to an alpine site, the Green Lake 4 catchment in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Using a long-term dataset (2002-2010) of weekly atmospheric wet deposition and snowpack chemistry, we found that volume weighted mean dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were 1.12 +/- 0.19 mg l(-1), and weekly concentrations reached peaks as high at 6-10 mg l(-1) every summer. Total dissolved nitrogen concentration also peaked in the summer, whereas total dissolved phosphorus and calcium concentrations were highest in the spring. To investigate potential sources of C in atmospheric deposition, we evaluated the chemical quality of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and relationships between DOM and other solutes in wet deposition. Relationships between DOC concentration, fluorescence, and nitrate and sulfate concentrations suggest that pollutants from nearby urban and agricultural sources and organic aerosols derived from sub-alpine vegetation may influence high summer DOC wet deposition concentrations. Interestingly, high DOC concentrations were also recorded during 'dust-in-snow' events in the spring, which may reflect an association of DOM with dust. Detailed chemical and spectroscopic analyses conducted for samples collected in 2010 revealed that the DOM in many late spring and summer samples was less aromatic and polydisperse and of lower molecular weight than that of winter and fall samples. Our C budget estimates for the Green Lake 4 catchment illustrated that wet deposition (9.9 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) and dry deposition (6.9 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) were a combined input of approximately 17 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1), which could be as high as 24 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in high dust years. This atmospheric C input approached the C input from microbial autotrophic production in barren soils. Atmospheric wet and dry deposition also contributed 4.3 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), 0.15 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1), and 2.7 kg Ca2+ ha(-1) yr(-1) to this alpine catchment.	[Mladenov, N.; Williams, M.

Tracing the spatial propagation of river inlet water into an agricultural polder area using anthropogenic gadolinium	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							QUALITY; IMPACT; IRRIGATION; HYDROLOGY; NITROGEN	Diverting river water into agricultural areas or nature reserves is a frequently applied management strategy to prevent fresh water shortage. However, the river water might have negative consequences for chemical and ecological water quality in the receiving water bodies. This study aimed to obtain a spatial image of the diverted river water propagation into a hydrologically complex polder area, the polder Quarles van Ufford in The Netherlands. We used anthropogenic gadolinium (Gd-anomaly) as a tracer for river water that was diverted into the polder. A clear reduction in the river water contribution was found between very dry conditions on 5 August 2010 and very wet conditions on 22 October. Despite the large river water impact on 5 August, the diverted river water did not propagate up into the small agricultural headwater ditches. Gadolinium proved to be an effective tracer for diverted river water in a polder system. We applied our results to upgrade the interpretation of water quality monitoring data and to validate an integrated nutrient transport model.

J	Zhang, WT; Rao, YR				Zhang, Weitao; Rao, Yerubandi R.			Application of a eutrophication model for assessing water quality in Lake Winnipeg	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						Eutrophication model; Lake Winnipeg; Cyanobacteria; Phosphorus; Nitrogen; Nutrient reduction	SEDIMENT RESUSPENSION; PHYTOPLANKTON PRODUCTION; NITROGEN; CANADA; INPUT; LIGHT	A eutrophication model using Water Analysis Simulation Program (WASP) has been applied to Lake Winnipeg during the period from 2002 to 2007. The model includes two nutrient cycles (N and P) and three functional phytoplankton groups (non-cyanobacteria, N-fixing cyanobacteria and non-N-fixing cyanobacteria). The model also considers distinct features of the morphological, hydrological, and climate conditions of the South and North Basins. The calibrated and validated results of water quality variables are in good agreement with the observed data of TN, NO3, NH4, TP, PO4, DO, and total chlorophyll-a. The model reproduced qualitative features of phytoplankton communities in space and time, such as cyanobacteria in the North Basin during the late summer and non-cyanobacteria in the South Basin during the spring. The non-N-fixing cyanobacteria showed an increasing trend, even though it occupied smaller percentage than N-fixer within total cyanobacteria. Multiple nutrient-reduction scenarios were examined to assess the potential influence of different N:P loading ratios on the lake ecosystem. A 10% reduction of phosphorus decreased the cyanobacteria percentage in both basins, and reduced peak values of chlorophyll-a concentration during late summer in the North Basin. However, model results indicate that this will promote growth of non-N-fixing cyanobacteria. A reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus loading by 10% will restrict non-N-fixing cyanobacteria. The averaged phytoplankton biomass (expressed as chlorophyll-a concentration) and phytoplankton components suggest that increasing N:P loading ratio (P reduction > 12% and N reduction < 7%) would be effective for improving water quality in Lake Winnipeg.

Some of the world's large lakes, such as Lake Victoria, Lake Tai and Lake Winnipeg, have become eutrophic due to excess nutrients from point and non-point sources. Novel approaches that can prevent excess nutrients from over fertilizing surface water bodies are required. Water quality trading (WQT) is a market mechanism that could cost-effectively provide a means to remediate eutrophication by reducing nutrient loads from point and non-point sources. This paper provides WQT design considerations to remediate water quality within large multi-jurisdictional basins by examining Lake Winnipeg which has become the most eutrophied large lake in the world due to excessive phosphorus loads. The multilevel architecture proposed is designed to simultaneously remediate water quality and encourage integrated water resource management. Inter-sub-basin trading allows for meeting a phosphorus load target for the lake while intra-sub-basin trading allows for meeting phosphorus load targets at the sub-basin outflows. The paper also provides regulatory frameworks (Boundary Waters Treaty, United States Clean Water Act, the Canadian Environmental Protection and the Canada Water Acts) and institutional support (International Joint Commission, United States Environmental Protection Agency and Environment Canada) required to manage an international WQT system within the Lake Winnipeg Basin. To reduce transaction costs a composite market with clearing house and exchange characteristics is likely best suited. By providing design considerations in the form of a multilevel WQT system, this paper makes a contribution towards WQT research within large multi-jurisdictional basins.

However, we have degraded river environment through rapid development in floodplain. In order to make our efforts vital, it is important to understand the structure and function of river ecosystem. In this paper, we focused on denitrification as one of the ecosystem function in the sand bar landscape possesses and its temporal change with landscape transition and change of human activity along a river. The objective of this study was to develop a model that could be used to examine how the nitrogen is trapped and retained by several elements of a sandbar in an alternate bar reach. We also developed a framework to analyze the temporal change in the denitrification by using a numerical simulation, aerial photos, and a water quality information system. The main results of this study are that the temporal change in the denitrification ecosystem function in a sandbar reach can be quantified using the proposed model and the denitrification activity has increased over the past 34 years.

J	Oh, J; Sankarasubramanian, A				Oh, J.; Sankarasubramanian, A.			Interannual hydroclimatic variability and its influence on winter nutrient loadings over the Southeast United States	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							STATISTICAL-MODEL; RIVERS; NITROGEN; PRECIPITATION; OSCILLATION; MANAGEMENT; FORECASTS; PATTERNS; STREAMS; TRENDS	It is well established in the hydroclimatic literature that the interannual variability in seasonal streamflow could be partially explained using climatic precursors such as tropical sea surface temperature (SST) conditions. Similarly, it is widely known that streamflow is the most important predictor in estimating nutrient loadings and the associated concentration. The intent of this study is to bridge these two findings so that nutrient loadings could be predicted using season-ahead climate forecasts forced with forecasted SSTs. By selecting 18 relatively undeveloped basins in the Southeast US (SEUS), we relate winter (January-February-March, JFM) precipitation forecasts that influence the JFM streamflow over the basin to develop winter forecasts of nutrient loadings. For this purpose, we consider two different types of low-dimensional statistical models to predict 3-month ahead nutrient loadings based on retrospective climate forecasts. Split sample validation of the predictive models shows that 18-45% of interannual variability in observed winter nutrient loadings could be predicted even before the beginning of the season for at least 8 stations. Stations that have very high coefficient of determination (> 0.8) in predicting the observed water quality network (WQN) loadings during JFM exhibit significant skill in predicting seasonal total nitrogen (TN) loadings using climate forecasts. Incorporating antecedent flow conditions (December flow) as an additional predictor did not increase the explained variance in these stations, but substantially reduced the root-mean-square error (RMSE) in the predicted loadings. Relating the dominant mode of winter nutrient loadings over 18 stations clearly illustrates the association with El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions. Potential utility of these season-ahead nutrient predictions in developing proactive and adaptive nutrient management strategies is also discussed.

Technical Note: Calibration and validation of geophysical observation models	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							OCEAN; CORN; PHYTOPLANKTON; FREQUENCY	We present a method to calibrate and validate observational models that interrelate remotely sensed energy fluxes to geophysical variables of land and water surfaces. Coincident sets of remote sensing observation of visible and microwave radiations and geophysical data are assembled and subdivided into calibration (Cal) and validation (Val) data sets. Each Cal/Val pair is used to derive the coefficients (from the Cal set) and the accuracy (from the Val set) of the observation model. Combining the results from all Cal/Val pairs provides probability distributions of the model coefficients and model errors. The method is generic and demonstrated using comprehensive matchup sets from two very different disciplines: soil moisture and water quality. The results demonstrate that the method provides robust model coefficients and quantitative measure of the model uncertainty. This approach can be adopted for the calibration/validation of satellite products of land and water surfaces, and the resulting uncertainty can be used as input to data assimilation schemes.

Understanding how sediment and nutrient (or constituent) concentrations vary with land use is critical to understanding the current and future impact of land use change on aquatic ecosystems. Access to appropriate land-use based water quality data is also important for calculating reliable load estimates using water quality models. This study collated published and unpublished runoff, constituent concentration and load data for Australian catchments. Water quality data for total suspended sediments (TSS), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were collated from runoff events with a focus on catchment areas that have a single or majority of the contributing area under one land use. Where possible, information on the dissolved forms of nutrients were also collated. For each data point, information was included on the site location, land use type and condition, contributing catchment area, runoff, laboratory analyses, the number of samples collected over the hydrograph and the mean constituent concentration calculation method. A total of similar to 750 entries were recorded from 514 different geographical sites covering 13 different land uses. We found that the nutrient concentrations collected using "grab" sampling (without a well defined hydrograph) were lower than for sites with gauged auto-samplers although this data set was small and no statistical analysis could be undertaken. There was no statistically significant difference (p <0.05) between data collected at plot and catchment scales for the same land use. This is most likely due to differences in land condition over-shadowing the effects of spatial scale. There was, however, a significant difference in the concentration value for constituent samples collected from sites where >90% of the catchment was represented by a single land use, compared to sites with <90% of the upstream area represented by a single land use. This highlights the need for more single land use water quality data, preferably over a range of spatial scales. Overall, the land uses with the highest median TSS concentrations were mining (similar to 50,000 mg/l), horticulture (similar to 3000 mg/l), dryland cropping (similar to 2000 mg/l), cotton (similar to 600 mg/l) and grazing on native pastures (similar to 300 mg/l). The highest median TN concentrations are from horticulture (similar to 32,000 mu g/l), cotton (similar to 6500 mu g/l), bananas (similar to 2700 mu g/l), grazing on modified pastures (similar to 2200 mu g/l) and sugar (similar to 1700 mu g/l). For TP it is forestry (similar to 5800 mu g/l), horticulture (similar to 1500 mu g/l), bananas (similar to 1400 mu g/l), dryland cropping (similar to 900 mg/l) and grazing on modified pastures (similar to 400 mu g/l). For the dissolved nutrient fractions, the sugarcane land use had the highest concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP). Urban land use had the highest concentrations of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP). This study provides modellers and catchment managers with an increased understanding of the processes involved in estimating constituent concentrations, the data available for use in modelling projects, and the conditions under which they should be applied. Areas requiring more data are also discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

River loads of suspended solids, nitrogen, phosphorus and herbicides delivered to the Great Barrier Reef lagoon	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article						Water quality; River load estimation; Sediment; Nutrient; Herbicides; Great Barrier Reef	WATER-QUALITY; NUTRIENT LOADS; SEDIMENT YIELD; DATA ASSIMILATION; CHESAPEAKE BAY; CATCHMENT; TERRESTRIAL; MANAGEMENT; SCALE; FLUX	Degradation of coastal ecosystems in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon, Australia, has been linked with increased land-based runoff of suspended solids, nutrients and pesticides since European settlement. This study estimated the increase in river loads for all 35 GBR basins, using the best available estimates of pre-European and current loads derived from catchment modelling and monitoring. The mean-annual load to the GBR lagoon for (i) total suspended solids has increased by 5.5 times to 17,000 ktonnes/year, (ii) total nitrogen by 5.7 times to 80,000 tonnes/year, (iii) total phosphorus by 8.9 times to 16,000 tonnes/year, and (iv) PSII herbicides is 30,000 kg/year. The increases in river loads differ across the 10 pollutants and 35 basins examined, reflecting differences in surface runoff, urbanisation, deforestation, agricultural practices, mining and retention by reservoirs. These estimates will facilitate target setting for water quality and desired ecosystem states, and enable prioritisation of critical sources for management.

Towards ecologically relevant targets for river pollutant loads to the Great Barrier Reef	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article						Great Barrier Reef; Water quality; Suspended solids; Nitrogen; Target; Resilience	WATER-QUALITY; NORTH-SEA; LAND-USE; MANAGEMENT; COASTAL; CATCHMENT; SEDIMENT; RUNOFF; LAGOON; EUTROPHICATION	Degradation of coastal ecosystems in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, has been linked with a decline in water quality from land-based runoff. This paper examines the reduction in current end-of-catchment loads required for total suspended solids (TSS) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to achieve GBR water quality guidelines. Based on first-order estimates of sustainable pollutant loads, current TSS and DIN loads would need to be reduced by approximately 7000 ktons/y (41%) and 6000 tons/y (38%), respectively. Next, these estimated reductions for TSS and DIN are compared with Reef Plan targets for anthropogenic sediment (-20% by 2020) and nitrogen (-50% by 2013) loads. If successful, these targets will accomplish approximately 40% of TSS and 92% of DIN load reductions required to achieve sustainable loads to the GBR lagoon. These first-order estimates elucidate the need to establish ecologically relevant targets for river pollutant loads to the GBR for management and policy.

J	Povilaitis, A; Stalnacke, P; Vassiljev, A				Povilaitis, Arvydas; Stalnacke, Per; Vassiljev, Anatoly			Nutrient retention and export to surface waters in Lithuanian and Estonian river basins	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH			English	Article						Estonia; export coefficients; Lithuania; MESAW; nutrients; retention	LAND-USE CHANGE; SOURCE APPORTIONMENT; NITROGEN-RETENTION; PHOSPHORUS; CATCHMENT; WETLANDS; QUALITY; IMPACT; FLUXES; LAKES	The statistical model MESAW was applied to simultaneously estimate export coefficients and retention of nutrients in four Lithuanian and three Estonian river basins (range 946-8,388 km(2)). This modelling approach uses non-linear regression to yield the export coefficients for total nitrogen and total phosphorus losses to surface waters, considering different land-use classes and retention of nutrients in the river network. The model was applied to data from 40 water quality monitoring sites and corresponding sub-basin data on land use, point sources and atmospheric deposition. The results showed that the studied river basins had a high nutrient retention capacity: 67-78 and 24-63% of total nitrogen and total phosphorus inputs remained in surface waters. The estimated retention was large in lakes: 27-59% for nitrogen and 11-31% for phosphorus. In-stream retention was apparently much lower, in the range 11-15% for total N and 3-12% for total P. Retention in lakes was lower in Estonia than in Lithuania due to the locations and smaller areas of the lakes in the Estonian basins. In Estonia, the highest relative retention in lakes was 46% for nitrogen and 35% for phosphorus. In-stream retention was also somewhat lower than in Lithuania, possibly because of the lower temperature in Estonian rivers in summer.

MONITORING THE ECOLOGICAL DIVERSITY OF THE AQUATIC DANUBE DELTA SYSTEMS IN TERMS OF SPATIAL-TEMPORAL RELATIONSHIP	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						environmental protection; the Danube delta; phytoplankton; zooplankton; benthic macroinvertebrates	DYNAMICS	The paper proposed the characterisation of a comparative biological analysis of aquatic ecosystems of the Danube delta in 7 sampling sites: Mahmudia, Murighiol, Saint George branch, artificial channel, Uzlina downstream, pontoon Uzlina and Uzlina upstream for the samplings period (February 2009 June 2010). The preliminary results of analysis for the biotic communities determined from all 7 locations demonstrated the following aspects: in the Mahmudia, Murighiol, Saint George branch, artificial channel, Uzlina downstream, pontoon Uzlina and Uzlina upstream control sections from the phytoplanktonic, zooplankonic and benthic macroinvertebrates components view point, the Danube water system is an eutrophic system equilibrated for class II according to the Norm concerning the reference objectives for the surface water quality classification (Order MMGA No 161/2006); in the Uzlina control section, the phytoplankton is better represented than in the Murighiol control section for numerical density and remanent biomass. Also, dominant species of phytoplankton and zooplankton - for numerical density and remanent biomass are oligo-betamesosaprobic species; concerning the benthic macroinvertebrates there is a quite high diversity, represented by gastropods and lamelibranhiates species, association of the oligocheta together with chironomidae organisms. The researches will be continued in order to assess the seasonal variations and to estimate the value of the trophic basis, in the 7 control sections of the Danube delta biosphere, because the main actions that must be achieved in this areas in order to accomplish a sustainable management are represented by: the reduction of the nutrient charge in the Danube, especially the Danube delta inputs, controlling the punctiform and diffuse pollution sources and the restauration of wetlands, this being the only way to prove the capacity to support and productivity of the entire Danubian system.

Phosphorus mass balance in a surface flow constructed wetland receiving piggery wastewater effluent	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						mass balance; phosphorus; surface flow constructed wetland	NUTRIENTS; RETENTION; REMOVAL; SEDIMENTS; NITROGEN; PLANTS	This research was conducted to investigate the phosphorus forms present in water, soil and sediment and to estimate the phosphorus mass balance in a surface flow constructed wetland (CW). Water quality and sediment samples were collected from each cell along the hydrologic path in the CW from October 2008 to December 2010. At the same time, three dominant plant species (e. g. common reed and cattails) were observed through the measurement of the weight, height and phosphorus content. Based on the results, the orthophosphate constituted 24-34% of total phosphorus in water for each cell. The overall average phosphorus removal efficiency of the CW was approximately 38%. The average inflow and outflow phosphorus loads during the monitoring period were 1,167 kg/yr and 408 kg/yr, respectively. The average phosphorus retention rate was 65%, was mainly contributed by the settling of TP into the bottom sediments (30%). The phosphorus uptake of plants was less than 1%. The estimated phosphorus mass balance was effective in predicting the phosphorus retention and release in the CW treating wastewater. Continuous monitoring is underway to support further assessment of the CW system and design.	[Lee, S. Y.; Maniquiz, M. C.; Choi, J.

J	Sun, C; Wu, HJ				Sun, Chen; Wu, Hongjuan			Pollution from animal husbandry in China: a case study of the Han River Basin	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						agricultural pollution; animal breeding; China; Han River; non-point source pollution; water quality	MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; PHOSPHORUS; WATER	Animal husbandry is one of the major agricultural pollution sources in China. The Xiangyang Reach of the Han River Basin was used as a case study to identify pollutants from animal rearing. The gross amount of pollutants from livestock and poultry rearing in the Xiangyang Reach was estimated using two empirical models with different data sets. The pig, cattle, sheep, and poultry population in 2009 amounted to 2.6, 0.6, 0.5, and 39.2 million head, respectively. The total annual pollutant loads generated from the feces and urine of livestock and poultry were 270,400 t of chemical oxygen demand; 228,900 t of biochemical oxygen demand; 26,500 t of ammonia nitrogen; 16,500 t of total phosphorus; and 63,900 t of total nitrogen. Approximately 12% of these pollutant loads were estimated to enter the Han River through the watershed outlet. Animal breeding has been one of the main pollution sources in this area, followed by domestic sewage and industrial wastewater. Cattle produced the most pollution, with the heaviest pollution load in downtown Xiangyang City. Several recommendations are presented to control the pollution caused by livestock and poultry breeding.

The purpose was to assess the efficiency of different long-term water quality improvement measures in current and future climate and societal settings, targeting nitrogen (N) load reduction. The spatial-dynamic model suite consists of two dynamically linked modules: PCRaster is used for the drainage network and is combined with ExtendSim modules for farming decision making and estuarine N dispersal. Model predictions of annual mean flow and total N concentrations compared well with data available for river and estuary (r(2) >= 0.83). Source apportionment was carried out to societal sectors and administrative regions; both households and agriculture are the major sources of N, with the regions of Flanders and Wallonia contributing most. Load reductions by different measures implemented in the model were comparable (similar to 75% remaining after 30 yr), but costs differed greatly. Increasing domestic sewage connectivity was more effective, at comparatively low cost (47% remaining). The two climate scenarios did not lead to major differences in load compared with the business-as-usual scenario (similar to 88% remaining). Thus, this spatially explicit model of water flow and N fluxes in the Scheldt catchment can be used to compare different long-term policy options for N load reduction to river, estuary, and receiving sea in terms of their effectiveness, cost, and optimal location of implementation.

The contributions of southern African research on different groups of algae and cyanobacteria are discussed. The role of algal and phytoplankton research and the focus shift to cyanobacteria, because of eutrophication in South African aquatic systems, are highlighted, which indicates the different modelling and management methods that have been used and tested. Recommendations are made for future research.

Sediment phosphorus flux in an Oklahoma reservoir suggests reconsideration of watershed management planning. Lake Reserv Manage. 28:59-69. A reservoir model of Lake Wister, Oklahoma, indicated that internal sources dominated phosphorus (P) loading to the waterbody, and that a watershed management plan need not address external P sources. To test this claim, we evaluated internal P loading by measuring sediment oxygen demand (SOD) and quantifying soluble reactive P (SRP) release from sediments to the overlying water column. Sediment cores from 3 sites were incubated at 21 C under quiescent conditions. Average SOD rates were between 9.9 and 22.6 mg/m(2)/h (240-540 mg/m(2)/d) across the three sites, where the shallow headwaters site had the least SOD. Average SRP release rate measurements varied from <0 to 3.30 mg/m(2)/d across the sites, and measurements were greatest under anaerobic conditions in the cores collected from deep water near the dam and the water intake structure. Measured values were an order of magnitude less than those used to calibrate the previous reservoir model. The new data contradict the findings of the earlier reservoir model and suggest that internal P cycling would not be the dominant P source. Thus, external P sources to Lake Wister must be considered in watershed management planning.

Characterization of runoff from various urban catchments at different spatial scales in Beijing, China	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						control strategy; event mean concentration (EMC); runoff quality; storm sewer; urban runoff		In order to investigate the characterization of runoff in storm sewer from various urban catchments, three monitoring systems at different spatial scales have been installed separately. They have been held since July 2010 in urban area of Beijing (China). The monitoring data revealed that chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and NH3-N values significantly exceed the Class V surface water quality standard developed by Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China (MEP). A surface solids buildup and wash off model for small watershed was adopted to analyze and discuss the process of a runoff pollutant discharge. More than a half of pollutant parameters presented a good fit to the model. However, a slightly worse-fit to the wash off model appeared in less than half of the data. Due to the influence of sewer sediments, sewer system characteristics, catchment characteristics, and other reasons, first flush was seldom observed in storm sewer runoff from these three survey areas. Meanwhile, the correlation between TSS and any other pollutant was analyzed according to cumulative load of pollutants in runoff events. An event mean concentrations (EMCs) approach was adopted to quantify the pollution of runoff. EMCs of various pollutants in storm sewer runoff between different rainfall events were slightly higher than the typical values observed in similar areas at home and abroad, according to other studies reported in literature. Based on quantitative analysis, it can be concluded that urban nonpoint source pollution is recognized as the major causes of quality deterioration in the receiving water bodies. This is after the point source pollution has been controlled substantially in Beijing. An integrated strategy, which combines centralized and decentralized control, along with the conditions of meteorology, hydrology, urban planning, existing drainage system, etc., will be an effective and economic approach to urban runoff pollution control.

The daily nitrate-nitrogen concentrations simulated using the HSPF were employed first to obtain daily, weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly average data and then to develop load duration curves for the data with four different temporal scales. The duration curves exhibited high variability in the load estimated using daily data as compared with those based on bi-weekly and monthly data. According to daily data, the nitrate-nitrogen load in the winter was found to be 2,780 kg. The nitrate-nitrogen load decreased with increasing temporal (daily, weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly) scale (commonly used in water quality monitoring) of the data. The coefficient of variation, used to quantify the effect of temporal scale on the load, was found to be linearly and inversely correlated with the logarithm of the time scale. Based on the finding, empirical equations were proposed to extrapolate near real-time data for flow and nitrate-nitrogen, greatly simplifying nutrient monitoring and reducing the cost involved in water quality monitoring.

The simulation of the dynamics of pollutant concentrations throughout the water body was conducted by means of structured discretization of the geometry of Igapo I Lake, together with the finite differences and the finite elements methods. Firstly, the hydrodynamic flow (without the pollutants), modeled by Navier-Stokes and pressure equations, was numerically resolved by the finite differences method, and associated with the fourth order Runge-Kutta procedure. After that, by using the hydrodynamic field velocity, the flow of the reactive species (pollutants) was described through a reaction transport model, restricted to the carbon-nitrogen cycle. The reaction transport model was numerically resolved by the stabilized finite elements method, by means of a semi-discrete formulation. A qualitative analysis of the numerical simulations provided a better understanding of the dynamics of the processes involved in the flow of the reactive species, such as the dynamics of the nitrification process, of the biochemical demand of oxygen and of the level of oxygen dissolved in the water body at Igapo I Lake.

It has been investigated that non-point pollution sources (NPSs) are the main contributor of this water quality drop. NPSs are diverse and hard to identify and therefore they are difficult to estimate. Therefore, Geographical Information Systems (GIS) was used to provide an extensive approach to evaluate land use and other mapping characteristics to explain the spatial distribution of NPSs of contamination in Cameron Highlands. The method to assess pollution sources has been developed using Cameron Highlands Master Plan (2006-2010) for integrating GIS databases, as well as pollution loads in the area of study. The results show highest annual runoff is created by forest, 3.56x10(8) m(3)/yr followed by urban development, 1.46x10(8) m(3)/yr. Furthermore, urban development causes highest BOD load (1.31x10(6) kgBOD/yr) while agricultural activities and forest contribute the highest annual loads for phosphorus (6.91x10(4) kgP/yr) and nitrogen (2.50x10(5) kgN/yr), respectively. Therefore, Non-structural management was recommended for the study area, which includes establish and provide technical advisory services unit, develop demonstration farms and provide incentives to encourage farmers in implementing sustainable agricultural management practices.

The study was carried out in two shrimp ponds: one of them with fresh water, and another with marine water. Chlorophyll-a, total phosphorus, pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, temperature and transparency were verified. Bacterial densities were determined by fluorescence microscopy. A model of the logarithm of the mean as a linear function of observed covariates was carried out. The result is a generalized linear model with Poisson response and link log. Both ponds, characterized as eutrophic environments, presented elevate densities of bacterioplankton (0.51 x 10(8) to 1.72 x 10(8) org mL(-1)), and high concentrations of chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus. The study highlights the importance of the adequate management techniques to maintain the water quality in shrimp ponds and its effluents.

We provide an overview of nutrient fluxes and their temporal and spatial patterns in the Mekong River for 1985-2005. Total inorganic nitrogen fluxes increased significantly, while phosphorus fluxes increased less steeply. The majority of fluxes originated from agricultural and from forest and shrubland areas. Although the Mekong is not yet facing severe water quality problems, the concurrent rapid development can be expected to accelerate nutrient enrichment. There is thus an urgent need to improve water quality monitoring and pollution control measures, and to give water quality issues more weight at the policy level.

Management model for assessment of nitrogen flow from feed to pig manure after storage in Vietnam	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						animal waste; compost; excretion; pig production; simulation	AMMONIA EMISSION; INTENSIFICATION; DIGESTIBILITY; CONSUMPTION; PHOSPHORUS; LOSSES; ENERGY; SLURRY	Nitrogen (N) losses from pig production and the recycling of N from manure to crops can harm the atmosphere, soil and ground water quality. This study intended to build a dynamic management model, adapted to the Vietnamese context, that links the N flow at all stages along the manure management chain from the N in the diets fed to grower-finisher pigs to the application of the manure in the field. The model assesses N contents and losses at each stage of manure management so that application of manure N can be adjusted to ensure optimal fertilizer value, while at the same time minimizing environmental damage. This model provides a tool for examining the N flow on pig farms, to adjust the N content of feeds, the pig population, and to minimize N discharge and emissions. The model is developed using Powersim (R) software and data from feed-excretion, storage and composting experiments. For validation and performance of the model we used sub-datasets from feed-excretion experiments in Denmark and Vietnam that were not used to parameterize in the model. This article presents the development of the model and trial of the model through scenario analyses of pig production in livestock production zones. The objective is that policy makers, extension officers or agricultural advisors will use the model as a support management tool to formulate and adjust manure management practices. This includes assessment of the land carrying capacity in existing livestock production areas and of maximum acceptable manure loads in planned livestock production zones.	[Vu, T. K. V.; Vu, C.

The response surface methodology that was applied with a central composite rotational design and two key operational parameters, flocs biomass concentration and C/N ratio was varied in order to evaluate the system performance and achieve the optimal operational conditions in this study. A polynomial linear regression model was found to quantitatively describe the relationship between the two variables and response values with adequate fitness in the simulate aquaculture bio-flocs systems. The results showed that flocs biomass concentration and operational C/N ratio both had significant impacts on the response objectives, as well as the interactions between them. The optimal results attained from the model indicated that more than 90% TAN removal efficiency was achieved when the flocs biomass concentration and C/N ratio were around 2.0-2.5 (volatile suspended solids, g/l) and 13-16, respectively.

Integrating three lake models into a Phytoplankton Prediction System for Lake Taihu (Taihu PPS) with Python	JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS			English	Article						Lake Taihu; model integration; Phytoplankton Prediction System; Python; Python library	WATER-QUALITY; FRAMEWORK; ECOSYSTEM; ISSUES	In the past decade, much work has been done on integrating different lake models using general frameworks to overcome model incompatibilities. However, a framework may not be flexible enough to support applications in different fields. To overcome this problem, we used Python to integrate three lake models into a Phytoplankton Prediction System for Lake Taihu (Taihu PPS). The system predicts the short-term (1-4 days) distribution of phytoplankton biomass in this large eutrophic lake in China. The object-oriented scripting language Python is used as the so-called 'glue language' (a programming language used for connecting software components). The distinguishing features of Python include rich extension libraries for spatial and temporal modelling, modular software architecture, free licensing and a high performance resulting in short execution time. These features facilitate efficient integration of the three models into Taihu PPS. Advanced tools (e. g. tools for statistics, 3D visualization and model calibration) could be developed in the future with the aid of the continuously updated Python libraries. Taihu PPS simulated phytoplankton biomass well and has already been applied to support decision making.

A review of investigations on diatoms (Bacillariophyta) in Turkish inland waters	NOVA HEDWIGIA			English	Article						Bacillariophyta; diatoms; lakes; reservoirs; rivers; Turkey	SHALLOW HYPERTROPHIC LAKE; DEMIRDOVEN DAM-RESERVOIR; BASIN CENTRAL ANATOLIA; BENTHIC ALGAL FLORA; SEASONAL-VARIATIONS; PHYTOPLANKTON ASSEMBLAGES; OMERLI RESERVOIR; EPIPELIC ALGAE; COMMUNITY RELATIONSHIPS; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS	A compilation/discussion of data published on diatoms in aquatic systems from Turkey is provided based on data ordered according to type of study, type of water body, and river basins within the conterminous Turkish territory. The majority of phycological studies in Turkey focus on phytoplankton seasonal changes in lakes and reservoirs located in lowlands, while only a few studies related to high mountain lakes and lotic systems have been published. Palaeolimnological work is also restricted to some basins, while others have been completely neglected from this perspective. Several studies performed during last decade focus on the application of diatoms to water quality monitoring, a topic that is rapidly gaining popularity among local scientists. The main shortcoming in all the studies is the pervasive use of publications based on European material as identification sources, which may have resulted in force-fitting of Turkish taxa into European-based concepts, thus giving a skewed impression of diversity and an imprecise estimation of the ecological requirements of the different taxa. Additionally, because of current research practices, chiefly by native researchers, the vast majority of publications only contain reports of the most common taxa. Even for these common diatoms, there is a severe lack of supporting information in the form of descriptions, argumentation or illustrations, which makes the elaboration of a catalogue a difficult if not impossible task. The aim of this manuscript is to provide a background for further investigations; it includes an identification of neglected geographical and research areas.

During the research period, maximum of total nutrient emission was in Ganzhou (TN 1.64x10(4)t, TP 0.21x10(4)t), which is followed by Nanchang. Just in tennis of 2009, total nutrient emissions from Ganzhou and Nanchang account for 60% and Nanchang, as a main control station, per capita nutrient emissions increased at the speed of 7.96% and 7.17% in 2008 and 2009, respectively. According to the prediction model, TN and TP emissions from Gan River basin will be 5.25x10(4)t and 0.68x10(4)t, respectively. Meanwhile, point sources still is the principal part of total nutrient emission from Gan River, which will have a negative impact on water quality of estuary and Poyang Lake.

The pollution deteriorates water quality and even causes significant change of the freshwater ecosystem. Management must be strengthened in order to reduce the pollution to secure water supply safety and to maintain healthy ecosystems. This paper investigated the yield of total nitrogen (TN) for different land use types, exemplified in the Xitiaoxi catchment of Lake Taihu basin, where catchment-generated nitrogen pollution is severe. Extensive water quality sampling was performed for different river levels and various land use types. A distributed hydrological model was also employed to simulate the river discharges at locations where flow observation is not available, and the simulated river discharges were used for the calculation of nitrogen yield. It is found that generally the catchment's nitrogen export is still as high as 2.6 t/km(2)/year. The yield for forest is 0.8-1.0 t/km(2)/year, while the yields for arable land and for the river sections immediately downstream of urban area are higher than the average ranging 2.8-3.3 t/km(2)/year. It is also concluded that the hydrological modelling using a spatially distributed model is helpful and essential in obtaining flows at any locations, which can subsequently be used jointly with the water quality data to identify the critical source areas with high nitrogen yields.

EVOLUTION OF AN AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM (THE SUCEAVA RIVER) FOR A 3-YEAR PERIOD IN TERMS OF ECOLOGICAL DYNAMICS	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						water quality; the Suceava river; phytoplankton; zooplankton; benthic macroinvertebrates		The paper presents the ecological diversity dynamics of an emissary (the Suceava river) in 25 control sections along a 3-year sampling period. The preliminary results of analysis for the biotic communities determined from all 25 locations demonstrated the following aspects: in the upstream and downstream control sections, in terms of phytoplanktonic, zooplanktonic and benthic macroinvertebrates components, the Suceava river and its tributaries water is framed in 'very good' and 'good' ecological status according to the Romanian Norm (Order MMGA No 161/2006); in the upstream control sections, the phytoplankton is better represented than in the downstream control sections for numerical density and remanent biomass. Also, dominant species in phytoplankton and zooplankton - for numerical density and remanent biomass - are oligo-betamesosaprobic species; concerning the benthic macroinvertebrates there is a quite high diversity, represented by Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, Diptera species, and association of the Oligocheta together with Chironomidae organisms. The project goal was estimating the value of the trophic basis, in all control sections of the emissary, because the main actions that must be achieved in these areas in order to accomplish a sustainable management are represented by: the reduction of the nutrient charge in the Suceava river, especially its tributaries inputs, this being the only way to prove the capacity to support the productivity of the entire system.

Based on the 1-D steady-state water quality model, the outfalls are generalized, and then we derived the formula for calculating water environmental capacity of each reach. According to the information of water quality, hydrology data and the discharge distribution of the river, we chose COD, ammonia nitrogen and volatile phenol as the main control factors, and some formulas were used to calculate the water environmental capacity of COD, ammonia nitrogen and volatile phenol. From which we got that annual water environmental capacity of COD, ammonia nitrogen and volatile phenol on the studied reach respectively arrive at 1257.897 similar to 1420.928t, 17.873 similar to 26.025t and 1.750 similar to 2.871t under different design terms. It is serious pollution in the Sushui River, combined with the status quo emissions, we found that under different design terms, the annual quantity of pollutants reduction of COD, ammonia nitrogen and volatile phenol arrive at 30.36x10(6)t, 3.257x10(6)t and 0.1745x10(6)t.

Multimetric spatial optimization of switchgrass plantings across a watershed	BIOFUELS BIOPRODUCTS & BIOREFINING-BIOFPR			English	Article						economics; landscape design; sustainability; switchgrass; Tennessee; water quality	EUTROPHICATION; BIOFUELS; BIOMASS; SUSTAINABILITY; AGRICULTURE; TRANSPORT; STREAMS; ENERGY; CARBON; CROPS	The increasing demand for bioenergy crops presents our society with the opportunity to design more sustainable landscapes. We have created a Biomass Location for Optimal Sustainability Model (BLOSM) to test the hypothesis that landscape design of cellulosic bioenergy crop plantings may simultaneously improve water quality (i.e. decrease concentrations of sediment, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen) and increase profits for farmer-producers while achieving a feedstock-production goal. BLOSM was run using six scenarios to identify switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) planting locations that might supply a commercial-scale biorefinery planned for the Lower Little Tennessee (LLT) watershed. Each scenario sought to achieve different sustainability goals: improving water quality through reduced nitrogen, phosphorus, or sediment concentrations; maximizing profit; a balance of these conditions; or a balance of these conditions with the additional constraint of converting no more than 25% of agricultural land. Scenario results were compared to a baseline case of no land-use conversion. BLOSM results indicate that a combined economic and environmental optimization approach can achieve multiple objectives simultaneously when a small proportion (1.3%) of the LLT watershed is planted with perennial switchgrass. The multimetric optimization approach described here can be used as a research tool to consider bioenergy plantings for other feedstocks, sustainability criteria, and regions.
