J	Johnes, P; Moss, B; Phillips, G				Johnes, P; Moss, B; Phillips, G			The determination of total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations in freshwaters from land use, stock headage and population data: Testing of a model for use in conservation and water quality management	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article							FERTILIZER NITROGEN; LOSSES	1. Nutrient concentrations (particularly N and P) determine the extent to which water bodies are or may become entrophic. Direct determination of nutrient content on a wide scale is labour intensive but the main sources of N and P are well known. This paper describes and tests an export coefficient model for prediction of total N and total P from: (i) land use, stock headage and human population; (ii) the export rates of N and P from these sources; and (iii) the river discharge. Such a model might be used to forecast the effects of changes in land use in the future and to hindcast past water quality to establish comparative or baseline states for the monitoring of change. 2. The model has been calibrated against observed data for 1988 and validated against sets of observed data for a sequence of earlier years in ten British catchments varying from uplands through rolling, fertile lowlands to the flat topography of East Anglia. 3. The model predicted total N and total P concentrations with high precision (> 95% of the variance in observed data explained). It has been used in two forms: the first on a specific catchment basis; the second for a larger natural region which contains the catchment with the assumption that all catchments within that region will be similar. Both models gave similar results with little loss of precision in the latter case. This implies that it will be possible to describe the overall pattern of nutrient export in the UK with only a fraction of the effort needed to carry out the calculations for each individual water body. 4. Comparison between land use, stock headage, population numbers and nutrient export for the ten catchments in the pre-war year of 1931, and for 1970 and 1988 show that there has been a substantial loss of rough grazing to fertilized temporary and permanent grasslands, an increase in the hectarage devoted to arable, consistent increases in the stocking of cattle and sheep and a marked movement of humans to these rural catchments. 5. All of these trends have increased the flows of nutrients with more than a doubling of both total N and total P loads during the period. On average in these rural catchments, stock wastes have been the greatest contributors to both N and P exports, with cultivation The next most important source of N and people of P. Ratios of N to P were high in 1931 and remain little changed so that, in these catchments, phosphorus continues to be the nutrient most likely to control algal crops in standing waters supplied by the rivers studied.

Total tissue nitrogen (N) content, pigments, and amino acids of the red alga Gracilaria edulis (Ginelin) Silva were compared to N source and availability in laboratory and field incubations to identify responses that would serve as bioindicators of N. Field-collected algae were preincubated (6-8 wk) in low-nutrient seawater to deplete their luxury reserves of N. Incubations were then conducted for periods of 3 d in laboratory aquaria (N-spiked seawater) and in the field using macroalgal incubation chambers. After incubation in different N sources (NH4+, NO3-, and urea) in laboratory aquaria, photosynthetic pigments (phycoerythrin and chlorophyll a) and total tissue N increased, in response to increasing [NH4+] but not to [NO3-] or [urea]. Incubation in two ranges of [NH4+], one from 0 to 80 mu M and the other from 0 to 800 mu M, in laboratory aquaria increased the total amino acid pool. Citrulline concentrations were the most responsive to [NH4+] (r(2) = 0.84). NH4+ source treatments produced increases in citrulline, phenylalanine, serine, and free NH4+ and decreases in alanine; NO3- treatments produced increases in glutamic acid, citrulline, and alanine; and urea treatments produced increases in free NH4+ and decreases in phenylalanine and serine. The observed variations in amino acid content facilitated the development of an index for each N source based on relative concentrations of various amino acids (i.e. metabolic profiling). Gracilaria edulis was incubated along a field N gradient in the Brisbane River (three sites) and Moreton Bay (four sites), Queensland, Australia. Both phycoerythrin and tissue N appeared to respond equally to NH4+ and NO3- availability in the field. N source indices, based on amino acid concentration, were effective predictors of both [NH4+] and [NO3-] over a wide range of concentrations along the field gradient. Macroalgal physiological responses, particularly amino acid content, to changes in source and availability of N appear to be useful as sensitive bioindicators of N.

Field and laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the P assimilatory capacity of a stream (Otter Creek) in the Taylor Creek/Nubbin Slough Basin located north of Lake Okeechobee, Florida. Dominant soils in this basin are sandy Spodosols; landuse is primarily dairy farms and beef cattle pastures. Estimates of P assimilation show that sediments assimilate approximately 5 percent of the P load. Phosphorus assimilation rates in the stream were estimated using first-order relationships based on the total P concentration of the water column as a function of distance from the primary source. This method assumes minimal lateral inputs. Stream lengths required for one turnover in P assimilation were estimated to be in the range of 3-16 km. Laboratory studies using intact sediment cores indicated a P assimilation rate of 0.025 m day(-1), and equilibrium P concentration of 0.16 +/- 0.03 mg L(-1) in the water column. Dissolved P concentration gradients in the sediments showed upward flux of P at water column P concentration of <0.16 mg L(-1). Approximately 56-77 percent of the P assimilated in the above-ground vegetation during active growth was released or translocated within six months of senesence, suggesting short-term storage in above-ground vegetation. Bottom sediments and recalcitrant detrital plant tissue provide for long-term P assimilation in the creek. Although stream sediments have the potential to adsorb P, high flow rate and low contact period between water and sediment limits this process.

J	James, RT; Havens, KE				James, RT; Havens, KE			Algal bloom probability in a large subtropical lake	WATER RESOURCES BULLETIN			English	Article						water quality; algal bloom probability; nitrogen; phosphorus; stage; temperature; wind; solar radiation; logistic regression	CHLOROPHYLL; PHOSPHORUS; FLORIDA; PHYTOPLANKTON; OKEECHOBEE; USA	Algal blooms, defined as chlorophyll a concentrations greater than 40 mu g l(-1), are common in Lake Okeechobee, Florida. Using logistic regression techniques, we have developed equations that relate limnological variables to algal bloom occurrence in four distinct open-water regions of this large shallow lake: central pelagic, northwest, southwest, and a transition region between the western and pelagic regions. Wind velocity and total phosphorus, which are closely related to resuspended material in the central region, are negatively related to algal bloom occurrence there. In the transition region, algal bloom occurrence is positively related to total nitrogen and wind velocity. Algal bloom occurrence is strongly and positively related to total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations in the western regions. The logistic regression model predicts an algal bloom probability greater than 95 percent in the northwest region when total phosphorus exceeds 0.10 mg l(-1) and total nitrogen exceeds 2.5 mg l(-1). In the southwest region the model predicts algal bloom probability of 100 percent when total phosphorus exceeds 0.10 mg l(-1) and total nitrogen exceeds 2.8 mg l(-1). Given 1994 mean total phosphorus concentrations of 0.05 and 0.04 mg l(-1) in the northwest and southwest regions, respectively, total nitrogen would have to remain below 1.32 and 1.43 mg l(-1), respectively, to keep the algal bloom probability below 10 percent. Because the lake is heterogenous, such nutrient standards should be considered on an in-lake regional basis for Lake Okeechobee.

A fish farm on the West Coast of Scotland was visited regularly during a two-year period to determine inflow and outflow water quality. Waste output budgets of suspended solids (SS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total ammonia nitrogen (TAN = NH3+NH4+), dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) and total phosphorus (TP) were produced. The annual waste loadings obtained were 71 kg TN t fish(-1) yr(-1) (one year of data only), 10.9-11.1 kg TP t fish(-1) yr(-1), 1.2-2.1 kg DRP t fish(-1) yr(-1), 422-485 kg BOD5 t fish(-1) yr(-1), 327-337 kg SS t fish(-1) yr(-1), and 30-35 kg TAN-N t fish(-1) yr(-1). Simple linear regression models relating waste parameter production to water temperature and feeding regime were developed. When compared to existing data for other salmonid production systems, greater ranges of daily waste loadings were observed. Wide variations in concentrations of these parameters during a daily cycle were also observed, suggesting that mass balance estimates of waste production will provide more robust estimates of waste output than frequent monitoring of outflow water quality.

The major component is a pollutant transport and fate model (a modified EUTROMOD) with an integrated uncertainty analysis utilizing a two-phase Monte Carlo procedure. The uncertainty analysis methodology distinguishes between knowledge uncertainty and stochastic variability. The model assesses the ecological risk of lentic (lake) ecosystems in response to the stress of excess phosphorus resulting in eutrophication. The methodology and model were tested on the Wister Lake watershed in Oklahoma with the lake and its trophic state as the endpoint for ecological risk assessment. A geographic information system was used to store, manage, and manipulate spatially referenced data for model input.

J	White, A; Stone, M				White, A; Stone, M			Spatial variation and distribution of phosphorus forms in bottom sediments of two Canadian Shield Lakes	CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN			English	Article							PHOSPHATE ADSORPTION; SPECIATION; CHEMISTRY	Nutrient dynamics in lake systems are influenced by the loading of sediment-associated phosphorus (P) from both internal and external sources. Despite efforts to control lake productivity through reductions in external P loading, water quality problems persist in some lakes due to high internal loading of P from bottom sediment. The present study examines the spatial distribution of chemically defined P forms (NH4Cl-RP, BD-RP, NaOH-RP, HCl-RP, and NaOH(85)-RP) in bottom sediments of two noncalcareous Canadian Shield Lakes. Sediment P data are related to some of the physical and chemical variables that control internal P loading in lakes. The BD-RP and NaOH-RP forms are related to water depth and nonresidual iron and aluminum content of sediment Approximately 80% of the total extractable P in the Muldrew Lakes sediment was bioavailable P (NH4Co-RP + ED - RP + NaOH - RP), which is about twice that reported in the literature for calcareous lakes. In order to model P cycling in the Muldrew Lakes, further research is required to determine the internal supply of P from the lakes' sediments and potential anthropogenic inputs of P from private sewage disposal systems.

J	Weller, CM; Watzin, MC; Wang, D				Weller, CM; Watzin, MC; Wang, D			Role of wetlands in reducing phosphorus loading to surface water in eight watersheds in the lake champlain basin	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						wetlands; phosphorus; landscape; regression model; riparian; Vermont	NUTRIENT RETENTION; QUALITY; PERSPECTIVE; CAPACITY; EXPORT	A landscape-level approach was applied to eight rural watersheds to assess the role that wetlands play in reducing phosphorus loading to surface waters in the Lake Champlain Basin. Variables summarizing various characteristics of wetlands within a watershed were calculated using a geographic information system and then compared to measured phosphorus loading through multiple regression analyses. The inclusion of a variable based on the area of riparian wetlands located along low- and medium-order streams in conjunction with the area of agricultural and nonwetland forested lands explained 88% of the variance in phosphorus loading to surface waters. The best fit model coefficients (P-load = 0.86Ag + 0.64For - 30Ripwet + 160) suggest that a hectare of riparian wetland may be many times more important in reducing phosphorus than an agricultural hectare is in producing phosphorus. These results provide additional support for the concept that protection of riparian wetlands is an important management strategy for controlling stream water quality in multiuse landscapes.

The lower limit of seagrass depth distribution was controlled by light availability. Both species grew to the same maximum depth, indicating they have similar minimum light requirements. Based on average annual values of K(d)PAR, estimates of seagrass maximum light requirements ranged from 24% to 37% of the light just beneath the water surface (I-0), much higher than a photic zone for many phytoplankton and macroalgae (1-5% incident light). In less transparent waters of Hobe Sound, where turbidity (NTU) and color (Pt-Co) had their highest concentrations, minimum light requirements for growth were greatest. These results suggest that more sophisticated optical models are needed to identify specific water quality constituents affecting the light environment of seagrasses. Water quality criteria and standard needed to protect seagrasses from decreasing water transparency must be based on parameters that can be routinely and reasonably managed.

J	Blom, HA				Blom, HA			Indirect measurement of key water quality parameters in sewage treatment plants	JOURNAL OF CHEMOMETRICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th Scandinavian Symposium on Chemometrics	JUN, 1995	LUND, SWEDEN			sewage; total phosphorus; multivariate modelling; indirect measurement		Many variables are regularly measured in frequently taken water samples from sewage treatment plants. This results in large data sets with associated high costs. The total phosphorus in the sewage is of great importance since it is an indicator of the total pollution concentration, but no direct on-line analyser is available. This paper concentrates on finding an indirect model for total phosphorus content (tot-P) based on other variables routinely analysed in inlet water to a Norwegian sewage treatment plant. Data from 1993 were used for calibration and the developed models were validated with data from 1994. A PLS model for tot-P based on eight X-variables gave the lowest test set RMSEP (0.35). Models based on fewer X-variables gave higher RMSEP, indicating that more X-variables stabilize the models. For practical use a model for tot-P based on orthophosphate, total organic carbon and suspended solids seems to be a good compromise between simplicity and predictability. With this model the total phosphorus content was predicted with an average deviation (RMSEP) of 0.45 mgPl(-1) from the measured values, giving a relative precision of 20%. Since the X-variables in the model can be measured on-line, this model can be used as an input for coagulant dosing in the sewage treatment plant and for process control. For this purpose the 20% relative precision is quite acceptable. Preliminary results of PLS models for alkalinity, chemical oxygen demand and biological oxygen demand indicate that useful models can also be developed for these Y-variables. The use of these PLS models has a substantial cost saving potential. They may replace traditional chemical analysis, speed up the time from sampling to results and represent a possible input to on-line process control. (C) 1996 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The goal was to establish the influence of natural processes (climate, fire, and bison grazing) on N transport and concentration in streams. Streams were characterized by variable flow, under conditions that included an extreme flood and a drought during which all channels were dry for over a year. The estimated groundwater/stream water discharge ratio varied between 0.15 to 6.41. Annual N transport by streams, averaged across all watersheds and years, was 0.16 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Annual N transport per unit area also increased as the watershed area increased and as precipitation increased. Total annual transport of N from the prairie via streams ranged from 0.01 to 6.0% of the N input from precipitation. Nitrate and total N concentrations in surface water decreased (P < 0.001, r values ranged from 0.14-0.26) as length of time since last fire increased. Increased watershed area was correlated negatively (P < 0.0001) to stream water concentrations of NO3--N and total N (r values = -0.43 and -0.20, respectively). Low N concentration is typical of these streams, with NH4+-N concentrations below 1.0 mu g L(-1), NO3--N ranging from below 1.4 to 392 mu g L(-1), and total N from 3.0 to 714 mu g L(-1). These data provide an important baseline for evaluating N transport and stream water quality from unfertilized grasslands.

J	Johnes, PJ				Johnes, PJ			Evaluation and management of the impact of land use change on the nitrogen and phosphorus load delivered to surface waters: The export coefficient modelling approach	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article							NITRATE; LAKE	A manageable, relatively inexpensive model was constructed to predict the loss of nitrogen and phosphorus from a complex catchment to its drainage system. The model used an export coefficient approach, calculating the total nitrogen (N) and total phosphorus (P) load delivered annually to a water body as the sum of the individual loads exported from each nutrient source in its catchment. The export coefficient modelling approach permits scaling up from plot-scale experiments to the catchment scale, allowing application of findings from field experimental studies at a suitable scale for catchment management. The catchment of the River Windrush, a tributary of the River Thames, UK, was selected as the initial study site. The Windrush model predicted nitrogen and phosphorus loading within 2% of observed total nitrogen load and 0.5% of observed total phosphorus load in 1989. The export coefficient modelling approach was then validated by application in a second research basin, the catchment of Slapton Ley, south Devon, which has markedly different catchment hydrology and land use. The Slapton model was calibrated within 2% of observed total nitrogen load and 2.5% of observed total phosphorus load in 1986. Both models proved sensitive to the impact of temporal changes in land use and management on water quality in both catchments, and were therefore used to evaluate the potential impact of proposed pollution control strategies on the nutrient loading delivered to the River Windrush and Slapton Ley.

J	Schleich, J; White, D; Stephenson, K				Schleich, J; White, D; Stephenson, K			Cost implications in achieving alternative water quality targets	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							NONPOINT	Excessive nutrient loading poses significant water quality problems in many water bodies across the country. An important question that must be addressed when nutrient reduction policies are devised is where nutrient reduction targets will be applied within the watershed. This paper examines the cost implications of establishing three possible nutrient reduction targets in different locations along the Fox-Wolf River basin in northeast Wisconsin. A linear programming model calculates the total cost of achieving a 50% phosphorus load reduction target established in various locations throughout the basin. Two strategies establish phosphorus reduction targets for each of the 41 subwatersheds, and the third approach establishes a single 50% target reduction at Green Bay for the entire watershed. The results indicate that achieving target phosphorus reductions at the subwatershed level is over 4 times more expensive than achieving the same percentage phosphorus reduction for the watershed as a whole.

J	Haamer, J				Haamer, J			Improving water quality in a eutrophied fjord system with mussel farming	AMBIO			English	Article							CULTURE	The flow of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in an eutrophied fjord system on the Swedish west coast has been studied. The aim was to identify possibilities for improving water quality through mussel cultivation. It is suggested that off-bottom mussel farms should be introduced in the fjords as extra filters, to convert passing particulate-bound nutrients into mussel meat and into mussel faeces that will form sediment under the farms. Nutrients will be removed from the fjords when the mussels are harvested, and the enriched sediments under the farms can be dredged up. Mussels are produced commercially in Sweden and the nutrient removing process could become more effective and economically viable than the methods used today. Using an empirical model it was shown that mussel farms covering 1%-2.4% of the fjord surface water DIN concentrations in the water flowing out of the fjords will be lowered by 20%, i.e. almost to the same level as DIN levels in the Skagerrak. The biological oxygen demand (BOD) in the deep basin waters, below sill depth, could be lowered by 26%. Decreased BOD could imply improved survival opportunities for higher life in the deep basins if oxygen concentrations are increased. It is also shown that if mussel farms are located so that faeces from the farms accumulate in the deep basins for more than a decade, the net effect of the farms will be increased BOD in the basin water. In addition to this type of extreme situation, the impact on the ecosystem due to mussel cultivation appears to be positive even when mussel sediments are not dredged up.

Two methods of modelling, namely the best subset model and the stepwise regression method based on R(2) and F values, are described. The best subset modelling procedure enables comparison between full model (containing all the independent variables) and subset models (containing subsets of independent variables). For correlated independent variables, the best subset modelling procedure is shown to provide a better model than the stepwise regression procedure. The statistical modelling results indicate that suspended solids play an important role in the prediction of phosphorus levels and consequently decreasing suspended solids would decrease the growth of aquatic plants in the Grand River Basin.

Our goal was to develop a simple model that would account for spatial pattern in topography and land use using geographic information system (GIS) databases. We estimated areas of the watershed that strongly contributed to P loading by approximating overland flow, and modeled annual P loading by fitting three parameters to data obtained by stream monitoring. We calibrated the model using P loading data from two years of contrasting annual precipitation for Lake Mendota, a Wisconsin eutrophic lake in a watershed dominated by agriculture and urban lands. Land-use scenarios were developed to estimate annual P loading from pre-settlement and future land uses. As much as half of the Lake Mendota watershed did not contribute significantly to annual P loading. The greatest contribution to loading came from a heterogeneous riparian corridor that varied in width from 0.1 km to approximate to 6 km depending on topography and runoff conditions. We estimate that loading from pre-settlement land use was one-sixth of the loading from present land use. A future scenario, representing an 80% increase in existing urban land (from 9 to 16% of total watershed area, which would be reached in 30 yr with current land-use trends), showed only modest increases in annual P loading but possible significant effects on water quality. If the watershed were to become entirely urbanized, P loading to the lake would double and potential effects on water quality would be severe. Changes in P loading were strongest with conversions of undisturbed vegetated lands, especially riparian areas, to either urban or agricultural uses. Variability in total annual rainfall leads to variability in the riparian area that affects P loading, with implications for policies intended to control nonpoint nutrient inputs.

The formulation of STREAM was based on the moving segment approach in the cell-in-series (CIS) system where a stream is assumed to be a series of completely mixed flow reactors. Major constituents included in STREAM are dissolved oxygen (DO), 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD,), suspended solids (SS), coliform bacteria, nitrogen species, phosphorus species, and phytoplankton. Dissolved oxygen change caused by sediment oxygen demand (SOD) and respiration and photosynthesis of periphyton and macrophytes are included in the model structure. STREAM was programmed in BASIC and can be executed on an MS-DOS personal computer. STREAM was designed for implementation with EGA/VGA colour graphics. The model results and the data are displayed on the computer screen and the output device in a graphic format. A demonstration application is presented to validate the STREAM model. The results indicate that the STREAM model could effectively simulate water quality of steep and shallow streams where longitudinal dispersive transport is negligible.

J	Culberson, SD; Piedrahita, RH				Culberson, SD; Piedrahita, RH			Aquaculture pond ecosystem model: Temperature and dissolved oxygen prediction - Mechanism and application	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						oxygen; pond; stratification; temperature	FISH PONDS; GROWTH; PHYTOPLANKTON; LAKES	Accurate characterization of temperature and dissolved oxygen stratification in ponds used for aquaculture is of critical importance in understanding how these ponds may be constructed, oriented, or otherwise managed biophysically when one wishes to provide optimal environmental conditions for the organisms being cultured. While field studies can provide characterizations of water quality stratification at a single locale, to date there have been few attempts at developing reliable models which can be used at a variety of sites after initialization with appropriate local geographic and atmospheric data. In conjunction with the Pond Dynamics/Aquaculture Collaborative Research Support Program (PD/A CRSP), the authors have developed a water quality model (the Aquaculture Pond Ecosystem Model, A.P.E.M.) which predicts temperature and dissolved oxygen stratification at several sites, including Thailand, Rwanda, and Honduras. Advances in model structure and reduction of data requirements relative to previous models reflect the desire to provide for culturists the ability to predict stratification events with commonly available data, obtained either by hand or from a simple weather station located at or near the pond site. Strategies used for dealing with the reduced data sets, and the associated assumptions made, are also presented. Lastly, a series of simulation runs is performed to assess the quantitative effects on temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration generated by varying pond depth and phytoplankton density input values.

J	Nilsson, MB; Dabakk, E; Korsman, T; Renberg, I				Nilsson, MB; Dabakk, E; Korsman, T; Renberg, I			Quantifying relationships between near-infrared reflectance spectra of lake sediments and water chemistry	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							COLUMBIA CANADA LAKES; TOTAL PHOSPHORUS; SPECTROSCOPY; DIATOMS; MODEL; PH	One of the most useful approaches to long-term monitoring of aquatic systems is the analysis of lake sediments. Biological indicators, such as diatoms, preserved in the sediments are widely used. We suggest that use of near-infrared reflectance (NIR) spectroscopy of lake sediments could become a rapid and cost-effective technique for environmental monitoring to follow long-term changes in water quality. NIR spectra of surface sediments from Swedish lakes were used to establish relationships between sediment properties and measured lake water chemistry. Predictive models for inferring total phosphorus (TP), pH, and total organic carbon (TOC) from sediment NIR data were developed using partial least squares regression. The model for inferring lake water TP (n = 33 lakes) captured 83% of the variance, while the explained variance for pH (n = 52 lakes) and TOC (n = 25 lakes) was 85 and 68%, respectively. We also used the TP model to evaluate the effect of inaccuracy in measured lake water chemistry for the model performance, i.e., the amount of explained variance. The inaccuracy in measured lake water chemistry corresponds to 10.5% of the total variance in the model. The highest possible variance to model then being 89.5%. This evaluation indicated that the obtained modeled variance almost equaled the variance possible to model, which suggests that further improvement of the models should be focused on enlargement of the calibration data set to include more lake types.

As quantitative information on historical changes in fish community structure is difficult to obtain directly from fish remains in lake sediments, transfer function for planktivorous fish abundance has been developed based on zooplankton remains in surface sediment (upper 1 cm). The transfer function was derived using weighted average regression and calibration against contemporary data on planktivorous fish catch per unit effort (PF-CPUE) in multiple mesh size gill nets. Zooplankton remains were chosen because zooplankton community structure in lakes is highly sensitive to changes in fish predation pressure. The calibration data set consisted of thirty lakes differing in PF-CPUE (range 18-369 fish net(-1)), epilimnion total phosphorus (range 0.025-1.28 mg P l(-1)) and submerged macrophyte coverage (0-57%). 2. Correlation of log-transformed PF-CPUE, total phosphorus and submerged macrophyte coverage v the percentage abundance in the sediment of the dominant cladocerans and rotifers revealed that the typical pelagic species correlated most highly to PF-CPUE, while the littoral species correlated most highly to submerged macrophyte coverage. Consequently, only pelagic species were taken into consideration when establishing the fish transfer function. 3. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that the pelagic zooplankton assemblage was highly significantly related to PF-CPUE (axis 1), whereas the influence of total phosphorus and submerged macrophyte coverage was insignificant. Predicted PF-CPUE based on weighted average regression without (WA) and with (WA(tol)) downweighting of zooplankton species tolerance correlated significantly with the observed values (r(2) = 0.64 and 0.60 and RMSE = 0.54 and 0.56, respectively). A marginally better relationship (r(2) = 0.67) was obtained using WA maximum likelihood estimated optima and tolerance. 4. It is now possible, quantitatively, to reconstruct the historical development in planktivorous fish abundance based on zooplankton fossil records. As good relationships exist between contemporary PF-CPUE data and indicators such as the zooplankton/phytoplankton biomass ratio, Secchi depth and the maximum depth distribution of submerged macrophytes, it is now also possible to derive information on past changes in lake water quality and trophic structure. It will probably prove possible further to improve the transfer function by including other invertebrate remains, e.g. chironomids, Chaoborus, snails, etc., and its scope could be widened by including deeper lakes, more oligotrophic lakes, more acidic lakes and lakes with extensive submerged macrophyte coverage (in the latter case to enable use of the information in the fossil record on plant-associated cladocerans).

J	Poiani, KA; Bedford, BL; Merrill, MD				Poiani, KA; Bedford, BL; Merrill, MD			A GIS-based index for relating landscape characteristics to potential nitrogen leaching to wetlands	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY			English	Article						wetlands; non-point source pollution; nitrogen; watershed; leaching; geographic information system; landscape; groundwater	GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; NONPOINT-SOURCE POLLUTION; TEMPERATE FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; JERSEY PINE BARRENS; WATER-QUALITY; GROUND-WATER; RIPARIAN FORESTS; DENITRIFICATION; NITRATE; DYNAMICS	We developed a spatially-explicit, quantitative Nitrogen Leaching Index to assess the potential for non-point source subsurface nitrogen pollution to wetlands. The index was based on the leaching potential of the watershed soils, the amount of nitrogen available for leaching, and the spatial position of nitrogen sources in the watershed. A raster or cell-based geographic information system (GIS) was used to estimate the necessary data inputs for calculating the index, such as soil hydrologic group, land use/soil type combination, groundwater residence time, and location of septic systems. The Total and Average Watershed Nitrogen Leaching Index (TWNLI and AWNLI) were calculated by summing and averaging, respectively, individual cell contributions over a watershed. Analysis of nine wetland watersheds in central New York state, USA, with mixed forest and agricultural land uses illustrated the use of the index for identifying and ranking wetlands with potential nitrogen pollution. Results showed that the spatial characteristics of a watershed potentially can effect subsurface nitrogen delivery to groundwater-dominated wetlands. The use of an index based on watershed soils, topography, and land use may be useful for assessing potential nitrogen pollution to wetlands at a regional scale.

J	Bachman, LJ; Phillips, PJ				Bachman, LJ; Phillips, PJ			Hydrologic landscapes on the Delmarva Peninsula .2. Estimates of base-flow nitrogen load to Chesapeake Bay	WATER RESOURCES BULLETIN			English	Article						water quality; watershed analysis; landscape analysis; surface water hydrology	COASTAL-PLAIN; CHEMISTRY; DELAWARE	Base-flow samples were collected from 47 sampling sites for four seasons from 1990-91 on the Delmarva Peninsula in Delaware and Maryland to relate stream chemistry to a ''hydrologic landscape'' and season. Two hydrologic landscapes were determined: (1) a well-drained landscape, characterized by a combination of a low percentage of forest cover, a low percentage of poorly drained soil, and elevated channel slope; and (2) poorly drained landscape, characterized by a combination of an elevated percentage of forest cover, an elevated percentage of poorly drained soil, and low channel slope. Concentrations of nitrogen were significantly related to the hydrologic landscape. Nitrogen concentrations tended to be higher in well-drained landscapes than in poorly drained ones. The highest instantaneous nitrogen yields occurred in well-drained landscapes during the winter. These yields were extrapolated over the part of the study area draining to Chesapeake Bay in order to provide a rough estimate of nitrogen load from base flow to the Bay and its estuarine tributaries. This estimate was compared to an estimate made by extrapolating from an existing long-term monitoring station. The load estimate from the stream survey data was 5 X 10(6) kg of N per year, which was about four times the estimate made from the existing long-term monitoring station. The stream-survey estimate of base flow represents about 40 percent of the total nitrogen load that enters the Bay and estuarine tributaries from all sources in the study area.

The system cultures gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata), using a seaweed biofilter (Ulva lactuca) to maintain water quality, reduce the flow-through rate of seawater, and reduce the nutrient load in effluents. The model describes the production, transfer, transformations, and losses of inorganic N in the system, in a relatively simple compartment model framework. The model was able to match very closely the experimental data on which it is based. Moreover, the model was able to predict the system's behavior in two additional experiments, which provided independent tests of the model under nonstandard operating conditions (reduced food input and reduced water recirculation rate). The success of the model beyond the range of conditions used in its construction suggests that the model provides a valid mechanistic description of the essential processes affecting inorganic N in the system. Sensitivity analysis of the model indicates that levels of ammonia-N and oxidized N in the system were most strongly affected by the rates of ammonia-N excretion by the fish and ammonia-N uptake by the seaweed, followed by the water inflow and recirculation rates, Sensitivities to internal transformation rate parameters were lower, which might explain the relative seasonal constancy of the system. Simulation experiments indicate that the experimental system could support much higher stocking densities of fish without exceeding tolerable levels of ammonia-N.

J	Hurley, MA; Currie, JE; Gough, J; Butterwick, C				Hurley, MA; Currie, JE; Gough, J; Butterwick, C			A framework for the analysis of Harmonised Monitoring Scheme data for England and Wales	ENVIRONMETRICS			English	Article						water quality; harmonised monitoring; limits of detection; long-term change; environmental change; Wolynetz algorithm		The Harmonised Monitoring Scheme (HIMS) records are the best long-term data sets for river water quality in Britain, A simple framework for statistical analysis of these data is developed which copes with the many observations below the limits of detection of the laboratory analytical methods used to measure concentrations of chemical determinands, Besides the estimates of annual mean concentrations, two products of the framework are estimates of precision of these means and a test of long-term change in annual mean concentration. The methodology is applied to concentrations of ammoniacal nitrogen, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, orthophosphate, copper and zinc at HMS river sites in England and Wales. These sites show a clear net improvement in ammoniacal nitrogen, nitrite, copper and zinc concentrations when comparing the late-1970s with the early-1990s. Conversely, between the same two periods, these sites show a clear net deterioration in chloride and orthophosphate concentrations and a small net deterioration in nitrate concentration at the HMS river sites. The simple framework is extended to include a seasonal component and a full likelihood test of long-term change, This is applied to ammoniacal nitrogen concentration at 30 HMS sites. The proportion of sites showing long-term improvement in ammoniacal nitrogen is a little higher than that obtained in the simple framework, suggesting that the simple approach is conservative in detecting change.

J	Wang, Y; Edwards, DR; Daniel, TC; Scott, HD				Wang, Y; Edwards, DR; Daniel, TC; Scott, HD			Simulation of runoff transport of animal manure constituents	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						nonpoint source pollution; models; runoff; water quality	QUALITY; SOIL; MANAGEMENT; RAINFALL; FESCUE; PLOTS	Runoff losses of land-applied animal manure constituents can adversely affect the quality of downstream waters. Reliable mathematical simulation models can help estimate runoff losses of animal manure constituents and identify management measures to reduce these losses. The objective of this study was to develop and calibrate an event-based simulation model to describe the runoff transport of solids (soil and manure particles) and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) from areas treated with animal manure. The resulting model, consisting of linked hydrology, soil/manure transport, and nutrient transport components, is process-oriented and uses measurable parameters to the greatest degree possible. The three components of the model were calibrated sequentially (hydrology, soil/manure transport, and nutrient transport, in order) using data from plot-scale field experiments involving grassed plots treated with poultry litter. The calibrated parameter values were generally consistent with previously published values. Transport of total suspended solids, ammonia-nitrogen, dissolved phosphorus, and total phosphorus was well-predicted by the model. Transport of nitrate-nitrogen, however, was overpredicted by approximately an order of magnitude, while total Kjeldahl nitrogen transport was underpredicted by approximately an order of magnitude. Improvements in model structure (e.g., using different equations to describe the release of nitrate from the litter to the soil and assuming a significant proportion of organic nitrogen to be soluble) and parameter selection appear warranted to improve prediction of nitrate and total Kjeldahl nitrogen losses.

By this treatment oxidation of organic material, nitrification and denitrification, by three different classes of bacteria, occurs in the same environment. The occurrence of these three processes within a close environment resemble too some extent the way the processes take place in aquatic sediment, which also to some extent consists of clay. The results presented in this paper show that it is possible to simulate the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) processes with a model which containing 6 state-variables including a coupling of the 3 processes performed by each of the bacterial species included. The model results and the results obtained from experimental data are in general comparable.

For at least 25 years, various types of measurements have been made intermittently in these systems, but almost no effort has been made to determine if water quality or habitat conditions have changed over the years or if distinctive spatial gradients in these features have developed in response to changing land uses. The purpose of this work was to examine this fragmented database and determine if such patterns have emerged and how they may be related to land uses. Turbidity, dissolved inorganic phosphate, algal biomass, and primary production rates in most areas of the coastal bays followed a regular seasonal pattern, which was wed correlated with Hater temperature. Nitrate concentrations were low (<5 mu M), and only modestly higher in tributary creeks (<20 mu M). Additionally, there was little indication of the spring bloom typical of river-dominated systems. There does appear to be a strong spatial gradient in water quality conditions (more eutrophic in the upper bays, especially in tributary creeks). Comparisons of water quality data collected between 1970 and 1991 indicate little temporal change in most areas and some small improvements in a few areas, probably related to decreases in point-source discharges. Seagrass communities were once extensive in these systems but at present are restricted to the eastern portion of the lower bays where water clarity is sufficient to support plant survival. Even in these areas, seagrass densities have recently decreased. Examination of diel dissolved oxygen data collected in the summer indicates progressively larger diel excursions from lower to upper bays and from open bars to tributary subsystems; however, hypoxic conditions (<2 mg l(-1)) were rarely observed in any location. Nitrogen input data (point, surface runoff, groundwater, and atmospheric deposition to surface waters) were assembled for seven regions of the coastal bay system; annual loading rates ranged from 2.4 g N m(-2) yr(-1) to 39.7 g N m(-2) yr(-1). Compared with a sampling of loading rates to other coastal systems, those to the upper and lower bays were low while those to tributaries were moderate to high. Regression analysis indicated significant relationships between annual nitrogen loading rates and average annual total nitrogen and chlorophyll a concentrations in the water column. Similar analyses also indicated significant relationships between chlorophyll a and the magnitude of diel dissolved oxygen changes in the water column. it is concluded that these simple models, which could be improved with a well-designed monitoring program, could be used as quantitative management tools to relate habitat conditions to nutrient loading rates.

J	Dunton, KH				Dunton, KH			Photosynthetic production and biomass of the subtropical seagrass Halodule wrightii along an estuarine gradient	ESTUARIES			English	Article							EELGRASS ZOSTERA-MARINA; SUBMERSED AQUATIC VEGETATION; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; RUPPIA-MARITIMA; WATER-QUALITY; GROWTH; PHYTOPLANKTON; AVAILABILITY; COMMUNITIES; ENRICHMENT	Seasonal patterns of aboveground and belowground biomass, leaf chlorophyll (chl) content, and in situ differences in photosynthetic parameters were examined in the shoal grass Halodule wrightii along an estuarine gradient in the western Gulf of Mexico. Continuous measurements of biomass were collected over a 5-yr period (1989-1994) with respect to several abiotic factors in three estuarine systems that were characterized by significant differences in salinity and ambient dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN; NO2- + NO3-) regimes that ranged from 5-25 parts per thousand (0-80 mu M DIN) in the Guadalupe estuary to 35-55 parts per thousand (0-9 mu M DIN) in the upper Laguna Madre. photosynthesis versus irradiance IP vs. I) parameters, measured from December 1989 to April 1991, showed no significant differences among the three sites, and there were no significant differences in leaf chlorophyll content and chl a:b ratios among sites over the entire 5-yr period. Saturation irradiance in Halodule wrightii is estimated at 319 mu moles photons m(-2) s(-1) based on measurements collected at the three sites over a 2-yr period. No strong seasonal variations were observed in total plant biomass, but root:shoot ratios (RSR) showed a clear pattern of maximum RSR values in winter and minimum values in summer. There were no significant differences in RSR among sites, and no consistent correlations could be established between plant parameters and sediment porewater NH4+, salinity, or temperature. Sediment porewater NH4+ values generally ranged from 50 mu M to 400 mu M (average 130-150 mu M) but could not be correlated with significant differences in sediment composition between the sites. The high productivity of Halodule wrightii under a variety of light, nutrient, and salinity conditions explains its ubiquitous distribution and opportunistic strategy as a colonizing species. However, the persistence of a denser algal bloom in Laguna Madre coincident with low DIN levels (<5 mu M) contradicts previously accepted relationships on nutrient stimulation of algal growth, and provides strong evidence that water quality parameters for estuarine seagrasses are decidedly estuarine-specific. Consequently, a knowledge of the long-term history of estuarine systems is critical to habitat managers, who are required to establish minimum water quality criteria for the protection of submerged aquatic vegetation in estuarine systems.

Concurrent with the seagrass sampling, quarterly water-quality monitoring was undertaken at greater than or equal to 3 sites in the vicinity of each studied seagrass meadow. Three months after termination of the seagrass sampling effort, a biweekly water-quality monitoring program was instituted at two of the seagrass sampling sites. In addition, a nitrogen loading model was calif,rated for the various watersheds influencing the seagrass meadows. Substantial spatial and temporal differences in turtle grass parameters but smaller spatial variation in water quality parameters are indicated by data from both the concurrent quarterly monitoring program and the biweekly monitoring program instituted after termination of the seagrass study. Turtle grass biomass and productivity were negatively correlated with watershed nitrogen loads, while water quality parameters did not clearly reflect differences in watershed nutrient inputs. We suggest that traditional water-quality monitoring programs can fail to detect the onset or continuance of nutrient-induced declines in seagrass health. Consequently, seagrass meadows should be monitored directly as a part of any effort to determine status and/or trends in the health of estuarine environments.

J	Madden, CJ; Kemp, WM				Madden, CJ; Kemp, WM			Ecosystem model of an estuarine submersed plant community: Calibration and simulation of eutrophication responses	ESTUARIES			English	Article							ZOSTERA-MARINA L; CHESAPEAKE BAY; POTAMOGETON-PERFOLIATUS; NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT; AQUATIC VEGETATION; NEW-ZEALAND; PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS; SEAGRASS COMMUNITIES; VASCULAR PLANTS; MANUKAU HARBOR	As water quality in the Chesapeake Bay has declined over recent decades, formerly healthy submersed plant communities have disappeared from littoral areas of the mesohaline estuary. A dynamic simulation model of shallow regions of bay tributaries (<1 m) was developed to investigate growth responses of submersed vascular plants to eutrophication and habitat degradation. Our objectives were to elucidate mechanisms responsible for the decline and to evaluate conditions required for plant restoration and survival. State variables in the model are plant leaves, roots, phytoplankton, epiphytes, and detrital material. The model calculates biomass pools and biogeochemical rate processes over annual cycles with a time step of 6 h. Simulations were performed to investigate the influence of phytoplankton and epiphytes on the underwater light environment, how the balance of limiting resources (light and nutrients) controls growth and productivity of submersed plants, and conditions necessary for the restoration of submersed vegetation. Model output for submersed plants was calibrated to baseline data from the mid 1970s (r(2) = 0.86); simulations reproduced declines in plant biomass with increasing nutrient enrichment. Model experiments showed that by increasing nutrient inputs 40% above levels observed in the 1960s, submersed plants disappeared within 1-2 yr due to enhanced growth of phytoplankton and epiphytes, which reduced light below required levels. Epiphytes were more important than were phytoplankton in attenuating light. The relationship between nutrient enrichment and plant loss rate was complex, as epiphyte density on leaf surfaces was not linearly related to nutrient levels. Relatively small nutrient increases could have a large effect on submersed plants because epiphyte density on leaves increased exponentially as leaf surface area decreased. Exchanges of organic carbon and nutrients between leaf and root compartments were seasonally variable and were critical for survival of submersed plants. The amount of root-rhizome material available for regrowth could control the outcome of nutrient reduction strategies. Consequently, model predictions of plant restoration success were highly dependent on initial conditions. The model is being used successfully as a research tool to interpret ecological relationships in the ongoing reevaluation of management alternatives for submersed plant restoration.

The basis for the model is the process by which pollutants build up on the watershed surface. For the wet climate of the study site, it was assumed that there exists an interval of time over which the pollutant buildup equals the pollutant washoff (no accumulation of pollutant). The buildup model was represented by a linear function of the antecedent dry time. The buildup function was then linked with a pollutant washoff model represented by a power function of the storm runoff volume. Various time intervals for no net accumulation were tested to calibrate the model. The model was calibrated to observed data for two small urban basins in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and model results were used to analyze the behavior of phosphorus concentrations in storm runoff from these basins over a long period of time.

Karst areas comprise about 18 percent of the Region's land area. An estimated one-third of the Region's farms, cattle, and agricultural market value are on karst terrain. Nitrate concentrations were measured in cave streams draining two primary land management areas. The first area was pasture serving a beef cow-calf operation. The second area was a dairy. Nitrate-N concentrations were highest in cave streams draining the daily and a cave stream draining an area of pasture where cattle congregate for shade and water. The dairy contributed about 60 to 70 percent of the nitrogen load increase in the study section of the cave system. It was concluded that agriculture was significantly affecting nitrate concentrations in the karst aquifer. Best management practices may be one way to protect the ground water resource.

A model consisting of several tanks and a pilot consisting of two 100-m(3), 100-m(2) ponds were studied, In both, the metabolically dependent water-quality parameters (dissolved oxygen, NH4+-N, oxidized-N, pH and phosphate) remained stable and within safe limits for the fish during over 2 years of operation, The design allowed significant increases in overall water residence time (4.9 days), compared with conventional intensive ponds, and produced a high yield of seaweed in addition to the fish, The design provides a practical solution to major management and environmental problems of land-based mariculture.

J	Arenz, RF; Lewis, WM; Saunders, JF				Arenz, RF; Lewis, WM; Saunders, JF			Determination of chlorophyll and dissolved organic carbon from reflectance data for Colorado reservoirs	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							SUSPENDED SEDIMENT CONCENTRATION; REMOTE-SENSING REFLECTANCE; SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; INLAND WATERS; OCEAN COLOR; QUALITY; LAKES; PHYTOPLANKTON; FLUORESCENCE	Relationships between phytoplankton abundance, concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and reflectance spectra were investigated in eight reservoirs of the Colorado Front Range. The purposes of the study were: (1) to determine the degree to which chlorophyll and DOC could be determined from spectral data of the type that can be acquired through remote sensing; and (2) to determine whether equations developed for other waters are applicable to Colorado reservoirs. Supplementary information was obtained from water selectively enriched in dissolved organic carbon (Georgia blackwater lakes) and in phytoplankton (phytoplankton cultures). Reflectance for the lakes ranged from 1 to 5 per cent across the spectrum. All lakes showed a peak of reflectance near 570 nm (green range) corresponding to the minimum absorption for chlorophyll. For both the reservoirs and the phytoplankton cultures, a peak near the red-infrared boundary (ca 700 nm) increased in size and shifted toward longer wavelengths with increasing concentration of chlorophyll a. Georgia blackwater lakes dominated by DOC yielded flat spectra combined with low overall reflectance (usually below 1 per cent). With the presence of tripton in addition to DOC, reflectance was higher and showed peaks near 710 and 810 nm caused by selective scattering and absorption. For the eight reservoirs, chlorophyll showed a very close relationship to ratios of reflectance at a number of wavelengths. The strongest relationship was for the ratio of reflectance in the near-infrared to reflectance in the green spectral range (r(2)=0.98): Chlorophyll a, mu g l(-1)=407 (R(806)/R(571))(2.52). Single ratios of reflectance did not show such strong relationships with concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (r(2) <0.70). Concentrations of DOC were related strongly, however, to dual ratios that were identified through multiple regression analysis. The closest relationship was (r(2)=0.95): DOC, mgl(-1)=0.55 [(R(716)/R(670))(-9.60)][(R(706)/R(670))(12.94)]. Reflectance ratios of red to green wavelengths and ratios containing reflectance near 800 nm work well for predictions of chlorophyll in Colorado reservoirs, although equations of this type have not been previously reported in the literature. Equations that have been developed for other areas do not consistently fit the data for Colorado reservoirs. Spectral analysis of reflectance in relation to water quality will be required from numerous geographic regions before universal equations or universal typologies can be considered.

J	Pekarova, P; Pekar, J				Pekarova, P; Pekar, J			The impact of land use on stream water quality in Slovakia	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article							CATCHMENT; BASIN	In the first part of this paper, the impact of forestry, agriculture and urban activities on the quality of surface water is analysed. Daily data from 15 forest and agricultural experimental catchments of the Institute of Hydrology, Slovak Academy of Sciences are used. It is shown, that the nitrate concentrations in surface water have decreased in Slovakia since 1989 as a result of decreased use of inorganic nitrogen fertilisers (lower intensity of agricultural production in Slovakia owing to recent economic changes). The annual nitrate specific load varies from 5.90 to 110 kg ha(-1) year(-1), the annual sulphate load varied from 29.16 to 509.60 kg ha(-1) year(-1) and the annual phosphate load varied from 0.0098 to 0.0224 kg ha(-1) year(-1) during 1990-1992. In the second part, a two-step method of three-component hydrograph separation of rain-, soil- and groundwater is proposed. The method is used in the Manelo-Gribov microbasin (0.95 km(2)) in Eastern Slovakia. The annual contribution of surface runoff in total runoff volume was 57.5%, the contribution of interflow runoff was 21.1%, and the contribution of groundwater was 21.4%, during the period from 1 August to 31 July 1992. A deterministic regression model for predicting daily nitrate concentrations from values of-stream daily discharge and flow component data was developed. A set of 1421 modelled NO3- data was compared with the set of measured data.

J	Guterstam, B				Guterstam, B			Demonstrating ecological engineering for wastewater treatment in a Nordic climate using aquaculture principles in a greenhouse mesocosm	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						aquaculture; aquatic food chain; ecotoxicity; greenhouse; heavy metals; mesocosm; natural resource management; Nordic climate; plant nutrient recycling; wastewater		A demonstration plant for ecologically engineered wastewater treatment was constructed in 1989 as an aquaculture inside a greenhouse, i.e., a mesocosm, designed for operation in a Nordic climate, at N Lat. 60 degrees, in Sweden. Located on the Baltic Sea coast in Trosa, Stensund Folk College was used as a model community, with 100 person equivalents (p.e.), for the purpose of developing a recycling concept for the wastewater resources of nitrogen, phosphorus and heat energy. After 4 years of operation, results show that the wastewater from 34 p.e. (0.18 m(-3) day(-1) person(-1)) has been treated in the aquaculture, from January 1990 to January 1994. Based on the total wastewater flow from 100 p.e., the nutrient uptake in the aquaculture was 10% of the nitrogen and 8% of the phosphorus. Source separation of phosphorus, i.e., the phosphorus not used, amounted to 34%, coming through an increased awareness to using phosphorus-free cleaning agents. The aquaculture's reduction of pathogenic bacteria and organic material gave a treated effluent close to swimming water quality. Metals were reduced by anaerobic treatment, with 48-73% reduction of the seven identified metals. Energy balances showed a small net energy import during winter, and 19% of the greenhouse's available energy was heat pumped. The costs of aquaculture wastewater treatment still exceed conventional costs, as long as aquaculture products are not counted.

The analyses were performed at different support scales, ranging from point level to a support level equal to the entire recharge area. We used a mass balance model that relates leaching from the vadose zone to long-term estimates of NO3-N concentration at the well. We used a GIS database and stratified sampling for both soil characterization and assessment of spatial variability of NO3 leaching. The LEACHA/N rootzone model was used in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulation to generate cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for leaching from different land strata (given by combinations of soil type and land use). To simulate the spatial variability of properties that served as inputs to the root zone model, we used CDFs of spatial distributions of soil properties and CDFs of the spatial variability of fertilizer application rates within a field. These strata scale CDFs were then combined to generate CDFs of the NO3-N concentrations at the well, i.e., at a recharge area support scale. Although considerable variability was found at a point support scale, the analyses generated a markedly lower variability at the recharge area support scale. The results suggest that GIS data bases generated at scales available to resource managers (i.e., 1:12 000 and 1:24 000) may be well suited to manage the water quality of large production scale wells.

It has been tested at the Mar Menor, an oligotrophic coastal lagoon located in the SE of Spain, based on a flight synchronized with sampling of water and substrate. The spectral information was obtained from Daedalus 1268 multispectral scanner which configuration was similar to CZCS. Samples from water and substrate were analysed in the laboratory to quantify environmental parameters. The lagoon has an average depth of 3.5 m and a maximum depth of 6.6 m. Bottoms are mainly covered by dense Caulerpa prolifera-Cymododea nodosa beds. The lagoon surface, which is about 135 km(2), was covered with five aeroplane passages. The proposed approach assumes that the coefficient of water attenuation (K) is not constant throughout the scene and these variations are related to chlorophyll a concentration. A new method to obtain K for each pixel was previously developed.

As of this writing RZWQM is in the beta-testing phase of development, This article reports on a parameterization and evaluation study performed in Ohio on field corn for the crop growth component of RZWQM. The generic crop growth model in RZWQM had not previously been parameterized or rested on field corn. This article reports the results of such a study. One year of data was used to calibrate RZWQM, and two additional years of data from the same site were used to check the predictions of the model once it was calibrated Crop growth, soil water content, and soil nitrate concentration predictions were compared to observed values collected throughout the growing season at the Ohio Management System Evaluation Area in Piketon, Ohio. The simulation results performed consistently with our expectations of the physical system. Since the generic crop growth model had not previously been tested on simulated field corn growth, we were unsure of its capabilities. For our site, the model was capable of being parameterized with one year's data, and reliably simulated the soil water content, nitrate in the root zone, corn growth, and yield for two other years	OHIO STATE UNIV,DEPT AGR ENGN,COLUMBUS,OH 43210; USDA ARS,GPSR,FT COLLINS,CO 80522	Nokes, SE (corresponding author), UNIV KENTUCKY,DEPT AGR & BIOSYST ENGN,128 AGR ENGN BLDG,LEXINGTON,KY 40546, USA.

J	Emery, SL; Perry, JA				Emery, SL; Perry, JA			Decomposition rates and phosphorus concentrations of purple Loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) and cattail (Typha spp) in fourteen Minnesota wetlands	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Loosestrife; Lythrum salicaria; cattail; decomposition; phosphorus; wetland	LITTER; MACROPHYTES; GLAUCA; NUTRIENTS; BREAKDOWN; MARSH	Purple Loosestrife is rapidly displacing native vegetation in North American wetlands. Associated changes in wetland plant communities are well understood. Effects of Loosestrife invasion on nutrient cycling and decomposition rates in affected wetlands are unknown, though potentially of significance to wetland function. We used litter bag methods to quantify decomposition rates and phosphorus concentrations of purple Loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) and native cattails (Typha spp.) in fourteen Minnesota wetlands. A 170-day study that began in autumn modeled decomposition of Loosestrife leaves. Loosestrife stems and Typha shoots that had overwintered and fragmented were measured in a 280- day study that began in spring. In general, Loosestrife leaves decomposed most rapidly of the three; Typha shoots decomposed faster than Loosestrife stems. Significant decay coefficients (k-values) were determined by F-testing single exponential model regressions of different vegetation types in the fourteen wetlands. Significant decay coefficients were: k = 2.5 x 10(-3) and 4.32 x 10(-3) for all Loosestrife leaves (170 d); k = 7.2 x 10(-4) and 1.11 x 10(-3) for overwintered Loosestrife stems (280-d) and k = 7.9 x 10(-4), 1.42 x 10(-3) and 2.24 x 10(-3) for overwintered Typha shoots (280-d). Phosphorus concentrations of plant tissue showed an initial leaching followed by stabilization or increase probably associated with microbial growth. Loosestrife leaves had twice the phosphorus concentration of Loosestrife stems and Typha shoots. Our results indicate that conversion of wetland vegetation from cattails to Loosestrife may result in significant change in wetland function by altering timing of litter input and downstream phosphorus loads. Conversion of a riverine, flow- through wetland from Typha to Loosestrife may effectively accelerate eutrophication of downstream water bodies. Impacts of Loosestrife invasion must be considered when wetlands are managed for wildlife or for improvement of downstream water quality.

The fake receives its major point-source loading, including pulp mill effluents, via the Pielisjoki River in the northeastern part of the lake, where the water is slightly eutrophic. The flow pattern was measured with three types of recording current meters, two of which were conventional mechanical meters and the third a new acoustic current profiler. The profiler was used in direct reading mode on a research vessel and also in self-contained mode on a float installed in the deep basin of the lake. The water-quality part of the model simulates oxygen, BOD, total phosphorus, AOX, and phytoplankton biomass. The three-dimensional model applied here simulates accurately the flow pattern of the water in Lake Pyhaselka.

J	Granberg, K				Granberg, K			The impact of effluents of Pitkaranta pulp mill on the water quality of Lake Ladoga: A model study	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Lake Ladoga Symposium on Ecological Problems of Lake Ladoga	NOV 22-26, 1993	ST PETERSBURG, RUSSIA	Univ Joensuu, Finland, Russian Acad Sci, Inst Limnol		pulp mill effluents; eutrophication; increased chemical oxygen demand		The aim of this study is to show the effects of the Pitkaranta pulp mill on the water quality of Northern Ladoga by using water quality models. The effluent loading of the pulp mill with its full production capacity is as follows: [GRAPHICS] Loadings of lignosulphonates and organic C are estimations. Lignosulphonate concentrations of 10.5 mg l(-1) have been reported in the region of Pitkaranta. The study area of northern Ladoga near the pulp mill was divided into three zones (I, II and III). The mean depth of each of them is considered as 10 m, their respective areas 5, 10 and 50 km(2), and volumes 50, 100 and 500 million m(3). The estimated discharges of the zones are 10, 20 and 50 m(3) s(-1), respectively. With the aid of simple water quality models the effects of the pulp mill effluents on the concentrations of oxygen, total phosphorus, lignin, COD(Mn) and Secchi disk depths in each of the zones were estimated. Estimations were made during full production capacity and half production capacity of the pulp mill. The modelling results were compared with the preliminary water analysis results of the Finnish-Russian joint research expedition into Lake Ladoga in August 1993. The results show that near the pulp mill (zone I) phosphorus concentrations are high even with half production capacity. Also lignin and COD(Mn) contents have increased, and oxygen concentrations are low both in the summer and during wintertime. Farther away in the open water (zone III) the pollution effects are low. Eutrophication, indicated by high total phosphorus concentrations, is the main effect of the pulp mill effluents.

Estimation of trophic status and saprobity of the reservoir was based on phytoplankton biomass and species composition and chlorophyll content. The most eutrophic waters were found to occupy the peripheral areas in littoral zone and river inflows of the reservoir, while the waters in the central part of the basin were less eutrophic. Long-term changes of the phytoplankton biomass, chlorophyll, chlorophyll/biomass-ratio and saprobity index observed in the central part of the reservoir were analyzed by statistical methods. An increase in saprobity and an inverse relationship between chlorophyll/biomass-ratio and water transparency demonstrate progressive eutrophication in the central part of the reservoir. Two distinct periods (1954-1970 and 1971-1984) could be discerned on the basis of annual mean phytoplankton biomass values. For the earlier period a relationship between biomass and climatic factors (solar radiation and wind velocity) could be established, but no such correlation could be found for the latter period. There was no significant increase in the phytoplankton biomass during the monitoring period, but a definite increase in the proportion of small-sized species of centric diatoms, cryptomonads and blue-greens. These forms are considered as r-strategists in the community, and their increase is interpreted as a sign of eutrophication.

J	Mattikalli, NM; Devereux, BJ; Richards, KS				Mattikalli, NM; Devereux, BJ; Richards, KS			Prediction of river discharge and surface water quality using an integrated geographical information system approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article								A methodology is developed for the prediction of river discharge and surface water quality (indexed by nitrogen loading) of a predominantly rural catchment using simple models in an integrated Geographical Information System (GIS). River discharge is predicted using the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) runoff Curve Number model, and surface water quality by the export coefficient model. Main input variable to these models is information on land-use along with ancillary information such as soils. Land-use is an important parameter that affects both discharge and water quality, and it can be derived from classification of remotely sensed images. Unlike conventional models, the models employed here do not require large amounts of data on several hydro-meteorological variables. The models are applied to a rural catchment in eastern England where major land-use changes have occurred in the recent past. Historical land-use data are derived from a variety of sources including maps, aerial photographs and remotely sensed satellite images for various dates ranging from 1931 to 1989. A GIS is a valuable means to enable large amounts of spatial data to be integrated, and to facilitate data manipulation for the specific application of the models. Results are validated using observed runoff and water quality records, and it is shown that the model predictions are of acceptable accuracy. This study demonstrated an application of a GIS to employ simple models to predict river discharge and water quality.

J	Minhas, PS				Minhas, PS			Saline water management for irrigation in India	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Review							NONSALINE WATERS; CONJUNCTIVE USE; SULFATE SALINITY; LOAM SOIL; WHEAT; SALINIZATION; PHOSPHORUS; CHLORIDE	Much (32-84%) of the ground water surveyed in different Indian States is rated either saline or alkali. Because of the continental monsoonal climate, the basic principles of saline water management need some adaptation, e.g. providing for a leaching requirement is not appropriate when the growing season for post-monsoon winter crops starts with a surface-leached soil profile, because it would increase the salt load. High salinities during the initial stages of growth are particularly harmful. Further, if benefits are to be gained from frequent saline irrigation, the amount of water applied per irrigation needs to be reduced. This is not possible with most widely practiced surface irrigation methods, but can be achieved with sprinkler and drip methods. However, in India the large-scale use of such systems is not yet technically or economically feasible. Another management goal is simultaneously to encourage the utilisation of carried over rainwater in the soil profile/shallow watertables. Tolerance limits of crops to the use of saline water in different agro-ecological regions of India are available, and have been observed to vary with soil type, rainfall and anionic/cationic constituents of salinity. Multi-location trials on the appropriate use of saline and non-saline water reveal the benefits of irrigating with non-saline canal water during the initial stages of growth, as well as cycles of saline and non-saline water during the pre-sowing irrigation period. Monsoon-induced salt leaching decreases with increasing clay content, SAR(iw), and is enhanced with increasing chloride salinity. Additional doses of phosphorous to alleviate the effects of chloride toxicity, and the use of organic materials to enhance the efficiency of applied nitrogen are recommended under saline-irrigated conditions. Contrary to the general belief that soils irrigated with high-SAR saline water may regain their infiltration capacity when the electrolytic concentration of ingoing water is greater than the flocculation value, irreversible reductions are induced under cyclic saline-rainwater infiltration where sub-soil layers, ingressed with clays from the plough layer, control steady intake rates. Thus, the use of gypsum (SAR(iw) > 20) is advocated. Gypsum is also needed for soils irrigated with saline water with an Mg:Ca ratio > 3 and rich in silica. Other cultural practices, such as furrow planting, increasing the plant density and post-seeding irrigation in crops like mustard, also prove useful. Water-quality standards which were too conservative have been replaced by site-specific guidelines where factors such as soil texture, rainfall and crop tolerance have been given due consideration.

J	Jayaweera, M; Asaeda, T				Jayaweera, M; Asaeda, T			Modeling of biomanipulation in shallow, eutrophic lakes: An application to Lake Bleiswijkse Zoom, the Netherlands	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						biomanipulation; fish; phytoplankton; transparency; zooplankton	PHYTOPLANKTON; GROWTH	The prediction of temporal variations of biota following biomanipulation measures in lakes is of paramount importance in view of water quality management. The temporal variations of phytoplankton biomass as chlorophyll-a and transparency as Secchi depths measurements are studied in the Lake Bleiswijkse Zoom, The Netherlands with a comprehensive biological model. In the formulation of the biological model, phytoplankton as several species, zooplankton, detritus, planktivorous and benthivorous fish and piscivorous fish are considered to be the major contributing biota for the food web manipulation. The biological model enumerates the species compositions at a given time taking biological, physical and meteorological processes into account. Reduction of almost all planktivorous fish and 85% of benthivorous fish results in increase in transparency, decrease in algal biomass and decrease in resuspended inorganic matters leading to an environmental sound lake ecosystem. The model also provides useful insights into positive and negative interrelationships among biota in the ecosystem. In other words, from the biomanipulation point of view, poor understanding of interactions among biota and hence, uncertainties of their accurate predictions may lead to controversial evidences.

Wetland water quality was significantly affected by contact with the sediment (surface water vs. groundwater), season, degree of hydrologic isolation, wetland class, and predominant land-use in the surrounding watershed (p < 0.05). Between years, only nitrate and particulate nitrogen concentrations varied significantly in Wright County wetland surface waters. For eight water-quality variables, the power of a paired before-and-after comparison design was greater than the power of a completely randomized design. The reverse was true for four other water-quality variables. The power of statistical tests for different classes of water-quality variables could be ranked according to the predominant factors influencing these: climate factors > edaphic factors > detritivory > land-use factors > biotic-redox or other multiple factors. For two wetlands sampled intensively, soluble reactive phosphate and total dissolved phosphorus were the most spatially variable (c.v. = 76-249%), while temperature, color, dissolved organic carbon, and DO were least variable (c.v. = 6-43%). Geostatistical analyses demonstrated that the average distance across which water-quality variables were spatially correlated (variogram range) was 61-112% of the mean radius of each wetland. Within the shallower of the two wetlands, nitrogen speciation was explained as a function of dissolved oxygen, while deeper marsh water-quality variables were explained as a function of water depth or distance from the wetland edge. Compositing water-quality samples produced unbiased estimates of individual sample means for all water quality variables examined except for ammonium.

One of the seagrass sites was near the outflow of a canal discharging highly coloured water, and is regularly inundated by a plume of coloured water. Attenuation coefficients for photosynthetically active radiation predicted by the model agreed with observations within about 15%. Observed ecological compensation depth for the seagrass bed more distant from the colour source agreed well with the central tendency of the 20% penetration depth predicted by the optical model using the observed distributions of water quality parameters. Depth distributions of the seagrass bed near the coloured water source were about 0.5 m shallower, a result predicted by the optical model assuming the seagrass bed is inundated by the coloured water plume 50-70% of the time. At depths less than their ecological compensation depths, the two seagrass beds had similar species composition, shoot densities and biomass characteristics. Application of the model to hypothetical scenarios to reduce the impact of coloured water on the depth distribution of seagrasses near the discharge site indicated that any improvement in water quality would improve conditions for seagrass growth. The results indicate the utility of optical modelling in conjunction with limited field surveys of seagrasses for setting water quality objectives.

J	Bettinetti, A; Pypaert, P; Sweerts, JP				Bettinetti, A; Pypaert, P; Sweerts, JP			Application of an integrated management approach to the restoration project of the lagoon of Venice	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Integrated Coastal Zone Management; GIS; Venice lagoon; eutrophication; environmental planning	MACROALGAE; NITROGEN; AREA	The lagoon of Venice is suffering major environmental problems which affect both its morphological and ecological characteristics, such as disappearance of tidal marshes owing to erosion processes and extensive macroalgal blooms due to high nutrient loads. In order to reverse this environmental deterioration, the Consorzio Venezia Nuova (CVN) has undertaken a programme to restore the morphology and improve the quality of the lagoon by designing practical measures to be implemented within the lagoon boundaries, as well as providing management tools to analyse different management measures. An integrated management approach was adopted to fulfil this objective, taking into account all the aspects of the environmental problems and their relationships with the economic activities in the estuary and its catchment. The main steps and specific tools of this approach are the following: description of the lagoon ecosystem; identification of the main aspects of the degradation; identification of critical environmental parameters and definition of target conditions for the recovery plan; verification of the selected target conditions and identification of critical areas using Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques; assessment of the effectiveness of the most promising restoration measures using (hydrodynamic and water quality) mathematical models; evaluation of intervention alternatives in relation to their technical and economical feasibility and their socio-economic impact. The results obtained using this approach have shown that the restoration process of the lagoon can be implemented only through the realisation of an integrated set of measures over different time scales. Long term measures include the reduction of pollution inputs from the drainage basin; medium term measures include modification of the morphology and of the water circulation pattern in specific areas; and emergency actions include macro-algae harvesting. This analytical approach is the basis of a decision support system that will be developed for the future management of the lagoon. It will help in defining monitoring programs, evaluating intervention options, and evaluating impacts of planned socio-economic development. This approach can be applied in any other geographical context. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited.

J	Field, CK; Siver, PA; Lott, AM				Field, CK; Siver, PA; Lott, AM			Estimating the effects of changing land use patterns on Connecticut lakes	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							STREAM WATER-QUALITY; AGRICULTURAL WATERSHEDS; PHOSPHORUS; EXPORT; TRENDS	Changes in land use of 30 Connecticut lake watersheds between 1934, 1970, and 1990 were quantified using aerial photographs. Results were used with existing land use models to estimate changes in concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) over the 56-yr period. On average, the watersheds have increased in urban-residential land cover from 2% in 1934 to 16% in 1990, and decreased in agricultural land from 20 to 7% during the same time period. The mean percentage of forested land has remained relatively constant. Based on the land use models of Norvell et al. (1979) and Frink (1991), the mean estimated total phosphorus concentration (eTP) increased from 15 mu g L(-1) in 1934 to 25 mu g L(-1) in 1990. The eTP concentrations increased in 26 of the 30 study lakes. In contrast, the mean estimated concentration of total nitrogen (eTN) increased only 20% from 374 to 450 mu g L(-1). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to score each study lake according to its current trophic and ionic condition using chemical data from 1991 to 1993, and the results regressed against the 1990 land use types. Trophic scores were most highly correlated with forest cover, while ionic scores were most highly correlated with forest cover and the degree of urban-residential land cover. The effect of water retention time is discussed. Land use models provide useful tools in the management of lakes.

Stochastic dominance analysis reveals economically preferred BMPs, the trade-offs relative to the production and market uncertainties, and the opportunity costs of altering current practices to meet prospective regulatory limits for nitrogen runoff and leaching Our simulations provide evidence that the control of nonpoint source pollution in this area through crop production and water management practices alone appears to be expensive and very limited. A federal cost-share program could provide incentives to farmers for voluntary adoption of economically efficient and environmentally acceptable BMPs. Simulation of expected returns may also allow the identification of those those producers who could most efficiently reduce N leaching/runoff and would be superior to an alternative scenario of regulating/penalizing all producers in the watershed.

The applicability, accuracy, and precision of such P transport prediction equations under pasture situations are less well defined The objectives of this study were to determine parameters of simplified runoff P transport equations for pasture fields and to assess the accuracy and precision of the equations. Runoff, sediment yield, soluble P transport, and particulate P transport data were collected from four pasture fields in northwestern Arkansas. Runoff event enrichment ratios and extraction coefficients were computed, and confidence limits on respective predicted particulate and soluble P transport were determined. An inverse linear relationship between the natural logarithms of enrichment ratio and sediment yield was found significant for all fields, but the slopes were lower than values reported earlier for general use. Runoff event extraction coefficients were considerably higher than those typically used and were highest for runoff occurring shortly following animal manure application. The 95% confidence limits on predicted soluble and particulate P transport varied in some cases by more than an order of magnitude, indicating that significant imprecision was associated with those predictions. The data suggested that the simplified model of soluble P transport might be a reasonable description of the processes for the fields, but that modification to the particulate P transport prediction method might be necessary to improve the prediction accuracy for low event sediment yields (< 10 kg/ha).

In this study first order analysis and Monte Carlo simulation were used to quantify this uncertainty in terms of probability distribution functions and confidence intervals on model outputs. Sensitivity coefficients were used to identify the parameters that were the most important for this analysis. In the case of runoff volume, one parameter accounted for 73% of the uncertainty in terms of variance. Thus improving knowledge of this single parameter can have a significant impact on reducing the uncertainty in the predicted runoff.

A relationship between population densities of the zebra mussel and their respiration demands for oxygen is developed, which can be used to support the analysis of the impact of zebra mussel infestation on the oxygen resources of streams and rivers. Dramatic changes in the water quality of the Seneca River, N.Y., a major tributary to Lake Ontario, have been brought about by zebra mussel infestation. These changes are documented from 3 years of monitoring data. The infestation converted the Seneca River from a turbid, phytoplankton-rich, nutrient-depleted system, with nearly saturated oxygen concentrations, to a river with high clarity, low-phytoplankton concentrations, enriched in dissolved nutrients, with greatly undersaturated oxygen concentrations. The degradation of oxygen resources was severe enough to cause violations of New York State standards for daily minimum and daily average concentrations for a number of days in the late summer of 1993. The associated loss in the waste assimilative capacity of the river is confounding waste discharge management and planning efforts in the river basin. This form of degradation is expected for other systems as the zebra mussel infestation spreads. The impact is expected to be greatest in rivers and streams with high concentrations of phytoplankton, large areas of rock substrate, and limited reaeration capacity.

J	Rast, W; Thornton, JA				Rast, W; Thornton, JA			Trends in eutrophication research and control	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Review						eutrophication; water management; water quality; water resources planning; watershed management; trophic status	EXPERIMENTAL LAKES AREA; WATER-QUALITY CRITERIA; SOUTH-AFRICA; PHOSPHORUS SUPPLIES; UNITED-STATES; SHAGAWA LAKE; MODEL; RESERVOIRS; MINNESOTA; CAPACITY	Eutrophication is the natural ageing process of lakes. It is characterized by a geologically slow shift from in-lake biological production driven by allochthonous (external to the water body) loading of nutrients, to production driven by autochthonous (in-lake) processes. This shift typically is accompanied by changes in species and biotic community composition, as an aquatic ecosystem is ultimately transformed into a terrestrial biome. However, this typically slow process can be greatly accelerated by human intervention in the natural biogeochemical cycling of nutrients within a watershed; the resulting cultural eutrophication can create conditions inimical to the continued use of the water body for human-driven economic purposes. Excessive algal and rooted plant growth, degraded water quality, extensive deoxygenation of the bottom water layers and increased fish biomass accompanied by decreased harvest quality, are some features of this process. Following the Second World War, concern with cultural eutrophication achieved an intensity that spurred a significant research effort, culminating in the identification of phosphorus as the single most significant, and controllable, element involved in driving the eutrophication process. During the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, much effort was devoted to reducing phosphorus in wastewater effluents, primarily in the developed countries of the temperate zone. These efforts generally resulted in the control of eutrophication in these countries, albeit with varying degrees of success. The present effort in the temperate zone, comprising mostly developed nations, has now shifted to the control of diffuse sources of a broader spectrum of contaminants that impact human water use. In the developing countries of the inter-tropical zone, however, rapidly expanding populations, a growing industrial economy and extensive urbanization have only recently reached an intensity at which cultural eutrophication can no longer be ignored. Further, initial attempts at applying temperate zone control measures in this region have been largely unsuccessful. Modification of the temperate zone eutrophication paradigm will be needed, especially to address the differing climatic and hydrological conditions, if cultural eutrophication is to be contained in this region, where eutrophication-related diseases continue to be a primary cause of human distress.

J	Wagner, RA; Tisdale, TS; Zhang, J				Wagner, RA; Tisdale, TS; Zhang, J			A framework for phosphorus transport modeling in the Lake Okeechobee watershed	WATER RESOURCES BULLETIN			English	Article						hydraulics; modeling; nonpoint source pollution; phosphorus; surface water hydrology; water quality; wetlands; uncertainty analysis		A modeling framework was developed to determine phosphorus loadings to Lake Okeechobee from watersheds located north of the lake. This framework consists of the land-based model CREAMS-WT, the in-stream transport model QUAL2E, and an interface procedure to format the land-based model output for use by the in-stream model. QUAL2E hydraulics and water quality routines were modified to account for flow routing and phosphorus retention in both wetlands and stream channels. Phosphorus loadings obtained from previous applications of CREAMS-WT were used by QUAL2E, and calibration and verification showed that QUAL2E accurately simulated seasonal and annual phosphorus loadings from a watershed. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses indicated that the accuracy of monthly loadings can be improved by using better estimates of in-stream phosphorus decay rates, ground water phosphorus concentrations, and runoff phosphorus concentrations as input to QUAL2E.

J	Hall, RI; Smol, JP				Hall, RI; Smol, JP			Paleolimnological assessment of long-term water-quality changes in south-central Ontario lakes affected by cottage development and acidification	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article							DIATOM ASSEMBLAGES; TROPHIC STATUS; PREINDUSTRIAL TIMES; ACIDIFIED LAKES; HUBBARD BROOK; CANADA LAKES; 3 LAKES; PH; PHOSPHORUS; ECOSYSTEM	Sediment diatom assemblages were used to evaluate water-quality changes since preindustrial times in south-central Ontario lakes receiving acidic deposition and moderate shoreline (mainly cottage) development. Canonical correspondence analysis identified significant relationships between surface sediment diatoms and environmental factors. Relationships were sufficiently strong to develop weighted-averaging regression-calibration models for inferring lake water pH and total phosphorus concentration ([TP]) from diatoms. These models were accurate to within +/-0.21 pH units and +/-4.2 mu g TP . L(-1). Postindustrial pH and [TP] changes were inferred from surface and pre-1850 sediment diatom assemblages. Results suggest that presently acid lakes (pH < 6) have acidified, and the pH of alkaline lakes (pH > 7) has increased, as observed in other regions receiving elevated acidic deposition. Diatom-inferred [TP] suggests that cultural eutrophication has not been widespread. In almost all lakes, present-day [TP] is not higher than before European settlement. In many mesotrophic lakes, preindustrial ITP] was higher than at present. Several factors could account for declining lake water [TP], including (i) lake and (or) watershed acidification processes that reduce P loading, or increase P loss rates; and (ii) reductions in nutrient loading from watersheds as a result of reforestation.

J	Hakanson, L				Hakanson, L			Predicting important lake habitat variables from maps using modern modelling tools	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on the Science and Management for Habitat Conservation and Restoration Strategies (HabCARES) in the Great Lakes	NOV, 1994	KEMPENFELT, CANADA				WATER-QUALITY	The aim of this work is to present several new lake management models for small, glacial lakes. The models are driven by simple, readily available ''map parameters'' describing the catchment area (like the percentage of mires, lakes, and forests) and the lake (area, volume, mean depth, etc.). The first step is to predict important limnological state variables (pH, total P, and colour); the second step involves predicting state indices describing the abundance of key functional groups (fish, phytoplankton and bottom fauna) and indices of special interest in lake management (Secchi depth and toxins in fish used for human consumption); and the last step concerns the definition of a lake ecosystem index based on the state indices. The ecosystem index characterizes the entire lake over extended periods (months to years) and not specific sites or sampling events. Lake indices can be obtained for a region or a country and the development can be illustrated with trend analyses. If these trends are linked to remedial measures, the effect of the remedies can be discussed qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of cost-benefit analyses. Calculations like this use Geographical Information Systems together with regional models based on map parameters.

J	Prairie, YT; Duarte, CM				Prairie, YT; Duarte, CM			Weak density-dependence and short-term perturbations as determinants of phytoplankton temporal dynamics	ECOSCIENCE			English	Article						phytoplankton; dynamics; semi-variogram; Gompertz; stochastic model; density-dependence	LAKE CONSTANCE; WATER-QUALITY; TIME-SERIES; VARIABILITY; BIOMASS; CHLOROPHYLL; PHOSPHORUS; VARIANCE; PLANKTON; ECOLOGY	We examined twelve temporal series of phytoplankton abundance in a diverse set of marine and freshwater habitats using semi-variogram analysis coupled with a stochastic discrete-time (daily) Gompertz model. The analysis revealed a very good correspondance between the theoretical semi-variogram function and the empirical semi-variograms. The estimated density-dependence parameters were remarkably similar in the various series and implied very weak regulation in phytoplankton abundance. Our results suggest that the magnitude of the daily variation in growth rates induced by density-independent factors increases with nutrient availability. The model also describes the general form of the mean-variance (temporal) relationship and is nearly identical to the empirical equation.

J	Balls, PW; Brockie, N; Dobson, J; Johnston, W				Balls, PW; Brockie, N; Dobson, J; Johnston, W			Dissolved oxygen and nitrification in the upper Forth estuary during summer (1982-92): Patterns and trends	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						estuaries; nutrients; dissolved oxygen; trends	FIRTH; SCOTLAND; CLYDE; WATER	River discharge, wastewater inputs and water quality data from summer surveys in the upper Forth estuary have been reviewed for the period 1982-92. Particular attention has been given to dissolved oxygen and its possible links to the processes involved in the cycling of dissolved inorganic nitrogen species. Average dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations for a particular year are linked with river flow; DO concentrations were lowest in years when river flow was low. Average DO concentrations in the upper Forth estuary have increased since 1959 when records began; however, the inter-annual variability in river flow precludes the detection of any significant trend over the present study period. An important process contributing to the development of the oxygen minimum in the upper estuary is nitrification. A comparison has been made between total oxidized nitrogen (TON) concentrations (i.e. nitrate + nitrite) observed in river water, and those predicted by extrapolating down estuary TON/salinity relationships to zero. The latter are always larger than the former with the greatest discrepancies observed under low river flows. It is suggested that under low flow conditions, the longer water residence times in the upper estuary enable nitrification to proceed to a greater extent. Ample particulate organic nitrogen (PON) required for nitrification is demonstrated to exist in the turbidity maximum. This can originate from the river and/or the estuary and may be of natural or anthropogenic origin. Evidence is presented to show that the magnitude of the internally generated TON source has increased over the period under study. Maximum ammonia and nitrite concentrations in the estuary tend to be associated with years in which river flow is low. The mid-estuarine concentration maxima for nitrite are indicative of a benthic source, their locations are downstream of the nitrification-produced nitrate maximum. Their distributions are consistent with processes breaking down PON in reducing sediments (e.g. denitrification). Therefore, lower DO concentrations in the water column may be taken as indicative of more reducing conditions close to the surface sediments. An oxygen budget is constructed for the upper estuary. While gas exchange is identified as the major source of oxygen overall, DO from river water is likely to dominate at low salinity. The main sinks for oxygen in the estuary are nitrification, inputs of BOD and sediment oxygen demand. The link between high river flows and improved water quality is attributed not only to the oxygen contained in river water, but also to the associated shift of the turbidity maximum further downstream where the volume of the estuary is greater. A complex picture emerges of chemical and physical processes tending to act in concert towards low DO concentrations under low river flow conditions.

J	Wallace, BB; Hamilton, DP; Patterson, JC				Wallace, BB; Hamilton, DP; Patterson, JC			Response of photosynthesis models to light limitation	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE			English	Article						phytoplankton production; time step; light limitation; water quality model	MIXED-LAYER; PHYTOPLANKTON; LAKES	An investigation into the effect of rime step on a common photosynthesis algorithm reveals that the predicted phytoplankton production and biomass depend strongly on the length of the time step. This time step dependence is due to the assumption that a light limitation factor derived From integrating the irradiance over the time step is equivalent to the integrated light limitation factor over the time step. This subtle inaccuracy in defining the factor For light limited phytoplankton production produces a substantial difference in the biomass estimates derived from the two models. To illustrate the difference, the light limitation factor integrated over the time step is implemented in the one dimensional water quality model DYRESM-WQ. The new version of DYRESM-WQ is used to simulate chlorophyll a concentrations in Prospect Reservoir, New South Wales. These results are compared to concentrations predicted using the original algorithm. The comparison shows that the new algorithm for phytoplankton production is relatively insensitive to time step, which decreases the difficulty of calibrating the model for chlorophyll a.

Measured subsurface drain Bow data for all 3 yrs was obtained from the Nashua Water Quality Site in Iowa. The model, in general, showed a good agreement between measured and predicted subsurface drain flow values, although discrepancies existed for several days of a given year, Coefficients of determination calculated for predicted vs, measured daily subsurface drain flows ranged from 0.51 to 0.68 for 1990, 0.70 to 0.78 for 1991, and 0.54 to 0.69 for 1992. Simulated tillage effect on subsurface drain flows for 1991 and 1992 were consistent with those for calibrated year 1990 (maximum subsurface drain Bow was observed under NT and minimum under MB), However, observed tillage effects varied from year to year, indicating a change in soil hydraulic properties, e.g., macroporosity. Other factors that could have caused the discrepancies between measured and simulated subsurface drain flows were: groundwater Bur due to natural gradient, deep seepage, inaccuracies involved in the estimation of breakpoint rainfall data, and spatial variability in soil properties.

The objectives were to evaluate the likely grazing impact on the river phytoplankton community and to produce predictive models by regressing the measured grazing rates against zooplankton biomass, temperature and food concentrations (represented by chlorophyll a). Grazing attained rates (overall average 0.2 day(-1), range 0.01-0.59 day(-1), expressed as instantaneous mortality rates of algal cells) comparable to those reported for lentic zooplankton communities. The measured community grazing rates were predictable largely as a function of total biomass or rotifer biomass and surface temperature for 1 m depth, and as a function of total biomass or juvenile copepod biomass and surface temperature for 4 m depth, with all-positive regression coefficients in the models. Owing to the predominance of microzooplankton in the river, the impact of zooplankton community grazing appears likely to be linked to a small-size fraction of the phytoplankton community all year. Management strategies for river water quality may need to take account of possible functional demarcation of grazing by river zooplankton.

J	Stamps, RH				Stamps, RH			Developing improved irrigation and nutrient management practices: A case study - Leatherleaf fern	SOIL AND CROP SCIENCE SOCIETY OF FLORIDA PROCEEDINGS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	55th Annual Meeting of the Soil-and-Crop-Science-Society-of-Florida	SEP 20-22, 1995	DAYTONA BEACH, FL	Soil & Crop Sci Soc Florida				When developing improved irrigation and nutrient management practices (IMPs), many factors (crop, economic, environmental, nutrient, pesticide, water) must be considered. This review of IMP development for leatherleaf fern is intended to help others who would like to develop IMPs for other crops. IMPs were developed for leatherleaf fern because of high risk of nitrate contamination due to production on highly permeable soils, relatively high nitrogen application rates, and year-round production. Good communication among fern growers, the academic community, and regulatory agencies facilitated IMP development. Both a multi-interest (academic community cooperative extension service, grower, fertilizer industry, regulatory and service agencies) steering committee and a multi-disciplinary (agricultural engineering, economics, horticulture, and soil science) team of scientists were involved in the research prioritization and initiation process. On-farm surveys, gravimetric lysimeters, field studies with and without surficial aquifer monitoring, estimates of nutrient withdrawals due to crop harvesting, field observations, and research on other foliage crops were each used during IMP development. Maintenance of grower anonymity and protection from prosecution by state agencies enforcing ground water quality standards enabled field trials to be conducted at commercial sites. The commercial acceptance of IMPs will depend upon many factors, and may be partially gauged by the number of growers who sign up to participate in Florida's nitrogen best management practices program.

J	Edwards, DR; Moore, PA; Daniel, TC; Srivastava, P				Edwards, DR; Moore, PA; Daniel, TC; Srivastava, P			Poultry litter-treated length effects on quality of runoff from fescue plots	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						water quality; nonpoint source pollution; poultry manure; nutrient transport		Using experimental data and/or mathematical simulation models to identify practices that reduce pollution from manure-treated areas is sometimes perceived as limited by the unknown validity of extrapolating plot-scale data to larger areas and by uncertainties in modeling transport of various pollutants. The objectives of this study were to assess the effect of length of manure treatment on runoff concentrations of poultry litter constituents and to define the modes of transport (particulate versus soluble) for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), carbon (C), and solids. Poultry litter was applied to three 1.5- x 18.3-m fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) plots with runoff collection gutters installed at 3.0-m intervals along the lengths of the plots. Runoff was generated from simulated rainfall (50 mm/h for 1 h of runoff), and samples were analyzed for total Kjeldahl N (TKN), organic N (Org-N), ammonia N (NH3-N), nitrate N (NO3-N), total P (TP), total organic C (TOC), and total suspended solids (TSS). Soluble fractions of TKN, Org-N, NH3-N, TP, and TOC were also determined. Manure-treated length had no effect on runoff concentration of any parameter indicating that a manure-treated length of only 3.0 m would have been sufficient to simulate runoff quality associated with longer manure length treatments. Proportions of TKN, Org-N, NH3-N, and TP transported in soluble form were high (greater than or equal to 74%), and over half of the TOC in the runoff was in soluble form. These results indicate that for conditions similar to those of this study, extrapolation with respect to runoff concentrations might be possible with little adaptation of the data and might simplify, the design of management practices that key on edge-of-field runoff concentrations. The results with regard to modes of transport can help to better model losses of N, P, and COD and suggest that losses of these parameters will be most effectively controlled through practices that focus on reducing soluble losses rather than simply reducing erosion.

Deterministic analyses	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						phosphorus; model; water quality; phosphorus cycling; lake sediments; Shagawa Lake; model calibration; model reliability; sediment phosphorus release	SHAGAWA LAKE; MINNESOTA; SEDIMENTS; SUPPLIES; RATES	Water quality problems in many lakes are closely related to the concentration of total phosphorus. Several total phosphorus models have been developed over the years that may be suitable to study these problems. However, some models may be more appropriate than others depending on the management objectives of the model and the mechanisms that affect the dynamics of various forms of phosphorus in the lake. These mechanisms include stratification, partitioning of total phosphorus into soluble and particulate forms, sediment interactions, and algal uptake and recycle. This paper analyzes the mechanisms, performance, and reliability of several total phosphorus models for lakes.

Stochastic analyses	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Monte Carlo analyses; phosphorus; model; water quality; phosphorus cycling; lake sediments; Shagawa Lake; model calibration; model reliability; sediment phosphorus release	SHAGAWA LAKE; MINNESOTA; EUTROPHICATION; SEDIMENTS; SUPPLIES	Water quality problems in lakes are frequently analyzed with the assistance of models that simulate the dynamic behavior of total phosphorus. Part I of this series used deterministic methods to evaluate the performance and reliability of models with different formulations and mechanisms. Complex models are often amenable to accurate calibration but may be sensitive to uncertainties in the model coefficients and errors in measured lake data. This paper uses stochastic methods (Monto Carlo) to examine the supposition that the appropriate level of model complexity depends on the accuracy of measured data and the uncertainty associated with model coefficients. Three total phosphorus models are used to test the methodology for Shagawa Lake.

Total phosphorus (T-P), total nitrogen (T-N), suspended solids (SS) and electronic conductivity (EC) were measured. T-P and SS concentrations varied in proportion to the discharge, and T-P concentrations increased with those of SS, too. EC varied inversely with the discharge, but the fluctuations of T-N concentrations were less than those of T-P and SS concentrations. Water quality remained, for the most part, constant throughout the day. T-P, T-N and SS load were 181t/year, 2320t/year and 51000t/year in 1992 respectively, 54% of T-P load, 47% of T-N load and 80% of SS loads outflowed in those cases where the discharge was more than 100 m(3)/s, which were 36 days in 1992. 79% of T-P load, 69% of T-N load and 92% of SS load outflowed in periods of high water discharge, which were 88 in 1992. T-P and T-N loads calculated by using one day's data in every month were 151t/year and 2450t/year. But nutrient loads calculated by using the average value of data from an ordinary discharge were two or three times lower than calculated yearly loads. These results showed the importance of estimating the yearly load considering the discharge condition and sampling at a time of high water discharge. Copyright (C) 1996 IAWQ.

The authors: have been studying the nutrient removal performance of the media-anaerobic-anoxic-oxic process (M-AAIO) using pilot plants, the media of which were suspending in an oxic tank (Mishima et al., 1995). The purpose of the M-AAO was to remove nutrients from sewage using a bioreactor half the size of the one used in the AAO process. The average water quality of the treated effluent of the M-AAO was 8.3 mg/l of T-N and 0.6 mg/l of T-P after a retention time of 8-9 hours in the bioreactor. According to the batch experimental results, 93% of nitrification at low water temperatures (below 15 degrees C) was performed by the biofilm on the media. The specific nitrification activity of the biofilm was high showing 5-10 mg-N/g-MLSS/hr at low water temperatures. Media nitrification largely depended on the dissolved oxygen (DO). The denitrification rate of the activated sludge increased almost in proportion to BOD-SS loading. It was suggested that the phosphorus uptake in the anoxic tank was closely linked to denitrification. Copyright (C) 1996 IAWQ.

Three reasons to use ecotechnological methods are given: they are cheap, minimize the use of raw materials and protect the global environment. In the article the most cost-efficient and environmentally friendly ecotechnologies for non-point source pollution management are given. These are divided into two categories: those done in the watershed and those used within the lake or reservoir. In the first category wetland use, restoration and construction is shown to efficiently reduce different kinds of pollution. The construction of small pre-impoundments is effective for trapping phosphorus as the main cause of eutrophication. In the category of in-lake approaches several are mentioned: biomanipulation or food web manipulation leading to decreased eutrophication, many approaches of mixing and aeration based on recent limnological knowledge, selective withdrawal as a manipulation of outflow and drinking water intake depths in reservoirs, the diversion of polluted inflow waters and sucking of hypolimnion waters. The limitations of the methods are given. Mathematical models helpful in optimizing the use of the corresponding methods are shown. Copyright (C) 1996 IAWQ.

Phytoplanktonic primary production had been recognized earlier as a link between mostly nonpoint nutrient loads to the Milwaukee River and degradation of water quality in the River. A mathematical model of a relevant section of the River was used in the study to estimate the effect of the removal of the Dam on this primary production link. The authors established the model using WASP, which is USEPA's widely used modelling package. The modelled extent of the River included both shallow, productive upstream reaches as well as impounded downstream sections. In the impounded reach of the River where the Dam is located, the simulated removal of the Dam (1) replaced net phytoplankton decay with net phytoplankton growth because of improved light conditions and limited settling; (2) substantially increased the concentration of DO because of the increased photosynthetic production and reduced benthic consumption; and (3) somewhat increased bottle BOD5 because of the elevated phytoplankton levels. The simulated removal of the Dam eliminated the negative effects of eutrophication at the site while possibly shifting the potential for these effects further downstream towards Lake Michigan.

Increasing demand on water supplies has stimulated the production or planning of many SAT systems that will use reclaimed wastewater for groundwater recharge. These systems are comprised of a series of infiltration basins. The design and operation of soil aquifer treatment systems presently relies primarily upon judgment and experience, This research effort is developing a methodology for determining the optimal operation of SAT systems that is based upon mathematically describing the problem as a discrete-time optimal control problem. The resulting mathematical problem is a large-scale nonlinear programming problem. Solution of the problem is being accomplished by interfacing a nonlinear programming optimizer, which is solved by a differential dynamic programming algorithm, with a simulator that describes the infiltration process, unsaturated flow, effects of surface clogging and biological clogging, biological removal of nitrogen and organics. Major efforts are devoted to numerical performance of the optimization model solution, and development of the simulator. Initial results of interfacing the optimizer with the simulator without water quality concern show high convergence rate. The operation pattern determined by this method is reasonable, This new methodology will be a tool for engineers to evaluate choices regarding the potential of the design and operation of SAT systems.

Zebra mussel at a threshold density of 0.25/L were able to decouple the nutrient-chlorophyll relationship, to induce erratic patterns in P and chlorophyll a trends, and to decrease mean algal cell sizes. Using shell length we explained 75 and 71% of the variability in P excretion rates in trials held at 17 and 22 degrees C. Using mass balance modeling, we examined the effects of zebra mussel growth and mortality on mean annual steady-state P levels as functions of hydraulic flushing and P loadings for the western basin of Lake Erie, for Lake St. Clair, and for Oneida Lake. Zebra mussel affected water column P levels only when the annual P accumulated into mussel biomass represented >20% of the lake's annual P loading. The mussel populations in all three lakes did not substantially affect water column P levels but decoupling of the nutrient-chlorophyll relationship was observed in lakes Erie and St. Clair. No evidence was found for increased decoupling of this relationship with increasing zebra mussel density in European lakes.

J	Jayaweera, M; Asaeda, T				Jayaweera, M; Asaeda, T			Impacts of environmental scenarios on chlorophyll-alpha in the management of shallow, eutrophic lakes following biomanipulation: An application of a numerical model	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						chlorophyll-alpha; eutrophic lakes; biomanipulation; numerical model; lake ecosystems; phytoplankton	NUTRIENT CONTROL; RESTORATION	Accurate prediction of species changes in lake ecosystems following biomanipulation measures is of paramount importance in view of water quality management. The temporal variation of phytoplankton biomass as chlorophyll-a and transparency as Secchi depth measurements are studied in the Lake Bleiswijkse Zoom, The Netherlands, with a comprehensive structural dynamic model. In the formulation of the biological model, phytoplankton as several species, zooplankton, detritus, planktivores and benthivores, and piscivores are considered to be major contributing state variables for the model. The primary goal of this paper is to describe the possible impacts of several environmental scenarios on chlorophyll-a biomass qualitatively as it would help lake and environmental managers and relevant authorities elucidate the processes of eutrophication and biomanipulation in a broad way. Some of the scenarios that have been studied by this model are: (1) The effect of fixed stoichiometry in terms of internal nitrogen and phosphorus that are tied up within algal cells; (2) the effects of external phosphorus limitation; (3) light limitation and external nitrogen limitation on algal growth; (4) probable consequences that have taken place within the chlorophyll-a biomass due to change in biomasses of various aquatic organisms; and (5) possible changes of chlorophyll-a biomass due to higher temperatures caused by global warming.

J	Harris, PJ				Harris, PJ			Water quality impacts from on site waste disposal systems to coastal areas through groundwater discharge	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY			English	Article						contaminated groundwater; on-site disposal systems; nutrient enrichment; nonpoint source pollution		This report summarizes research studies linking on-site waste disposal systems (OSDS) to pathogen and nutrient concentrations in groundwater with the potential to impact coastal embayments. Few studies connect OSDS to coastal water quality. Most studies examined pathogen and nutrient impacts to groundwater and omitted estimations of contaminants discharged to surface water. The majority of studies focused on nitrogen, with little information on pathogens and even less on phosphorus. Nitrogen discharged from OSDS poses the greatest threat to water quality. Vertical distance of septic tank infiltration system from the water table, septic system design, and siting remain the key components in minimizing potential impacts from OSDS for control of both pathogens and nutrients. The most comprehensive information connecting nutrient contributions from OSDS to surface water quality was the study conducted on Buttermilk Bay in Massachusetts where 74% of nitrogen to the bay was attributed to onsite disposal systems. In conclusion, further studies on the viability and transport of pathogens and nutrients through the groundwater aquifer and across the groundwater/surface-water interface are needed. Additional research on the importance of septic system design on the availability of contaminants to groundwater as well as the minimum distance between the septic system and water table necessary to protect groundwater are also indicated.

J	HOPKINSON, CS; VALLINO, JJ				HOPKINSON, CS; VALLINO, JJ			THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG MANS ACTIVITIES IN WATERSHEDS AND ESTUARIES - A MODEL OF RUNOFF EFFECTS ON PATTERNS OF ESTUARINE COMMUNITY METABOLISM	ESTUARIES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Pulsed Ecosystems - A New Paradigm/Estuarine-Research-Federation Meeting	NOV, 1993	HILTON HEAD ISL, SC	Estuarine Res Federat			MICROBIAL LOOP; ECOSYSTEM; CARBON; DYNAMICS; RIVER; TRANSPORT; NITROGEN; SEDIMENT; SWAMP; BACTERIA	Activities of man in rivers and their watersheds have altered enormously the timing, magnitude, and nature of inputs of materials to estuaries. Despite an awareness of large-scale, long-term changes in river-estuarine watersheds, we do not fully understand the consequences to estuarine ecosystems of these activities. Deforestation, urbanization, and agriculturalization have changed the timing. and nature of material inputs to estuaries. Conversion of land from forest to almost any other land use promotes overland flow of storm runoff; increases the timing, rate and magnitude of runoff; and increases sediment, organic matter, and inorganic nutrient export. It has been estimated that total organic carbon levels in rivers have increased by a factor of 3-5 over natural levels. Man's activities have also changed the magnitude of particulate organic carbon relative to dissolved organic carbon export and the lability of the organic matter. Historically, rivers and streams had different features than they do today. Two of man's activities that have had pronounced effects on the timing and quality of river water are channelization and damming. Agricultural drainage systems, channelized and deepened streams, and leveeing and prevention of overbank flooding have had the combined effect of increasing the amplitude and rate of storm runoff, increasing sediment load, increasing nutrient delivery downstream, and decreasing riparian wetland productivity. Dams on the other hand have altered natural discharge patterns and altered the downstream transfer of sediments, organic matter, and nutrients. Patterns of estuarine community metabolism are sensitive to variations in the timing, magnitude, and quality of material inputs from watersheds. The autotrophic-heterotrophic nature of an estuary is determined by three primary factors: the ratio of inorganic to organic matter inputs, water residence time, and the overall lability of allochthonous organic matter inputs. A simulation model is used to explore the effects of man's activities in watersheds on the spatial patterns of production and respiration in a generalized estuarine system. Examined are the effects of variations in the ratios of inorganic and organic nitrogen loading, the residence time of water in the estuary, the degradability of allochthonous organic matter, and the ratio of dissolved to particulate organic matter inputs. Simulations suggest that the autotrophic-heterotrophic balance in estuaries is more sensitive to variations in organic matter loading than inorganic nutrient loading. Water residence time and flocculation-sedimentation of organic matter are two physical factors that most effect simulated spatial patterns of metabolism in estuaries.

The treated spill broken down into several patches and drifted south and finally got deposited on the Murud shores and in the Rajpuri creek. The impact of the spill on biota was studied during 27-30 May 1993. Local abnormal concentrations of dissolved dispersed petroleum hydrocarbons (PHC) in the water column exposed pelagic biota to high levels of oil residues. Levels of chlorophyll-a and phaeophytin varied widely and were unevenly distributed. Few phytoplankton species like Nitzschia sp, were damaged with a coating of black layer of PHC, around the cell. Zooplankton in general were not severely affected though damage restricted to a few species of copepods, Lucifer, Sagitta bedoti and S. enflata showing oily coating on body surfaces or ingestion of PHC into the body leading to death in extreme cases. Drastic reduction in population density of chaetognaths was observed. As the PHC had not sedimented, no adverse impact on macro benthos was evident. Also, there was no evidence of damage to the fish and other marine life. Monitoring of the same area in May 1994 showed normal water quality and biological characteristics indicating the complete recovery of the marine environment off Murud.

Methodological standpoints concerning the limestone dissolution rate, acidic surges and reacidification are also discussed. L Alinenjarvi (0.45 km(2)) is located near the city of Nokia with a surrounding population of over 5 000 (< 2 km). Before liming,the lake had only a sparse crayfish (Astacus astacus L) population left, because reproduction had been failing since the early 1980s. The most important effect of liming is that it should connect with the potential production of crayfish. The roach (Rutilus rutilus L) population was also affected The liming improved the chemical quality of the water, and decreased also the Al and Mn concentrations. The number of phytoplankton species increased, and the species composition of periphyton changed after liming. The a-chlorophyll concentration in water remained low. Furthermore, crustacean zooplankton and benthic animals increased in abundance in the first late summer after liming. ?he diet analysis of perch (Perca fluviatilis L) gave comparable results suggesting a possible positive effect of liming on their food resources. The improved water quality seems to make the reproduction of the crayfish possible again, but recovery would take several years. To guarantee a recovery, the introduction of new crayfish individuals and supplementary neutralizing methods would be needed. The results of a mailed survey showed that L Alinenjarvi is a valuable water source for the local people. The most usual forms of leisure around the lake and shores are, however, outdoor recreation and swimming, with only minor usage for fishing. Despite that, though the immediate benefits would be negligible, a majority of local residents supported the continuation of liming even though they would have to carry the costs in the future.

The instances of severe ground-level fumigations that caused acute damage to vegetation in an area of approximately 1,000 km(2) have been nearly completely eliminated. Significant improvements in water quality have also occurred in many of the estimated 7,000 acid-damaged lakes. Several species of acid-sensitive phytoplankton, zooplankton and insects have invaded lakes where improvements have occurred. Epiphytic lichens have reinvaded the former ''lichen desert'' that once extended out 7 lan from the smelters. Sensitive species such as Evernia mesomorpha and Usnea hirta now exist throughout the area. The vascular plant communities have been relatively slow to recover in the most severely damaged terrestrial areas. Metal-tolerant grasses (e.g. Agrostis scabra, Deschampsia caespitosa) were the first species to invade the barrens. Acid- and metal-contamination of soil, severe microclimate conditions, and the damaging effects of insect pests appear to delay recovery of terrestrial ecosystems. Recovery rates of aquatic ecosystems are also affected by a suite of physical, chemical and biotic interactions and many lakes remain severely damaged.

The model was calibrated to a comprehensive set of field data for 1985-1986, and then used to simulate the period 1973-1992. The model represented the mean behavior of in-lake total phosphorus, dissolved available phosphorus, total nitrogen and chlorophyll a concentrations reasonably well during the calibration period. The model did not represent dissolved available nitrogen concentrations very well, nor did it capture much of the observed temporal variability during the calibration period. The model results identified important information needs to improve our understanding of the nitrogen cycle including, sediment-water nitrogen fluxes, denitrification and nitrogen fixation. Results from the 1973-1992 simulation indicated that model assumptions and/or calibration parameters were not uniformly applicable over this period. Total phosphorus concentration results from this model were compared with results from two site-specific, empirical loading models for the lake. None of these models represented annual average concentrations uniformly well over the entire 20-year period, and none captured much of the observed inter-annual variability. External total phosphorus loadings and lake hydrology are not sufficient to fully describe total phosphorus dynamics in Lake Okeechobee. Other important factors are diffusive sediment-water fluxes, wind-induced sediment resuspension, and the spatial heterogeneity in the lake.

In the present study, diagnostic and sensitivity analyses were conducted with the calibrated model to better understand factors controlling phytoplankton and load-response dynamics in the lake. Phytoplankton growth rate limitation due to underwater light attenuation appears to be substantially greater than growth rate limitation due to non-optimal phosphorus concentrations. Phytoplankton biomass appears strongly controlled by the supply rate of dissolved available phosphorus to the water column. The dynamics of total phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentrations in the lake are strongly influenced by sediment-water phosphorus fluxes. There is a wide range of uncertainty in responses of total phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentrations to changes in tributary phosphorus loadings. Much of this uncertainty is due to a lack of quantitative understanding of sediment responses to changes in tributary loadings. Other important factors are inter-annual variability in hydrometeorological conditions and the potential influence of wind-induced resuspension of particulate phosphorus. Responses of total phosphorus and chlorophyll a concentrations for a given change in tributary loading depend not only on the magnitide of the loading change, but also on the time frame after the loading change due to a lag in sediment response. Load-response predictions for Lake Okeechobee must lake into account changes in available phosphorus loadings to the water column, and must be premised on assumptions for changes in internal phosphorus loadings from the sediments. Results from this preliminary modeling analysis are provisional in that they do not include potential nitrogen limitation, potential interactions between phosphorus and nitrogen, or phytoplankton responses to potential nitrogen fixation.

Short-term DO and algal dynamics in a sub-tropical, nitrogen-limited, marine ecosystem are studied by means of a specially designed telemetry system. The high resolution data show clearly the importance of the vertical DO structure, and its relationship with environmental variables (solar radiation, water temperature, wind, tidal current) and phytoplankton dynamics. The design, instrumentation and calibration, and operational experience of the system are described. The simple and robust system has proved useful in (i) providing continuous data for full testing of water quality models, and (ii) the planning of field experiments to study algal dynamics.

Simulated nitrogen losses occur through volatilization, surface water and soil runoff, subsurface lateral flow, and leaching. Physical and crop management variables explain a moderate but significant proportion of the variation in nitrogen losses. Site slope and tillage have offsetting effects on surface and ground water losses. Nitrogen applications in excess of agronomic recommendations and manure obtained off the farm and applied to the sites are significant contributors to nitrogen losses. Farm characteristics such as production of confined livestock, total manure nitrogen available, and farm income per cropland acre explain a relatively large portion of the variability in manure nitrogen applied to survey sites. The results help to identify farm characteristics that can be used to target nutrient management programs. Simulation modeling provides a useful tool for investigating variables which contribute to agricultural nitrogen losses.

The framework integrates the EPIC-PST crop growth/chemical transport model and a mathematical programming model. The framework is applied to the evaluation of four water quality policies in the southern high plains of the United States: restrictions on per-acre nitrogen use, taxes on nitrogen use, taxes on irrigation water use, and incentives to convert conventional irrigation systems to modern irrigation technology. The results indicate that producers would make a variety of adjustments in responding to these policies. Important responses might include reductions in nitrogen and water use, crop substitution, removal of land from crop production and conversion from irrigated to dryland production. These four policies are evaluated based on changes in farm income and social welfare. The irrigation system conversion incentive clearly outperforms other policies from both society's and producers' points of view. Producers would prefer nitrogen use restrictions to nitrogen or water use tares because farm income would be reduced less under the restrictions than under the taxes. Nitrogen use tares, however, are more desirable than nitrogen use restrictions from society's point of view.

This region generates high phosphorus loads into the lake relative to other basins, causing environmental concerns. Field instrumentation and monitoring wells were installed at four experimental pasture sites in the Kissimmee River Basin to conduct research concerning water and phosphorus movement in flat, sandy, high-water-table soils. The focus was to obtain hydrologic/water quality data sufficient to determine surface/subsurface flow partitioning, and thus phosphorus flowpaths from the land phase to stream channels. A field-scale model was developed to simulate water and phosphorus movement from individual fields. This model, named FHANTM, is based on DRAINMOD with modifications to include simulation of phosphorus movement and routing of overland flow. The field monitoring data were used to calibrate and verify the modified model. This model was developed for use in predicting the effects on phosphorus movement to streams from application of management practices on the dairies.

It was designed to allow regional planners to alter land uses and management practices in the Lake Okeechobee basin and then view the environmental and economic effects resulting from the changes. The Lake Okeechobee basin coverage incorporates information about land uses, soil associations, weather regions, management practices, hydrologic features and political boundaries for approximately 0.6 million ha of land and consists of close to 7000 polygons. The system has the capability to generate reports and maps concerning regional land attributes, call external hydrologic simulation models as well as display historical water quality and quantity sampling station data. LOADSS runs on SUN SPARC stations using the ARC/INFO GIS software and requires 80 mb of hard disk storage.

It has only been in the last decade that P applied to land as animal waste has been recognized as a large potential problem. This problem is a result of the concentration of animals into a small area to the extend that so much waste is applied to land that the P fixing capacity of the soil is exceeded. One of the first areas where this problem was recognized was in the Lake Okeechobee drainage basin. When the sources of P in the lake were identified, regulators took action to have best management practices (BMP) implemented on dairies which were a primary source of P and also several research projects were initiated to determine if better BMP could be developed. One of the most successful BMPs thus far implemented is improvement of collection of waste in high intensity areas and routing this waste to improved lagoons. Preliminary data indicate that up to 90% of the P entering a lagoon system remains there in the sludge. A project to remove the P with a combination of chemical and biological reactions has also been successful thus far. It has been shown that aquatic macrophytes can be utilized to reduce the P moving from secondary lagoons toward the drainage canals. There is, however, a problem of what to do with the plants. The model LOADSS has been successful in predicting the effect of various management options in the watershed on amount of P which will enter the lake. If the management options described in this special issue of Ecological Engineering are not successful in reducing the P loads in the lake to acceptable limits, it may mean that large animal units should not be concentrated in many watersheds of the U.S. because of the probability of encountering P problems.

An off-field management practice that is widely used to control sediment and water-borne pollutants from entering surface waters is vegetated buffer (or filter) strips. When situated between a potential pollutant source and a surface water body that receives runoff, vegetated buffer strips have been shown to be very effective in removing substantial amounts of sediment and nutrients (primarily nitrogen and phosphorus) from the runoff. However, the effectiveness of vegetated buffer strips depends not only on their hydrologic and hydraulic characteristics but also on their physical characteristics (e.g., width and placement within the agricultural landscape). This paper examines the influence of width and placement of vegetated buffer strips on sediment yield in an agricultural watershed. The AGNPS hydrologic/water-quality model was linked with ARC/INFO geographic information system to predict sediment yield in the Bluegrass watershed in southern Iowa. The linked modeling system was also used to assess the impact of various buffer strip implementation strategies (width and placement along segments of the perennial stream) on sediment yield. When compared with the baseline condition, consisting of current land use/land management and no buffer strip, the vegetated buffer strip implementation strategies were effective in reducing sediment yield. For example, a buffer strip 30 m wide with a very dense alfalfa/smooth bromegrass stand reduced sediment yield by about 30% compared to the baseline condition. Furthermore, when the vegetated buffer strips were implemented along certain segments of the perennial stream within the watershed, disproportionate reductions in sediment yield were obtained.

The VFS reduced mass transport of ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N), total KjeEdahl nitrogen (TKN), ortho-phosphorus (PO4-P), total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (GOD), and total suspended solids (TSS). Mass transport of TKN, NH3-N, TP, and PO4-P were reduced by averages of 39, 47, 40, and 39%, respectively, by 3.1 m VFS and by 81, 98, 91, and 90%, respectively, by 21.4 m VFS. Effectiveness of VFS in terms of mass transport reduction was unchanged, however, beyond 3.1 m length for TSS and COD and averaged 35 and 51%, respectively. The VFS were ineffective in removing nitrate-nitrogen from the incoming runoff. Removal of litter constituents was described very well (r(2) = 0.70 to 0.94) by a first-order relationship between constituent removal and VFS length.

Although swine manure and other animal manures have been reported to physically ''seal'' lagoons to various degrees, long-term studies with sandy soil have been lacking. Two swine manure, anaerobic lagoons located in sandy, coastal plain soil were investigated. Both continued to have significant seepage after 3.5 to 5 years of receiving waste. Monitoring wells indicated broad seepage plumes, and much variation in concentrations of several parameters with well location, time, and depth of well. The variations indicate the difficulty of accurately monitoring and quantifying seepage transport of nutrients, and the complexity of developing groundwater transport models to accurately predict transport and transformations of chemical compounds, particularly ammonium and nitrate nitrogen, at various distances from the lagoon.

Several models predict that elevated levels of zooplanktivory will promote increases in phytoplankton abundance and corresponding decreases in water clarity. Because estimates of zooplanktivorous fish abundance are logistically difficult, empirical testing of these models has been limited. Our goal was to examine whether the impact of mysids and larval chaoborids on their herbivorous zooplankton prey is either transmitted to, or becomes uncoupled at, the phytoplankton and water quality levels. 2. A secondary analysis of ninety-eight correlation coefficients from twenty-five published and unpublished data sets indicated that on average 71% of all correlations agreed with the predictions of top-down trophic interactions, although most did so with only marginal or weak support. 3. Potential confounding by variable nutrient concentrations, alternative determinants of water clarity and omnivory may complicate simple interpretation of the influence of pelagic invertebrates on zooplankton in lakes.

The increase in dry weight of the sward was a result of a greater above-ground yield of certain forbs, particularly Filipendula, Scabiosa and Thymus. N treatment did not significantly increase the growth of other forbs, but there were no adverse effects even at N inputs as high as 80 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). 3 The forbs which responded positively to N addition had low Ellenberg Indicator Values. This index is unlikely to be an accurate predictor of how a species will respond to increases in N deposition. 4 The growth of the grass Brachypodium pinnatum did not increase significantly as a result of nitrogen addition. There was no evidence that increases in atmospheric nitrogen deposition will result in grass dominance and a loss of species diversity. 5 Growth of both grasses and forbs was probably limited by the availability of phosphorus. In these circumstances, high levels of N deposition may prove a greater threat to ground water quality than to species composition. 6 The growth of Brachypodium was adversely affected by a simulated grazing treatment. The response of forbs was variable; grazing reduced the growth of some species but had beneficial effects on others. Management practices such as grazing are likely to be a key factor in maintaining species diversity in chalk grasslands. 7 The critical load for a grazed, P-limited chalk grassland is calculated to be between 42 and 55 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). Neither Brachypodium nor any of the forbs showed different growth responses according to whether N was applied as ammonium or nitrate. A critical load for total N deposition should be calculated for chalk grasslands, and modified for local characteristics such as past and present management practises, and factors which may limit N assimilation (e.g. P status).

J	LUNG, WS; LARSON, CE				LUNG, WS; LARSON, CE			WATER-QUALITY MODELING OF UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND LAKE PEPIN	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article								There has been concern over the eutrophication in Lake Pepin in recent years, Particularly following algal blooms and fish kills in 1988. Currently, the Metropolitan Wastewater Treatment Plant is the largest point source of phosphorus above the lake. In this study, the Environmental Protection Agency's EUTRO5 model was used to evaluate phosphorus control alternatives at the Metro Plant, using data from 1988, 1990, and 1991. Model results indicate that under summer low-flow conditions, the most optimistic improvement in Lake Pepin water quality would be to reduce the average chlorophyll a levels from 60 mu g/L to 50 mu g/L, still well above the goal of 30 mu g/L. Chlorophyll a reductions are not expected under higher summer flow conditions such as those encountered in 1990 and 1991.

J	Roberts, RK; Howard, DD; Gerloff, DC; Johnson, LA				Roberts, RK; Howard, DD; Gerloff, DC; Johnson, LA			Economic analysis of nitrogen sources and placement methods in no-tillage corn	JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE			English	Article								No-tillage production reduces the effects of declining soil productivity and water quality where severe erosion is a concern, Proposed federal environmental regulations may restrict N fertilizer applications, thereby reducing no-tillage yields. Soil injected N is more effective than broadcast N, although costs of labor, equipment, and energy are higher for injection than for broadcasting. This study compares the levels of N required to achieve specified no-tillage corn (Zea mays L.) yields from injection vs. broadcast applications. The costs of achieving the specified yields also are compared. Data from field experiments conducted at the Milan, TN, Experiment Station in 1983, 1984, and 1985 are used to estimate corn yield response functions for injected and surface applied N. Results suggest that injecting requires 31% to 59% less N per acre than broadcasting to achieve average field experiment yields for 1983, 1984, and 1985. Even though machinery and labor costs are higher, costs of achieving 1983, 1984, and 1985 average experimental yields are $12, $8.76, and $9.63/acre lower for injecting urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) than for the least costly broadcast alternative. Similar reductions in cost for injected anhydrous ammonia (AA) compared with the least costly broadcast alternative are $16.99, $15.50, and $16.16/acre for 1983, 1984, and 1985, respectively. Results suggest that achieving average experimental yields through injection rather than broadcasting can reduce N use by at least 30% while reducing costs of fertilizer N and its application by as much as 50%.

J	PUTZ, K				PUTZ, K			THE IMPORTANCE OF PRE-RESERVOIRS FOR THE WATER-QUALITY MANAGEMENT OF RESERVOIRS	JOURNAL OF WATER SUPPLY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-AQUA			English	Article							LAKE	Pre-reservoirs are small reservoirs, with a water-retention time of a few days, that reduce the phosphorus input in main reservoirs. The process of phosphorus removal involves the biochemical conversion from the dissolved to the particulate form (mainly phytoplankton) and the sedimentation of this particulate matter. The input variables are light, orthophosphate concentration, temperature of the inflowing water and discharge. Benndorf & Putz have developed a method for calculating and predicting the removal rates of orthophosphate in pre-reservoirs. This method has been introduced successfully as a standard practice for water-quality management of reservoirs in the former German Democratic Republic.

Our objective was to develop predictive relationships between these variables that could be used in conjunction with remote sensing information on plant productivity to produce large-area estimates of N gas fluxes. Our hypothesis was that there are inherent relationships between plant productivity and N gas fluxes in tallgrass prairie because both are controlled by water and N availability. The research was carried out as part of a multi-investigator project, the First ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE, ISLSCP = International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Program), directed toward the use of remote sensing to characterize land-atmosphere interactions. Fluxes of N-2 (denitrification) and N2O were measured using soil core techniques. Estimates of annual flux were produced by temporal extrapolation of measured rates. Annual aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) was estimated from measurements of the maximum standing crop of plant biomass. There were strong relationships between ANPP and N gas fluxes, and between a satellite remote sensing-based index of plant productivity (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) and gas fluxes. We used these relationships to convert images of NDVI into images of N gas fluxes for one 83 ha watershed and for the entire 15 by 15 km FIFE site. These images were used to compute mean landscape gas fluxes (0.62 g N m(-2) y(-1) for N-2, 0.66 g N m(-2) y(-1) for N2O) and total N gas production for the two areas. Our flux and production values are useful for comparison with values produced by simulation models and site-specific studies, and for assessing the significance of N gas production to ecosystem and landscape scale processes related to nutrient cycling, water quality and atmospheric chemistry.

The lake has a history of water quality problems and has been an efficient trap for suspended sediment and sediment-associated contaminants. Based on bathymetric survey data, the loss of volume in Lake Pepin between 1897 and 1986 was estimated. The mass balance of the lake for total suspended solids, chlorophyll a, total and dissolved reactive phosphorus and total nitrogen for 9 June 1987 to 4 June 1988 was also estimated. Water was sampled at the inflow, mid-reach, and outflow of the lake. Lake Pepin is very eutrophic, based on concentrations of phosphorus, nitrogen and chlorophyll a. The lake volume decreased by approximately 21% between 1897 and 1986. Longitudinally, the greatest fraction of the whole-lake volume loss occurred in the upper lake (45%). Based on mass balance calculations, the lake trapped about half of the suspended solids entering the lake, but it had a small net export of chlorophyll a. The lake was a sink for phosphorus and nitrogen; however, it had a net export of total phosphorus at times during low flows in the summer of 1987. Internal loading of dissolved reactive phosphorus was prevalent during the summer of 1987. The only substantial export of total nitrogen occurred in June 1987 during a bloom of cyanobacteria. The lake should continue to be an efficient trap for suspended sediment and associated contaminants, but its trapping efficiency will continue to decline slowly as lake volume decreases. Lake Pepin will probably continue to experience water quality problems, such as nuisance algal growths and low dissolved oxygen, especially during summer low flows.

This study examined the relation between light availability and primary production in Lake Onalaska, a shallow, nutrient-rich impoundment of the Upper Mississippi River. Continuous water quality monitors recorded dissolved oxygen, temperature and light flux at a network of sites from July to September 1990 and these data were used to estimate the primary production, light availability and light attenuation coefficients. The gross primary production averaged 2.2 g C m(-2) day(-1) and was due almost entirely to phytoplankton. Production was strongly light-limited, with most of the light attenuation due to non-algal components, possibly related to wind resuspension in this shallow system. Regression analyses revealed significant effects of wind speed and direction on light attenuation.

This report documents NO2- concentrations in the major rivers entering Lough Neagh, which are frequently in the range of 100 to 150 mu g N L(-1) and exceed the European Community (EC) water quality guide values, The contribution of land drainage to NO2- loads carried by these rivers was estimated to be about 40%, The remaining 60% of NO2- appears to originate from N transformations at the sediment-water interface of the river system, The available evidence suggests that NH4+ originating from agricultural pollution provides the N substrate for nitrification by Nitrosomonas to NO2-. What Is anomalous Is why this NO2- is not further oxidized rapidly to NO3- by Nitrobacter, A possible mechanism is that the Nitrobacter is retarded by the presence of free ammonia concentrations that can be predicted to be present in the range of 65 to 76 mu g N L(-1).

Recent Federal regulations now require pollution prevention activities on many construction sites, but one of the most frequent complaints of those working to enforce these regulations is that it is difficult to get developers to apply prompt and effective temporary vegetative cover to disturbed areas. We evaluated a new approach in which temporary vegetative soil stabilization was applied rapidly and frequently to all bare areas on a construction site by a person independent of the construction process. Using field sampling of runoff from treated and untreated sites in North Royalton, Ohio, as well as computer modeling based on site condition maps, we found that rapid application of surface cover dramatically reduced both the amount of sediment generated by surface erosion and the concentration and total load of phosphorus in storm-water runoff. Rapid applications of surface cover reduced soil erosion by up to 86% and phosphorus loadings by up to 80% compared to bare-soil conditions. In addition, developers recognized the advantage of extensive green areas in marketing home lots and could see economic benefits for adopting an approach that went beyond their role in meeting regulatory requirements. This approach to construction-site erosion control significantly reduces nonpoint source pollution in the form of both phosphorus and sediment, and makes sense for both developers and those involved in regulation enforcement.

Additional water quality information and data over the trophic status of the lake were collected during shea visits carried out in April 1980, October 1985 and Jannuary 1986. Lake Chungara can be classified as a cold-polymictic, high altitude, tropical, volcanic, and saline lake. Cations in lake Chungara ranks as: Mg+2 > Na+ > Ca+2 > K+. The chemistry of water in lake Chungara is also dominated by: SO42-, CO2, HCO3-, Li, and Al. Large concentrations of P-PO4, up to 10 mu M 1(-1) were measured in the lake water. Nitrate and Silica in the lake, are in moderate concentrations. The phytoplankton in Lake Chungara is dominated by Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta. Zooplankton is dominated by calanoids and cladocerans. Fishes are present: Trichomycterus sp. (Trichomicteridae) and Orestias sp. (Cyprinodontidae). Lake Chungara is a sanctuary for an abundant migratory avifauna. The trophic status of this lake was estimated according to chlorophyll a concentration (1.49 mu g 1(-1)) as oligomesotrophic, and according to photosynthetic activity (0.0428 g C m(-2) h(-1)) as meso-eutrophic. Concurrence of unique physical, chemical and biological features make lake Chungara worth of further specific intensive studies and long term monitoring.

Data from 20 forested catchments (0.3-42 km(2)) in Finland and Sweden during the 10-year period 1979-88 were used to develop empirical multivariate regression models of average NO3-N, NH4-N and organic N export fluxes as a function of geomorphological, meteorological, hydrological, deposition and forest management variables. A combination of high inorganic N deposition or air temperature and a low extent of organic soils was related to (R(2) = 0.64) high losses of NO3-N. A strong correlation between N deposition and air temperature makes it difficult to distinguish the effects of one variable from the other. Retention of deposited nitrogen is still high in most of the catchments. High losses of NH4-N had the strongest correlation with forestry activities and stream density. A combination of drainage percentage and temperature was related to (R(2) = 0.53) losses of NH4-N. The most important factors explaining spatial variability of organic N losses were clearly forestry activities. A combination of high percentage of drainage and clear-cutting was related to (R(2) = 0.81) high organic N losses. However, within the catchments, large-scale forest management practices were needed before any clear effect on spatial variability was detected. All the equations obtained were influenced by the choice of a limited number of catchments. No causal relationships between losses and the explaining variables can be inferred from this type of study.

Diatoms, pollen, total and organic carbon (TOC), total and organic nitrogen, total sulfur, acid-soluble iron, an estimate of the degree of pyritization of iron (DOP), and biogenic silica (BSi) were used as paleoecological indicators in four cores collected from a transect across the Chesapeake Bay from the Choptank River to Plum Point, Maryland. This paper covers results for diatoms, pollen, and BSi. Sediments were dated using radiocarbon and pollen techniques, and sedimentation rates were determined (0.2-5.8 mm/yr) using pollen methods. Geochemical indicators were measured and diatom species identified at subsampled intervals within each core. More than 400 diatom species, primarily marine and estuarine taxa, were identified in the sediments, some for the first time. Analysis of the data indicates that sedimentation rates, eutrophication, turbidity, and anoxia have increased in the Chesapeake Bay since the time of European settlement of the watershed. There is also evidence that freshwater input to the mesohaline Chesapeake Bay has increased. Changes in diatom community structure and geochemical indicators reflect major changes in land use patterns of the watershed and increasing population. Diatom community diversity exhibits a continuing decline, while centric/pennate ratios rise dramatically in most recent sediments.

We sampled on an event basis, beginning in 1973 for some constituents in bulk precipitation. Beginning in 1981, we also sampled wet precipitation separately from bulk precipitation. In this report, we examine temporal variability of precipitation chemistry at different time scales. Several constituents showed long-term trends. In bulk precipitation, hydronium concentration increased by 27% of its mean concentration per decade, calcium by 67%, ammonium by 28%, and nitrate by 25%, while organic nitrogen decreased by 41%, organic phosphorus by 31%, and organic carbon by 16%. In wet precipitation, ammonium increased by 33% and calcium by 100%, while magnesium decreased by 78% per decade. Concentrations differed greatly among precipitation events, increasing as the volume of precipitation decreased and as the interval since the previous event increased. Most constituents also showed marked seasonal variation. We used a regression model to predict concentrations for each event from month, precipitation volume, and the time since the previous event. We evaluated how much of the interannual variability could be explained by these factors. The event-scale model accounted for almost half of the variability among annual means for ammonium, sodium, and magnesium in bulk precipitation, and for potassium in wet precipitation. This suggests that much of the interannual variability of concentrations may result from interannual variation in the temporal distribution of precipitation.

This mass balance model for nitrogen has been used to estimate the impacts of land use change and climate change on river water quality. Changing agricultural patterns have been simulated and indicate increased nitrogen levels in the river as catchment land use changes. Climate change will alter flow regimes, temperature and nitrogen mineralization patterns. Simulation runs for a range of scenarios illustrate the impacts of climate change with the most significant effect being mineralization of nitrogen in the soil feeding through into the river system. These higher nitrogen levels are reduced slightly by the increased temperatures and decreased summer hows, both of which enhance denitrification processes.

The ENR Project is a 3815 acre (1545 ha) pilot project, located in Palm Beach County. The operation of the treatment system will he used to demonstrate the performance of larger scale constructed wetland systems for removal of phosphorus from Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) stormwater runoff. It is currently the largest stormwater wetland treatment system in the world. The SHEET2D model was used to analyze the performance of the ENR Project. SHEET2D is a two-dimensional, depth-averaged hydrodynamic model that is applicable to shallow water flow conditions. Subsequently, results from SHEET2D simulations were used to develop the ENRMOD model. ENRMOD is a lumped parameter box water quality model that can be used to analyze the long term performance of the ENR project with respect to hydrology and phosphorus uptake. Localized short-circuiting in the agricultural ditches within the project area was analyzed by using the RBFVM-2D model, which is a finite volume hydrodynamic model that is also applicable to shallow water flow conditions. The SHEET2D model was employed to simulate the hydraulics of the structures between cells and the hydrodynamics of the sheet-flow moving across the buffer cell and treatment cells. Collection, distribution, and larger discharge canals within the project were simulated by means of the MultiBasin Routing (MBR) model features that are built into the SHEET2D model. Constant inflows (75 to 600 cfs [2.1 to 17 m(3)/s]) were used in all runs to simulate the discharge of the ENR Project based on the proposed operating schedule for the outflow pump station. The model simulated 30 days to reach steady state conditions. Under steady state conditions, the hydraulic retention times were computed for the project and the split of flow between the two treatment trains of the entire project from the common buffer cell. Additionally, design components such as height of the levees, capacity of the structures, and hydrographs at specified grids were obtained.

J	JEWELL, PW				JEWELL, PW			A SIMPLE SURFACE-WATER BIOGEOCHEMICAL MODEL .1. DESCRIPTION, SENSITIVITY ANALYSES, AND IDEALIZED SIMULATIONS	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Review							HUDSON-RARITAN ESTUARY; CATALYTIC-OXIDATION METHOD; STATES CONTINENTAL-SHELF; DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; MIXED LAYER; 3-DIMENSIONAL SIMULATION; PHYTOPLANKTON GROWTH; PLANKTON DYNAMICS; SEASONAL DISTRIBUTION; CHLOROPHYLL MAXIMA	Accurate simulation of surface productivity, dissolved nutrient and oxygen concentrations, and particulate carbon flux are critical components of any viable surface water quality model. A linear, three-component model consisting of a dissolved limiting nutrient, phytoplankton, and zooplankton coupled to a one-dimensional turbulence closure fluid flow model has been constructed and applied to a generalized surface water setting. The model transfers nutrients from the euphotic zone to the subeuphotic zone using empirical biogenic flux-depth relationships. The model does not require specification of biogenic particle settling velocity which is known to vary by at least 2 orders of magnitude in natural surface waters and thus constitutes a major source of uncertainty in many biogeochemical models. Using an empirical biogenic flux-depth function to transfer nutrients through the water column introduces spatial errors which are most extreme in deep water. The model is thus most appropriate for lakes, estuaries, and shallow (<1000 m deep) marine settings. Restricting the model to three components with seven empirical constants permits a high degree of computational efficiency. Sensitivity analyses of the empirical constants show that integrated surface productivity is responsive to the three constants related to light (initial slope of the light-productivity curve, light attenuation coefficient of the water, and photosynthetically available radiation) while being relatively insensitive to constants which are strictly related to biogeochemical transformations (remineralization rate, nutrient half-saturation constant, maximum zooplankton growth rate, and Ivlev constant for zooplankton growth). Model simulations using idealized Surface temperature boundary conditions produce thermal and biogeochemical characteristics of a typical temperate-latitude lake. The simulations also suggest that vertical mixing plays an important role in producing the late seasonal, deep chlorophyll maximum commonly observed in many surface water settings.

The first order kinetic rate constants for both organic carbon and organic nitrogen degradation in fish ponds were evaluated. The rate constants were computed by either relating the measured rate of disappearance of the substrate concentration or by the comparison of the measured with a theoretically derived evolution pattern of organic carbon or nitrogen concentrations in model ponds. The organic carbon degradation rate constant was found to be 0.15/day. The organic nitrogen degradation rate constant was expected, theoretically to be about 0.06/day and was found experimentally to be in the range of 0.05-0.09/day. These values seem to be reasonable approximations for constantly aerated-mixed ponds, at a temperature range of 20-30 degrees C. Organic matter previously metabolized in anoxic sites at the pond (e.g. resuspended sediments), has a degradation rate of ca. 0.6/day, and can thus consume large amounts of oxygen in the water body.

The average concentration and load of soluble P in the runoff were significantly greater from the no-till than from other tillage treatments. Only moldboard plowing after surface broadcasting of P fertilizer reduced the soluble P concentration below 0.05 mg-P/L, a concentration of total P believed to promote eutrophication. For the Catlin soil, a variety of tillage practices (disk, field cultivation, and strip-till) appeared to result in soluble P concentrations of approximately 0.14 mg-P/L. For the Tama soil, disk-harrow followed by field cultivation and harrow after fertilizer application appeared to reduce soluble P concentration in the runoff to approximately 0.06 mg-P/L. These results concur with other results reported in the literature which suggest that dissolved P concentrations in runoff from reduced tillage systems (particularly no-till) may be problematic for water quality if fertilizer P is surface applied.

P loading increased slowly after forest clearance and early settlement in the late 1800s, then increased exponentially from the late 1940s to early 1970s, and finally decreased after the mid-1970s in response to management practices implemented to improve water quality. Similarly, the sediment accumulation rate of NAIP increased rapidly during the 1940s and 1950s, peaked during the late 1960s and early 1970s, and then decreased after the mid-1970s. The signal of delta(13)C(orgC) normalized to account for the historic 1.4 parts per thousand depletion in delta(13)C of atmospheric CO, mirrors that for accumulation of NAIP in sediments. Our results show that paleoproductivity peaked in the lower Great Lakes during the mid-1970s but has since declined as a result of P abatement programs. Inferred trends for NAIP and delta(13)C(orgC) are those predicted in P-limited lacustrine systems and demonstrate that the carbon isotopic ratio of organic C can be used as a proxy for paleoproductivity in large, deep lakes.

J	YOSHIDA, Y; NAKAHARA, H				YOSHIDA, Y; NAKAHARA, H			RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE DOMINANT PHYTOPLANKTON AND DIN/DIP RATIOS IN LAKE BIWA	NIPPON SUISAN GAKKAISHI			Japanese	Article							PICOPLANKTON	The relationships between the dominant phytoplankton and the factors of water quality were examined in Lake Biwa, referring to the Shiga Prefecture's data. In the lake, TN (total nitrogen): TP (total phosphorus) and DIN (dissolved inorganic nitrogen): DIP (dissolved inorganic phosphorus) ratios tended to be lower with increased WT (water temperature), and this was more remarkable for DIN: DIP ratios than TN: TP ratios. As one of the causes, it was suggested that TN: DIN ratios increased and DIN decreased with increased WT. The relationships between the dominant phytoplankton and the factors of water quality were considerably variable and complex. Uroglena americana and Asterionella formosa occurred in waters with low WT and TN: DIN ratios and with high DW, TN: TP and DIN: DIP ratios. On the other hand, Microcystis aeruginosa and Anabaena affinis occurred in waters with high WT, TN: DIN, TP: DIP ratios and with low DW, TN: TP and DIN: DIP ratios. These results suggest that the examination on the relationships between the dominant phytoplankton and the factors of water quality was one of the useful methods to clarify the distinctive features of phytoplankton and to forecast the occurrence of algal blooms.

J	CRIPPS, SJ				CRIPPS, SJ			SERIAL PARTICLE-SIZE FRACTIONATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF AN AQUACULTURAL EFFLUENT	AQUACULTURE			English	Article						TECHNIQUES - PARTICLE SIZE FRACTIONATION; WATER QUALITY; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN		The particulate phase of the effluent from a salmonid hatchery was serially divided into seven size fractions using 200, 100, 85, 65, 47, 25, and 5 mu m pore size nylon membranes. The main aim was to determine the nutrient distribution associated with the particles and use this information to determine the screen pore size that would remove those particles containing the greatest nutrient load. Treatment effort could thus be targeted more efficiently on the particles likely to have the greatest environmental impact. It was considered likely that particles of a specific size would contain elevated nutrient concentrations, resulting from their origin in the diet. The total, dissolved and particulate phosphorus and nitrogen, suspended solids, and various particle size parameters, such as mean particle diameter and total particle volume, of each fraction were determined. Ranges in concentrations of the fractions were: total phosphorus, 131.7-67.9 mu g/l; total nitrogen, 0.70-0.47 mg/l; suspended solids, 6.9-1.8 mg/l; total particle volume concentration, 26.17-2.15 mu m(3)/l . 10(9); and particle number concentration, 602-378/1 . 10(3). No single separated particle size fraction contained a disproportionate concentration of total phosphorus, total nitrogen, total particle volume concentration, or particle number concentration. The phosphorus content, in both the suspended solids and the volume of the particles, increased significantly with decreased particle size. The concentrations of suspended solids and total particle volume in the small pore size fractions were, however, less than in larger fractions. Total phosphorus and total nitrogen concentrations were therefore unaffected by variations in the particulate phosphorus concentration associated with different size particles. The nutrients' and solids' removal efficiency data for each fraction could be used to estimate the minimum achievable removal efficiencies of a commercial effluent screening device with a specified pore size. Total particle volume concentration was significantly correlated with suspended solids concentration and so could be used in place of the latter term. Total particle volume concentration could be measured to lower concentrations than suspended solids concentration. Particle size analysis, used in conjunction with other techniques; such as fractionation and nutrient analysis, is a powerful tool for the characterisation of aquacultural wastes and for the improvement in wastewater treatment efficiency.

J	SHARPLEY, AN; ROBINSON, JS; SMITH, SJ				SHARPLEY, AN; ROBINSON, JS; SMITH, SJ			BIOAVAILABLE PHOSPHORUS DYNAMICS IN AGRICULTURAL SOILS AND EFFECTS ON WATER-QUALITY	GEODERMA			English	Article							IMPREGNATED FILTER-PAPER; AVAILABLE PHOSPHORUS; RUNOFF; LOSSES; TRIBUTARIES; EXTRACTION; SORPTION; SEDIMENT; NITROGEN; ALUMINUM	The transport of bioavailable phosphorus (BAP, i.e., algal available) in agricultural runoff can accelerate freshwater eutrophication. As procedural and theoretical limitations have restricted BAP estimation in agricultural soils and runoff, a routine method was developed using iron oxide-impregnated paper strips (Fe-oxide strips) as a sink for BAP. Fe-oxide strips were used to investigate the amounts and seasonal dynamics of BAP in 12 Oklahoma soils over 2 years and the effect of agricultural management on BAP loss in runoff from these 12 and 8 additional sites over 4 years. The sites involved native grass, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.], and peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.). The strip P content of unfertilized soils was higher in winter (October-March; 10-19 mg kg-1) than spring months (May-June; 3-6 mg kg-1). For the P-fertilized soils, the strip P content increased from 8-17 mg kg-1 prior to P application (20-25 kg ha-1 yr-1) to 33-42 mg kg-1 immediately following application. Seasonal dynamics of strip and organic (OP) and inorganic P (IP) fractions indicated mineralization of moderately labile OP, as a function of phosphatase enzyme activity, and release of moderately labile IP and fertilizer P, as a function of P sorption capacity; these are the major processes controlling the strip P content of unfertilized and fertilized soil, respectively. Dissolved organic P did not reduce the efficiency of IP sorption by the Fe-oxide strips and removal of P from the strips by NaOH rather than H2SO4 minimized hydrolysis of OP sorbed on the strip. The loss of BAP in runoff was a function of watershed management. Over the 4-yr study, BAP losses increased in the order reduced till (98 g ha-1 yr-1), native grass (160 g ha-1 yr-1), no till (382 g ha-1 yr-1), and conventional till (678 g ha-1 yr-1). Although the total P loss was 93% lower from no till than conventional till, 73% was bioavailable for no till compared to only 28% for conventional till. Clearly, strip P is a dynamic soil property, which, along with watershed management, can influence the bioavailability of P loss in runoff. Thus, the BAP content of runoff in conjunction with runoff and erosion potential may provide a more reliable index of the trophic response of receiving water bodies than dissolved or total P.

Previous studies determined that the unsewered sanitation systems in the recharge areas are the main source of nitrogen. Calculations are made in this study to estimate the maximum population density allowable without improved sewage systems in order to keep the nitrogen levels in ground water below the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Results were achieved employing a mass balance that involved the concentration and rate of domestic effluents and the flow rate in the aquifer, as well as an estimation of the effects caused by the agricultural activity. It was concluded that, in general terms, the population density must not exceed 45 inhabitants per hectare. Otherwise, sewage systems and treatment plants are necessary. These conclusions provide a basis for urban growth planning, which will protect ground water quality. The method used in this case should apply to similar situations.

J	SPALING, H				SPALING, H			ANALYZING CUMULATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL-EFFECTS OF AGRICULTURAL LAND DRAINAGE IN SOUTHERN ONTARIO, CANADA	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						CANADA; CUMULATIVE EFFECTS; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT; DRAINAGE; AGRICULTURE	WATER-QUALITY; STREAM WATER; LOSSES; DEGRADATION; PESTICIDE; ATRAZINE; SOIL	The temporal and spatial attributes of agricultural land drainage suggest that drainage is a potential source of cumulative environmental change. This paper applies a cumulative effects model of drainage to the case of southern Ontario, Canada. The application is focused on the cumulative effects of drainage on volume and timing of water flow, content of nitrate-nitrogen and atrazine residue in receiving channels, and area and distribution of wetlands. These are investigated using available information on drainage-environment interactions and geographic information system (GIS) technology. Available data show that the combined effect of two pathways of accumulation in drained areas (i.e. subsurface flow and runoff) increases the content of nitrate in water, but decreases the atrazine content, relative to the single pathway (i.e. runoff) in undrained areas. Drainage alters timing and volume of water flow at the field scale, but evidence of accumulation of these changes at the watershed scale is inconclusive for southern Ontario. This is attributed to counteractive processes and constraints of available data bases. Fragmentary effects are evident in the spatial association between drainage density and change in area and contiguity of wetlands at the subregional and regional scales. Application of GIS demonstrated that 47% of the decline in total wetland area (1312 ha) in Peel Township during 1800-1990 is attributable to subsurface drainage. Average patch size decreased nearly 50%, and the number of large patches (> 50 ha) declined by about 65%. In southern Ontario, counties with the greatest reduction in wetland area are consistently characterized by high drainage density. Collectively, the empirical application demonstrated the utility of the cumulative effects model, and showed that it is possible to conduct a cumulative effects analysis using available information sources.

Multiple regression models derived from airborne imagery on 16 May 1990 accurately depicted phytoplankton biomass and turbidity within aquaculture impoundments. To examine their temporal validity, the exact models, as well as identical model forms, were fit to similar imagery and in situ data collected on 20 June 1990. None of the exact models for 16 May accurately predicted in situ data on 20 June; however, model forms were robust for describing in situ variables. To examine their spatial validity, identical model forms were fit to in situ data partitioned among phytoplankton composition and biomass. The fit of the models and the contribution of imagery variables to the models varied among in situ variables. Although imagery variables explained all of the observed variability for turbidity, regression tree modeling indicated that a significant proportion of the variability in chlorophyll distribution both among and within impoundments was explained through both imagery variables and phytoplankton biomass. Consequently, universal models for the airborne remote sensing of water-quality variables in systems having distinct optical signatures is unlikely. Rather, robust site-specific models will need to be developed.

J	VANDENBRINK, C; ZAADNOORDIJK, WJ				VANDENBRINK, C; ZAADNOORDIJK, WJ			EVALUATION OF GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION FROM NONPOINT SOURCES - A CASE-STUDY	GROUND WATER			English	Article							UNSATURATED SOILS	In many countries a substantial part of the drinking-water supply comes from subsurface-water resources. During the last several decades an increasing extent of diffuse pollution has endangered these water resources. Knowledge of the changes in ground-water quality is necessary in order to know if, and to what extent, ground-water quality is endangered. Changes in ground-water quality can be predicted by means of models describing both the ground-water flow and the transport of contaminants. A Geographic Information System is an efficient tool to handle the storage and manipulation of the large amount of data needed for the description of diffuse pollution. A methodology to predict changes in ground-water quality, which is called FLUNIT, has been built around the programs FLUZO, NITRON, ARC/INFO, dBASE, and WELCON, and the ground-water flow package TRIWACO. The method runs on a PC (with 386 processor). The system has been applied to a well field on Csepel Sziget (near Budapest, Hungary). The purpose was not so much the prediction of the ground-water quality, but much more the evaluation of ground-water protection strategies based on risk analysis and effectivity of possible measures. The system has been designed in such a way that the important information can be used with the available resolution, and that new and more detailed data can be added efficiently. Change of the nitrogen concentrations in the extracted water can be predicted. The resolution is sufficient for the evaluation of alternative ground-water protection strategies. Moreover, detailed insight into changes in ground-water quality can be obtained quickly.		VANDENBRINK, C (corresponding author), IWACO,CHOPIN LAAN 12,POB 8064,9702 KB GRONINGEN,NETHERLANDS.

Model validation is supported by comprehensive field monitoring and kinetic experiment programs, and a mass-transport model. The river is severely impacted by the inflow from ionically polluted hypereutrophic Onondaga Lake. Chemical-based density stratification is induced in the river, and attended by violations of dissolved oxygen (DO) and free ammonia standards in the ower layer of the river. The model performed well in matching DO depletions in the lower layer of the river, and diurnal variations in DO. Model projections demonstrate DO standards can only be met by eliminating chemical stratification in the river. The water-quality model is to be used to support regional planning of domestic waste treatment and disposal, including diversion of a major discharge to the river.

Groundwater samples collected from the facility during 1989 to 1990 were analyzed for pathogens. A specific basin was selected during the 1990 to 1991, 1991 to 1992, and 1992 to 1993 recharge seasons for sampling source water (tertiary effluent), pore-liquid samples from the vadose zone, and groundwater during recharge. These samples were analyzed for the nitrogen species, dissolved organic carbon (DOG), and total organic halide (TOX). The results showed that the site provides effective SAT. Enteroviruses were completely removed during travel in the 37-m (120-ft) thick vadose zone. No Giardia were detected in any of the groundwater samples. The DOC and TOX were reduced by 92% and 85%, respectively. After leaching of indigenous nitrogen from the vadose zone, total nitrogen was reduced by approximately 47% during recharge. Near-surface anaerobic conditions promote denitrification.

J	EJAZ, MS; PERALTA, RC				EJAZ, MS; PERALTA, RC			MODELING FOR OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL AND DOMESTIC WASTE-WATER LOADING TO STREAMS	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							WATER-QUALITY MANAGEMENT; SIMULATION-OPTIMIZATION	A simulation/optimization (S/O) model to aid managing multiobjective wastewater loading to streams while maintaining adequate downstream water quality is presented. The conflicting objectives are to maximize the human and dairy cattle populations from which treated wastewater can be discharged to the river system. Nonindustrial municipal (domestic) wastewater undergoes primary and secondary treatment by a sewage treatment plant (STP) before entering as a steady point source. Dairy wastewater is treated by overland flow (OLF) land treatment before entering the stream as a controlled steady diffuse source. Maximum dual-source loading strategies which do not degrade downstream water quality beyond specified limits are developed. For each computed loading strategy, an optimal OLF system design is also determined. The E constraint method is used to obtain sets of noninferior solutions. Sets of noninferior solutions are represented graphically to show the trade-off between human and bovine populations that can be maintained. Each set is computed for a different upstream flow rate to illustrate sensitivity to nondeterministic upstream flow rates. The nonlinear constraints utilized restrict downstream concentrations of 5-day biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen (organic, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate), organic and dissolved phosphorus, and chlorophyll a. Concentrations are described via regression equations. The new regression expressions, surrogates for the complex advective-dispersive equation, permit rapid and feasible solutions by this unique S/O model.

The quantitative description of the algal population growth is of primary importance to understand the mechanisms which lead to these phytoplankton blooms, hence also for the development of a successful water-quality management. Due to the high degree of complexity of phytoplankton blooms, dynamic simulation models may be a powerful tool to study and elucidate the mechanisms leading to these blooms. In the present study, a simulation model for the blooming of a natural population of Oscillatoria agardhii in Lake Vechten (lat. 52 degrees 04'N, long. 5 degrees 05'E, the Netherlands) using measured temperature, filament length and nutrient concentrations as external drives, is presented. The lake was sampled weekly from January to the middle of May, 1992. Temperature, nutrient concentration (nitrate and phosphate in the water) and filament length were recorded. Because cell size was constant, filament length could be converted to number of cells per litre to estimate algal biomass. To implement the model additional information, e.g. some algal growth parameters, was obtained from the literature. The model simulated well the growth of the Oscillatoria agardhii population in the lake during the research period. According to the model, temperature was the most important rate-limitating factor for growth at the beginning of the year. Nutrient limitation became increasingly important while the importance of temperature limitation decreased during the season. During the whole period, light was strongly limiting and became the most important rate-limiting factor in the second week of April. Via sensitivity analysis, the model showed to be highly affected by temperature-related factors, and it was useful in the identification of research needs.

Lake sediments, however, can be used as natural archives of perturbation histories, e.g. acidification and eutrophication. At present the use of simple weighted averaging models permits the reconstruction of a variety of water chemical variables from diatom and other microfossils preserved in lake sediments (pH, total phosphorus, salinity and lakewater temperature). Sediment records can, therefore, provide lake-specific background data for lake management as well as information about their ecological histories. The common models used in palaeolimnology (dating, transfer-functions) are reviewed and their role in environmental monitoring discussed. Predictions of future lake water quality following lake restoration methods tend to be made from dynamic mathematical models, but they are also used for hindcasting (e.g. the MAGIC model of catchment acidification). A problem with using dynamic models is that they are often site-specific and require calibration for a given lake. Combined with reliable dating, chemical reconstructions from microfossil-based transfer functions offer the possibility of testing hindcast predictions derived from dynamic mathematical models, e.g. for salinity, TP and pH. In this way, sediment microfossil-based models can assist with the parameterization of more complex, dynamic models of contemporary processes. In this review, comparisons between the two approaches (sediment-based and dynamic models) are given and possible future interactions outlined. Validation of mathematical models by palaeolimnological data might enhance their predictive ability when used for forecasting lake recovery. There is clearly, however, a need for a more rigorous approach to palaeolimnology, i.e. critical hypothesis generation. Multidisciplinary studies of lake disturbance, that combine palaeolimnology, dynamic modelling and contemporary process studies, would also be beneficial.

The biogeochemical cycling of elements is significantly affected by man's activities. With the growing awareness of human impact on quality of rivers, emphasis is given more towards a holistic treatment of a river as an ecosystem. In the present study, an attempt is made to estimate the organic carbon transport from the Himalayan rivers. The transfer of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) and particulate organic carbon (POC) from the Himalayan rivers is estimated to be about 7.6 and 9 million tons per year. High concentrations of P-PO4 are found in all the Indian rivers, which may be due to human interference. Pronounced temporal and seasonal variation for DOC and P-PO4 have been reported. The flux of P-PO4 and particulate inorganic phosphorus (PIP) from the Indian rivers to the ocean is 19.5 X 10(10) g yr(-1) and 1.5 X 10(12) g yr(-1) respectively. Comparisons were made with the prominent world rivers.

An 11-yr (1982-1992) study was conducted to assess NO3 losses to subsurface, tile drainage for corn (Zea mays L.) grown with continuous conventional tillage (CT) and no tillage (NT) on a poorly drained Webster clay loam soil (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Haplaquoll) at Waseca, MN. Nitrogen was applied at an annual application rate of 200 kg ha(-1). Mean annual subsurface drain dow during the 11-yr period was 35 mm higher for NT (315 mm) compared with CT (280 mm). Flow-weighted nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations increased dramatically in the wet gears (1990 and 1991) following the dry period of 1987 to 1989. Flow-weighted NO3-N concentrations during the 11-yr period averaged 13.4 and 12.0 mg L(-1) for CT and NT, respectively. Although subsurface drain Bow was 12% higher with NT, NO3-N losses were about 5% higher with CT mainly due to higher NO3-N concentrations with CT in the last 2 yr. Corn grain yields and N removal were significantly higher in 6 out of 11 yr with CT compared with NT with no difference between tillage systems in the other 5 yr. Grain yields averaged 8.6 Mg ha(-1) with CT and 7.3 Mg ha(-1) with NT during the 11-yr period. Multiple regression equations showed that annual Bow-weighted NO3-N concentration is best predicted from residual son NO3 in the 0- to 1.2-m profile and spring rainfall while NO3-N flux can be predicted wed from May and June rainfall. Results from this long-term study indicate that on this poorly drained soil, CT had a positive effect on corn grain yield and N removal compared with NT, but tillage systems had minimal impact on NO3 losses to subsurface drain Bow. Higher drain Bow with NT does not necessarily result in higher NO3-N fluxes lost via subsurface drainage.

This allows water to be safely recycled to the fish and results in a comparatively 'non-polluting' final effluent. As with other mariculture systems, only similar to 25% of the food-N was used for fish growth. The dominant processes affecting N within the system were excretion by fish of ammonia-N (30%), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) (30%) and faeces-N (10%), rapid transformation of DON to ammonia-N (16%) in the fish tank and uptake of ammonia-N (17 to 39%) by the seaweed (all percentages expressed relative to food input). Nitrification (10%) competed with the seaweed for the available ammonia-N. There was only minimal uptake of nitrate by the seaweed. Anoxic conditions developed in the sedimentation tank. Denitrification (5%) and bacterial ammonification, including sulphate reduction, were observed. The system showed only minor seasonality, probably because the major processes (food input and U, lactuca uptake) had only a slight dependence on temperature. Our quantitative understanding of the processes affecting N within the system was confirmed by a parallel study in which a computer simulation model was developed which was able to predict well the observed changes in ammonia-N, total oxidised N and U. lactuca growth. There was an excess of phosphorus in the food supplied. It was removed by the seaweed (9 to 21%) but to a lesser degree than ammonia-N. The residual organic matter in the sedimentation tank was enriched in P, probably because of the presence in the food of bone meal which is resistant to bacterial decay. The final effluent discharged contained 20 to 27% of the N supplied (and 39 to 47% of the P) which is less than half the N discharged from conventional mariculture technology.

However, there are difficulties in applying mass balance to marine systems, particularly with regard to parameters involved in tidal flushing. A well defined tidal channel at the entrance to Lough Hyne allows the use of adapted mass balance models to study the nutrient economy, and to make inferences about system scale productivity. Water quality gathered over four years demonstrated a net input to the lough for three different nutrients. There was a net tidal input of dissolved inorganic phosphorus. Significant inputs of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved inorganic silicon came from freshwater sources. In two of the years a net input of dissolved inorganic nitrogen from the sea was also detected. Scaling the net inputs with flushing terms in a mass balance leads to estimates of the net system productivity. From a dissolved inorganic phosphorus budget, the uptake of nutrient in the lough implied a net system production of 11-33 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Budgets for nitrogen suggest that a degree of denitrification occurred. Dissolved inorganic silicon budgets underestimated the net system production determined using dissolved inorganic phosphorus by about 50%. An examination of chlorophyll transport suggests that about 28% of the net system production may be exported to the open sea as phytoplankton. Mass balance can be used as a simple starting point for comparing different systems. This is likely to emphasise the importance of catchment type and size, along with tidal flushing scales in determining the local rates of processes such as net system metabolism.

J	SINGH, P; KANWAR, RS				SINGH, P; KANWAR, RS			MODIFICATION OF RZWQM FOR SIMULATING SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE BY ADDING A TILE FLOW COMPONENT	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE; WATER QUALITY; HYDROLOGIC MODELING	PREFERENTIAL FLOW; TILLAGE SYSTEMS; SOIL; FERTILIZATION; INFILTRATION; NITROGEN	Fluctuating water table and subsurface drain flow components were incorporated in the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) to enable the model to simulate subsurface drain flows. Parameters in a modified model were calibrated using observed subsurface drain flows for 1990. Model performance was evaluated by predicting subsurface drain flows for 1991 and 1992 by using the calibrated parameters and comparing the predicted drain flows with observed subsurface drain flows for the same years. The modified RZWQM model, in general, showed a good response to rainfall in terms of time of peak flows. However, the modified RZWQM model overpredicted total tile flows by an average of 13%, and the magnitudes;of peak tile flows were generally underpredicted. Selected soil properties (bulk density, macroporosity, and residue content) in the surface horizon were changed to investigate tillage effects on tile flows using the modified RZWQM. Four different tillage systems, chisel plow (CP), moldboard plow (MB), no-tillage (NT), and ridge-tillage (RT), were considered. Predicted tillage effects on subsurface drain flows were consistent with the observed effects (i.e., maximum tile flow for NT and minimum tile flow for MB).

This article discusses further modifications made in the RZWQM to simulate nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations and NO3-N losses with subsurface drain flows. Daily NO3-N concentrations were simulated in subsurface drain flows under four different tillage systems: chisel plow (CP), moldboard plow (MB), no-tillage (NT), and ridge-tillage (RT) by using the modified RZWQM. Simulations were conducted for the growing seasons of three years (1990 to 1992). Simulated NO3-N concentrations and losses with subsurface drain flows were compared with the measured data obtained from a water quality research site at Nashua, Iowa. Predicted NO3-N concentrations generally followed the same pattern as the observed concentrations. Simulated annual average NO3-N concentrations in subsurface drain flows were within 11% (averaged over all three years) of observed annual average NO3-N concentrations in subsurface drain flows. The model correctly predicted maximum concentrations under MB treatment and minimum under NT for all three years. Simulated annual NO3-N losses were within 14% (averaged over all three years) of observed annual NO3-N losses. Various NO3-N transformation processes need to be calibrated as a function of tillage system to improve model performance.

A 4-year program designed to evaluate large-scale artificial fertilization as a potential management tool for enhancing the forage and game fish populations of Lake Mead, a large Colorado River reservoir, generated considerable attention from both on-lake and downstream water users. An extensive water-quality monitoring program, undertaken as part of the fertilization experiment, demonstrated that the nutrient additions did not produce significant negative impacts on Lake Mead water quality from either a public health (that is, drinking water) or environmental perspective. One set of parameters, for example, hypolimnetic oxygen depletion and the relative abundance of blue-green algae, exhibited no consistent response to the fertilizer. A second group of parameters did respond to fertilizer addition, but changes were both moderate and relatively short-term. Examples in this group include chlorophyll, threshold odor number, and trihalomethane formation potentials.

The kinetics of phosphorus uptake are modelled using several kinetic equations including the Elovich, Bangham, diffusion and first-order equation. The Elovich equation is found to describe best the SRP influx to both bed and suspended sediments. The relative contribution of abiotic and biotic processes in the outdoor experimental channel are considered together with estimates of the flux to the bed-sediment predicted from the results describing the kinetics in the laboratory channel. The sediment is characterized by mineralogy, size fractionation and wet-chemical analyses including total phosphorus, iron and calcium determinations as well as biologically available phosphorus (BAP) by the iron-oxide stripping method and the equilibrium phosphate concentration, EPC(0), calculated from sorption measurements. The kinetic results from this sediment illustrate the importance of suspended sediment in the fast uptake of SRP. This contrasts with the control of the influx of SRP to the bed-sediment in channels with low concentrations of suspended solids, caused by the rate-limiting diffusional transfer across the sediment-water interface.

The model consists of a set of mass balance equations for organic substances, ammonium nitrogen, oxidized nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, biomass, and disinfectants in the bulk liquid phase and within the biofilm under laminar and turbulent flow conditions. This model is validated by comparing its solutions with the numerical solutions in the literature and then is applied for predicting the behavior of a typical water treatment plant effluent through a distribution pipe. The flow properties and disinfectant consumption rate at the pipe wall play a significant role in the determination of potable water quality in the distribution system.

A component for including land application of municipal sewage sludge is added and Monte Carlo simulation used to predict the long-term impact of land application on stand development, soil humus dynamics, nitrogen saturation, and nitrate losses at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire. Simulations suggest that applying 4 Mg/ha (dry mass) of anaerobically digested sludge to a 30-yr-old forest at 3-yr intervals for 50 yr may increase production of harvestable boles and branches by an average of 24.6% over controls. An application rate of 8 Mg/ha results in little additional biomass increase but significantly threatens groundwater and surface water quality. Repeated applications significantly increase the nitrogen in soil humus. Species representation is not affected significantly unless sludge is applied after harvest during forest reorganization. Sustainable loading rates are on the order of 3-4 Mg/ha if sludge is applied at 3-yr intervals.

Radiocaesium concentrations were highest in pike, and were about two to three times higher in the pike and perch than in the roach. The largest perch had about four times more Cs-137 than the smallest ones, but the activities in the pike and roach were independent of fish size. All of the water quality parameters examined correlated with Cs-137 concentrations in the fish, but the concentrations of Cs-137 in the bottom sediment did not. Cs-137 fallout and water retention time in lakes showed a positive correlation with fish Cs-137, while the size of the catchment area, phosphorus content of the water, water colour, pH and electrical conductivity showed a negative one. Thus there was more Cs-137 in the fish from the oligotrophic lakes than from the eutrophic ones, from the less humic lakes than from the more humic ones, from the more acid than from the less acid ones and from the lakes containing less potassium than from those containing more potassium. The depth, area and volume of the lake did not affect radiocaesium in the fish. Regression equations are presented for predicting Cs-137 in fish on the basis of environmental data. Fallout, total phosphorus and pH together had the highest influence in multiple regression models but were less significant in the roach than in the perch and pike.

To meet the objectives, the design relies on a probability sample of the resource population of interest (e.g., a random sample of lakes) each year on which measurements are made during an index period. Natural spatial and temporal variability and variability in the sampling process all affect the ability to describe the status of a population and the sensitivity for trend detection. We describe the important components of variance and estimate their magnitude for indicators of trophic condition of lakes to illustrate the process. We also describe models for trend detection and use them to demonstrate the sensitivity of the proposed design to detect trends. if the variance structure that develops during the probability surveys is like that synthesized from available databases and the literature, then the trends in common indicators of trophic condition of the specified magnitude should be detectable within about a decade for Secchi disk transparency (0.5-1 percent/year) and total phosphorus (2-3 percent/year), but not for chlorophyll-a (> 3-4 percent/year), which will take longer.

The bioindication is realized at the species level by stenoecic species in relation to the factor considered (mineralisation and trophy), or at the level of phytocenoses. Several conditions have to be met to obtain bioindication scales which are quantified and reproducible. These are the a) hydrological sampling, b) definition of the water qualities, c) existence of a complete range of variations of these qualities, d) integration of rheological, sedimentological and morphometric facies in the Vegetation sampling. Condition a) is met in the alluvial alsatian floodplain of the Rhine, which is characterized by highly mineralized, calcic bicarbonated waters and the large plateau of triassic sandstone of the Northern Vosges with poorly mineralized waters. These two sectors will be used as model for our demonstration. Saproby and trophy will be distinguished. Moreover the trophic quality need be separated from the mineral content (bicarbonate, calcium) and is defined by the phosphate and ammonia nitrogen (as toxic factor) levels, nitrate being, exceptionally, a limiting factor. The vegetation surveys are realized globally, i.e. by integrating the rheological facies in river reaches of many hundred meters to obtain the minimal area. Laboratory controls (analyses of leaf, sediment and water, ammonia toxicity and phosphorus uptake experiments) will supplement the field observations and surveys. The establishment of a bioindication scale of the trophic level lead us to discuss on concepts of aquatic ecology of running oligosaprobic waters. In the hierarchisation of the factors responsible for the vegetation distribution, water mineralisation constitutes the highest level, followed by the trophy (phosphate and ammonia), then by the rheological, sedimentological and morphometric parameters. Hydrological applications and new knowledge of the ecological spectrum of hydrophytes are mentioned. For Instance, we use the bioindication method of river-groundwater exchange in an alluvial floodplain, and the memory of hydrological events (flood). Thus, the aquatic macrophyte communities are used as ecological describers of spatio-temporal variations of the trophic quality.

J	EJAZ, MS; PERALTA, RC				EJAZ, MS; PERALTA, RC			MAXIMIZING CONJUNCTIVE USE OF SURFACE AND GROUND-WATER UNDER SURFACE-WATER QUALITY CONSTRAINTS	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES			English	Article								A simulation/optimization (s/o) model is presented to address the increasingly common conflicts between water quantity and quality objectives. The model can assist water resources analysts in selecting compromise strategies for stream/aquifer systems in which the stream gains water from the aquifer. The water quantity objective is to maximize steady conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water resources. The water quality objective is to maximize waste loading from a sewage treatment plant (STP) to the stream without violating downstream water quality beyond acceptable limits. The STP discharge is proportional to human population. The two objectives conflict because an increase in groundwater extraction reduces dilution of the stream water contaminants. The result is a decrease in the STP waste loading to the stream and the waste-producing human population that can be supported. The trade-off between objectives is illustrated graphically via sets of noninferior solutions. The sets of noninferior solutions are prepared using the E-constraint method and assuming different upstream flow rates. The s/o model includes superposition expressions describing head and flow responses to decision variables (pumping, diversion, and loadings) and regression expressions describing contaminant concentration responses to these decision variables. Modeled contaminants include: 5-day biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen (organic, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate), organic and dissolved phosphorus, total dissolved solids, and chlorophyll-a.

J	PIEDRAHITA, RH; SELAND, A				PIEDRAHITA, RH; SELAND, A			CALCULATION OF PH IN FRESH AND SEA-WATER AQUACULTURE SYSTEMS	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article								A procedure for the calculation of pH in fresh and salt waters has been developed. The method is based on a fourth-order polynomial relationship between hydrogen ion concentration and other (conservative) water quality parameters. The method avoids trial and error estimations and results in a direct calculation procedure that can be implemented in models developed in various modeling environments, such as spreadsheets, conventional programming languages (BASIC, C, FORTRAN, PASCAL, etc.) or specialized modeling languages (ExtendTM, StellaTM). The method developed is based on the solution of the full alkalinity-pH equation. Because of the need for simplification of the equations to yield explicitly solvable polynomial equations, the accuracy of the solutions depends on the simplification made and varies with water properties. Three simplifications are tested based on a second-, a third- and a fourth-order polynomial equation for hydrogen ion concentrations. The equations have been tested for salinities ranging from 0 to 35 parts per thousand (fresh to sea water), for temperatures ranging from 0 to 35 degrees C, for total carbonate carbon concentrations of 0.1 and 5.0 mmol/liter, and for total ammonia nitrogen concentrations of 0 and 10 mg/liter. Approximations are most accurate in waters of high total carbonate carbon and low ammonia concentrations, where the fourth-order approximation yields results that are within 0.05 pH units for the full range of pH values tested (5-10).

Dynamics of zooplankton and ecosystem processes were examined for 3 yr following the manipulation and compared to 2-3 yr of premanipulation data. Sampling of vertebrate and invertebrate planktivores documented shifts in other members of the zooplanktivore guild as rainbow trout declined. Reduction of rainbow trout densities led to compensatory responses in other components of the Castle Lake fish assemblage as brook trout and golden shiners increased in abundance. This compensation resulted in increased rates of vertebrate planktivory on daphnids within 2 yr after trout stocking was discontinued. Zooplankton shifts in response to discontinuance of trout stocking were more rapid, particularly an immediate increase in a previously rare invertebrate predator (Diacyclops thomasi). Other limnological parameters also responded rapidly following the manipulation: water transparency declined and primary productivity (PPr) increased. In addition, intra-annual patterns (i.e., seasonal development) and the vertical distribution (shallow vs. deep) of PPr appeared to be affected by the food web manipulation. Our results indicate that complexities of real food webs complicate the prediction of the outcome of food web perturbations. Reduction of the previously dominant planktivore (rainbow trout) led to increases in other zooplanktivores (Diacyclops, golden shiners, brook trout) that resulted in enhanced predation pressure on zooplankton herbivores. Our results also indicate that alterations in water quality parameters (transparency, PPr) in response to food web alterations need not necessarily be mediated through changes in the abundance of Daphnia, as strong limnological responses preceded reductions in Daphnia by a year. We hypothesize an alternative mechanism for food-web-induced changes in lake ecosystem dynamics: changes in water clarity and productivity can result when cyclopoid predation strongly affects micrograzers.

This has been done putting the different data sources and techniques into the same Geographical Information System (GIS). The integration of GIS with the environmental impact simulator and economic programming model was utilized for estimating the possible changes in environmental impact caused by the recent Reform in the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) of the European Union. An economic programming model was built to evaluate land use changes induced by the CAP Reform under different hypotheses of technology adjustment. The entire data set has then been utilized as a geographical data base to run non-point source (NPS) simulation models to estimate the impact on water quality of the agricultural systems located within the study area Nutrient (nitrogen) concentrations were the environmental indicators chosen to evaluate the impacts on water quality. In this way the system created by the linkage of GIS and simulation model (Spatial Environmental Impact Simulator, SEIS) has become a decision support system, for evaluating the effectiveness of environmental interventions on a regional scale.

The model combines a one-dimensional, process-based hydrodynamic model (DYRESM) with numerical descriptions of phytoplankton production, nutrient cycling, and oxygen dynamics. The hydrodynamic component is free from calibration, which improves water quality predictions for extreme hydrodynamic forcing events and allows for identification of the specific processes that influence water quality. The model simulations show that diversion of the main inflow would affect the oxygen dynamics through removal of the major source of dissolved oxygen from the hypolimnion. The simulations also show increased phytoplankton concentrations resulting from anoxic release of phosphorus from the sediments. The increased phytoplankton concentrations resulting from anoxic release of phosphorus from the sediments. The increased phytoplankton concentrations were observed only following turnover, however, when phosphorus released form the sediments was redistributed through the water column. The results illustrate the ability of an interactive hydrodynamic-ecological model to capture the subtle interactions between the hydrodynamics and biochemical processes that influence water quality.

The impact of this STP on the water quality in the Nepean River was assessed for calibrated data against the relevant measured data, from 1991 to 1992. A flow rate of 11.8 ML/d at Maldon Weir (upstream boundary) was used, which is more severe than the 50 percentile flow rate for water quality management recommended by the NSW EPA. The loadings from the tributaries into the river were calculated from the catchment area and runoff rate, and the STP's loading was represented by the 50 percentile values of the individual variable. Various scenarios were simulated to investigate the effects on the water quality in the river caused by the STP and possible releases from Cordeaux Dam. Water quality in the river would still meet the EPA guidelines (except for total nitrogen-TN). Neither TN nor total phosphorus (TP) would meet the EPA guidelines during prolonged dry weather in 2012. A release of 10 ML/d would be required to meet the TP guideline in 2012, and more than 40 ML/d would need to be released into the river to meet the TN guideline.

Relevant physicochemical factors affecting macroalgal and phytoplankton competition and succession have been analyzed as a function of physiological and trophic conditions. Results of simulations show that while phytoplankton response to growth factors is more intense and of shorter duration, internal nutrient storage in macroalgae stabilizes the growth process and makes macroalgal communities relatively more independent of variations of chemical and external forcing functions. The model provides results which appear to be qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with available functional in situ measurements.

Most data originate from sandy soil areas. The objective of the present experiment was to investigate the mechanism and magnitude of nitrate leaching from grassland on a heavy clay soil. On an experimental field, nitrogen input and nitrate concentrations in groundwater and drain discharge were measured for two consecutive years. A bromide tracer was applied to the same experimental field to study solute transport mechanisms. It appeared that nitrate transport in the heavy clay soil studied occurred mainly via preferential flow through mesopores and macropores. This resulted in small mobile water volumes and high nitrate leaching rates. As a result, nitrate concentrations in the drain discharge were high, on the average some 70 mgl(-1)NO(3)-N, with maximum values of 136 mg l(-1)NO(3)-N. With an average N-input from fertilizer and slurry of 480 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) N, the average nitrate leaching was equal to 124 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) NO3-N. Computer simulation models for nitrogen transport and behaviour in soils, which compute water and solute transport on basis of the Darcy equation, cannot adequately predict nitrate leaching in heavy clay soils.

J	Skaggs, RW; Breve, MA; Gilliam, JW				Skaggs, RW; Breve, MA; Gilliam, JW			Predicting effects of water table management on loss of nitrogen from poorly drained soils	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop of the European-Society-for-Agronomy on Modelling the Fate of Agrochemicals and Fertilizers in the Environment	MAR, 1994	VENICE, ITALY	European Soc Agron		drainage; controlled drainage; nitrogen; nitrate; DRAINMOD; water table management	SYSTEM-DESIGN; QUALITY	Agricultural drainage and related water management practices affect the quality and quantity of water leaving the field and entering ground and surface waters. The design and management of drainage systems should consider these impacts, as well as effects on agricultural production. In many instances, water quality and environmental requirements have a priority greater than that of maximizing agricultural productivity and profits. This paper describes the application of a simulation model, DRAINMOD-N, to predict the effects of design and management of subsurface drainage systems on nitrogen losses and crop yields. DRAINMOD-N uses hydrologic predictions by DRAINMOD, including daily soil water fluxes, in numerical solutions to the advective-dispersive-reactive (ADR) equation to describe movement and fate of NO3-N in shallow water table soils. Simulations were conducted for maize production on a Portsmouth sandy loam soil (Thermic, Typic Umbraquult) in the North Carolina Coastal Plain. Agricultural production objectives could be satisfied with Im deep parallel drains spaced 40 m apart or less. Predicted losses of NO3-N were significantly affected by drainage design and management. Increasing drain spacing from 20 to 40 m decreased NO3-N losses by 47 per cent. Nitrate losses can be further reduced by placing a weir in the drainage outlet so as to raise the water level in the outlet and reduce subsurface drainge rates. This practice, called controlled drainage, can be applied in both the growing season and the nongrowing season, and can be varied in intensity (with season) by placing the weir closer to or further below the soil surface. Controlled drainage during both the growing season and winter months reduced NO3-N losses from an annual average of 21.8 kg ha(-1) to 10.5 kg ha(-1) (52 per cent) for a 30 m drain spacing, without reducing crop yields. Analysis of simulated results on a year-by-year basis showed that large losses of NO3-N via drainage water occur in years following droughts when crops remove little of the fertilizer N because of reduced yields. Losses to the environment under these circumstances can be reduced by increasing the intensity of drainage control to minimize subsurface drainage during the following year. In one year, for example, raising the weir in the drainage outlet to a 25 cm depth directly after harvest and holding it there until time for seedbed preparation (one month prior to planting) in the spring reduced predicted NO3-N losses by 77 per cent compared to conventional drainage and by 60 per cent compared to currently recommended controlled drainage practices. The effectiveness of intensive drainage control was not as great in other years, but reduced NO3-N losses by at least 20 per cent in the years analysed. Results of this study indicate simulation modelling can be used to design and guide the management of drainage systems to address both agricultural productivity and environmental objectives.

Thus, information on the effect of agricultural management on N and P loss in runoff is needed to develop sustainable management systems. While reliable field data require several years of study, simulation models can quickly estimate the relative effects of management on nutrient loss. A kinetic equation describing the desorption of soil P was used to predict dissolved P (DP) loss in runoff; enrichment ratio approaches were used to predict particulate N (PN), particulate P (PP), and bioavailable PP (BPP) losses. Accurate predictions of N and P loss in runoff were obtained for watersheds under conservation and conventional till wheat; reduced and no till rotational small grain crops; winter wheat with and without a sorghum cover crop; and native and set-aside grasses. Overall, prediction errors were 25 per cent of measured values. Although conservation practices reduced PN and PP losses in runoff up to 50 per cent, algal available DP losses increased 56 per cent compared to conventional practices. Simulated losses of N and P from soils receiving animal manure (beef, poultry, and swine) for 10 to 35 years, indicate the need to minimize surface soil accumulations of N and P in excess of crop requirements. Threshold soil P levels, above which DP concentration of runoff is expected to exceed water quality standards associated with eutrophication, were predicted by the kinetic equation. The kinetic and enrichment ratio approaches used can provide valuable information on the relative effects of watershed management on soil and water resources and thereby aid development of sustainable agricultural systems.

J	Goss, MJ; Goorahoo, D				Goss, MJ; Goorahoo, D			Nitrate contamination of groundwater: Measurement and prediction	FERTILIZER RESEARCH			English	Article						groundwater quality; nitrate contamination; nitrogen budgets; Ontario; well survey	AMMONIA VOLATILIZATION; CATTLE SLURRY; NITROGEN; FIELD; FERTILIZER; GRASSLAND; MANURE	Agriculture makes a significant contribution to the diffuse source contamination of surface and groundwater resources, particularly contributing to the NO3- contamination of groundwater. Two approaches were adopted to evaluate management practices (within the context of the whole farming system) for their impacts on the environment : (1) measurement of the quality of groundwater under different fanning systems, and (2) comparison of predictions of the impact of farming systems on water quality, obtained using whole farm N budgets, with measured values. The Ontario Farm Groundwater Quality Survey evaluated the rural groundwater quality in Ontario, with respect to common contaminants including NO3-. Approximately 1300 domestic farm wells were sampled, and wells were drilled in some fields of farms involved in the study. NO3- was present at concentrations above the maximum acceptable for drinking water (10 mg N l(-1)) in 14% of wells, including 7% of wells that also had unacceptable concentrations of coliform bacteria. Significant levels of NO3- contamination were observed under most agricultural land use practices investigated. Calculation of N budgets was simplified by assuming that there was no net change in the N content of farm assets. The N inputs to agricultural systems considered were: purchases from off-farm suppliers, N-2 fixation and atmospheric deposition. Symbiotic N-2 fixation was estimated from empirical relationships between crop yield and N-2 fixed. The N outputs were in sales of plant and animal produce, gaseous and leaching losses. Gaseous loss was assumed to result only from volatilization of ammonia, estimated to be 39% of total manure N. We have identified one cash crop farming system where there was a true balance. The rotation included corn soybeans and wheat, with two years of soybean always being grown before corn. Many livestock farms, including two organic farms, gave large imbalances of N which might indicate that these operations were not in equilibrium. The relationship between measured and predicted values of NO3--N expected in the groundwater under the different management systems showed that the simplified N budget overestimated the NO3--N concentration by about one third. However, the budget approach appeared to identify farms where contamination was likely even if the actual amount was over estimated. Simplified budgets could therefore be used to compare the potential of different farming systems for causing environmental contamination.

J	Benndorf, J				Benndorf, J			Possibilities and limits for controlling eutrophication by biomanipulation	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE			English	Article						ecotechnology; top-down control; biomanipulation; phosphorus loading; optimum fish biomass; long-term field experiments	FOOD-WEB MANIPULATION; LAKE RESTORATION; FISH; WATER; ECOSYSTEMS; PREDATION; SHALLOW	Ecotechnology aims at the implementation of such a complex physical, chemical and/or biological ecosystem structure, which leads to a maximum capacity of the ecosystem to improve the water quality by ecosystem-internal mechanisms. Numerous ecological control variables can be used in ecotechnology, however only mortality caused by predation, feeding or grazing on all trophic levels provides the possibility of a top-down control of the community structure. There are two contrasting concepts regarding the efficiency of top-down control: (1) the ''cascading trophic interactions'' hypothesis (CARPENTER et al., 1985), which postulates that changes at the top of the food web are transmitted down to primary producers, and (2) the ''bottom-up/top-down'' hypothesis (MCQUEEN et al., 1986), which predicts that top-down effects are strong at the top but weaken near the bottom of the food web. This paper describes an examination of these concepts by summarizing the effects of strong (Bautzen reservoir) and extremely strong (Lake Grafenhain) enhancement of the stock of piscivorous fish. Both investigations refer to long-term whole-lake experiments. The results seem to confirm the ''bottom-up/top-down'' hypothesis. Effects at the top are strong, although sustained effects regarding dominance of Daphnia are achieved only at an ''optimum'' (relatively low but not zero) density of zooplanktivorous fish. Far below the optimum density an efficient invertebrate predator was able to compensate almost completely the fish predation pressure on large Daphnia. On the other hand, the optimum density can easily be exceeded during periods when high numbers of 0+ fish occur. Especially the effective control of O+ fish of the intentionally enhanced piscivorous species is a key problem. At the bottom of the ''classical'' food web, the effects are restricted to a change of the phytoplankton compositions (mean biomass is not reduced). The contradiction between the latter results and other findings from lakes having lower phosphorus loadings (e. g. STENSON, 1988) can be solved only if the ''bottom-up/top-down'' hypothesis is combined with the hypothesis of a ''biomanipulation efficiency threshold of the P-loading'' (BENNDORF, 1987). The latter hypothesis predicts that the desired reduction of mean phytoplankton biomass as a strong top-down effect at the bottom of the food web can be expected only below a threshold of the P-loading. Below this threshold a set of biomanipulation-induced indirect effects on phosphorus metabolism causes a reduction of the in-lake P-concentration. Consequently, sustained reduction of the phytoplankton biomass by biomanipulation can be achieved only by P-limitation, which is an indirect bottom-up effect induced by top-down control of the food web. Taking into consideration the combination of the ''bottom-up/top-down; and ''P-threshold'' hypothesis, an attempt is made to predict the effects of biomanipulation regarding phytoplankton and water transparency under different conditions of lake morphology, P-loading and light climate.

J	ROBINSON, JS; SHARPLEY, AN				ROBINSON, JS; SHARPLEY, AN			RELEASE OF NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS FROM POULTRY LITTER	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							SOIL; QUALITY; RUNOFF; LAKES	In areas of intensive poultry production, large amounts of litter produced are often applied as fertilizer to local agricultural land. To assess the agronomic and water quality implications of poultry litter applications, we quantified the effects of recurring, simulated rainfall (5 x 50-min rainfalls of 2.54 cm h(-1)) alternated with different drying temperatures (4, 20, 30, and 35 degrees C for 1 h) on the release of dissolved N and dissolved P from two types of poultry litter (pine bark shavings-and wheat straw-based). Amounts of litter leached were equivalent to a 10 Mg ha(-1) application, containing an average of 360 kg N ha(-1) and 158 kg P ha(-1). A total of 74 kg ha(-1) NH4-N, which accounted for >95% of the dissolved N, and 14 kg ha(-1) inorganic P were released by the end of five rainfalls (averaged for the two types of poultry litter, and for all drying temperatures). Although the pattern of N and P release from litter was similar for all drying periods, the magnitude of losses was a function of drying temperature. The average portion of total N present in the litters released as NH4-N during five rainfalls decreased from 22% for litter dried at 4 degrees C to 18% for litter dried at 35 degrees C. This decrease was attributed to an increase in N volatilization at the higher temperature. Conversely, the portion of litter P released as dissolved inorganic P, increased from 8% at 4 degrees C to 10% at 35 degrees C. Thus, the influence of drying temperature on the release of N and P should be considered when determining the optimum timing of poultry litter application. It is suggested that the timing of poultry Litter application should coincide with active periods of crop growth to combine maximum agronomic productivity with minimum edge-of-field losses of N and P to surface and groundwaters. As much as 60% of the N and 40% of the P released during the five rainfalls was lost during the first rainfall. This initial rapid N and P release stresses the importance of avoiding litter applications during periods of heavy rainfall.

J	Makarewicz, JC; Bertram, P; Lewis, T; Brown, EH				Makarewicz, JC; Bertram, P; Lewis, T; Brown, EH			A decade of predatory control of zooplankton species composition of Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						Lake Michigan; zooplankton biomass and population trends; food web; predation	WATER-QUALITY; BYTHOTREPHES-CEDERSTROEMI; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; DYNAMICS; ONTARIO; ERIE; PHYTOPLANKTON; CONSEQUENCES; SELECTION; INVASION	From 1983 to 1992, 71 species representing 38 genera from the Calanoida, Cladocera, Cyclopoida, Mysidacea, Rotifera, Mollusca and Harpacticoida comprised the offshore zooplankton community of Lake Michigan. Our data demonstrate that the composition and abundance of the calanoid community after 1983 is not unlike that of 1960s and that species diversity of the calanoid community is more diverse than the cladoceran community in the 1990s as compared to the early 1980s. Even though the relative biomass of the cladocerans has remained similar over the 1983-1993 period, the species diversity and evenness of the Cladocera community in the early 1990s is unlike anything that has been previously reported for Lake Michigan. Cladocera dominance is centered in one species, Daphnia galeata mendotae, and only three species of Cladocera were observed in the pelagic region of the lake in 1991 and 1992. Nutrient levels, phytoplankton biomass, and the abundance of planktivorous alewife and bloater chub and Bythotrephes are examined as possible causes of these changes in zooplankton species composition. The increase in Rotifera biomass, but not Crustacea, was correlated with an increase in relative biomass of unicelluar algae. Food web models suggest Bythotrephes will cause Lake Michigan's plankton to return to a community similar to that of the 1970s; that is Diaptomus dominated. Such a change has occurred. However, correlational analysis suggest that alewife and bloater chubs (especially juveniles) are affecting size and biomass of larger species of zooplankton as well as Bythotrephes.

Additionally, nitrogen release, ammonium desorption, and denitrification rates in lake sediments were experimentally performed. For an eutrophic lake, the average denitrification rate was approx 14.6 mg N/m(2) . h within a 5-cm layer of the sediment; the rates decreased with an increase in sediment depth. By considering adsorption, desorption, and denitrification processes,a model was developed to describe the transformation of nitrogen species between the sediment and the aqueous solution and to predict the effects of nitrogen forms in sediments on the water quality of the overlying water bodies.

Coincidentally and maybe consequently, the foodweb structure and functioning has altered in local areas causing various phenomena like oxygen depletion, mortality of groups of organisms, foam on beaches, and an increase in the productivity of benthic communities and some commercial fish species. The observed increases in algal biomass and shifts in species composition are discussed in relation to the involved key mechanisms: resource competition and selective grazing. Along the Dutch coastal zone of the North Sea eutrophication has caused a doubling of the yearly averaged algal biomass during the past three decades. The sudden appearance of Phaeocystis summer blooms coincided with a shift from P-limitation towards N-limitation in the Dutch coastal area due to a stronger increase in P-discharge relative to the increase in N-discharge. Competition experiments in continuous cultures showed Phaeocystis to become dominant under N-limitation. Additionally, the large Phaeocystis colonies, which can reach a diameter up to one centimetre, escape from microzooplankton grazing. A computer model is presented which demonstrates a shift from bottom-up towards top-down control if the pelagic environment becomes eutrophicated. Implementation of this concept in a size-differential phytoplankton control model generates the prediction that algal blooms are dominated by species that escape from grazing by those zooplankton species which have a high potential numerical response. In marine environments these are microzooplankton species. These organisms mainly feed on cyanobacteria, prochlorophytes and some nano-algal species. One of the consequences for foodweb structure and the carbon fluxes in marine foodwebs is that eutrophication will lead to the dominance of poorly edible algal species. Eutrophication favours the downward transport of carbon and nutrients towards the sediments not only due to higher algal biomasses but also as a consequence of a shift towards larger algal species with higher sedimentation characteristics. An example is given how these new insights can be used for water quality management purposes.		Riegman, R (corresponding author), NETHERLANDS INST SEA RES, POB 59, 1790 AB DEN BURG, NETHERLANDS.

While the detention period was kept constant at 25 days, the organic loading rate fed to the system changed with changes in the BOD5 of the raw sewage and varied from 15.7 to 58.3 with an average value of 34.1 kg BOD5/ha/day. Monitoring of the system indicated remarkable improvement in the water quality of me treated effluent BOD5 was around 26 mg O-2/l. Average residual values of COD, suspended solids and phosphorus were 154, 65 and 3.2 mg/l respectively. A reduction up to 99.99% in coliform bacteria population has been recorded. However, residual values were still high. Tilapia fish grew healthily during the study period Daily growth rate was 1.43% of the body mass. The productivity was 7.15 kg/ha/day. The corresponding extrapolated yield was 26.09 t/ha/yr which is considered to be a high yield as compared to published information. (C) 1996 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The model is two-dimensional with two compartments, the one characteristic of eutrophication and the other one of oligotrophy. Five state variables were chosen characterizing eutrophication, phytoplankton, bacteria, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrate and ammonia concentration. The nutrient and organic load from sewage outfalls was also estimated from data available for the city of Mytilini. For the evaluation of the model, data available for the coastal area of Mytilini, Lesvos were used, collected from April 1991 to December 1993. A general pattern of low values in winter and higher in summer was predicted for phytoplanktonic carbon, whereas bacterial populations showed a significant seasonality with low numbers in winter time and early spring and higher in late summer and autumn. The model indicated close dependence of bacterial and phytoplanktonic growth and emphasizes the importance of eutrophic conditions in the survival and growth of the marine microbial flora. This model seems to be a useful methodological tool for the evaluation of different scenaria concerning water quality in coastal management studies.

Deteriorating water quality in the late 1960s led to a special ''policy'' for the watershed, designed to preserve the reservoir as a drinking water supply. Key provisions of the policy mandated replacement of the watershed's 11 publicly owned wastewater treatment works with a single advanced wastewater treatment plant (AWT), and establishment of the Occoquan Watershed Monitoring Programme. Early results from the programme established non-point nutrient pollution as a major cause of water quality deterioration and resulted in the implementation of nonpoint pollution controls throughout the watershed during the late 1970s. The AWT plant went on-line in July 1978. Continuous monitoring since 1973 has demonstrated both the necessity and the effectiveness of point and non-point nutrient controls for the preservation of the reservoir's water quality. The AWT plant provides excellent removal of organics and phosphorus, plus complete nitrification. The nitrates are discharged to the receiving stream to enhance conditions in the reservoir. Control policies include land-use management for the preservation of this essential water supply for 750 000 people in the Washington, D.C. suburbs. Land-use management decisions are based on the results obtained with a watershed-reservoir linked computer model which predicts water quality changes resulting from land-use changes.

Hydroperiods and excessive nutrients in surface water inflows have been identified as potentially disruptive to the natural ecosystem, with phosphorus (P) deemed to be the limiting nutrient. Hence, agricultural drainage water from the EAA, containing higher than background P loads and concentrations, has been targeted as a source of the problem. To reduce P loads and concentrations in the drainage water leaving farms in the EAA, on-farm best management practices (BMPs) can be used. These BMPs have been identified and tested at the large plot scale and are presently being implemented and their efficacy verified at the farm level. It is currently estimated that P loading from the EAA can be reduced by 20% to 60% using BMPs. A 45% reduction should be attainable while keeping within acceptable cost/benefit ratios. The use of BMPs, however, will require higher levels of farm management and more sophisticated tools for decision-making.

This has allowed the program to set and implement meaningful goals. The research phase resulted in the ''1983 Chesapeake Bay Agreement'', which called for the jurisdictions to focus existing pollution control programs on reducing the nutrient loads to the Bay. A second ''Bay Agreement'' was developed and signed by the jurisdictions in 1987. This agreement contained 27 specific goals including a Basinwide Nutrient Reduction Strategy to reduce ''1985 controllable'' nutrient loads to the Bay by 40 percent in the year 2000. To assure high quality monitoring data, CBP established a strong quality assurance and quality control procedure which is Used for all monitoring. To assist with the monitoring a computer program, ''Chesapeake Bay Automated Monitoring System'' was developed to evaluate the quality of field and laboratory data and to allow the data to be directly loaded into the CBP computers. The Chesapeake Bay Program Office developed models for the drainage basin and the water of the Bay. The watershed model simulates the pollutant loads from eight land uses, the majority of the point sources and atmospheric deposition. It processes these loads through the river systems and delivers the load to the Bay for use in the Bay model. The Bay model uses these loads and adds atmospheric deposition, loads from the ocean interface and loads from bottom sediments to simulate water quality data at all points in the Bay. The models were used to confirm that the 40% nutrient reduction goal was correct, resulting in an amendment to the 1987 Agreement, calling for a commitment by the jurisdictions to develop tributary specific strategies to reach the goal. The tributary strategies lay out the future goals and direction that must be taken to reach the nutrient reduction goals. These tributary strategies are being evaluated by the program office, using the models. The results of the evaluation and model simulation of the implementation progress in the basin are discussed along with the economic implications of reaching these goals.

The model combines a GIS-based approach to estimate loads, geohydrological data to define model structure and statistical techniques to estimate parameter values. The model starts with an inventory of sources of N and P: agriculture, wastewater and (for N) atmospheric deposition. Nitrogen flows are assumed to follow both surface- and groundwater flows, while for phosphorus only surface water flow is taken into account. A calibration of loss terms of N and P (assumed to be constants for the whole of Europe) by comparing total inputs to measured loads shows good agreement between observations and calculated river discharges. For the coastal seas of Europe concentrations are calculated by assuming conservative behaviour of N and P. Freshwater quality problems occur in western Europe with its intensive agriculture and high population density and locally in southern Europe where dilution is low due to low water discharge. In the marine environment the main problem areas are the Baltic and Black seas, with much lower impacts in the North and Adriatic Sea; in other coastal waters human impacts are essentially negligible.

Owing to this high nutrient concentration, duckweed grows abundantly. To reduce the nutrient concentrations in the surface water, remedial measures are needed. To predict the effectiveness of three measures, a combination of a nutrient leaching model and a water quality model for nutrients in the surface water system was used. The scenarios formulated on the basis of these measures were simulated over a period of 35 years. Removing duckweed results in a substantial reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus. Improving the water purification plants results in a small reduction in the average nutrient concentrations. Dredging the total sediment layer results in a large reduction of phosphorus concentrations, but leads to an increase in nitrogen concentrations. The three measures combined will not improve the nitrogen concentration 30 years after implementation, but the phosphorus concentration will be reduced by 80% compared with 1990.

Ecosystems were manipulated with fish (Cyprinus carpio) in 2-year management cycles: in spring of the first year, the pond was stocked with young fish, and in the fall of the second year it was drained and mature fish were harvested. Fish management had a direct influence on bacterial numbers and on the basic parameters of the systems. A statistical analysis using t-tests found significant differences in oxygen concentration, chlorophyll-a and BOD during both years of fish management. A water temperature model was calculated on an extensive homogenous data set (197 measurements), by fitting a regression curve. During each season, populations of indicator bacteria increased with increasing water temperature, and maximal numbers of bacteria were recorded during the summer months. Correlation analysis (fitted Spearman correlation coefficient) confirmed that temperature had a positive significant effect on population dynamics. The results demonstrate that fish stocking can affect bacterial population, in the sense that during high fish biomass (second years) the numbers of indicator bacteria as well as BOD and phytoplankton were higher. If pond water quality must be optimised for the purposes of drinking or recreation, the planned fish yield may have to be reduced.

Our main hypothesis was that decreasing elevation in mountainous terrain corresponds to an increase in diversity of watershed size and lake area, depth, temperature, nutrient concentrations, and productivity, A second hypothesis was that watershed location and aspect relative to climatic gradients within mountainous terrain influences the limnological characteristics of the lakes. We evaluated these hypotheses by examining watershed location, aspect and size; lake morphology; water quality; and phytoplankton and zooplankton community characteristics among high mountain forest and subalpine lakes in Mount Rainier National Park. Although many of the comparisons between all forest and subalpine lakes were statistically insignificant, the results revealed trends that were consistent with our hypotheses. The forest lake group included more lakes with larger watersheds, larger surface areas, greater depths, higher concentrations of nutrients, and higher algal biovolumes than did the group of subalpine lakes. Deep lakes, which were mostly of the forest lake type, exhibited thermal stratification and relatively high values of some of the water-quality variables near the lake bottoms. However, the highest near-surface water temperatures and phytoplankton densities and the taxonomic structures of the phytoplankton and zooplankton assemblages were more closely related to geographical location, which corresponded to a west-east climate gradient in the park, than to lake type. Some crustacean and rotifer taxa, however, were limited in distribution by lake type. Fish predation did not appear to play an important role in the structure of the crustacean zooplankton communities at the genus level with the exception of Mowich Lake, where crustacean taxa were absent from the zooplankton community. This was the only lake inhabited by a true zooplanktivourous species of fish.

The wetland reduced the volume weighted mean concentrations of a number of solutes. Stream solute loadings were calculated from chemical and flow data from two flumes situated above and below the wetland at the catchment outlet. The flow contribution from the wetland itself was estimated on an areal basis and combined with sampled chemistry to estimate solute fluxes. Streamwater dissolved nitrogen loading, equivalent to an input of 55 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), was reduced by 38% after flowing through the wetland. Reductions in streamwater loadings were also observed for phosphate (94%), total dissolved-P (42%), total monomeric aluminium (39%), total filtrable aluminium (21%), iron (54%), DOC (34%) and silica (21%). All other retention rates were within the original streamwater loading estimate errors. Retention of nitrogen was lower than expected, perhaps due to exhaustion of the wetland's immobilisation capacity by the large nitrogen loading in the streamwater entering the wetland from the surrounding land in combination with atmospheric loadings. Retention of nitrogen and other solutes was also reduced due to a prolonged period of low rainfall during the summer of 1989 which resulted in high concentration events of various elements from the wetland relative to concentrations at the wetland inflow.

Better knowledge of amino acid concentrations in water could lead to improve water treatment and so, water quality on distribution networks. The general objective of this study is to quantify total amino acids in surface waters and drinking waters. For that purpose, OPA precolumn derivatization followed by HPLC analysis with fluorimetric detection was used. Natural water samples were first hydrolysed under acidic conditions. Amino acid analysis were carried out on raw surface waters from three french rivers (Oise, Seine, and Marne), and on the water treatment plant of Mery sur Oise (Paris, France). Analysis were performed at different steps of the treatment plant: storage, flocculation-sedimentation, sand filtration, interozonation, GAC filtration, postozonation and chlorination. The global amino acid concentration measured ranged in most cases from 50 to 250 mug l-1, expressed as carbon content (i.e. 20 to 90 mug l-1 N). Major compounds were glycine, serine, alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, threonine and valine at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 0.9 mumol l-1. Seasonal variations were observed, with an increase of total amino acid concentrations in raw waters at spring and summer periods. Based on our previous studies, we can estimate chlorine consumption of treated water due to these compounds between 0.4 to 1 mg l-1 Cl2.

Studies in a variety of physiographic areas have shown that concentrations of sediment and agrichemicals are reduced after passage through a riparian forest. The mechanisms involved are both physical and biological, including deposition, uptake by vegetation, and loss by microbiological processes such as denitrification. Current research by USDA-ARS and University of Georgia scientists at Tifton, GA is focusing on managing riparian forest buffer systems to alleviate agricultural impacts on the environment. The underlying concept for this research is that agricultural impact on streams is best protected by a riparian forest buffer system consisting of three zones. In consecutive upslope order From the stream these zones are (1) a narrow band of permanent trees (5-10 m wide) immediately adjacent to the stream channel which provides streambank stabilization, organic debris input to streams, and shading of streams, (2) a forest management zone where maximum biomass production is stressed and trees can be harvested, and (3) a grass buffer strip up to 10 m wide to provide control of coarse sediment and to spread overland flow. Several ongoing projects at Tifton, GA are focusing on using riparian forest buffer systems as filters. A forest management project is testing the effects of different management practices on surface and ground water quality. This project includes three different forest management practices: mature forest selectively thinned forest, and clearcut. In a different study a natural wetland is being restored by planting trees. The effectiveness of this wetland on filtering nutrients from dairy wastes which are being applied upslope is being evaluated. At this same site, a pesticide study is being conducted on the side opposite to where dairy wastes are applied. An overland flow-riparian buffer system using swine lagoon waste is evaluating the effectiveness of different vegetative treatments and lengths of buffer zones on filtering of nutrients. In this study three vegetative treatments are compared: (1) 10 m grass buffer and 20 m riparian forest (2) 20 m grass buffer and 10 m riparian forest, (3) 10 m grass buffer and 20 m of the recommended wetland species maidencane. Waste is applied at the upper end of each plot at either a high or low rate, and then allowed to now downslope. The three zone riparian forest buffer system is being used for the Riparian Ecosystem Management Model (REMM). This model, which is currently under development at Tifton, GA, is a computer simulation model designed to reduce soil and water degradation by aiding farmers and land use managers in decision making regarding how best to utilize their riparian buffer system.

The variables considered by the model are the algal biomass, and the intracellular quota of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus). The model simulates a point in the Lagoon. Because of this, other factors, such as external nutrients and dissolved oxygen concentrations, are considered as input data and evaluated by monitoring the water quality. The model is calibrated with a time series of weekly data collected during the years 1985 and 1986. The model allows for a deep knowledge of the macroalgae life cycle in the Lagoon and points out the relevance of some processes or factors like: nitrogen limitation; control of algal decay due to oxygen depletion; relevance of the combination of photosynthesis, temperature and nutrient effects.

J	STEDNICK, JD; KERN, TJ				STEDNICK, JD; KERN, TJ			RISK ASSESSMENT FOR SALMON FROM WATER-QUALITY CHANGES FOLLOWING TIMBER HARVESTING	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article								Land use activities may affect surface water quantity and quality. Water quality changes (concentration increases) from land use activities that are above background but below the water quality standard or criteria have always been considered benign. Increased public interest and recent legislation and management regarding threatened, or endangered, salmon populations suggest that environmental influences on these populations need to be reevaluated. As one approach, we developed a risk assessment (toxicity and exposure) for salmon from water quality changes following timber harvesting. Toxicity relationships for nitrate-nitrogen (as an LC(50)) using chloride, suspended sediment, and exposure were developed from the literature and data from the Alsea Watershed Study in the Oregon Coast Range. These relationships were used to predict the probable risk to coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to nitrate-nitrogen exposure. The control or reference catchment, Flynn Creek, had higher nitrate-nitrogen concentrations, but showed little likelihood of risk to salmon because of lower suspended sediment concentrations. The treated catchment, Needle Branch (harvested 27 years ago), had lower nitrate-nitrogen concentrations and was expected to have less risk to salmon. However, the risk assessment relationship exhibited sensitivity to suspended sediment concentrations. This smaller catchment had higher suspended sediment transport and thus a higher risk of nitrate-nitrogen exposure to salmon. The suspended sediment transport functions were based on post-treatment monitoring (1966-1973) and are not considered to represent the current situation. These findings are not meant to be categorical, but merely illustrative of this risk assessment application.

Different inter-correlations between abiotic parameters and phytoplankton abundance were estimated. Functional relationship between NO3 and Zygnematales showed 83% of variance. A multiple regression model of phytoplankton abundance accounted for 88% of variance. Of the abiotic parameters included in the analysis, water temperature, total alkalinity and SiO2 increased phytoplankton population. A shift in specific algae with increase in trophicity and saprobity was clearly demarcated. This information may be useful in categorizing algae as bio-indicators for monitoring water quality.

J	SHALHEVET, J				SHALHEVET, J			USING WATER OF MARGINAL QUALITY FOR CROP PRODUCTION - MAJOR ISSUES	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Review						IRRIGATION REGIME; IRRIGATION WATER QUALITY; SALINITY; CROP EFFECT; SOIL EFFECT; SALTY WATER, PRODUCTION FUNCTION	SALT TOLERANCE; GROWTH-STAGES; BRACKISH WATER; SALINITY; IRRIGATION; SENSITIVITY; SOIL; WHEAT; TRANSPIRATION; FREQUENCY	A considerable amount of data is available regarding the effect of soil salinity on crop yield. Most of the data was obtained under uniform spatial and temporal distribution of salts, at high levels of fertility and with crop established prior to the introduction of saline conditions. In practice, under realistic field conditions, uniformity is the exception rather than the rule, soil fertility may not be optimal and salinity may be present before the crop is established. In addition, crops may have different sensitivities at different stages of growth. This review attempts to answer the principal questions which are relevant to the use of marginal quality water for irrigation. Duration of exposure and stage of growth: plants are more sensitive during the seedling stage than during later stages of growth. But the preponderant temporal effect of salinity is the duration of exposure. Spatial distribution: the best estimate of the effective salinity when salt is non-uniformly distributed with depth is the mean salinity within the root zone. Under some conditions normalization on the water uptake basis is superior. Soil fertility: the level of soil fertility has no effect on the tolerance of crops to salinity. Varietal differences: differences in salt tolerance among varieties exist mainly in fruit trees, which are specifically sensitive to chloride and sodium salts. Differences among field and garden crops are not common and are usually small. Irrigation requirement: crop water production functions relating yield to evapotranspiration are not influenced by water salinity. It is still controversial whether reduction in water uptake with increasing salinity is the cause or the result of reduction in growth. Leaching requirement: leaching is the key to the successful use of saline water for irrigation. Under normal field conditions with free drainage the leaching provided by the normal inefficiencies in irrigation should be sufficient to control salinity. When leaching is necessary, it should be provided at the time when the soil salinity reaches hazardous levels. Irrigation frequency: the bulk of the evidence shows no advantage to increasing irrigation frequency when saline water is used, except possibly under excessive leaching. Fertilizer application: the response to nitrogen and potassium fertilization under non-saline conditions is the same as or even greater than under saline conditions. Excessive phosphorous application may be toxic at high salinity, especially in hydroponic conditions. Availability of more than one water source: blending of saline with non-saline water is a questionable practice. It is preferable to use the non-saline water source early in the growing season and the source Of saline water successively. Irrigation method: drip irrigation, where feasible, gives the greatest advantages when saline water is used. Sprinkler irrigation may cause leaf burn on sensitive crops. The damage may be reduced by night irrigation and by irrigating continually rather than intermittently. Drainage: the critical depth to the water table is determined mainly by the aeration requirement of the crop, as long as a net downward flux of water is maintained by natural or properly designed man made drainage system. The design drainage coefficient is determined by the leaching requirement. Soil hydraulic conductivity (K) and drainable porosity: important parameters in drainage design, are strongly influenced by the composition and concentration of the irrigation water. The higher the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), the greater the reduction in K. The detrimental effect of high SAR is mitigated as the total salt concentration increases.

Thus, irrigated agriculture faces the challenge of using less water, in many cases of poorer quality, to provide food and fiber for an expanding population. Some of these future water needs can be met by using available water supplies more efficiently, but in many cases it will prove necessary to make increased use of municipal wastewaters and irrigation drainage waters. Aside from increased levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, the salinity (total salt content) and sodicity (sodium content) of these waters will be higher than that of the original source water because of the direct addition of salts to the water and the evapoconcentration that occurs as water is used. While the use of these waters may require only minor modifications of existing irrigation and agronomic strategies in most cases, there will be some situations that will require major changes in the crops grown, the method of water application, and the use of soil amendments. Use of poor quality waters requires three changes from standard irrigation practices: (1) selection of appropriately salt-tolerant crops; (2) improvements in water management, and in some cases, the adoption of advanced irrigation technology; and (3) maintenance of soil-physical properties to assure soil tilth and adequate soil permeability to meet crop water and leaching requirements (LR). This paper looks at farmers' experiences, research, and computer modelling in these areas, and concludes with a discussion of examples of farm experiences with waters that caused problems with infiltration rates and soil tilth and the practices used to mitigate these problems.

Mathematical models aimed at or with possible use to solving reservoir water quality problems, particularly those connected with eutrophication, are reviewed. From the different types of model available for use in management, the predictive and optimization type models are stressed. The models are divided according to whether the options they consider relate to the watershed, to the reservoir or to the outflow, respectively.

The area will then not be subject to high changes in water levels, which at low water leave the sediment banks dry and sometimes smelling and looking bad. The barrage project is supposed to increase the recreational and touristic value of the area. The water of the resulting impoundment upstream of the barrage would be almost stagnant and the impoundment would be receiving treated and untreated municipal waste water. Eutrophic conditions of this lake must be foreseen. A periodically two-layered structure of the water masses, due to the development of a thermocline, must also be foreseen. Modelling of the hydrodynamic conditions and of the water quality were performed in order to analyse the consequences of introducing a barrage. Several schemes that were meant to improve the water quality were analysed. The oxygen concentration in the bottom water was the key parameter in these analyses, since this parameter to a large extent is a result of the eutrophic conditions (algae growth) in the surface layer. A combination of a flushing scheme, physical constructions, and waste water treatment was found by which a predicted minimum oxygen concentration around 5 Mg O2 l-1 was achieved. The situation with no flushing and existing sewage discharge was predicted to result in minimum oxygen concentrations of 1-2 mg O2 l-1.

In comparison with hydrological studies where water balance models are traditionally frequently used, water quality investigations are typically faced with essentially higher uncertainty. This study presents an approach to the assessment and propagation of this uncertainty, with a case study on a river reach with three point source polluters, substantial throughflow, and non-point components. A computational implementation using spreadsheets was used, which allows the use of probabilistic models in close contact with environmental data bases.

Watershed models were first developed using a geographic information system (GIS). Empirical models were then developed correlating water quality with land use, lake morphometry, and riparian sensitivity. Base models of forested, cultivated, pasture/open, wetland and residential land use within 100, 200, 400, and 2000 m of the study lakes were regressed on total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a. Area-weighted groundwater and surface runoff sensitivity indices were then incorporated into each model and tested for significance. Within the 200-m buffer, the total phosphorus base model was improved by including the groundwater index alone. The chlorophyll-a base model at 200 m was improved by including: (1) the groundwater index alone, and (2) both the groundwater and surface runoff sensitivity indices. Results suggest that surface and subsurface runoff analysis of potential source areas can improve decision making for lake riparian management.

The system prioritizes potential phosphorus loading from fields or cells in a watershed and can evaluate the effects of alternate management practices on phosphorus yield. The model simulates phosphorus loading by using a daily mass balance on a unit-area basis and incorporates the effects from rainfall, topography, soil properties, fertilizer and animal waste application, and management. Model predictions include dissolved and sediment-bound phosphorus yield, runoff volume, and sediment yield. Within the integrated GRASS-modeling system, the user can obtain model input data, execute the model using various options, rank model input and output data, and display them as GRASS-based maps or data tables. All functions are menu driven, developed using C language and X-window tools to run on a SUN workstation platform. The system provides a powerful and efficient tool for prioritizing phosphorus loading from nonpoint sources.

Although the inherent limitations of using these wells are generally recognized, little has been done to investigate how these wells actually sample groundwater. A semi-analytical particle tracking model is used to illustrate the influence of variable vertical contaminant distributions and aquifer heterogeneity on the composition of water samples from these wells during short pumping periods. The hypothetical pumping well used in the simulations is located in an unconfined, alluvial aquifer with a shallow water table and concentration gradients of nitrate-nitrogen contamination. This is a typical setting for many irrigated areas in the United States. The main conclusions are: (1) high-capacity wells underestimate the average amount of contamination within an aquifer; (2) shapes of concentration-time curves for high-capacity wells appear to be governed by the distribution of the contaminant and travel times to the well; (3) variables such as well construction, pumping rate, and hydrogeologic properties contribute to the magnitude of the concentration-time curves at individual high-capacity wells; and (4) a sampling strategy using concentration-time curves based on the behavioral characteristics of the well rather than individual samples will provide a much better framework for interpreting spatial contaminant distributions.

Four acid-sensitive lakes were studied from 1988 to 1991 to determine if phytoplankton were deficient in nitrogen, phosphorus, or both N and P and if the nutrient input via atmospheric deposition could increase primary production. The relative accuracy of predictions based on growth response bioassays, physiological assays, and nutrient deficiency indices was also evaluated. Our results show that (1) N enrichment generally caused a greater biomass response than P, although N + P almost always yielded the greatest effect and co-limitation was likely in two of the lakes, (2) predictions based on DIN:TP ratios generally agreed with the growth bioassays; TN:TP and DIN:SRP were not useful and could be misleading, and (3) atmospheric deposition could satisfy most of the daily algal N demand and increase the fertility of these lakes. These results suggest that although water quality protection based solely on P may not protect against this non-point source of nutrients, without these control strategies, P inputs would be expected to have a disproportionately greater stimulation of phytoplankton growth.

We applied the model to five regions of the upper Chesapeake Bay, ranging from shallow tidal fresh habitats to deep mesohaline habitats, for the years 1985 to 1987. Model results indicated that existing suspension-feeding bivalves could consume more than 50% of annual primary production in shallow freshwater and oligohaline reaches of the upper Chesapeake Bay and Potomac River. In deep mesohaline portions of the Chesapeake Bay and Potomac River, suspension-feeding bivalves could consume only 10% of primary production. Independent estimates of benthic carbon demand based on benthic production supported the model predictions. Hydrodynamics of large estuaries restrict the potential of benthic suspension-feeders to crop phytoplankton production because the width and depth of these estuaries limit transport of pelagic waters to the littoral flanks of the estuaries where benthic suspension-feeders can be abundant. Benthic suspension-feeders are dominant consumers in shallow segments of the Chesapeake Bay system, but are suppressed in deeper segments. The suppression is below that set by hydrodynamic limits, and may be due to periodic hypoxia or other factors. Our results suggest that the proposed use of suspension-feeding bivalves to improve water quality of large estuaries will be limited by the depth and width of the estuary, unless the bivalves are suspended in the water column by artificial means.

J	SLOAN, WT; JENKINS, A; EATHERALL, A				SLOAN, WT; JENKINS, A; EATHERALL, A			A SIMPLE-MODEL OF STREAM NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS IN FORESTED AND DEFORESTED CATCHMENTS IN MID-WALES	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article							COMPUTER-SIMULATION; CRITICAL LOADS; WATER-QUALITY; SOIL-WATER; NITROGEN; MINERALIZATION; NITRIFICATION; ECOSYSTEMS; DEPOSITION	A model is developed specifically for simulating the nitrate concentrations in a stream at approximately weekly intervals in an upland forested and a moorland catchment. It is constructed on the basis of observed nitrate concentrations in rain water and in two streams, the Hafren and the Hore, at Plynlimon, Mid-Wales, where long data records exist. The Hore catchment has recently undergone extensive deforestation. A simple regression model relating temperature to stream nitrate concentrations was capable of simulating the seasonal fluctuations in nitrate concentration observed in the Hafren. However, this ignores the influx of nitrate through wet deposition and is incapable of simulating land-use change. The regression model was developed into a simple dynamic model which includes a deposition term and a biomass indicator. The extended Kalman filter algorithm was used to estimate the optimum values of the parameters and to assess the model structure. The model was applied to both catchments, and the fit between observed and simulated nitrate concentrations at the Hafren was good. At the Hore, the model was able to capture the major changes in nitrate concentration through the deforestation and replanting phases although detailed short-term dynamics were not well represented. Finally, the model is related, speculatively, to processes which are known to occur in most catchments. This simple model is intended as a step towards the development of similar but more comprehensive catchment models of stream nitrogen dynamics.

J	SUN, XH; ANDERSON, JM				SUN, XH; ANDERSON, JM			EVALUATION OF THE APPLICATION POTENTIAL OF A VARIABLE INTERFERENCE FILTER IMAGING SPECTROMETER FOR THE WATER ENVIRONMENT	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL			English	Article							AIRBORNE	This paper evaluates the application potential of a variable interference filter imaging spectrometer (VIFIS) for the water environment by analysis of the experimental data acquired in recent airborne tests. It shows that VIFIS can be configured to fly in different sensing modes to satisfy a variety of applications. In sunglint-free sensing mode, VIFIS supplies regular wavelength-spectral images of the solar diffuse reflection of the body of water. In the front (rear)-sunglint sensing mode, VIFIS supplies unique directional-spectral images of the specular reflection of the surface of water. Two kinds of wavelength-spectral image examples, which consist of a frame of the progressively-variable-filtered sensor imagery and a set of multispectral track-recovery-images respectively, are illustrated. The first allows efficient access of the simultaneous spectrum of a homogeneous water area within a whole sensed frame. The other is applicable to areas of general interest for both spatial inspection and pixel spectrum analysis. These regular wavelength-spectral data sets are of interest for monitoring the subsurface scattering that is usually relevant to water quality, phytoplankton, shallow water fish schools and other subsurface materials. With the unique directional-spectral images, VIFIS has extra capabilities of enhancing the contrast of the anomalies and other regular surface features, such as oil spills, floating materials, ship wakes, and frontal patterns between different water bodies, on the general water background.

Multi-temporal empirical algorithms to predict these parameters have been developed from the atmospherically-corrected satellite-received radiance and field data collected at the time of the satellite overpass. Highly significant, predictive algorithms for the surface C (range: 0.2-2.7 mug l-1) and SDD (range: 4-15 m) were obtained using bands 1 and 3 of the Thematic mapper. It is shown that a high confidence may be placed on the predictions using these algorithms and therefore it offers a cost-effective tool for complementing regular monitoring programmes.

Nonpoint sources of P in agricultural runoff now contribute a greater portion of freshwater inputs, due to easier identification and recent control of point sources. Although P management is an integral part of profitable agrisystems, continued inputs of fertilizer and manure P in excess of crop requirements have led to a build-up of soil P levels, which are of environmental rather than agronomic concern, particularly in areas of intensive crop and livestock production. Thus, the main issues facing the establishment of economically and environmentally sound P management systems are the identification of soil P levels that are of environmental concern; targeting specific controls for different water quality objectives within watersheds; and balancing economic with environmental values. In developing effective options, we have brought together agricultural and limnological expertise to prioritize watershed management practices and remedial strategies to mitigate nonpoint-source impacts of agricultural P. Options include runoff and erosion control and P-source management, based on eutrophic rather than agronomic considerations. Current soil test P methods may screen soils on which the aquatic bioavailability of P should be estimated. Landowner options to more efficiently utilize manure P include basing application rates on soil vulnerability to P loss in runoff, manure analysis, and programs encouraging manure movement to a greater hectareage.

Field experiments were conducted in 1988 and 1989 to measure herbicide and tracer movement to tile lines during and immediately after a simulated heavy rainstorm. The eight tile lines monitored were 1.2 m deep and 3.4 m long. In 1988, alachlor (2-chloro-N-(2,6-diethylphenyl)-N-(methoxymethyl) acetamide), cyanazine (2-[[4-chloro-6-(ethylamino)-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl]amino]-2-methylpropanenitrile) and Rhodamine WT dye were applied to 4.5-m2 plots directly over field drainage tiles. In 1989, alachlor, cyanazine, Rhodamine WT, and pendimethalin (N-(1-ethylpropyl)-3,4 dimethyl-2,6 dinitrobenzenamine) were used. Chloride or bromide tracers were also soil applied. The plots were irrigated 24 h after chemical application with a rainfall simulator. In 1988, 53 mm of rainfall was applied, whereas 81 mm of rain was applied in 1989. Tile effluent was intensively sampled for 8 h after irrigation. In 1988, herbicide and Rhodamine dye concentration peaks ranged from 1 to 38 mug l-1. In 1989, concentrations were higher than in 1988, with alachlor and cyanazine concentration peaks exceeding 500 mug l-1 from one tile line. In contrast, pendimethalin was found in only one sample, barely above the detection limit. Rhodamine WT was found to be useful as a tracer to study the movement of alachlor and cyanazine in the soil profile. In all tile effluent samples containing Rhodamine WT, alachlor and cyanazine were also detected. In both years, herbicide and dye concentrations peaked within 130 min after the start of rainfall. The rapid solute movement to the 1.2 m tile depth suggests that preferential flow is an important mechanism affecting chemical transport through structured soils.

Mass transport of ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), ortho-phosphorus (PO4-P), total phosphorus (TP), and total suspended solids (TSS) was reduced significantly (p < 0.05) by fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) VFS. The 3 and 21 m VFS removed 65 and 87% of incoming TKN, 71 and 99% of incoming NH3-N, 65 and 94% of incoming PO4-P, and 67 and 92% of the incoming TP, respectively. Effectiveness of VFS, however, did not increase significantly beyond 3 m for TSS and chemical oxygen demand and averaged 61 and 50%, respectively. Mass transport of TKN, NH3-N, PO4-P, and TP was minimized at the 9 m VFS length. The VFS did not significantly reduce nitrate nitrogen and fecal coliform from the incoming runoff. First-order kinetics described the removal of manure constituents.

J	ABTEW, W; KHANAL, N				ABTEW, W; KHANAL, N			WATER-BUDGET ANALYSIS FOR THE EVERGLADES AGRICULTURAL AREA DRAINAGE-BASIN	WATER RESOURCES BULLETIN			English	Article						AGRICULTURAL HYDROLOGY; DRAINAGE; IRRIGATION; WATER MANAGEMENT; WATER QUALITY; LAKE OKEECHOBEE; WATER BUDGET MODEL		Water budget studies are essential for water resources and environmental management. In this study, a water budget analysis is presented for the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) in South Florida for the period from 1973 to 1991. The EAA is a highly productive irrigation/drainage basin that has a high water table and organic soils. Water quality problems are associated with the drainage discharge from the basin. During dry periods, supplemental water is used for irrigation and in rainy periods excess water with relatively higher phosphorus content is pumped out of the basin to Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades ecosystem. Elevated concentrations of phosphorus in the runoff/drainage that is discharged from the EAA basin have created water quality problems. The mean surface water inflow to the basin was 63,990 ha-m, and the outflow was 131,447 ha-m per year. On the average, supplemental surface water use was 47,411 ha-m, and runoff/drainage was 114,816 ha-m per year. The mean annual basin rainfall was 120.9 cm. A general trend in the decline of the wet season rainfall is observed.		ABTEW, W (corresponding author), S FLORIDA WATER MANAGEMENT DIST,3301 GUN CLUB RD,W PALM BEACH,FL 33416, USA.						Allison R.

Managers of such waters may ask whether nutrients added by waterfowl degrade water quality. For lakes and reservoirs where primary productivity is limited by phosphorus (P), we developed a procedure that integrates annual P loads from waterfowl and other external sources, applies a nutrient load-response model, and determines whether waterfowl that used the lake or reservoir degraded water quality. Annual P loading by waterfowl can be derived from a figure in this report, using the days per year that each kind spent on any lake or reservoir. In our example, over 6500 Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and 4200 ducks (mostly mallards, Anas platyrhynchos) added 4462 kg of carbon (C), 280 kg of nitrogen (N), and 88 kg of P y-1 to Wintergreen Lake in southwestern Michigan, mostly during their migration. These amounts were 69% of all C, 27% of all N, and 70% of all P that entered the lake from external sources. Loads from all external sources totaled 840 mg P m-2 y-1. Application of a nutrient load-response model to this concentration, the hydraulic load (0.25 m y-1), and the water residence time (9.7 y) of Wintergreen Lake yielded an average annual concentration of total P in the lake of 818 mg m-3 that classified the lake as hypertrophic. This trophic classification agreed with independent measures of primary productivity, chlorophyll-a, total P, total N, and Secchi disk transparency made in Wintergreen Lake. Our procedure showed that waterfowl caused low water quality in Wintergreen Lake.

The theoretical perspective used to guide the study was formulated from selected components of social learning theory and the farm structure model. Nutrient use was operationalized as pounds of nitrogen, phosphate and potassium applied per acre for corn, soybeans and wheat. The variance in nutrients per acre was regressed against selected predictive variables. Characteristics of the farm enterprise and measures of learning experiences were used as predictive variables to examine the merits of the theoretical perspective used to guide the investigation. While the study findings were consistent with research expectations, the amount of explained variance demonstrated that the theoretical model had limited utility for predicting nutrient application rates at the farm level. The research findings are discussed in the context of future resource conservation efforts in the study region.

This study collated information relating to acidification of running and standing waters on Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) throughout Britain in acid-sensitive areas. 2. Of those SSSIs which occur in acid-sensitive areas of Britain, 196 have water bodies. The following information was obtained for each site if available: details of local geology and soils, types of land use and management, water quality data and data relating to biological components of both the aquatic and riparian habitats. 3. In addition, samples from 112 water bodies were collected for water chemistry and epilithic diatom analysis. Results from each site were placed into existing critical loads and species response. models to determine whether acidification had occurred. 4. Results showed that the fresh waters on 141 SSSIs had probably suffered acidification. This was most acute in north Wales, with mid Wales, south-west and north-east Scotland and northern England also being badly affected. 5. A wide variety of changes in the biological status of water bodies relating to acidification were found to have been recorded on SSSIs, ranging from phytoplankton, invertebrate and macrophyte community changes to decline of fish, amphibian, bird and mammal populations. 6. Catchment afforestation may be a problem in poorly buffered areas and has probably contributed to freshwater acidification on 40 SSSIs. 7. Comparison with critical loads maps for acidity in UK fresh waters reveals that existing commitments on acidifying emissions (the EC Large Combustion Plant Directive) will not be sufficient to prevent further acidification on a number of SSSIs. In order to achieve a protection of the nature conservation interest of fresh waters further commitments to emission reductions will be necessary.

The model is written in terms of absorption spectra of dissolved yellow substance, the chlorophyll-specific absorption of phytoplankton, and absorption and scattering by particulate matter (expressed as turbidity). Based on published light requirements for submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) in Chesapeake Bay the model is used to calculate the range of water-quality conditions that permit survival of SAV at various depths. Because the model is spectrally based, it can be used to calculate the attenuation of either photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, equally weighted quanta from 400 nm to 700 nm) or photosynthetically usable radiation (PUR, the integral of the quantum spectrum weighted by the pigment absorption spectrum of SAV). PUR is a more accurate measurement of light that can be absorbed by SAV and it is more strongly affected by phytoplankton chlorophyll in the water column than is PAR. For estuaries in which light attenuation is dominated by turbidity and chlorophyll, the model delimits regions in which turbidity alone (chlorophyll < 10 mug l-1). chlorophyll alone (turbidity < 1 NTU) or both factors (chlorophyll > 10 mug l-1, turbidity > 1 NTU) must be reduced to improve survival depths for SAV.

Fertilizer form varied among the fields with two receiving inorganic fertilizer, one receiving poultry (Gallus gallus domesticus) litter, and one receiving poultry manure. Soil and grazing parameters also differed among fields. Runoff and nutrient/sediment transport observed over 20 months were compared to EPIC predictions generated without calibration. Significant correlation between event predictions and observations were found in half the cases. There was significant correlation between observed and predicted calendar year total transport for all outputs except nitrate-nitrogen. The findings indicate that EPIC can accurately reflect runoff quality trends when executed without calibration for pasture fields in northwestern Arkansas.

It was shown that, when hydrographs and concentration graphs were positively correlated, computations using a time-composite sampling strategy resulted in load underestimation. Combinations of 11 synthetically generated and 12 actual hydrographs and concentration graphs of agricultural runoff events were used for numerical analysis. The bias in load calculation with different sampling frequencies was determined The influence of cross-correlation of hydrographs and concentration graphs on the direction and magnitude of bias was demonstrated. Although flow-composite sampling is theoretically correct for load computation, it is more expensive and, like other approaches, still involves uncertainties in both flow and concentration measurements. The dependence of the coefficient of variation (CV) of load on CV of flow rate, CV of concentration, and the cross-correlation between flow rate and concentration is presented analytically and graphically. To achieve load estimates comparable to the accuracy of flow-composite sampling, multiple time-composite sampling methods were investigated This analysis indicates that with eight concentration values from eight time-composite samples of a runoff event, a reliable load estimation can usually be made.

Model simulation results were compared with field data. The experiment included four replications for each of the three soil-amendment treatments. The GLEAMS simulation of soluble and sediment P losses in surface runoff and NO3-N concentrations in leachate and soil layers were not consistent with field data. Simulation of N-transformation effects on N losses in surface runoff did not agree with field data. The model simulated higher NH4-N than NO3-N losses in surface runoff, while field data showed the opposite. The model simulated low concentrations of P in leachate at a 1.0 m depth, while the observed data showed large variations.

J	AHL, T				AHL, T			REGRESSION STATISTICS AS A TOOL TO EVALUATE EXCESS (ANTHROPOGENIC) PHOSPHORUS, NITROGEN, AND ORGANIC-MATTER IN CLASSIFICATION OF SWEDISH FRESH-WATER QUALITY	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION			English	Article							SWEDEN	Concentrations of phophorus, nitrogen, COD(Mn), and humic matter in streams from small protected Swedish watersheds have been used to build statistical models useful in the evaluation of the state of the water quality. The precision of the models has been tested on data sets from other SEPA (Swedish Environmental Protection Agency) reference programs as well as international data sets. The models refer to watersheds, where most of the samples have a pH above 5.0. For the nutrients two delimitations have been defined. The lowest delimitation, the most likely upper limit for pristine concentration, corresponds to the models estimate minus 1 standard error. The highest delimitation, the most likely upper limit for none or insignificant influence, corresponds to twice the lowest delimitation, which also can be considered as a management concentration [c(m)]. The calulated export coefficients for phosphorus agree with coefficients reported in the literature. The export coefficients for nitrogen seems to be dependent on the atmospheric deposition of nitrogen. A nutrient pollution index (NPI) has been calibrated against existing trophic state classification systems. The NPI for phosphorus show a considerable decrease in southern Sweden since the inroduction of chemical treatment plants. The nirogen conditions have not been improved to the same extent.

PROCESS ANALYSIS	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						ACTIVATED SLUDGE PROCESS; BIOLOGICAL NITROGEN REMOVAL; NITRIFICATION; DENITRIFICATION; MODELING; PROCESS CONTROL; WASTE-WATER TREATMENT	BIOLOGICAL REMOVAL; TREATMENT-PLANT; WASTE-WATER; PHOSPHORUS; SYSTEMS	Increasing demands on discharged water quality have led to the development of activated sludge processes which incorporate the biologically mediated removal of nitrogen and phosphorus. A major obstacle in the development of new control strategies for such processes is the lack of variables which can effectively alter process behavior and can feasibly be manipulated This two part paper deals with a novel means to improve the nitrogen removal in an alternating type nutrient removal activated sludge process through control of the cycle length. In this first part, an analysis of process dynamics is undertaken. Using a simple model to describe the nitrogen dynamics in the alternating process, the existence of an optimal cycle length as a function of process conditions is demonstrated and explained. A graphical technique is developed which allows quick visualization of nitrogen dynamics under constant process conditions. This also serves as a means to assess whether a selected cycle length is optimal, too long, or too short for a given set of conditions. Based on the findings of this first part, the second part of the paper develops and demonstrates control strategies which serve to automatically adjust the cycle length to compensate for changing process conditions.

This effort was part of a joint project between NASA and the University of Puerto Rico to develop techniques to monitor the water quality of a Caribbean coastal zone. This paper presents the methods and algorithms developed to map and analyze short term changes in the source and spatial distribution of SPM in Mayaguez Bay by using remotely sensed data acquired by the Calibrated Airborne Multispectral Scanner (CAMS). A PC-based data acquisition system was developed to record continuous ship measurements of select in- water variables. Spectral reflectances derived from CAMS red and near-IR data were corrected for atmospheric effects and then used to generate maps of SPM. These maps displayed SPM plumes associated with the mouths of the bay's three river systems. Significant day-to-day differences in the spatial characteristics were observed, suggesting that changes in river discharge occurred. However, an analysis of estimated river discharge, sediment yield, local wind field, and thermal river plume indicates that observed sediment plumes result primarily from wind-driven resuspension events.

J	KALLIO, K				KALLIO, K			EFFECT OF SUMMER WEATHER ON INTERNAL LOADING AND CHLOROPHYLL-A IN A SHALLOW LAKE - A MODELING APPROACH	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						SHALLOW LAKE; HYDRODYNAMICS; INTERNAL LOADING; WEATHER CONDITIONS; MODELING	PHOSPHORUS; WATER; SEDIMENTS	The effect of weather on the eutrophication of a shallow lake was estimated by a hydrodynamic lake model coupled with a simple water quality module. The model was applied to Lake Villikkalanjarvi in southern Finland. This shallow, agriculturally loaded lake may stratify during warm and calm periods in summer and as a result oxygen is often consumed from the hypolimnion, causing high internal loading of phosphorus. Vertical mixing and temperature distribution in the lake were simulated by a one-dimensional, horizontally integrated hydrodynamic model. State variables included in the water quality model were dissolved reactive phosphorus, chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen. The model was first calibrated against observations from 1989 and 1990. Thereafter, simulations were carried out using weather data from the years 1961 to 1988. The results indicated that warm summer periods may cause high chlorophyll a concentrations due to high internal loading. In four years with exceptionally warm summers the model predicted maximum chlorophyll a concentrations almost twice as high as in years without remarkable internal loading. The model simulates accurately temperature and mixing but the reliability of water quality predictions could be improved by adding more factors regulating algal biomass and sediment phosphorus release.

J	BENNION, H				BENNION, H			A DIATOM-PHOSPHORUS TRANSFER-FUNCTION FOR SHALLOW, EUTROPHIC PONDS IN SOUTHEAST ENGLAND	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						DIATOMS; PHOSPHORUS; PALEOLIMNOLOGY; TRANSFER FUNCTION; UNITED-KINGDOM; SHALLOW	LAKE; ASSEMBLAGES; PH; STEPHANODISCUS; PHYTOPLANKTON; REGRESSION; INDICATORS; SEDIMENT; OLD	Shallow ponds in southeast England are often eutrophic with high phosphorus concentrations. The aim of this study was to develop a diatom-phosphorus 'transfer function' to enable past phosphorus levels in such waters to be inferred from the sediment record. A water chemistry survey of 123 randomly chosen, shallow, artificial ponds in southeast England was carried out. Principal components analysis (PCA) revealed that phosphorus was an important environmental variable. A subset of 31 sites was selected along a total phosphorus (TP) gradient (winter TP range 7-1123 mug l-1), in order to explore the relationship between the surface-sediment diatom assemblages and the contemporary water chemistry using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Annual mean TP was the most significant variable in explaining the variance in the diatom species data. Weighted averaging (WA) regression and calibration techniques were used to generate a transfer function, enabling annual mean TP (range 25-646 mug l-1) to be inferred from the diatom species TP optima of 102 common taxa in the dataset (r2 = 0.79; RMSE = 0.161; RMSE(boot) = 0.279; n = 30). The model was applied to fossil diatom assemblages in a sediment core from Marsworth Reservoir, Hertfordshire, a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), with currently high TP levels of 476 mug l-1 to reconstruct past epilimnetic annual mean TP concentrations. The study shows that artificial, shallow waters can be suitable for palaeolimnological research and that it is possible to reliably infer lake water TP using the WA technique, across a large range of phosphorus concentrations. This method has the potential to provide limnologists, conservationists and water quality managers with an estimate of pre-enrichment phosphorus concentrations and an indication of the onset and development of eutrophication at a site. This information is essential for lake management strategies and restoration programmes.

Consequently the lake is highly enriched but with an annual cycle of algal P-limitation in winter and N-limitation in summer. There have been several schemes proposed to accelerate the improvement of the lake's water quality for recreational use. A computer hydraulic and nutrient model of Lake Horowhenua was developed using rainfall, evaporation and nutrient data to describe the nutrient budget. To match the lake nutrient concentrations, terms for in-lake processes of sedimentation, seasonal sediment nutrient release, phytoplankton production, and denitrification were required. The computer model results indicated that denitrification was the major natural restoration process accounting for a net loss of more than 50% of the N from the lake each year. Application of the model also allowed lake managers to evaluate the potential effects of a number,of proposed restoration schemes.

This study determined the magnitude of surface runoff losses of herbicide and nutrients at, and subsequent to, application. The first of three weekly 10-min, 2.6-cm rainfalls were simulated on triplicated 1-m2 plots (a set) on which com had been planted and the herbicide (metolachlor/atrazine, 1.5: 1.0) and fertilizer (28% N at 123 kg ha-1) had just been applied. Identical simulations were applied to two other adjacent plot sets (protected from rainfall) 1 and 2 wk following herbicide application. Runoff (natural, simulated) was monitored for soil, nutrient and herbicide losses. Concentrations of total phosphorus in surface runoff water and nitrate N in field-filtered samples were not significantly influenced by the time of the rainfall simulation but exceeded provincial water-quality objectives. Atrazine and metolachlor runoff losses were greatest from simulated rainfall (about 5% loss) immediately following application. Subsequent simulated rainfall usually resulted in < 1% herbicide runoff losses. Herbicide concentrations in all plot runoff samples exceeded provincial drinking-water quality objectives. Since herbicide surface transport is primarily in the solution phase (not via association with soil particles), water-management conservation technologies are the key to retaining these chemicals on cropland.

Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the sediment-bound and porewater pools of the riverbed were greatest and porewater dissolved oxygen concentrations were lowest at the site with highest open-water nutrient concentrations (118 and 553 mu g/l TP and TDN) and aquatic macrophyte biomass (205 g/m(2)). Sites receiving little or no sewage effluent (23-60 mu g/l TP and 221-325 mu g/l TDN) had the lowest porewater and sediment-bound nutrient concentrations if no macrophytes were present, whereas concentrations were one-third to seven-fold greater if macrophytes were present in moderate abundance (135 g/m(2)). Our results showed that effluent loading and aquatic macrophytes may cause significant changes in the chemistry of riverbed sediments and suggest that for shallow slow-flowing rivers, benthic nutrient exchanges represent a critical component in water quality modeling.

Groundwater-fed streams located in the Ill floodplain are analysed using three methods: an analytical method based on hydrochemical variables (Cl-, NO3-, PO43- and NH4+), a phytosociological one based on surveys of aquatic macrophyte communities and a biological method based on the accumulation of mercury in the moss Fontinalis antipyretica. The results show that the eutrophicated and polluted river Ill (660 mug l-1 N-NH4+, 500 mug l-1 P-PO43-, 0.3-0.4 mg Hg kg-1 dry weight of moss) has a negative effect on the groundwater via the bed, depending on the level of the river bed in relation to the groundwater table level. Upstream of Colmar in the south of the Alsace floodplain, the Ill waters infiltrate and contaminate the groundwater, but this is not the case further downstream. Along a stretch of the Ill (40 km) annual floods provide eutrophicated and polluted waters to the aquifer. However these waters are purified during their transfer through the soil-vegetation system. Thus in the groundwater-fed streams the water is characterised by a low level of phosphate, ammonium nitrogen and mercury(10-20 mug l-1 N-NH4+ and P-PO43-, < 0.05 mg Hg kg-1 dry weight of moss). We demonstrate the importance of a functional floodplain in replenishing the aquifer with poor-nutrient waters. The aquatic vegetation of groundwater-fed streams reflects the water quality and thus can be used as a bioindicator and descriptor of river-groundwater exchange process.

Sludge deposits are suspected as the sire of much of the biochemical oxygen demand, mineralization of nutrients from organic matter, formation of toxic metabolites, and possibly the site of nutrient and organic matter recycling back into the pond food web. To determine the effect of sludge on water quality, nitrogen extinction and shrimp production, three sludge management regimes were tested: (1) leaving sludge undisturbed in the pond (REMAIN); (2) removing sludge accumulations at weekly intervals (REMOVE); and (3) resuspending or moving sludge deposition daily to reduce the degree of anoxia (RESUSPEND). All ponds were operated without water exchange. Shrimp (Penaeus setiferus) growth was good, but survival ranged from om negligible in the REMAIN treatment to moderate in the REMOVE and RESUSPEND treatments. The sludge management regime influenced overlying water qualify, with the most pronounced effect being a significant reduction in ammonia-nitrogen, orthophosphate and in vivo fluorescence and an increase in dissolved oxygen for the REMOVE treatment. In the REMOVE treatment, 67% of nitrogen added as feed was harvested from the pond with sludge. Only 22% and 15% of the nitrogen added as feed was left in the pond sludge at harvest for the REMAIN and RESUSPEND treatments respectively. All nitrogen inputs could be accounted for in the REMOVE treatment while 89% and 58% could be accounted for in the RESUSPEND and REMAIN treatments respectively, indicating that the sludge management regime affected denitrification processes. If the sludge can be safely disposed of on high land, pond water quality, as well as the quality of the water being returned to receiving streams in drain harvesting, is improved. Shrimp pond sludge can be used to improve terrestrial crop yields on well-drained but impoverished, soils. Shrimp production as high as 3474 kg/ha without water exchange has not been reported elsewhere.		HOPKINS, JS (corresponding author), WADDELL MARICULTURE CTR,POB 809,BLUFFTON,SC 29910, USA.

J	GIOVANNINI, P; PIEDRAHITA, RH				GIOVANNINI, P; PIEDRAHITA, RH			MODELING PHOTOSYNTHETIC PRODUCTION OPTIMIZATION FOR AQUACULTURE PONDS	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article								In an aquaculture pond, the primary production system serves both as the basis for the natural food chain, and as a primary source of dissolved oxygen (DO). As the productivity of the pond system and the standing crop of phytoplankton increases, so does the degree of fluctuation in diel DO concentrations, water quality, and the degree of vertical stratifications of the water column. In highly turbid pond systems the rapid extinction of incident light in the surface layers results in benthic zones serving only as a net oxygen sinks, even while the surface is exposed to full sunlight and is a net oxygen source. As the standing phytoplankton crop is reduced, self shading decreases, as does total food availability and gross production of oxygen, but the stability of the system, in terms of DO fluctuations and water quality, increases. Therefore, in this respect, the trade-off in balancing the pond system is in terms of gross productive potential versus water-quality stability.

The results indicate that Secchi depth, chlorophyll and total suspended solid concentrations, vertical extinction coefficient, absorption coefficient and irradiance reflectance in the PAR region can be used to discriminate between the two lakes. Dissolved organics concentration, scattering and total attenuation coefficients estimates, as well as backscattering probability, are less acceptable, because of instrumental limitations. Relationships between optical and water quality parameters were investigated and found to behave according to accepted theoretical frameworks. Both lakes exhibited Vertical and horizontal heterogeneities in chlorophyll and turbidity, and had contrasting mean bio-optical characteristics: although suspended solid concentrations were similar, transparency was lower in Lake Zug, but reflectance was substantially higher in Lake Lucerne. Water colour determined by chromaticity analysis was blue-green in Lake Lucerne and green in Lake Zug. Reflectance spectra simulated through a three-component optochemical model did not completely match those derived from in situ measurements, because of lack of site-specific optical cross-sections for suspended minerals and dissolved organics. The monitoring of water quality in subalpine lakes by remote sensing, both with present and future technology, is discussed and considered as possible, provided that their optical behaviour is known, and preferably expressed by a valid optochemical model.

J	PATTERSON, JC; HAMILTON, DP; FERRIS, JM				PATTERSON, JC; HAMILTON, DP; FERRIS, JM			MODELING OF CYANOBACTERIAL BLOOMS IN THE MIXED-LAYER OF LAKES AND RESERVOIRS	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH			English	Article							WATER-QUALITY; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; PHYTOPLANKTON; LIGHT; SIMULATION; PHOTOINHIBITION; RESPONSES; FIELD	The chemical and biological components of existing water quality models are in general described by simple first-order rate equations in which the production and uptake coefficients are fixed functions of the other variables of the model. Thus although, for example, in a photosynthesis model the specific algal growth rate may be a function of light intensity, nutrient concentration and temperature, the form of this dependence on these variables is assumed to be fixed. In this paper, the effect on the performance of a water quality model of removing this assumption for the specific case of photosynthesis is examined. An existing coupled motion-photosynthesis model has been installed in the water quality model DYRESM-WQ and the result compared with the original model, which assumes a fixed functional dependence. The resulting model has been applied to two reservoirs, without recalibration. The result shows that the removal of the assumption of a fixed functional form for the photosynthetic growth rate may have a significant effect on the magnitude and timing of predicted cyanobacterial blooms in lakes and reservoirs, which would have important implications for reservoir and lake management. In addition, the result suggests that, in general, the validity of the assumption of fixed functional form for the rate coefficients in water quality models is not assured.

J	STEFAN, HG; FANG, X				STEFAN, HG; FANG, X			DISSOLVED-OXYGEN MODEL FOR REGIONAL LAKE ANALYSIS	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article							PLANKTONIC ALGAE; WATER-QUALITY; CLIMATE; TEMPERATURE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; HABITAT; LIGHT; ERIE	A deterministic, one-dimensional, unsteady dissolved oxygen (D.O.) model has been formulated to simulate summer D.O. conditions (stratification) in a wide range of lakes of the north central United States and to study potential impacts of global climate change. The simulation includes contributions by photosynthesis, plant respiration, reaeration, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and sedimentary oxygen demand (SOD) as source and sink terms. The one-dimensional vertical oxygen transport equation is solved in conjunction with the heat transport equation in daily time steps beginning 1 March and ending 31 October. Lake morphometry, trophic status and daily weather parameters have to be specified as input, and daily profiles of water temperature and dissolved oxygen are obtained as output. The model finds the onset of summer-stratification from initially isothermal and constant D.O. conditions. Trophic status is related to Secchi depth, phytoplankton (chlorophyll-alpha) concentrations, BOD and SOD. Field data from seven lakes (11 years) have been used to calibrate and validate the D.O. model. The simulations for dimictic lakes with strong stratification are better than for weakly stratified polymictic lakes, i.e. the model works better for deep lakes than for shallow lakes. The average standard errors for calibration and validation are 1.4 and 1.9 mg D.O. l(-1), respectively. The temperature simulations, especially the mixed-layer depth, affect the D.O. simulation results. A sensitivity analysis to model coefficients was also conducted. The model is most sensitive to sedimentary oxygen demand (SOD). Twenty seven classes of lakes (3 depths X 3 areas X 3 trophic states) in the north central U.S. were analyzed with the model. Simulated mean daily dissolved oxygen concentrations in the epilimnion are near saturation, those in the hypolimnion vary considerably depending particularly on length of time since the onset of stratification and the sedimentary oxygen demand.

Comparison of 1982-1983 total P and total filtrable P concentrations with data from 1990-1991 and other published data showed little change. The measured annual primary flux of P to the sediment surface reflected rapid sedimentation of both allochthonous particles and spring diatom production. Diatoms were the dominant vector of P to the sediment surface. Terrigenous phases and autochthonous calcite were also significant. More than half of the mixed-period diatom P demand was provided by colloidal and particulate P, nearly 60% of diatom-associated P was recycled within the water column, and 55-58% of total primary P flux was recycled at the sediment surface. Ultimately 2.2% of C and 2.7% of P became incorporated into recent sediments. The amount of P supplied by resuspension was relatively small compared with water-column standing pools and major flux vectors. With its relatively long residence, the response time for P changes with respect to lending should be on the order of 5-15 years.

Univariate, linear regression analyses using ratioed wavelength bands and line height algorithms for radiance (CASI) or reflectance (AMMS) in the 625-725-nm wavelength range provided the best correlations to ground-truthed uncorrected chlorophyll a (R2 = 0.84-0.95) for both imaging systems during the summer when phytoplankton dominated the suspended solids composition. For the winter flight, using the AMMS system 3-4 days after a major rain event, reflectance in the 690-710-nm range was correlated to turbidity and suspended solids concentrations (R2 = 0.79-0.85). The high correlations between imaged data and chlorophyll in July-August and inorganic turbidity in February-March demonstrate the feasibility of using low-cost imaging spectrometers and multispectral video cameras from fixed-wing aircraft. Since these imaging systems are effective for a wide variety of waters, they should be used more frequently for monitoring, modeling, and management of large water bodies.

J	HAMLETT, JM; EPP, DJ				HAMLETT, JM; EPP, DJ			WATER-QUALITY IMPACTS OF CONSERVATION AND NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES IN PENNSYLVANIA	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article								A field-scale microcomputer model, CREAMS, was used to assess the impacts of selected best management practices (BMPs) and nutrient management programs (NMPs) on sediment and nutrient losses from three locations with three soil and field configurations common to the Chesapeake Bay drainage area in Pennsylvania. Several BMPs were evaluated, with CREAMS simulations conducted for runoff, erosion, sediment and nutrient delivery to the field boundary, and percolation and nitrate leaching through the crop root zone. Two separate NMPs were evaluated in combination with the BMPs. The baseline NMP followed traditional manure and fertilizer application practices and the improved NMP used an improved, high management system that incorporated best timing, placement, and types of nutrient additions. BMPs increased percolation and decreased runoff compared to moldboard plowing with no conservation practices. Sediment exported from the fields was also reduced by the use of BMPS. Reductions in total nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses varied greatly for different BMPs and sites. Although BMPs reduced sediment-associated N and P losses, the improved NMPs, as compared with the traditional baseline NMP, bad little effect on these losses. BMPs tended to increase, whereas the improved NMPs substantially reduced, nitrate leaching. The improved NMPs also greatly reduced P losses from those sites where P loss was predominantly in soluble form rather than sediment associated. The use of BMPs and improved NMPs together effectively reduced sediment and total nutrient losses.

J	Malchow, H; Shigesada, N				Malchow, H.; Shigesada, N.			Nonequilibrium plankton community structures in an ecohydrodynamic model system	NONLINEAR PROCESSES IN GEOPHYSICS			English	Article							DIFFUSION; PHYTOPLANKTON; SHEAR; INSTABILITY; TRANSPORT; ADVECTION	Due to the local and global impacts of algae blooms and patchiness on water quality, carbon cycling and climate, models of plankton dynamics are of current interest. In this paper, the temporal and spatial patterns in natural plankton communities are interpreted as transient and stationary nonequilibrium solutions of dynamical nonlinear interaction-diffusion-advection systems. A simple model of phytoplankton-zooplankton dynamics (Scheffer, 1991) is presented in space and time. After summarizing the local properties as multiple stability and oscillations, the emergence of spatial and spatio- temporal patterns is considered, accounting also for diffusion and weak advection. In order to study the emergence and stability of these structures under hydrodynamic forcing, the interaction- diffusion-advection model is coupled to the hydrodynamic equations. It is shown, that the formation of nonequilibrium spatio-temporal density patterns due to the interplay of the deterministic nonlinear biological interactions and physical processes is a rare occurrence in rapidly flowing waters. The two-timing perturbation technique is applied to problems with very rapid single-directed steady flows. A channel under tidal forcing serves as and example for a system with a relatively high detention time of matter. Generally, due to the different time and length scales of planktic interactions, diffusion and transport, initial nonequilibrium plankton patches are simply moved through the system unless the strong hydrodynamic forces do not destroy them before.

This experiment assessed and compared runoff quality impacts of organic and inorganic fertilizer application for a single simulated storm occurring seven days following application. The organic fertilizers used were poultry (Gallus gallus domesticus) litter, poultry manure, and swine (Sus scrofa domesticus) manure. All fertilizers were applied at an application rate of 217.6 kg N/ha. Simulated rainfall was applied at 50 mm/h for an average duration of 0.8 h. Runoff samples were collected, composited, and analyzed for nitrate N (NO3-N), ammonia N (NH3-N), total Kjeldahl N (TKN), ortho-P (PO4-P), total P (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), fecal coliforms (FC), and fecal streptococci (FS). Application of the fertilizers did not alter the hydrologic characteristics of the receiving plots relative to the control plots. Concentrations of fertilizer constituents were almost always greater from treated than from control plots and were usually much greater. Flow-weighted mean concentrations Of NH3-N, PO4-P,, and TP were highest for the inorganic fertilizer treatment (42.0, 26.6, and 27.9 mg/L, respectively). Runoff COD and TSS concentrations were greatest for the poultry litter treatment. Concentrations of FC and FS were greater for fertilized than for control plots with no differences among fertilized plots, but FC concentrations for all treatments were in excess of Arkansas' primary and secondary contact standards. Mass losses of fertilizer constituents were low (< 3 kg/ha) and were small proportions (< 3 percent) of amounts applied.

J	MCPHERSON, BF; MILLER, RL				MCPHERSON, BF; MILLER, RL			CAUSES OF LIGHT ATTENUATION IN TAMPA BAY AND CHARLOTTE HARBOR, SOUTHWESTERN FLORIDA	WATER RESOURCES BULLETIN			English	Article						WATER QUALITY; ATTENUATION; LIGHT TRANSMISSION; CHLOROPHYLL-A; WATER COLOR; SUSPENDED MATTER; SOLAR ANGLE; ESTUARY; FLORIDA COAST	UNDERWATER LIGHT; PHYTOPLANKTON; ESTUARY	Vertical attenuation of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in clear waters of central Florida theoretically can vary almost 50 percent during a sunny summer day as a result of changing solar elevation. We used a simple formula to partially adjust the attenuation coefficient in Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor for changing solar elevation of the direct beam and then used multiple regression analysis to estimate the relative contribution of different water properties or constituents to the adjusted attenuation coefficient, k(adj). Color, on an average, was responsible for 18 percent of k(adj), chlorophyll a for 21 percent, nonchlorophyll suspended matter for 55 percent, and seawater for the remaining 6 percent. In both estuaries, k(adj) increased with decreasing salinity as a result of freshwater runoff adding color, suspended matter, and nutrients. Nutrients affected attenuation by stimulating phytoplankton growth and increasing concentrations of chlorophyll a. Reduced nutrient loading to upper Tampa Bay (Hillsborough Bay) in the early to mid-1980's appears to have decreased concentrations of chlorophyll a, increased water clarity, and increased seagrass recolonization. Assuming other attenuating substances remained unchanged, the decrease in the average concentration of chlorophyll from 30 to 15 mug L-1 would correspond to an increase in the depth of light penetration necessary for seagrass survival (> 10 percent incident light) from 1.0 to 1.5 m, which, on a relatively flat sea bed (slope of 2 m/km), would increase the area potentially available for seagrass recolonization by 0.25 km2/km of shoreline.

Laboratory test results and values in references are used for the determination of parameters and coefficients in the model. In modeling of the processes, sediments, suspended solids, and overlying water are taken as elements and in computation a Lagrangian reference frame in terms of accumulated water volume is employed for reduction in numerical dispersion. Simulation results on ammonium and nitrate nitrogen, showing good agreement with long term field observation results, qualitatively explain well the processes in the river. The results indicate some countermeasures to reduce nitrate more such as the increase in the area of sediment surface. The simulation model is available for the estimation of water quality in well mixed tidal rivers and applicable for water quality control.

In general, nitrates in drinking water may not be the main component of total nitrate intake, but nitrate-contaminated drinking water can make an important contribution to total nitrate intake. In this paper, a nitrate risk-assessment methodology is developed to assist decision makers in estimating human health risks corresponding to a particular nitrate dose to humans and in determining whether regulatory action must be taken to reduce the health risks. The case of a community with a nitrate water quality problem is used to illustrate the nitrate risk assessment methodology. The uncertainty associated with assessing health risks of nitrate and its impact on results are represented by using a fuzzy-set approach and incorporated into the nitrate risk assessment methodology. Therefore, a nitrate risk assessment can be made that is more realistic and appropriate than the one made without taking uncertainty into account.

The models were first calibrated and validated with field temperature and water quality data. The combined models were then used to characterize the temperature distribution, seasonal overturning phenomena, and the variations of chlorophyll-a, organic nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, organic phosphorus, inorganic phosphorus, and dissolved oxygen in the reservoir. It was shown that the limiting factor for eutrophication in Te-Chi Reservoir is phosphorus, and that better control of phosphorus loading into the reservoir is the crucial step toward improving the water quality of Te-Chi Reservoir.

The phosphorus model had been originally applied to the Lake Balaton (Hungary), and then to other water bodies - Ivan'kovskoe Reservoir, Lake Kubenskoe, Lake Uvildy (Russia), Lake Kuortaneenjarvi, Lake Tuusulanjarvi, Lake Kotojarvi (Finland), South-East part of Finnish Gulf. An analysis of the combined simulation data for water bodies studied by the model allows us to estimate features of phosphorus changeability and its general load taking into account an external phosphorus input plus an internal phosphorus cycling into the water ecosystem.

The inflow to the reservoir changes in a cascade reservoir from an undammed river to the regulated flow from the hypolimnion of the upperlying reservoir, while the meterological and other conditions remain unchanged. In agreement with previous findings of the strong effect of theoretical retention time on reservoir stratification, the comparison of a solitary and a cascade reservoir is based on hydrologically similar conditions. It is concluded that the change in the inflow temperatures manifests itself in the change from a lower degree of stratification and an accumulation of cold water near the bottom in the solitary reservoir to a more pronounced stratification in the cascade reservoir. Comparing years with different RT, in a dry year (longer RT) the stratification is more pronounced both in a solitary and a cascade reservoir, the high flows in a wet year (shorter RT) producing much more rapid heating of the deep layers. The surface temperatures are lower in the cascade reservoir, too, being affected by mixing of the inflowing water with the surface strata. The heat budget of the reservoir is changed, more heat being taken up by the cascade reservoir as a consequence of the greater air-water temperature gradient. More intensive mixing of water masses is produced in the cascade reservoir under conditions of the same retention time, than in the solitary reservoir. The outflow temperature of the cascade reservoir is lower than the temperature of the solitary one. Another effect on the heat budget, not exactly studied in this paper, might be caused by the decreased extinction of light for the water in the cascade reservoir due to sedimentation, phosphorus uptake and organic matter decomposition in the upperlying reservoir, causing lower turbidity, less phytoplankton and less colour.

The literature suggests that Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) has spectral and spatial characteristics that are suited to monitoring small coastal water bodies. This study examined the potential for the satellite-based TM sensor to serve as a regular monitoring tool. Atmospherically corrected TM digital data acquired on four dates over summer 1990/91 and concurrent field measurements collected at the time of the satellite over-pass over the Peel-Harvey Estuarine System (32 degrees 30'S lat. 115 degrees 40'E long.) were used to obtain multitemporal, empirical algorithms for predicting pigment concentration, Secchi disk depth (SDD), and salinity. Highly significant, predictive algorithms were developed for these parameters. It is concluded that Landsat TM has the resolution and accuracy to be a potentially very useful monitoring tool. However, cloud cover and delays in data acquisition seriously diminish its usefulness for monitoring an anything less than a seasonal basis. Laboratory-based radiometric studies also indicated that Landsat TM was unlikely to be useful in determining the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton blooms in coastal waters.

Relationships between metal and suspended particulate matter (SPM), turbidity, colour (g440), temperature and system hydrology were quantified, and used to derive empirical models for predicting metal concentrations. In a test of the models using an independent data set, they explained a significant proportion of the variation in Al (90%), Fe (85%), and Mn (57%), but only 37% of the variation in riverine Zn concentrations. Metals concentrations are most strongly associated with SPM concentrations. The proportion of the total metal load associated with particulates (>0.45 mu m) is highly variable below 10 ppm SPM, indicating that this concentration approximates the division between systems dominated by weathered (solution) versus eroded (particulate) inputs. Annual metal exports were calculated, and empirical models for predicting catchment exports were developed using system hydrology and average SPM concentrations. These simple models can be used to estimate metals concentrations and exports from routine water quality monitoring data, without requiring chemical analyses. They also serve to distinguish background levels from those indicating metal contamination, and will, therefore, be useful for water quality evaluation.

Each factor can obscure the effects of the other. This complicates efforts to interpret and predict catchments' geochemical and hydrological behavior. Here we present simple empirical techniques for separating effects of discharge fluctuations and effects of changes in acid anion concentrations in catchment monitoring data. We illustrate these techniques with data from central Ontario. Statistically subtracting acid anion effects reveals that important water quality variables (e.g., sum of base cations, acid neutralizing capacity, H+, Al(i)) are simple functions of the logarithm of catchment discharge. Likewise, correcting for discharge effects reveals that these water quality variables are roughly linear functions of runoff acid anion concentrations. The linear functions linking acid anion concentrations to water quality can be reliably predicted from bulk catchment runoff chemistry. Therefore acid anions' effects on water quality can be reliably predicted, even if they are obscured by discharge fluctuations in catchment monitoring data.

The kinetics of the immobilized enzyme was studied, and mathematical descriptions were developed for the use of an immobilized enzyme packed-bed reactor to evaluate the kinetic parameters and the number of active sites on the immobilized enzyme. Suppression of phosphatase activity by orthophosphate was found to be significantly reduced, and the Michaelis-Menten constant increased when the enzyme was immobilized and packed in a reactor. Immobilized E.coli alkaline phosphatase exhibited similar activity at pH 8 in Tris-HCl, NaHCO3 and borate-HCl buffers but slightly lower activity in NH3H2O-NH4Ac buffer. The performance of the immobilized enzyme reactor was not affected by the presence of up to 10 M Mg(II), Ni(II), Cd(II), Co(II), Mn(II), Cu(II), or urea, 1 M Fe(II), or 0.1 M Fe(III) in the substrate stream. The chelating agent EDTA, however, gradually deactivated the immobilized enzyme. The periodic restoration of enzyme activity was achieved following the removal and addition of zinc ions. The immobilized E. coli alkaline phosphatase packed-bed reactor was used to measure the alkaline phosphatase available phosphorus content of a number of model organophosphorus compounds. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate showed a linear response in the range of 1.6 X 10(-7)-1.6 X 10(-4) M. This study forms part of a larger program to develop enzymatic systems for water quality measurement.

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has proven effective in rapidly separating and distinguishing chlorophylls, chlorophyll-degradation products, and carotenoids within monotypic and mixed algal samples. When coupled with absorbance and/or fluorescence spectroscopy, HPLC can accurately characterize phylogenetic groups and changes in community composition and yield information concerning microalgal physiological status, production, trophic interaction, and paleolimnology/paleooceanography. The recent widespread occurrence of toxic and noxious phytoplankton blooms has necessitated the use of remote imagery of pigment and reflectance ''signatures'' for monitoring and predicting bloom distribution. Because HPLC allows the processing of large numbers of samples from numerous locations relatively quickly, it is ideally suited for large-scale ''ground truthing'' of remotely sensed imagery. Coupled with rapidly evolving computer-based remote sensing technologies, HPLC-based pigment analyses may provide accurate assessments of aquatic biogeochemical flux, primary production, trophic state, water quality, and changes therein un local, regional, and global scales.

J	VANORDEN, GN; UCHRIN, CG				VANORDEN, GN; UCHRIN, CG			THE STUDY OF DISSOLVED-OXYGEN DYNAMICS IN THE WHIPPANY RIVER, NEW-JERSEY USING THE QUAL2E MODEL	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article								An intensive water quality study of the lower Whippany River, located in northeastern New Jersey, was performed examining dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, sediment oxygen demand, photosynthesis, river hydrology, geomorphology, and major inputs. Dissolved oxygen dynamics were studied using the USEPA Enhanced Stream Quality Model ''QUAL2E''. Model validation was performed using field data collected during 1980 and 1985 summer, low-flaw surveys. The computed values for DO, CBOD and nitrogen species corresponded closely to the actual instream data. DO uptake in the river was found to result predominantly from the biooxidation of carbonaceous and reduced nitrogenous compounds originating from two major municipal point sources: the Morristown and Hanover Sewerage Treatment Plants. Sediment oxygen demand occurring in reaches located immediately below the Morristown Sewerage Treatment Discharge also contributed significantly to DO uptake. The model did predict that by improving effluent quality of two major municipal discharges to 8 mg/1 BOD-5 and 2 mg/1 ammonia-nitrogen and by reducing the rate of SOD in the river, river DO will exceed 7.0 mg/1 at most locations.

J	CERCO, CF; COLE, T				CERCO, CF; COLE, T			3-DIMENSIONAL EUTROPHICATION MODEL OF CHESAPEAKE BAY	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article								CE-QUAL-ICM is a three-dimensional,time-variable,eutrophication model. CE-QUAL-ICM incorporates 22 state variables that include physical properties multiple forms of algae, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and silica; and dissolved oxygen. The model is part of a larger package that includes a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model and a benthic-sediment diagenesis model. Application to Chesapeake Bay over a three-year period, 1984-86, indicates the model successfully simulates water-column and sediment processes that affect water quality. Phenomena simulated include formation of the spring algal bloom subsequent to the annual peak in nutrient runoff, onset and breakup of summer anoxia, and coupling of organic particle deposition with sediment-water nutrient and oxygen fluxes. The study demonstrates that complex eutrophication problems can be addressed with coupled three-dimensional hydrodynamic and water-quality models.

This experiment was conducted to assess the influences of swine manure treatment (0 and 220 kg/ha nitrogen applied) and drying interval (4, 7, and 14 days) between manure application and first runoff event on quality of runoff from fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) plots. Runoff was generated from simulated rainfall (50 mm/h) and sampled at 0.08 h intervals during runoff Flow-weighted composite runoff samples from each treatment and replication were analyzed for nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and total suspended solids (TSS). One set per treatment of the noncomposited runoff samples was also analyzed. Runoff concentrations of all manure constituents investigated were higher for the manure-treated plots than for the untreated plots. Runoff NO3-N increased with drying interval due to nitrification, but concentrations of other manure constituents were unaffected by drying interval. Amounts of constituents lost from the plots in runoff were higher for the manure-treated plots than for the untreated plots, but all (including NO3-N) losses were found independent of drying interval. Analyses of the noncomposited runoff samples revealed high variability in the response of runoff quality to time after the beginning of runoff for all parameters investigated Data from the noncomposited samples did not lend itself to generalized descriptions of changes with respect to time of runoff concentrations of manure constituents.

AGNPS is used to estimate the amounts, origin, and distribution of sediment, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in the watershed. GRASS and GRASS WATERWORKS are used to generate parameters needed for AGNPS from digital maps, which include soil association, land use, watershed boundaries, water features, and digital elevation. Outputs of the model include spatially distributed estimates of volume and peak runoff, overland and channel erosion, sediment yields, and concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus. Management scenarios are explored in the AGNPS model to minimize sedimentation and nutrient loading. Scenarios evaluated include variations in crop cover, tillage methods, and other agricultural management practices.

J	SAMUELS, WB				SAMUELS, WB			LAKEMAP - A 2-D AND 3-D MAPPING SYSTEM FOR VISUALIZING WATER-QUALITY DATA IN LAKES	WATER RESOURCES BULLETIN			English	Article						LAKES; WATER QUALITY DATA; GRIDDING AND CONTOURING		The visualization of water quality data in lakes was achieved by integrating the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) STORET water quality database, lake shoreline polygons from EPA's Reach File (version 3), and the UNIMAP 2-D and 3-D interactive mapping and modeling software. Based on lake name (and state abbreviation), a lake shoreline polygon can be accessed from the Reach File. The coordinates of the polygon are portrayed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 1:100,000 scale Digital Line Graph (DLG) hydrography layer. This polygon is passed, in turn, to the STORET water quality file. Monitoring stations located within the polygon boundary are extracted along with the complete sampling survey. Specific parameters, such as total phosphorus, pH, ammonia, and optional time and depth restrictions can be selected to build a file of x, y, z(1), z(1),... zn data which is imported to UNIMAP. Up to four parameters, including depth, can be selected se a time. Within UNIMAP, the data is gridded and then displayed as a 2-D color contour map, 3-D perspective contour map, or 2-D projected time or depth slices. This system operates on the EPA ES9000 mainframe computer located in Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina. LAKEMAP is the culmination of an effort to bridge the gap between the vast array of environmental data collected by the EPA and the complex analytical and display software resident on the mainframe.

We conducted six bioassays on surface phytoplankton assemblages collected from productive Lake Apopka, Florida, to measure the effect of nutrient reduction on phytoplankton growth and nutritional state. Lake water was mixed with one of three diluents to create a gradient of ambient nutrient concentrations; nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) limitation at each level of dilution was evaluated in a 2 x 2 factorial design. While the addition of N clearly increased the growth of phytoplankton in undiluted Lake Apopka water, the phytoplankton became more P limited with the reduction of particles (30-60% dilution). Regression of algal yields onto total P concentrations from our bottle experiments indicated that an 8 mu g.L(-1) change in P leads to only a 1 mu g.L(-1) change in chlorophyll yield, probably due to the high concentration of P in the lake. Because dilution influences factors in addition to ambient nutrient concentrations, results obtained with the technique must be carefully evaluated. Despite this, reduction of particles to improve water quality may, in concept, be a reasonable management scheme in lakes where a large fraction of the nutrients is particulate.

A P site index has been proposed that qualitatively ranks sites based on their potential for off-site P movement. Soil test P is one of eight site characteristics used in calculating the current P site index. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature on crop, soil, and management factors which may be used as indirect measures of soil test P. Crop, soil, and management factors can influence soil test P in a variety of ways. It is quite probable that anticipated crop P removal at a particular site would reflect soil P test, and an extensive table was developed outlining P removal for numerous crops. Crops or crop rotations using relatively high P inputs will have higher soil P tests. This is true even when P inputs are balanced with P removal by the crop and reflects the low efficiency (crop P uptake divided by P application rate) that is typical for P. Vegetable and specialty crops in the cropping sequence and high subsoil P levels generally lead to higher surface soil P levels. Modeling efforts, using published P fertilizer recommendations and crop P removal rates, predicted the effects of two crop rotations on relative available P over time. Continuous corn (Zea mays L.) was predicted to maintain a higher level of relative available P than a corn-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation. Soil testing philosophies also influence the probability that a particular site may have a high soil P test. The maintenance approach will generally lead to higher soil P test levels than the sufficiency level approach. Reduced tillage may require greater P fertilization and lead to higher soil P levels. These crop, soil, and management factors may be used to differentiate areas that may vary in P soil test levels and, therefore, probably vary in their potential for P movement off-site. This would be particularly useful for large-scale applications of the P site-index where P soil test levels cannot be determined on every tract of land.

When rainbow trout were reared outdoors in cone-bottom capes and fed the same floating feed, recovery of solids from the cages by daily pumping averaged 16.3% when cages were in calm water but only 3.6% when cages were in strong water currents. Based on estimates of phosphorus concentrations in feed, fish, and solids, 24-h-interval pumping from cages in calm water removed 35% of the total phosphorus fed to the fish and 45% of the phosphorus that would have been lost to the environment. Daily pumping of wastes from customized cages modified to trap settleable solids was a simple and effective method of reducing water quality degradation under our experimental conditions.

Aspects of river eutrophication in Ireland	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY			English	Article						Eutrophication; rivers; phosphorus; spreadsheet model; rainfall-discharge model; phosphate-discharge model		In the absence of recognised criteria for phosphate in rivers, this paper attempts to arrive at an independant phosphate criterion value for Irish rivers as distinct from lakes. A comparison is made between biological assessments of river water quality and phosphate values at some 800 sites over a 3-year period. This analysis demonstrated that river eutrophication begins to be a problem when median annual "ortho-phosphate" (MRP) levels exceed 30 mu g P l(-1). A spreadsheet modelling technique aimed at predicting in-stream phosphate levels is illustrated by an example for the River Deel in County Mayo, Ireland. Regression equations link river flow rates or phosphate concentrations with daily rainfall figures in order to predict stream discharge and phosphate concentration on a 365-day basis. The equations - or similar site-specific equations - can be implemented using any of the standard spreadsheet packages for microcomputers.

FRAMEWORK FOR REGIONAL-ANALYSIS	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							EPIC-PST; PESTICIDE	Agricultural production systems provide some unique challenges for assessing the regional impacts of water quality protection policies. A modeling framework is proposed for assessing the environmental and economic consequences of groundwater quality protection policies at the regional level. The model consists of three components: (1) a crop simulation/chemical transport model, (2) a regional economic optimization model, and (3) an aquifer groundwater flow model. The three submodels are linked and run recursively to simulate producer response to alternative water quality policies over a multiple-year time horizon. Model solutions provide projections of production practices employed on various resource situations across the region. Economic evaluation of alternative policies may he based upon regional agricultural income, crop production levels, input use, and changes in aquifer water levels over time. Measures of agricultural nonpoint source pollution provided by the model include nitrate, phosphorus and pesticide loadings in deep percolation and runoff water, as well as sediment losses.

APPLICATION TO THE CENTRAL HIGH-PLAINS	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article								A three-stage modeling framework is applied to evaluate the potential economic and environmental impacts of agricultural groundwater protection policies in the Central High Plains Region. Three alternative policies (limitations on total nitrogen applications, limitations on unit-area nitrogen applications, and restrictions on the use of selected herbicides) are compared to a baseline scenario that reflects the absence of any form of groundwater quality protection measures. In general, nitrogen restrictions are more effective in reducing nitrate loadings in percolation water if implemented on a unit-area basis rather than as a total (farm level) restriction. In contrast, the total restriction is more effective in controlling runoff losses of nitrogen. Both nitrogen restrictions have significant impacts on crop production levels and regional agricultural income, while the economic consequences of the pesticide restriction are much less pronounced. The proposed regional modeling framework provides critical information necessary to assess the economic and environmental tradeoffs of policy alternatives aimed at controlling agricultural nonpoint source pollution.

J	NILSSON, SI				NILSSON, SI			ACIDIFICATION OF SWEDISH OLIGOTROPHIC LAKES - INTERACTIONS BETWEEN DEPOSITION, FOREST GROWTH AND EFFECTS ON LAKE-WATER QUALITY	AMBIO			English	Article							SOUTHERN SWEDEN; SPRUCE FOREST; CATION POOLS; SOILS; CATCHMENT; ACIDITY; BIOMASS; REVERSIBILITY; ACCUMULATION; NITROGEN	Lake acidification mechanisms are reviewed with emphasis on Swedish lakes in forested regions with podsolized soils, and the combined influence of atmospheric deposition and forest growth. Short-term changes in surface water acidity are determined by the alkalinity and total salt concentration in the water infiltrating the soil, the relative mobility of the anions, and by the main water-flow paths. Long-term effects on lake acidity are mediated through changes in soil base saturation; these changes are determined by the balance between atmospheric deposition of strong acids and internal soil acidification processes on the one hand and weathering of soil minerals on the other. Estimates of current soil acidification due to annual base-cation accumulation in trees, were obtained by combining results from inventories of volumetric growth and specific studies on biomass and nutrient distribution in different tree species. The soil acidification due to base cations is in the same order of magnitude as the soil acidification associated with the deposition of strong acids, regardless of geographical region. Both processes increase from north to south. The total impact on surface-water chemistry is enhanced in south-western Sweden, by the combination of high tree growth rate and high atmospheric load of marine chloride salts, sulfate salts and sulfuric acid.

Research was conducted to assess atrazine [6-chloro-N'-ethyl-N'-(1-methylethyl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine] and alachlor [2-chloro-N-(12,6-diethylphenyl)-N-(methoxymethyl) acetamide] losses in subsurface tile drainage during and after long-term use on a Webster clay loam soil (Typic Haplaquoll) at Waseca, MN, under typical agricultural management conditions. Individual subsurface drainage systems were installed in 1975 to plots cropped continuously to corn (Zea mays L.) under moldboard plow and no-tillage systems. Annual alachlor and atrazine use was initiated in 1974 and 1975, respectively. Alachlor use was continued through 1991 while atrazine use was terminated after the 1988 application. Tile drainage water was collected and analyzed for atrazine and alachlor beginning in October 1985. Alachlor was detected in only 2% of the samples from 1985 through 1991. Atrazine was detected in 97% of the samples from 1985 through 1990. Atrazine detection frequency declined to 78% in 1991. Atrazine concentration in October 1985 was 0.56 mug L-1. Average atrazine concentration in tile drainage water in 1986 was 1.0 mug L-1 and estimated loss by leaching was 4.1 g ha-1. Average atrazine concentrations in 1987 and 1988 were 1.24 and 0.84 mug L-1, respectively, but due to limited tile flow, atrazine losses were less than 1 g ha-1 each year. Twelve to 18 mo after the last atrazine application, average atrazine concentration in tile water did not decline. However, from 24 to 30 mo after the final atrazine application, average concentration dropped to 0.42 mug L-1 and during the following growing season average concentration declined to 0.29 mug L-1. There was little fluctuation in atrazine concentration during any year. Tillage systems had minimal impacts on atrazine concentration or loss in tile drainage water. This research indicates that low concentrations of atrazine may contaminate tile drainage water during and after long-term use and may persist for several years after use is stopped. Contamination of drainage from similar use of alachlor appears minimal.

J	DANIEL, TC; EDWARDS, DR; SHARPLEY, AN				DANIEL, TC; EDWARDS, DR; SHARPLEY, AN			EFFECT OF EXTRACTABLE SOIL SURFACE PHOSPHORUS ON RUNOFF WATER-QUALITY	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						POLLUTION; RUNOFF; WATER QUALITY	LOSSES; MANAGEMENT; DESORPTION	Phosphorus (P) additions to surface water from agricultural nonpoint sources are of concern, because P often limits eutrophication of surface waters. Numerous sources of runoff P exist: indigenous soil and plant material, land-applied manure and sludge, and commercial fertilizer. In many soils receiving commercial fertilizer and manure, concentrations of P at the soil surface have been steadily rising due to either long-term or excessive applications of P. Critical levels of soil surface P may exist, above which runoff may promote eutrophication. Methods for rationally identifying these critical levels are needed to manage losses of P, which implies the need for accurate methods of relating soil surface P concentration (P(s)) to runoff P concentration. A study was conducted on both pasture and tilled plots (with and without residue) to evaluate the relationship between P(s) and dissolved reactive P in runoff (P(R)) using simulated rainfall. The data indicated that even for comparable storms, P(s) alone was not a satisfactory estimator of P(R). A model describing the kinetics of P release from surface soil to runoff was used to include additional variables in predicting P(R). When used with uncalibrated parameters, the model explained a significant proportion of the variation in observed P(R) values for pasture plots (r2 = 0.43) but was less successful in predicting PR for tilled plots (with and without residue, r2 = 0.13). Calibration of (adjustments to) the extraction coefficients resulted in an overall coefficient of determination between observed and predicted P(R) values of 0.73. While the model was successful in describing how P(R) and the independent variables are related for the pasture plots, the extraction coefficients should be calibrated to obtain best estimates of P(R). When used with calibrated extraction coefficients, the model provided realistic estimates of P(R) over the range of experimental conditions.

The measurements cover different trophic states of water bodies. from oligotrophic to hypertrophic, and different climatic conditions. The range of chlorophyll-a is 0. 1 350 mg m-3, suspended matter is 0.1-66 mg l-1 and dissolved organic matter absorption, al a wavelength of 380 nm, is 0.1 12 m-1. All radiometric measurements were performed with a single radiometer in the 400 750 nm range with spectral resolution better than 1 nm. Factor and signature analysis, as well as multispectral statistical modeling of water quality parameters versus simulated spectral band ratios, made possible the determination of appropriate functions of reflectance for estimating phytoplankton chlorophyll-a, suspended matter and dissolved organic matter concentrations, One set of measurements was used to develop empirical relationships between the spectral reflectance and the above-mentioned water quality parameters. The other sets of measurements were used to test these relationships. The maximum errors of estimation are: 3 mg m-3 for chlorophyll-a, 4 mg l-1 for suspended matter and 0.065 mgC m-3 for dissolved organic matter. The results are used to develop an appropriate methodology for monitoring of eutrophication processes in inland waters.

These processes are outlined, together with complementary modelling approaches: (i) development of sophisticated three-dimensional models to represent the physics, and sub-models of suspended sediment, microbiology and metal interactions for processes controlling nutrients, dissolved oxygen, phytoplankton, detritus and metals; (ii) a framework to link these component models; (iii) an accessible model with simpler physics for wide use in simulating constituent distributions, for comparison with measurements to infer sources, sinks and interactions. The North Sea Project measurements provide an input in process evaluation, and data to test the models.

At the same time a harmonized nationwide monitoring program was established to monitor the reduction in nutrient load from different sectors and the ecological effects in the aquatic environment. The monitoring program covers all aquatic media and provides spatial and temporal information on the land-use related distribution of nutrients and their effects on the aquatic environment. Results obtained during the first year are presented together with long-term trends in nutrient loading and surface-water quality. Nitrogen has been documented to be the limiting nutrient for phytoplankton production in Danish marine waters, except in many inshore waters for a short period in spring where phosphorus is the limiting nutrient. One of the main objectives of the Danish Action Plan is therefore to reduce nitrogen loading of the aquatic environment by 50% before 1994. Preliminary model estimates show that a similar reduction in the nitrogen input from Sweden and Germany to the Kattegat and the Belt Sea will lead to an increase in autumn bottom-water oxygen concentration of 0.5-1.0 ml L-1.

J	DEVRIES, W				DEVRIES, W			AVERAGE CRITICAL LOADS FOR NITROGEN AND SULFUR AND ITS USE IN ACIDIFICATION ABATEMENT POLICY IN THE NETHERLANDS	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION			English	Review							PACIFIC NORTHWEST CONIFERS; RED SPRUCE SEEDLINGS; FOREST SOIL HORIZONS; SOLUTION CULTURE; ALUMINUM CONCENTRATION; ACID DEPOSITION; ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION; AMMONIUM-SULFATE; WATER-QUALITY; TOLERANCE	Atmospheric deposition of N and S on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems causes effects induced by eutrophication and acidification. Effects of eutrophication include forest damage, NO3 pollution of groundwater and vegetation changes in forests, heathlands and surface waters due to an excess of N. Effects of acidification include forest damage, groundwater pollution, and loss of fish populations due to Al mobilization. Critical loads (deposition levels) for N and S on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the Netherlands related to these effects have been derived by empirical data and steady-state acidification models. Critical loads of N generally vary between 500 and 1500 mol(c) ha-1 yr-1 for forests, heathlands and surface waters and between 1500 and 3600 for phreatic groundwaters. Critical loads of total acid (S and N) vary between 300 to 500 mol(c) ha-1 yr-1 for phreatic groundwaters and surface waters and between 1100 to 1700 mol ha-1 yr-1 for forests. On the basis of the various critical loads a deposition target for total acid of 1400 mol(c) ha-1 yr-1 has been set in the Netherlands from which the N input should be less than 1000 mol(c) ha-1 yr-1. This level, to be reached in the year 2010, implies an emission reduction of 80-90% in SO2, NO(x) and NH3 in the Netherlands and of about 30% in neighboring countries compared to 1980 emissions.

Non-tidal palustrine forested wetlands comprised 66.0% of the 11,372 ha of wetlands in Caroline Co. The majority were either seasonally (4000 ha) or temporarily (1596 ha) flooded wetlands dominated by broad-leaved deciduous species. These wetlands are both small (averaging 5.4 and 2.4 ha in area, respectively) and numerous in this region. Adsorption by Al and Fe (hydr)oxides and precipitation of Al, Fe, and Ca phosphates probably controls dissolved phosphate retention and long-term P storage in these wetlands, although P storage in the woody biomass of aggrading forests may also be important. Phosphorus adsorption isotherms, a single-point phosphorus adsorption index, and concentrations of oxalate-extractrable (noncrystalline) Al and Fe have all been used as comparative indices of P sorption potentials in wetland soils, although the latter may represent the best single index of P sorption capacity because of its direct relationship to the mechanisms controlling P adsorption in soil. When using these indices to compare wetland P sorption potentials, it is important to consider differences in soil depth, profile heterogeneity, and bulk density between sites. Actual amounts of phosphate retained by a wetland will also be influenced by the degree of phosphate loading it receives, as determined by hydrology, phosphate sources in the watershed, and the P sorption potentials of surrounding upland soils. Because of the low P sorption potentials of sandy soils in coastal plain uplands, non-tidal palustrine forested wetlands in the mid-Atlantic coastal plain may perform particularly important functions with respect to dissolved phosphate removal and retention on the landscape.

An empirical approach of relating TM data with ground referenced data for these parameters through regression analysis was employed. Significant relationships were established between them. These models were used to predict and map these parameters in 27 of the Norfolk Broads. All the predicted values are consistent with the available general knowledge about these Broads.

Simultaneous measurements of the- upwelling and downwelling irradiances, along with phytoplankton chlorophyll-a, suspended matter and dissolved organic matter concentration at over 20 water bodies throughout former USSR, Hungary, Germany and Bulgaria, are reported in this article. The measurements cover different trophic states of water bodies, from oligotrophic to hypertrophic, and different climatic conditions. The range of chlorophyll-a is 0.1 to 350 Mg m-3, suspended matter is 0.1 to 66 mg l-1, and dissolved organic matter absorption at the wavelength 380 nm is 0.1 to 12 m-1. All radiometric measurements are performed with a single radiometer in the 400-750 nm range with spectral resolution better than 1 nm. Factor and signature analysis, as well as multi-spectral statistical modelling of water quality parameters versus simulated spectral band ratios, makes possible the determination of appropriate functions of reflectance for estimating phytoplankton chlorophyll-a, suspended matter, and dissolved organic matter concentrations. One set of measurements is used to develop empirical relationships among the spectral reflectance and the above-mentioned water quality parameters. The other sets of measurements are used to test these relationships. The maximum error of estimation are: 3 mg m-3 for chlorophyll-a, 4 mg l-1 for suspended matter and 0.065 mg Cm-3 (mg of carbon per m3) for dissolved organic matter. The results are used to develop an appropriate methodology for monitoring of eutrophication process in inland waters and to test concepts of inland water quality monitoring from space.

Values for these coefficients may be established through field and laboratory experimentation or through model calibration, guided by literature estimates. Uncertainty in coefficient selection influences model performance and reliability. Here, a site-specific approach to the determination of selected kinetic coefficients used in modeling phytoplankton growth is described. The technique involves laboratory incubation of natural phytoplankton assemblages under controlled conditions of light and temperature. Example applications are provided for two eutrophic systems: Onondaga Lake, New York and Green Bay, Lake Michigan. Kinetic coefficients derived according to the proposed technique are field verified through in situ incubations of natural phytoplankton assemblages. The value of the approach for reducing model uncertainty is explored using Monte-Carlo analysis.

Gracilaria verrucosa and Ulva lactuca decomposed rapidly in outdoor mesocosms. Ulva, but not Gracilaria, became nitrogen-enriched during decomposition. Maximal weekly rates of nitrogen release were 5.91 +/- 2.23 and 6.37 +/- 2.59 g N m-2 d-1, respectively for Gracilaria and Ulva. Temperature had a significant effect on the decomposition rate of Gracilaria in a laboratory experiment: decomposition was greater at 30-degrees-C than at 25-degrees-C. No net decomposition was observed at 16-degrees-C. Gracilaria became nitrogen enriched at 30-degrees-C, but not at 16-degrees or 25-degrees. The release of stored nutrients from decaying seaweeds should be included in nutrient budgets and models when seaweed standing stocks are significant. Seaweed source-sink relationships are important ecologically and can be applied to attempts at using seaweeds as environmental monitors of anthropogenic eutrophication and to efforts of cultivating seaweeds for the improvement of water quality.

Fluorigenic 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate served as a model substrate. Experiments were conducted using sediment cores in a laboratory simulation of diffuse groundwater discharge through the stream bed, a natural process occurring in the Breitenbach as well as many other streams. Streambed sediments contained high levels of particulate phosphorus, but concentrations of dissolved phosphorus in the interstitial water were 3 to 4 orders of magnitude lower. These interstitial concentrations were similar to those in the stream and groundwater. Extracellular phosphatase activity was high in the streambed sediments. These enzymes probably contribute significantly to the flux of phosphorus in sediment by hydrolyzing phosphomonoesters, making free phosphate available to the sediment microorganisms. Factors influencing the kinetic parameters V(max) (maximum activity) and apparent K(m) (enzyme affinity) of phosphatase were discharge rates of water through the sediment, water quality (ground- or stream water), and substrate (phosphomonoesters) as well as dissolved ortho-phosphate concentrations. Enzymes are supposed to be effective at limiting substrate concentrations, where, in this study, changes in discharge rates had little influence on rates of hydrolysis. Higher V(max) and lower K(m) values were found during percolation of groundwater through the sediment cores, compared with stream water. This indicates that rates of hydrolysis were higher with groundwater, both at substrate limitation and at substrate saturation.

Studies have evaluated chemicals such as hexazinone, picloram, sulfometuron methyl, metsulfuron methyl, azinphosmethyl, triclopyr, carbofuran, lindane, malathion, fenvalerate, copper-chromium-arsenic, and pentachlorophenol. Off-site movement in stream flow, leaching to ground water, and thermal combustion have been examined. Model verifications of pesticide fate and dissipation and risk analyses have been conducted using simulation models such as GLEAMS, CREAMS, and PRZM. Field study data indicate that movement is controlled by the main hydrologic pathways (e.g., surface runoff, infiltration, interflow, and leaching below the root zone). Peak residue concentrations tend to be low (<500 mug/L), except where direct applications are made to perennial streams or to ephemeral channels, and where buffer strips are not used and do not persist for extended periods of time. Indirect effects noted from the use of pesticides in forested watersheds include temporarily increased nitrate nitrogen losses, reduced sediment yields, temporal changes in terrestrial invertebrate abundance, reduced plant diversity, and changes in particulate organic matter transport in streams. Very limited cumulative effects research has been conducted. The effects of increasing watershed size on herbicide concentrations and the impact of nonforestry pesticides on fish have been examined. Analyses conducted in regional environmental impact statements indicate that the low concentrations and short persistence of forestry pesticides in surface and ground water do not pose a significant risk to water quality, aquatic biota, or human health.

Two water salinity treatments (channel water; EC(w) = 0.07 and groundwater; 2.4 dS m-1) and four irrigation frequencies were included in a factorial design with four replicates. The channel water treatments were irrigated when pan evaporation minus rainfall equalled 50 mm, whereas the groundwater treatments were irrigated at deficits of 40, 50, 65 or 80 mm. Cumulative dry matter of the clover was significantly less in treatments irrigated with saline groundwater compared to channel water at day 164, and soil salinities (EC(e)) increased on average from 2.3 to 5.07 dS m-1. In contrast, salinity of the irrigation water had no effect on the cumulative yield of grass. Cumulative dry matter of the grass and clover were not affected by groundwater irrigation frequency. Total N accumulation by the grass did not differ significantly between treatments. However, total N accumulation in white clover was significantly less (P < 0.05) in all treatments irrigated with groundwater compared to channel water. Neither the N concentrations of the grass nor the clover differed significantly between the salinity treatments. Salinity and irrigation frequency had no effect on the proportion of clover N (P(atm)) derived from N2 fixation. The values of P(atm) were high throughout, and increased progressively from 0.78 at day 39 to 0.91 at day 164 (P < 0.01). However, the yield of fixed N was lower in clover when watered with groundwater compared to channel water (P < 0.01). Thus low to moderate soil salinity did not affect the symbiotic dependence of clover, but the yield of biologically-fixed N was depressed through a reduction in the dry matter yield of the legume. The efficiency of the dairy industry in the Murray-Goulburn Irrigation region is dependent on the white clover component of the pasture supplying adequate nitrogen (N) for the intensive grazing system (Cockroft and Martin 1981; Mundy 1987). In conjunction with water, the flux of biologically-fixed N, into the farming system determines the yield and productivity. Greater amounts of N are essential if the higher yield potential afforded by irrigation is to be realised. Limited data are available on the inputs of atmospheric N2 fixed by white clover grown in mixed pastures of the region (Mundy 1987). A shallow saline watertable has developed throughout the irrigation region of northern Victoria, with commensurate rises in soil salinity (Mehanni and Bleasdale 1983; Noble et al. 1987). The re-use of the moderately saline groundwater for irrigation is one salinity management strategy under consideration. However, this option is only practicable if productivity losses are minimal. Studies have been undertaken to evaluate the effect of irrigation with saline water on the growth of pasture (Mehanni and Repsys 1980, 1986) and lucerne (Noble et al. 1987), and recently Mehanni and West (1992) reported positive pasture yield response to N application when irrigated with saline water. However, no measurements have been made of the effect of irrigation with saline water on N2 fixation. Consequently, the impact of changes in the irrigation water quality and soil salinity on N2 fixation must be determined. The objective of this work was to determine the effect of irrigation with saline groundwater on the proportion of N derived from the atmosphere (P(atm)) in white clover, estimated by the N-15 isotope dilution technique using grass as the non-fixing reference plant.

Here the temporal and spatial patterns in natural plankton communities are interpreted as transient and stationary non-equilibrium solutions of dynamical nonlinear interaction-diffusion-advection systems. The analysis of a simple model of phytoplankton-zooplankton dynamics in space and time is presented. Nutrients and planktivorous fish are not treated separately, but they act as environmental control variables. After summarizing the local properties, the emergence of spatial and spatio-temporal patterns is considered. Conditions for the formation of spatial patterns after the diffusive instability of a uniform species distribution are derived, and numerical results of diffusive as well as shear-diffusive patterning are presented on a two-dimensional spatial cross-section. The variability of phytoplankton growth due to its light sensitivity is considered in a linear approximation. Multiple stability, oscillations, the propagation of planktic fronts as well as stationary and drifting patches are presented.

Some additional observations on the periphyton development upon leaves of Potamogeton pectinatus L. have been made simultaneously. Four different light conditions were created in an experimental setup by manipulating the photon flux density through artificial shading. Periphyton upon artificial substratum exhibited a relatively high abundance with a distinct seasonal pattern. Periphyton accrual rates were highest at the beginning of June and in August and September upon slides which were incubated for two weeks. Periphyton mass increased during May and June, decreased or remained about the same during July and subsequently increased until an upper plateau was reached upon slides which were incubated from the beginning of May onwards. Generally, periphyton mass was lower upon slides than upon P. pectinatus. The seasonal variation in periphyton mass was more pronounced upon P. pectinatus leaves than upon the slides. Attenuation by periphyton upon slides ranged from 5 to 65% after two weeks of incubation. Periphyton upon slides which had been incubated for more than two weeks demonstrated an attenuation of more than 85%. Water quality parameters other than photon flux density were probably more important in determining the periphyton dynamics, since only minor differences were observed in periphyton mass between the various light conditions. Chlorophyll-a content was higher with increased shading on various sampling dates. Periphyton, especially 'older' periphyton consisted largely of settled silt and clay particles and to a lesser extent of detrital matter on both substrata. Living epiphytes were only a relatively small fraction. It is concluded that a reduction of resuspension of sediment particles, giving less suspended matter in the water column, will result in lower periphytic mass. Consequently, the quantity of photosynthetically active radiation reaching the submerged macrophytes is expected to increase considerably.

J	POMOGYI, P				POMOGYI, P			NUTRIENT RETENTION BY THE KIS-BALATON WATER PROTECTION SYSTEM	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						EUTROPHICATION; WATER QUALITY PROTECTION; NUTRIENT LOAD; NUTRIENT RETENTION		Water quality of Lake Balaton, particularly that of its south-western basin (the Keszthely-Bay), has been deteriorating faster and faster. The greatest transporter of inorganic nutrients to the Bay is the Zala River. The lower valley of the river was part of the lake until about 200 years ago. Later, a large part of the area was turned to a wetland, while the smaller part dried up. To retain the nutrients from Keszthely-Bay, the former marshland is now being reconstructed: the so-called Kis-Balaton Water Protection System (KBWPS). The first part of the System, the Hidvegi-Pond, has been operating since the middle of 1985. The second stage, the Feneki-Pond, to be finished by the end of this century, is now under construction. The main purpose of the KBWPS is to gain enough time to build up the technology necessary for an adequate protection of Lake Balaton. From the beginning of the operation of the Hidvegi-Pond a multidisciplinary research program has been carried out to monitor the hydrological, hydraulical, ecological, and biological processes in the reservoir. This program focused on nitrogen and phosphorus loadings and retention. Input and output loads were estimated from daily measurements. The mechanisms of retention were studied in special projects. With the exception of TN, nutrient retention increased from year to year. In 1990, 96% of PO4-P, 87% NO3-N, and 58% of TP were retained. This efficiency exceeds expectations. Retention of TN is the lowest (about 20%), due to N2-fixation by blue-green algae. However, the second stage needs to be implemented, since there is an additional external load from the watershed of the lower valley, and nutrient release takes place during decomposition of the organic matter which leaves the Hidvegi-Pond.

There was a zooplankton succession of rotifers (mostly Brachionus), Moina, Boeckella and Mesocyclops, and then Daphnia. An increase in Daphnia correlated with a decline in Anabaena, suggesting grazing on that cyanobacterium. Golden perch larvae included copepods in their diet whereas silver perch did not, and this was reflected in lower Boeckella numbers in the golden perch ponds. There was sufficient zooplankton forage, supplemented by chironomid larvae in the later stages of the rearing ponds, for fish growth. The limnological conditions and zooplankton communities in these ponds provide a model for evaluating nursery grounds for these fish.

Ground water was collected (1990-92) monthly from three range sites (south Florida flatwoods, slough, and freshwater pond) at the Southwest Florida Research and Education Center near Immokalee, Florida. Water samples were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, total phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and ammonium-nitrogen (NH4-N); and water table depth was monitored monthly. Levels of nutrients were highly variable during the sampling period. Levels of P at all three sites exceeded the South Florida Water Management District's (SFWMD) maximum allowed level (0.18 mg P/L) in surface water runoff from rangeland. Time series models were useful for predicting (p<0.15) future events for all nutrients and water table depth. Variation in water quality, related to its N, P, and K content, was minimized by excavating the ground water wells three times before sampling. Water samples continue to be collected from each range site to develop a longterm water quality database from unfertilized rangeland.

Although several algal assays and chemical extractions have been proposed to estimate BAP, procedural and theoretical limitations have restricted widespread BAP measurement. Thus, a routine method was developed to estimate BAP, which uses iron oxide-impregnated paper strips (Fe-oxide strips) as a P-sink for BAP in runoff. In the proposed method BAP is determined by shaking 50 mL of unfiltered runoff with one Fe-oxide strip for 16 h. Phosphorus is removed from the strip by 0.1 M H2SO4 and measured. The BAP content of runoff from 20 agricultural watersheds in the Southern Plains was related to the growth of P-starved algae incubated for 29 d with runoff as the sole source of P. Acting as a P sink, Fe-oxide strips may have a stronger theoretical basis than chemical extraction in estimating BAP. The method may also have potential use as an environmental soil P test to indicate soils liable to enrich runoff with sufficient P to accelerate eutrophication. Bioavailable P loss in runoff was lower from no till (438 g ha-1 yr-1) than from conventional till (1288 g ha-1 yr-1). Kinetic and enrichment ratio approaches accurately predicted (r2 of 0.93) BAP transport in runoff during 1988 to 1990. Use of the Fe-oxide strip method will facilitate estimation of BAP transport in runoff and thereby, improve assessment of the resultant impact on the biological productivity of receiving surface waters.

J	SHARPLEY, AN; SMITH, SJ				SHARPLEY, AN; SMITH, SJ			PREDICTION OF BIOAVAILABLE PHOSPHORUS LOSS IN AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							SURFACE RUNOFF; SOIL; NUTRIENTS	The loss of bioavailable P (BAP) in both soluble (SP) and particulate (BPP, bioavailable particulate P) forms in agricultural runoff, can accelerate the eutrophication of surface waters. Bioavailable P represents P that is potentially available for algal uptake. Although prediction of BAP loss would provide a more reliable assessment of the impact of agricultural management on surface water eutrophication than just SP or total P (TP), currently no predictive equations are available. Bioavailable P transport in soluble and particulate forms in runoff from 20 agricultural watersheds in the Southern Plains over a 5-yr period, was predicted using kinetic and enrichment ratio approaches, respectively. Measured and predicted SP and BPP concentrations of individual runoff events were similar for all watersheds and management practices over a range of 7 to 3522 and 3 to 4059 mug L-1, respectively. Calculated as the sum of SP and BPP, BAP loss in runoff was predicted accurately, with only a 12% error in measured mean annual loss (662 g ha-1 yr-1). Although BAP loss below 100 g ha-1yr-1 was underestimated, above this value measured and predicted values closely followed a 1:1 relationship. Inclusion of these equations in comprehensive water quality models will improve the prediction of agricultural management on the biological response of receiving water bodies.

J	RITTER, WF				RITTER, WF			PHOSPHORUS LOADING MODELS FOR DELAWARE LAKES	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING & TOXIC AND HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE CONTROL			English	Article						PHOSPHORUS; MODELS; LAKES		Phosphorus concentrations were predicted for 29 Delaware lakes by the Vollenweider, Chapra, Larcen-Mercier, Backman-Canfield, Dillon-Rigler and Reckhow phosphorus loading models. All lakes were part of the Delaware Clean Lakes survey in which lake morphometry data were collected and water quality sampling was conducted. Twenty-five of the lakes had 97% or more of the phosphorus entering from nonpoint sources. The mean depth of the 29 lakes varied from 0.4 to 1.8 m and the detention time varied from 0.8 to 80 days. The predicted total phosphorus concentration was regressed against the predicted total phosphorus concentrations for each model. The Dillon-Rigler model gave the highest r2 followed by the Larcen-Mercier model. The Reckhow model gave the lowest r2 value. The r2 values ranged from 0.314 to 0.602. Logarithmic transformations gave lower r2 than using the original observed and predicted phosphorus concentration data.

Major municipal sewage treatment plants were limited to 1 mg/L total phosphorus and phosphorus loadings to Lake Erie have decreased significantly. Recent estimates of point source loadings from municipal and industrial sites in the Lake Erie basin show that these improvements have continued as smaller sources are providing treatment and larger sources are achieving better control. For larger plants, compliance on a monthly basis is approaching 100%. Because of this, further point source reductions cannot exceed about 50 tonnes per year unless a lower phosphorus limit is established.

J	ESTERBY, SR; BERTRAM, PE				ESTERBY, SR; BERTRAM, PE			COMPATIBILITY OF SAMPLING AND LABORATORY PROCEDURES EVALUATED FOR THE 1985 3-SHIP INTERCOMPARISON STUDY ON LAKE ERIE	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						QUALITY ASSURANCE; WATER QUALITY; LAKE ERIE; STATISTICAL ANALYSIS		To update the information concerning data intercomparability from Great Lakes monitoring programs, a three-ship laboratory comparison was conducted on the central basin (mid-lake) of Lake Erie in August 1985, in which eight water quality parameters were measured Participating were ships operated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Ohio State University, and Environment Canada. Two separate comparison studies were conducted, the first to identify that portion of variability due to analytical variability (AV), and the second to assess the overall variability (OV) in whole-ship operations, including water sampling procedures at two depths, epilimnion and hypolimnion. In general, differences in mean levels were due primarily to laboratory procedures, with significant differences occurring between at least one pair of laboratories for every parameter. For all parameters, except chloride and nitrate plus nitrite, these differences ranged from 30 to nearly 100 percent of the mean in the water layer with the lower concentration and from 12 to 95 percent in the layer with higher concentration. The results for some parameters were overly precise for one or more laboratories, which led to differences as small as 3 to 6 percent of the mean being significant (nitrate plus nitrite and chloride). However, large laboratory differences were observed for soluble reactive silica even though laboratory precision was high. These results are discussed in view of the quality assurance program of the EPA laboratory, the August 1985 monitoring of central basin stations by the three agencies, and the magnitude of changes in total phosphorus in Lake Erie over time. It is concluded that, although at least one laboratory exhibited precision better than that of the 1985 monitoring program, the differences between laboratories estimated from the intercomparison study are large enough to be of practical significance and thus careful consideration is necessary before combining results from monitoring programs of the different agencies.

J	HAVIS, RN; ALBERTS, EE				HAVIS, RN; ALBERTS, EE			NUTRIENT LEACHING FROM FIELD-DECOMPOSED CORN AND SOYBEAN RESIDUE UNDER SIMULATED RAINFALL	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL			English	Article							WHEAT STRAW RESIDUES; ORGANIC-CARBON; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; RUNOFF; LOSSES	Quantification of nutrient leaching from crop residue is important in the management of agricultural water quality. This study measured plant matter decay under field conditions, and nutrient (NH4, PO4, and NO3) leaching dynamics and total mass transport from partially decomposed corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] residue under laboratory-scale rainfall simulation. Plant matter decay rates were not significantly different for the two crops during 1 yr of decomposition. The nutrient mass leached (nutrient mass/plant material mass) from soybean residue was, in decreasing order, NH4-N > NO3-N > PO4-P and, from corn residue, NH4-N > PO4-P, NO3-N. More NO3-N and NH4-N was leached from soybean residue than from corn residue, but corn residue released more PO4-P than soybean residue. The fraction of water-soluble nutrient mass in the plant material that was leached under rainfall increased for NO3, decreased for NH4, and remained constant for PO4, as residue decomposed. Equations to simulate nutrient leaching dynamics under simulated rainfall were evaluated and values for model variables were estimated through nonlinear least squares analysis. A hyperbolic equation provided the best model of the total nutrient mass leached during a rainfall event.

J	EDWARDS, DR; DANIEL, TC				EDWARDS, DR; DANIEL, TC			RUNOFF QUALITY IMPACTS OF SWINE MANURE APPLIED TO FESCUE PLOTS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						ANIMAL MANURE; WATER QUALITY	COASTAL BERMUDAGRASS; RAINFALL RUNOFF; FORAGE MIXTURE; EFFLUENT; REMOVAL; YIELD; WATER	Runoff concentrations of animal manure ConStituents are much higher for the first runoff-producing storm after land application than for subsequent storms. These concentrations are also inversely related to the interval between application and first runoff-producing storm. In terms of runoff quality, the worst situation is generally when the first runoff-producing storm occurs soon after application. This study was conducted to determine how potential first-storm runoff quality from rescue grass plots is affected by animal manure application rate and simulated rainfall intensity. Swine manure slurry was used in a factorial experimental design with three levels [0, 217, and 435 kg nitrogen (N)ha-1] of slurry application rate and two levels (5 and 10 cm h-1) of simulated rainfall intensity. The slurry was applied during moist soil conditions. Simulated rainfall was initiated 24 h following application. Runoff amounts and concentrations of slurry constituents (total Kjeldahl N, ammonia N, nitrate N, total phosphorus, dissolved reactive phosphorus, chemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids, and electrical conductivity) were determined. Analyses of variance were performed to assess the influences of the variables on both concentrations and event mass losses of the slurry constituents. Both runoff concentrations and event mass losses of all slurry constituents except nitrate N increased approximately linearly with application rate. Runoff concentrations of all slurry constituents except nitrate N decreased with increasing rainfall intensity, but event mass losses were unaffected.

Inputs of nitrogen to the site were manure fertilizer, commercial fertilizer, nitrogen in precipitation, and nitrogen in ground-water inflow; and these sources averaged 93, 4, 2, and 1 percent of average annual nitrogen additions, respectively. Outputs of nitrogen from the site were nitrogen in harvested crops, loads of nitrogen in surface runoff, volatilization of nitrogen, and loads of nitrogen in ground-water discharge, which averaged 37, less than 1, 25, and 38 percent of average annual nitrogen removals from the site, respectively. Virtually all of the nitrogen leaving the site that was not removed in harvested crops or by volatilization was discharged in the ground water. Applications of manure and fertilizer nitrogen to 47.5 acres of cropped fields decreased about 33 percent, from an average of 22,700 pounds per year (480 pounds per acre per year) before nutrient management to 15,175 pounds of nitrogen per year (320 pounds per acre per year) after the implementation of nutrient management practices. Nitrogen loads in ground-water discharged from the site decreased about 30 percent, from an average of 292 pounds of nitrogen per million gallons of ground water before nutrient management to an average of 203 pounds of nitrogen per million gallons as a result of the decreased manure and commercial fertilizer applications. Reductions in manure and commercial fertilizer applications caused a reduction of approximately 11,000 pounds (3,760 pounds per year; 70 pounds per acre per year) in the load of nitrogen discharged in ground water from the 55-acre site during the three-year period 1987-1990.

The research results of two model drinking water supply reservoirs (different area and depth) m the Morava river basin showed that the main nutrient sources in the period 1960-1991 were: agricultural land use (overland and subsurface transport of nutrients, effects of drainage and erosion), point sources (urban activities, agricultural farms) and atmospheric depositions of N and P compounds. The accelerated eutrophication was manifested by the increasing development of N phytoplankton. The main problems entail occurrence of toxic species of Cyanophyta/Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Microcystis aeruginosa and some other species (e.g. Pseudanabaena limnetica). In the small and shallow drinking water reservoir of Ludkovice the living algae penetrated drinking water. In the deep reservoir of Vir the situation was more favourable. The increase of nutrient input (NP) during the period 1969-1992 was highly significant Various measures have been proposed to slow the reservoir eutrophication (sustainable use of land, best management practices - soil retention, buffer strips, constructed wetlands etc.).

The aim of this study is to find the depth of biologically active substrate in an infiltration basin by determining the depth of the media colonised by the biomass and by studying oxygen renewal mechanisms. The study using sand columns has allowed simultaneous comparison, on the same profile, of biomass content (ATP), gaseous composition (chromatography) and the variations of the effluent quality (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus). Down to a depth of 30 cm, removal rates achieved in terms of conventional treatment parameters are very high (COD and SS > 90%, NH4+ almost-equal-to 95%, total phosphorus almost-equal-to 50%). Beyond a depth of 15 cm, the biomass content (expressed in ATP) is ten times less than at the surface, and virtually ceases to develop. Monitoring of O2 levels points to the need for drying periods in order to ensure natural ventilation of the basins. The primary settling stage must be effective in order to avoid any risk of clogging which would prevent the air from being renewed by diffusion. The length of the drying period must be almost double that of the flooding period to allow the media to recover as much of its treatment capacity as possible. This study pinpointed the depth of the biologically active substrate at arround 30 cm. The data obtained from this trial project point to the following design criteria: 1.5 m2/p.e. spread over three basins, and a drying period twice as long as the flooding period. The sand depth will depend on the plants overall water quality objectives: around 0.50 m for the removal of carbonaceous pollution and nitrification of Kjeldahl nitrogen, a greater depth for disinfection	AGENCE EAU SEINE NORMANDIE,CREATE,F-92700 COLOMBES,FRANCE; CEMAGREF,F-69336 LYON 09,FRANCE	GUILLOTEAU, JA (corresponding author), SAUR,CENT LAB,2 RUE BRESLE,F-78312 MAUREPAS,FRANCE.

Although point sources are discharged after secondary treatment, there has been a steady deterioration of lake water quality. Removal of point sources alone may produce no measurable improvement in the lake condition because of nonpoint sources. So the objectives of this paper are to quantify the nonpoint sources and to assess the impact to the lake. Nutrient inputs from point sources are unlikely to have been altered significantly, but nonpoint nutrient inputs have great monthly variation. Contribution of nonpoint sources to the external input of total phosphorus is almost 67% in the wet season and 19% in the dry season. Assuming that a substantial nonpoint source reduction is made by the Hoedong Lake basin, we attempt to estimate the effect of the lake water quality by mass balance equation. The nonpoint source impact to Hoedong Lake water quality is more than 60% in the wet season.

A highly concentrated stream holds more than 90% of the total COD-load, the lowly concentrated stream about 80% of the flow. Anaerobic pretreatment of the highly polluted stream and additional aerobic treatment of all wastewater reduces the total costs to less than one third in comparison to the aerobic treatment alone. The anaerobic treatment is linked with several problems like high sulphate, high ammonia and high calcium concentration leading to H2S and NH3 toxicity as well as calcium carbonate precipitation, about 3 times more than biomass growth. A special anaerobic reactor (EKJ-reactor) was designed to realize an equal distribution of the wastewater in the sludge bed and to prevent sludge and lime deposition. In 1986 the first stage of the full scale treatment plant for the high concentrated wastewater consisting of an equilization tank, an anaerobic reactor (10 000 m3) and a highly loaded activated sludge plant (2 000 m3) went into operation. In 1987 a second anaerobic reactor was built. In 1988 an additional activated sludge plant with simultaneous nitrification-denitrification (aeration tank volume 15 000 m3) for treatment of all the wastewater was designed in order to keep the effluent concentrations within the strict effluent limits. This plant went in operation in 1990. The anaerobic reactors have shown very good results throughout all the five years of operation. At a COD loading rate of 3 to 7kg/(m3.d) a COD removal of almost 90% could be achieved. Because of the high COD removal rate of the anaerobic stage, nitrification occurred in the first post-treatment plant but only to nitrite due to high ammonia concentration and high pH. In the second activated sludge plant stable nitrification was obtained. The content of NH4-N as well as NO2-N in the effluent is generally less than 2 mg/l. Some highly concentrated wastewater is fed directly into the second stage in order to obtain rather complete denitrification. So the NO3-N-concentration in the effluent can be kept below 20 mg/l (85% nitrogen removal) mostly.

Preliminary water quality data (runoff) from a comparative study of 20 microwatersheds using 4 different levels of maintenance, show reductions in these types of pollutants in runoff for microwatersheds planted to resource efficient plants. Utilization of plants indigenous to an ecoregion (and other resource efficient plants) in landscape design and management allows considerable reduction in inputs from fertilizer, water, and pesticides. This results in lower pollutant concentrations in runoff and is estimated to result in lower total pollutant loadings from such systems. Installation of native or resource efficient plants in new developments (commercial and residential) and replacement of existing landscapes with these plants as older plants die or neighborhoods are updated could provide cities and suburban areas with a cost-effective, low-maintenance, and aesthetically-pleasing pollution control technology. Data from the comparative study should provide municipalities charged with meeting the new requirements of the National Pollutant Elimination Discharge System with a way to compare the pollution prevention effectiveness of resource-efficient landscapes with more traditional structural urban runoff controls.

The focus was on removal of nitrogen by intermittent aeratyion. Following the experimental results, treated water quality lower than 10 mg/l of BOD and T-N was ensured throughout the year, under the operational conditions of hydraulic retention time in aeration tank longer than 24 h and MLSS higher than 2,500 mg/l. Treated water quality of T-N was less than 5 mg/l within cumulative frequency of 66%. Removal capacity of T-N did not reach its limit under condition less than 0.05 kgN/m3.d-1 of influent load. Estimating from the nitrogen removal rate, consumption of alkalinity, characteristics of biomass growth and the amount of nitrogen content in MLSS, 77% of influent nitrogen was denitrified, 18% of that was discharged as treated water and 5% of that was extracted as excess sludge or SS in treated water. Fluctuation patterns of DO and ORP in a cycle by seasonally changed water temperature were effective indices for regulation of operation. A remote monitoring system was helpful to support the management, because it enabled maintenance staff to judge urgency of management from the latest real time data.

Changes were made in handling of animal wastes and cropping practices to reduce runoff of sediment and nutrients. Modelling results predicted a reduction in phosphorus runoff of 30 percent. The water quality of White Clay Lake has worsened since the installation of NPS controls. The lake's phosphorus concentration has increased from a mean of 29 mug L-1 in the late 1970s to 44 mug L-1 in recent years. Water clarity has declined from 2.7 to 2.1 m and the mean summer chlorophyll levels have increased from 9 to 13 mug L-1 with peak values exceeding 40 mug L-1. Increased phosphorus loading is not the result of elevated precipitation but instead the failure of the control measures to sufficiently reduce P loading. Most of the effort was placed on structural changes while most of the P loading comes from cropland runoff. Further, soil phosphorus concentrations have increased because of artificial fertilizers and manure spreading.

Water quality of most Finnish watercourses is good or excellent, but in the intensively cultivated region of southern and western Finland the turbidity of water as well as algal blooms are a common problem. Generally, phosphorus is the limiting nutrient for primary production in Finnish lakes, but in eutrophic lakes and coastal waters the role of nitrogen becomes more important. Nitrogen from agriculture enters the watercourses mainly in dissolved form. By contrast, most phosphorus is transported in association with small particles. According to bioassays the algal availability of this particulate P is very low. Therefore, the eutrophying effect of agriculture can be estimated on the basis of dissolved nutrients. In shallow lakes, typical in agricultural regions, the release of dissolved P from the bottom sediment often induces the development of N2-fixing blue- green algal blooms. In some cases the internal load may exceed the external load. For the recovery of such a lake the introduction of better agricultural practices in the drainage basin has to be coupled with in-lake measures.

Above a suspended sediment concentration of about 500 mg/l, associated concentrations of total phosphorus are highest in overland flow and then progressively decrease from agricultural drains to ephemeral washes to undammed rivers. Within a stream type, sediment-related concentrations of total phosphorus typically differed between larger and smaller basins. Small rivers had higher phosphorus transport per unit of sediment load than larger rivers. Small and medium sized washes had different relationships between phosphorus and sediment than did large and very large washes.

The approach utilizes the Universal Soil Loss Equation together with empirical loading functions to derive representative phosphorus export coefficients for the local drainage system. Cumulative loadings from individual sub-basins within the watershed serve as input to a simple water quality model of Owasco Lake, showing the expected lake response in terms of average total phosphorus concentrations, trophic state, water transparancy, and minimum hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentration. The methodology facilitates easy and rapid assessment of general watershed management and development scenarios of interest. A unique aspect of the approach is its dependence upon descriptive data supplied by a Geographic Information System (GIS) to establish the coincidence of specific land use, soil texture and surface slope attributes within each of the hydrologic sub-basins comprising the overall watershed. The GIS-generated attribute matrices provide a much more accurate depiction of critical geographic characteristics known to impact nonpoint source runoff loadings, thereby improving the reliability of current and projected phosphorus loads to Owasco Lake.

The hydrologic model is an energy-driven, distributed parameter model that couples surface and ground waters. The vertical discretization consists of overland flow, perched saturated layer, root zone, percolation zone, and groundwater. The chemical model is based on the mass balances of nitrate, ammonium ion, organic nitrogen, humus material, organic phosphorus, phosphate, litter and biomass in the unsaturated zone and the groundwater. Geochemical processes affecting the nitrogen species mass balance that are included are nitrification, denitrification, plant uptake, mineralization, litter partition, humidification, decomposition and biomass growth (uptake) and respiration. The NTT model was used to simulate the fate, transport and speciation of nitrogen through a corn riparian zone using data collected during the summer months of 1992. The NTT model was shown to be capable of simulating the hydrologic and biogeochemical processes occurring in riparian zones. The root mean square error between the simulated and observed nitrate concentration is 1 mg/l. The model can be used in the design of riparian buffers for nonpoint source pollution control.

When DSM is accomplished in an object oriented programming framework, modelling is highly interactive. The Field Phosphorus Model (FPM) was created with STELLA(R) II, an object oriented DSM programming environment. FPM is based on sophisticated accounting of all annual inputs and outputs of phosphorus for a farm field and simulates, on a yearly basis, patterns of phosphorus export from farm fields used for manure management on dairy farms. Model inputs include atmospheric deposition, manure application and chemical fertilizer; outputs include surface runoff, crop harvest, and movement into deeper soil layers. Using two BMP scenarios, the implications for long-term phosphorus export levels from the field to surface and ground waters are discussed. Changes in the land treatment or BMP levels on the field results in a lag time between when the BMP is implemented and when the full impact on phosphorus export is seen. The Field Phosphorus Model suggests that the simultaneous reduction of long-term phosphorus output to surface and ground waters is accomplished by implementation of BMPs that limit the input of phosphorus to the field.

These guidelines are aimed at the reduction of pollutant loads by means of stormwater sedimentation tanks and the increase of storage capacity. To obtain better knowledge of the water quality aspects of the guidelines, the effects of combined sewer overflows from systems with stormwater sedimentation tanks of varying storage capacity were studied. Three receiving water bodies, with different dimensions and base flow, were reviewed. For the evaluation of effects on the oxygen balance a combined simulation model was used to predict the pollutant load and the dissolved oxygen response of individual overflow events. Eutrophication effects and accumulation of micropollutants were judged from the annual discharge data. It appeared that in small, stagnant ditches, the guidelines will induce a sharp reduction of the number of violations of the dissolved oxygen standard. In larger, flowing waters, the guidelines may adequately protect the water against violation of these standards. The discharge of total phosphorus and micropollutants is largely reduced by the prescribed measures. However, other sources of phosphorus must be eliminated as well to combat eutrophication effectively.		VANSLUIS, JW (corresponding author), DHV WATER BV,POB 484,3800 AL AMERSFOORT,NETHERLANDS.

It may preserve mobile P from being released to the water column and maintain P at the ancient sediment-water interface. A conceptual model is proposed to explain the trapping of P in sediments. For sediments having a large inventory of mobilizable P, immobilization in sediments by turbidites or even thin detrital layers may positively influence the water quality of the hypolimnion. Examples of this phenomenon are presented for four sites in two Swiss lakes.

J	DUDGEON, D				DUDGEON, D			ENDANGERED ECOSYSTEMS - A REVIEW OF THE CONSERVATION STATUS OF TROPICAL ASIAN RIVERS	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Review						ASIA; TROPICAL; RIVER; STREAM; FLOODPLAIN; ENDANGERED SPECIES; CONSERVATION; ECOSYSTEM; POLLUTION; HABITAT DEGRADATION; RIVER REGULATION	APPLIED LAND CLASSIFICATION; WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT; NORTHERN-TERRITORY; NEW-GUINEA; INDIA; POLLUTION; IMPACT; ALGAE; CHINA; AUSTRALIA	Tropical Asian rivers are characterized by their flow seasonality. One (sometimes two) peaks in discharge cause temporary declines in phytoplankton, zooplankton and zoobenthos biomass, but lead to inundation of river floodplains and significant land-water interactions. Fishes undertake lateral or longitudinal breeding migrations within the river system during the flood season, which is marked also by intensive feeding upon allochthonous inputs. Among the diverse human influences upon tropical Asian rivers, three threats stand out. Firstly, degradation of drainage basins (particularly through deforestation and overgrazing) leads to increased suspended sediment loads and extensive flooding. Excessive floodplain siltation alters habitats causing species decline or disappearance. The second threat - river regulation and control - has been practised widely in the region for centuries but, with the planned development of massive projects on the Yangtze and Mekong Rivers, the potential for environmental damage has increased. Flow regulation reduces flood-season peaks, changing the magnitude and extent of floodplain inundation and land-water interactions. Fish breeding migrations may be disrupted, because dams block migration routes or changed flow regimes fail to stimulate reproduction. River pollution is pervasive throughout the region, and constitutes the third threat. Untreated sewage is a particular problem in densely-populated areas, and pollution by industrial effluents and mining wastes is becoming more important. The effects of pollution in tropical Asian rivers are essentially the same as those recorded in north-temperate regions. However, biological understanding has yet to be matched by an ability to halt or limit river degradation. Together, the three threats have led to declines and range constrictions of aquatic animals and those terrestrial species associated with riparian corridors and floodplains. River dolphins and certain crocodilians are particularly threatened, but declines in species of waterfowl, floodplain deer, a host of fishes, macrophytes, and invertebrates have been documented. Reversing the trend is difficult as pollution, flow regulation, and drainage-basin degradation have non-additive detrimental effects on river ecosystems, and enhance the success of exotic invasive species. Moreover, our ability to predict the outcome of man-made changes is hampered by a lack of knowledge of species' life histories and a paucity of data on the trophic basis of production. Despite a lack of detailed information, conservation of tropical Asian rivers will be effected only if limnologists move beyond the bailiwick of science. Ecologically viable management strategies for tropical Asian rivers will succeed only if the socioeconomic context of development plans is taken into account. A failure to rise this challenge will result in the further degradation of these endangered ecosystems.

Water characteristics, including algal pigments, total suspended particles, as well as dissolved and particulate organic matter, were obtained at 31 sites. These water quality measurements were evaluated in terms of their importance in explaining water phenomena observed by using remote sensing reflectance images. Measurements that exhibited unique variances were related to remote sensing data using a statistical methodology to identify relations explaining the greatest amount of variance for each water variable. This approach resulted in predictor equations explaining 91 per cent of the chlorophyll-a variance, 91 per cent of the total suspended particles variance, and 98 per cent of a Trophic State Index variance based on the depth of light penetration. Further, remotely-sensed thermal data explained 88 per cent of the measured surface water temperature variance. These relations were used to produce maps depicting the quantitative distribution of these water quality variables and the bulk near-surface water temperature distribution within the active water cooling reservoir. The two-water cooling reservoirs not affected by thermal inflows were characterized by water containing very low and uniform concentrations of all water property measures. Conversely, the thermally active reservoir was characterized by higher and more variable water property concentrations; there was a spatial covariation between decreases in the bulk near-surface water temperature and increases in almost all water quality indicators.

The data set cover various trophic states of water bodies, all seasons and different climatic regimes. A shift of the peak position from about 680 nm up to 715 nm and an increase of the peak magnitude when chlorophyll concentration increased were observed. The magnitude and the peak position could be used as precise indicators and predictors for the phytoplankton concentration. It contributed significantly to the increase in the accuracy of the derivation of chlorophyll values from multispectral data.

Algorithms are presented that permit the ternary plots to be readily produced via any computer spreadsheet having orthogonal graphics capability. The Pielou method is modified to present time-series-diversity data as chronological tables or plots similar to those used for other water-quality variables and to accommodate n-dimensional relationships. The modified method is applied to phytoplankton data from two lakes, one impacted by acid mine drainage and one pristine.

J	EDWARDS, DR; DANIEL, TC				EDWARDS, DR; DANIEL, TC			POTENTIAL RUNOFF QUALITY EFFECTS OF POULTRY MANURE SLURRY APPLIED TO FESCUE PLOTS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						MANURE; POULTRY; RUNOFF; WATER QUALITY	NITROGEN; WATER	A 3 x 2 factorial experiment was conducted to determine how quality of runoff from grassed areas amended with poultry manure slurry is affected by slurry application rate and rainfall intensity for storms occurring one day following application. Poultry manure slurry was applied at rates of 0, 220, and 879 kg N ha-1 to plots established with fescue grass on a Captina silt loam soil. Simulated rainfall was applied 24 h following slurry application at intensities of 5 and 10 cm h-1 until runoff had occurred for a duration of 0.5 h. Flow-weighted composite runoff samples were collected and analyzed for total Kjeldahl N, ammonia N, nitrate N, total P, dissolved reactive P, chemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids, and electrical conductivity. Effects of the experimental variables on both runoff concentrations and mass losses of slurry constituents were assessed by analyses of variance. Increasing slurry application rate significantly increased runoff concentrations of all slurry constituents investigated except nitrate N. For the affected slurry constituents, the relationships between runoff concentration of the constituent and slurry application rate appeared to be linear over the range of application rates used. Mass losses of all slurry constituents except nitrate N significantly increased with increases in both slurry application rate and rainfall intensity. Relationships between mass losses and slurry application rate also appeared to be linear for the range of application rates used in the study.

The practical feasibility and mathematical sensitivity of the method were analysed for Lake Kuortaneenjarvi, Western Finland. A sampling programme to estimate characteristic rate parameters for competition between the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacter Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and eukaryotic phytoplankton was produced and the robustness of the design with respect to parameters and input was studied using the Monte Carlo technique. Optimal timing of observations appeared to be more sensitive to noise in the parameter values than to stochasticity in the model input, which consisted of data on the nutrient loading and climatic conditions of the lake. The perturbated parameter values favoured the weighting of phytoplankton dynamics, whereas the perturbations of the input shifted the design towards cyanobacterial dominance. It was concluded that this was because correct timing of algal succession was the most crucial element in successful estimation. Considerable rationalization of the use of measurement resources can be achieved by adopting the design procedure. This was also demonstrated for Lake Kuortaneenjarvi.

J	LI, Y; NARUSAWA, Y				LI, Y; NARUSAWA, Y			APPLICATION OF FIA TO WATER-QUALITY MEASUREMENT AND ONLINE MONITORING IN THERMAL POWER-PLANTS	BUNSEKI KAGAKU			Japanese	Review						ONLINE MONITORING IN POWER PLANTS; APPLICATION OF FIA AND RFIA; SILICON; PHOSPHORUS AND SULFUR DETERMINATION; COPPER AND IRON DETERMINATION; NEW EXCHANGE CAPACITY DETERMINATION METHOD OF ION-EXCHANGE RESINS	FLOW-INJECTION ANALYSIS	Flow-injection analysis (FIA) is characterized by its high analytic speed (120 approximately 240 samples/h), high precision (RSD<1.0%) and reduced consumption of reagents and samples. Nevertheless, there are some difficulties in quality control and the on-line monitoring of the thermal stream in power plants. This paper proposes a dozen FIA methods applicable to power plants, all of which have been developed during the past 8 years with the hand-made instrument, FIA-TI-721. These methods are as follows: simultaneous determination method Of PO43- and SiO32- in boiler water with on-line rFIA (0.2 approximately 30 ppm PO43-, 0.02 approximately 5.00 ppm SiO32-), FIA concentration determination of microamounts of silica in water-steam with ion-exchange resin (3.0 approximately 70 ppb SiO32-), catalytic FIA spectrophotometric determination of microamounts of Cu2+ in water-steam (0.4 approximately 100 ppb Cu2+), FIA spectrophotometric determination of microamounts of Fe2+ in water used in power plant (100 approximately 4000 ppb Fe2+), rFIA determination of SO42- in water used in power plants (3.0 approximately 20 ppm SO42-), and a new method of determining the exchange-capacity of ion-exchange resin based on FIA. This paper deals with the analytical speeds, reproducibilities, concentration ranges, chemifolds and optimum conditions of analyses (e.g. reagent concentrations, sampling volumes, temperatures, pump speeds and the lengths of reaction coils). The advantages and deficiencies in applying FIA to water quality measurements and on-line monitoring in power plants are also discussed.

J	RANTA, E; LINDSTROM, K; SALOJARVI, K				RANTA, E; LINDSTROM, K; SALOJARVI, K			WATER-QUALITY, FISHING EFFORT AND FISH YIELD IN LAKES	FISHERIES RESEARCH			English	Article								The relationship between fish yield, water quality and fishing effort was explored in 70 Finnish lakes. The total yield (kg ha-1 yr-1) was also split to species level (11 species). Fishing effort was estimated by the number of fishermen (fishermen km-2). The principal components of water quality variables were extracted. The first component comprised total nitrogen and phosphorus, water colour and oxygen saturation; the second was an association of pH, alkalinity and conductivity. Together they retained about 77% of the variation in the original data. The best single predictor for the total fish yield was the number of fishermen (R2 = 0.47), but also the second principal component entered as a variable in a stepwise regression model (R2 = 0.53). No regional differences were found, so the model is potentially valid for the whole country. However, the spread of the data around the model was considerable; close to 50% of the variation in yield remained unexplained. At the species level, fishing effort was needed as a variable in six models (in four of them as the first variable entering the model) and water quality in five models (four times as the first variable). The variation of yield explained by these models ranged from 21% to 49%. Generally, water quality was less important in determining the yield than fishing effort. This was confirmed by partitioning out the effect of effort variables from the correlation between yield and water quality. No obvious improvements in the coefficients were observed.

This allows rapid analysis of river, lake and groundwater samples from a range of environments for total nitrogen and phosphorus. The method was evaluated using a range of organic nitrogen and phosphorus structures tested at low, mid and high range concentrations from 2 to 50 mg l-1 nitrogen and 0.2 to 10 mg l-1 phosphorus. Mean recoveries for nitrogen ranged from 94.5% (2 mg l-1) to 92.7% (50 mg l-1) and for phosphorus were 98.2% (0.2 mg l-1) to 100.2% (10 mg l-1). The method is precise in its ability to reproduce results from replicate digestions, and robust in its ability to handle a variety of natural water samples in the pH range 5-8.

The limnocorrals were 5 m in diameter and from 5-6 m in depth and were open to the sediments. In 1983 four limnocorrals were deployed in an isolated bay of Toolik Lake within a cross-classified treatment regime of high and low inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus additions and high and low free swimming fish additions. The objective of the nutrient addition was to stimulate phytoplankton growth and determine the extent to which increased plant production was passed through pelagic and benthic food chains. The objective of the fish addition was to determine the impact of fish predation on large-bodied zooplankton, especially the zooplanktivorous copepod Heterocope, then to study the effect of altered Heterocope densities on small-bodied zooplankton species population dynamics. In 1984 two more limnocorrals were deployed, one a low fish, 1 x nutrient addition treatment and the other a no fish, no nutrient treatment. The fish manipulation was changed to confining several fish in cages with the cages held in corrals for varying lengths of time. The addition of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus dramatically increased phytoplankton productivity. This increase in algal biomass and production greatly altered the light environment and water quality in the nutrient treated limnocorrals. The secchi disk depth in the nutrient treated limnocorrals declined each summer reaching as low as 1 m in 1985. Both oxygen content and pH increased in the nutrient treatment corrals. Corrals not receiving nutrient additions remained near lake concentrations for most water quality parameters. While phytoplankton biomass was stimulated in 1983 phytoplankton growth was not sufficient to draw down all the nitrogen and phosphorus added and these nutrients reached high levels in the last half of the summer. In 1984 phosphorus remained above 20 mug in the nutrient-treated corrals but ammonia dropped to reference levels by day 25. In 1985 both nutrient concentrations rapidly declined to reference levels. Most pelagic components responded to the nutrient additions. Microbial production was stimulated in the nutrient treated limnocorrals and bacterial population sizes built up to nearly 8-10 times those of the reference corrals. However, microheterotrophs soon increased in abundance and apparently grazed down bacteria to reference levels. Phytoplankton population density, as estimated by chlorophyll a determinations, increased dramatically with nutrient addition such that each year the phytoplankton densities were higher than before. Primary productivity was also stimulated and appeared not to be light limited even when phytoplankton densities rose to high levels. In the first two years of the experiment zooplankton densities were little altered by the increased phytoplankton densities. However, by 1985 daphnid densities were quite a bit higher in the high nutrient addition limnocorrals. The benthic community and sediment response was much less affected by nutrient addition. Overall sediment respiration increased in the nutrient treated corrals but underlying sediments seemed little affected. Decomposition of Carex litter was likewise little affected by nutrient addition. Benthic invertebrates were also little impacted by the nutrient addition and increased sedimentation of phytoplankton. However, the response of benthic invertebrates is difficult to assess fully in the current experiment because chironomids, a prominent component of the benthic community, failed to recruit into the limnocorrals and the corrals physically shifted during ice-out in the spring of 1984 disturbing the sediment in several corrals. The fish additions in 1983 of free swimming grayling essentially eliminated large bodied zooplankton, especially Heterocope septentrionalis, from all four limnocorrals. In subsequent summers Heterocope were not so dramatically preyed upon but generally were found in higher densities in the low or no fish treatments. However, either when Heterocope were eliminated in 1983 or were in rough inverse proportion to fish density, altered Heterocope abundance had no obvious affect on small-bodied zooplankton abundance. The fish treatment apparently influenced the zooplankton response to high nutrient addition in 1985. In the high nutrient limnocorrals daphnid populations became very abundant, but in the high fish treatment the daphnid responding was the small-bodied D. longiremis while in the low fish treatment the daphnid responding was the large-bodied D. middendorffiana. Thus we have considerable evidence for bottom up control of phytoplankton density and production. This increased production ultimately, but not for two years, stimulated zooplankton density increases. Increased nutrients had little effect on the benthos or sediments. Fish manipulations influenced large-bodied zooplankton but had little effect on small-bodied zooplankton. Because grayling are predominantly plankton feeders in lakes, no fish effect on benthic invertebrates was expected. Limnocorrals thus seem good systems to study nutrient-phytoplankton interactions. They are not as suitable for benthic invertebrate studies and fish manipulations may be difficult. Most other limnocorral studies were of brief duration; however, in the present study the limnocorrals seemed to perform well over a three year period.

Water was recirculated through a biological filler by centrifugal pumping for 24 h in six ponds and for 12 h in the other six ponds. In each pond, food quality, phytoplankton populations, and geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) concentrations were evaluated weekly during the last 8 weeks of the growing season (mid September to early November). Food quality was determined from average taste panel scores for earthy-musty flavors. Objectionable off-flavor was detected by the trained panel in 13.5% of the 96 sample units (ponds X weeks). Levels of geosmin and MIB in the water ranged from 0.000 to 0.097 mug/l for geosmin (excepting one measurement of 0.649 mug/1), and 0.039 to 0.356 mug/l for MIB. Off-flavor scores and concentrations of geosmin and MIB in the water did not significantly differ between the two pond recirculation treatments. Objectionable off-flavor scores (> 1.0) were significantly correlated (P < 0.05) with the prior week's MIB values and degree of Oscillatoria domination. MIB levels and Oscillatoria dynamics leading to dominance conditions were indicative of off-flavor problems in subsequent weeks and may be used in a-predictive manner.

J	ULANOWICZ, RE; TUTTLE, JH				ULANOWICZ, RE; TUTTLE, JH			THE TROPHIC CONSEQUENCES OF OYSTER STOCK REHABILITATION IN CHESAPEAKE BAY	ESTUARIES			English	Article							DYNAMICS; FISH	There is mounting speculation that overharvesting of oyster stocks (Crassostrea virginica) in Chesapeake Bay may be a factor contributing to the decline in water quality and shifts in the dominance of species inhabiting the estuary. The trophic consequences of increasing the oyster population may be addressed using a simple quasi-equilibrium, mass action model of the exchanges transpiring in the Chesapeake mesohaline ecosystem. According to output from the model, increasing oyster abundance would decrease phytoplankton productivity as well as stocks of pelagic microbes, ctenophores, medusae, and particulate organic carbon. Recently acquired field data on phytoplankton productivity, bacterioplankton, and labile organic carbon in the vicinity of rafted oyster aquaculture support model predictions. The model also indicates that more oysters should increase benthic primary production, fish stocks, and mesozooplankton densities. Hence, augmenting the oyster community by restoring beds or introducing raft culture represents a potentially significant adjunct to the goal of mitigating eutrophication through curtailment of nutrient inputs.

The resulting phosphorus budget indicates that diversion of treated wastewater discharges achieves the greatest reduction in load. However, application of a simple water-quality (trophic state) model suggests additional remediation of contributions from other (tributary) sources is necessary to reach lake restoration objectives. Analysis of loadings from Onondaga Creek-the second largest phosphorus contributor to Onondaga Lake-indicates that, on a unit area basis, urban sources account for a disproportionately high fraction of the tributary load. Phosphorus contributions from rural sources exhibit a significant increase during extreme, short-term hydrologic events, possibly as a partial result of effusions of soft sediments (mud boils) triggered during periods of high flow. Findings reveal the importance of developing a comprehensive, basinwide phosphorus control strategy for Onondaga Lake-a strategy that considers remediation of rural and especially urban sources within critical reaches of Onondaga Creek. Leaky sewers and combined sewer overflows, together with possible mud-boil effects and runoff from urban and rural areas, should all be addressed within the context of the aforementioned strategy.

Two simplified pollutant export models were integrated with the Virginia Geographic Information System (VirGIS) to estimate soil erosion, sediment yield, and phosphorus (P) loading from the Nomini Creek watershed located in Westmoreland County, Virginia. On the basis of selected criteria for soil erosion rate, sediment yield, and P loading, model outputs were used to identify watershed areas which exhibit three categories (low, medium, high) of nonpoint source pollution potentials. The percentage of the watershed area in each category, and the land area with critical pollution problems were also identified. For the 1505-ha Nomini Creek watershed, about 15, 16, and 21 percent of the watershed area were delineated as sources of critical soil erosion, sediment, and phosphorus pollution problems, respectively. In general, the study demonstrated the usefulness of integrating GIS with simulation modeling for nonpoint source pollution control and planning. Such techniques can facilitate making priorities and targeting nonpoint source pollution control programs.

Risk is define here as the probability of failing to meet an established in-stream water quality standard. The QUAL-TX dissolved oxygen (DO) water quality model was modified to a Monte Carlo framework. Flow augmentation coding was also modified to allow an exact match to be computed between the predicted and an established DO concentration standard, thereby providing an avenue for linking input parameter uncertainty to the assignment of a wasteload permit (allowable mass loading rate). Monte Carlo simulation techniques were employed to propagate input parameter uncertainties, typically encountered during WLA analysis, to the computed effluent five-day carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand requirements for a single major wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The risk of failing to meet an established in-stream DO criterion may be as high as 96 percent. The uncertainty associated with estimation of the future total Kjeldahl nitrogen concentration for a single tributary was found to have the greatest impact on the determination of allowable WWTP loadings.

The survey included 567 samples analyzed for 46 elements. Three distinctive distribution patterns were found for seven U.S. Environmental Protection Agency priority pollutants surveyed, as well as for boron and phosphorus: (1) enrichment of elements in the Chicago urban area and in stresses draining the urban area relative to rural areas, (2) enrichment in main stems relative to tributaries, and (3) enrichment in low-order streams at high-population-density sites relative to low-population-density sites. Significant differences in background concentrations, as measured by samples from low-order streams, were observed among five subbasins in the study area. Uncertain geochemical correspondence between low-order, background sites and high-order, generally metal enriched sites prevented determination of background levels that would be appropriate for high-order sites. The within-sample ratio of enriched elements was variable within the Chicago area but was constant in the Illinois River downstream from Chicago. Element ratios imply a composite fine-fraction sediment in the Illinois River of 35-40 percent Des Plaines River origin and 60-65 percent Kankakee River origin.

WATER FERTILITY AND TOXICITY EVALUATED BY AN ALGAL GROWTH-POTENTIAL TEST	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE			English	Article							PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; NITRATE LIMITATION; LAKES; EUTROPHICATION; PHOSPHORUS; BIOASSAYS; DEPENDENCE; SUCCESSION	An investigation was undertaken to evaluate water fertility and toxicity of the River Nile in Egypt. Sixteen different sampling stations were selected for the purpose, three located upstream and thirteen downstream of Cairo. Water samples were seasonally collected during the period from autumn (1987) to summer (1988). Nutrient enrichment biotests to define algal growth limiting nutrients, their bioavailability and the heavy metal toxicity of the sampled water, were achieved using Selenastrum capricornutum Strain NIVA-CHL 1. Total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), total soluble inorganic nitrogen (TSIN = nitrate-N + nitrite-N + ammonium-N), total Kjeldahl-N (TKN = ammonia-N + organic-N), some trace metals (Cd, Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn) and phytoplankton chlorophyll a (observed Chl. a) were also analysed. The expected Chl, a was calculated by an empirical equation. It represents the maximum chlorophyll a biomass that the sampled water could support under optimum growth conditions. Nutrients, heavy metals, and observed Chl. a showed great regional and seasonal variations. The algal growth potential test (AGPT) exhibited results ranging from 0.02 mg l-1 to 84.8 mg l-1 algal dry weight. The algal growth was mainly limited by P, heavy metal toxicity and, in few cases, by N. Simultaneous addition of P, N, and EDTA supported the highest biomass production of the test alga. The bioavailability of both P and N was greatly affected by heavy metal toxicity. For most cases, the inhibition of algal growth due to metal toxicity was highly significant (p < 0.001). The observed Chl. a was significantly higher than the expected Chl. a, when P was the limiting nutrient and the reverse was true in case of N limitation. The expected Chl. a maintained a number of strong (r > 0.8 at p < 0.01) linear relationships with bioavailable phosphorus and nitrogen. However the magnitude of the predictive linear models was mainly dependent on the N:P mass ratio of the water samples. Also the N:P ratio displayed a great effect on nutrient limitations, as values below 10 involved N limitation, between 10 and 20 neither N or P can be supposed with certainty to be limiting (possible P and N co-limitation) and above 20, P was the most growth limiting nutrient. No consistent linear relationship was found between the observed and the expected Chl. a value. The algal growth potential test proved to be reliable method for assessing the fertility and toxicity of the River Nile waters.

Airborne imaging spectrometry was acquired. Simultaneous (sub)surface spectroradiometric and laboratory-based spectrophotometric measurements allowed the description of the underwater lightfield through determination of the inherent and apparent optical properties. Spectral signature simulation of various systems increased understanding of the performances and led to the development of the CAESAR Inland Water Mode spectral bandset. These results apply to the operational use of high resolution airborne systems (CASI) and are relevant for future satellite systems such as MERIS, MODIS, and HIRIS, especially in the area of data reduction through selection of spectral bands and the development of algorithms.

The phosphorus uptake length was found to decrease with decreasing initial phosphorus concentration added; the uptake length was 98 m when an initial P concentration of 51.0-mu-g l-1 was used, 90 m with 21.7-mu-g l-1 and 63 m with 12.7-mu-g l-1. The estimated errors in the uptake lengths were 6-8%. Approximately 32% of the added phosphorus was retained in the 32 m study reach, with almost all (ca. 93%) of this retained phosphorus taken up by the sediments (microbial uptake plus physico-chemical adsorption) and only a small amount retained in transient storage zones.

J	KNUDHANSEN, CF				KNUDHANSEN, CF			POND HISTORY AS A SOURCE OF ERROR IN FISH CULTURE EXPERIMENTS - A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT USING COVARIATE ANALYSIS	AQUACULTURE			English	Article							ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS; WATER INTERFACE; LAKE-SEDIMENTS; PHOSPHORUS; PHOSPHATE; RELEASE; ADSORPTION; FISHPONDS; EXCHANGE; FIXATION	Nine successive 5-month experiments. which examined relationships between fertilization strategies (with chicken manure, triple superphosphate and urea ), water quality and yields of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), took place from February 1985 through March 1990 in 16 earthen ponds at the Ayutthaya Freshwater Fisheries Center, Bang Sai, Thailand. Over the course of these experiments. randomization of treatments resulted in all ponds having different fertilization histories. Analysis of covariance was used to quantify the carry-over effects of nutrient inputs from earlier experiments on experimental errors in Experiment 9. Analyses of variance indicated that the residual (experimental error) accounted for approximately 39% of the total variation of net fish yield (NFY) observed in Experiment 9. Covariate analysis revealed that residuals were most significantly correlated to accumulated chicken manure input from Experiments 5 through 8. Previous pond fertilizations accounted for approximately 49% of total experimental variation in NFY observed in Experiment 9. Multiple linear regression analysis, using treatment inputs and the pond history covariate as the two independent variables to explain NFY, gave an r2=0.75 (P < 0.001 ). Pond sediment chemistry data proved to be ineffective as covariates for reducing experimental error and/or predicting NFY. Reasons for the positive effect of earlier experiments on NFY most likely involved the inverse relationship between the ability of pond sediments to remove soluble phosphorus from overlying water, and the accumulation of organic matter and phosphorus on pond bottoms. Pond management considerations and recommendations for fish culture experiments are given to better account for between-pond variability due to different fertilization histories.

This study uses a 15-year mathematical programming model to evaluate the effectiveness of low-input agriculture, under alternative policy scenarios, as a strategy to protect ground water quality in Richmond County, Virginia. The analysis considers eight policy alternatives: cost-sharing for green manures, two restrictions on atrazine applications levels, chemical taxation, a restriction on potential chemical and nitrogen levels in ground water only and in surface and ground water, and two types of land retirement programs. The CREAMS and GLEAMS models were used to estimate nitrate and chemical leaching from the crop root zone. The economic model evaluates production practices, policy constraints, and water quality given a long-term profit maximizing objective. The results indicate that low-input agriculture alone may not be an effective ground water protection strategy. The policy impacts include partial adoption of low-input practices, land retirement, and the substitution of chemicals. Only mandatory land retirement policies reduced all chemical and nutrient loadings of ground water; however, they did not promote the use of low-input agricultural practices.

The effect of soil physicochemical conditions, phosphorus loading rate, and diffusive exchange between soils and the overlying flood water column on phosphorus release and retention were studied. The predominantly mineral swamp forest soil displayed greater phosphorus sorption potential than the organic freshwater marsh soil. Moreover, clue to its low bulk density (0.11 g cm-3), the freshwater marsh soil surface area required for phosphorus retention is very large compared to the bottomland hardwood wetland soil. For both wetlands, soil redox status affected P release and assimilatory capacity. The more reducing the soils, the smaller their phosphorus retention capacity (greater their release). Phosphorus removal from the overlying water column into the wetland soils followed a first-order kinetic model. Under similar hydrological conditions, phosphorus was found to diffuse 1.2 times faster to the bottomland hardwood soil than in the freshwater marsh soil. Results indicate that while the bottomland hardwood wetland soil will serve as a sink for phosphorus entering such wetland, phosphorus will be released and exported from the freshwater marsh soil into adjacent ecosystems.

Concurrent in situ data consisted of phytoplankton pigment concentrations and standing crop, water color, turbidity, and surface-water temperature. Surface and near-surface assemblages of cyanophytes and chlorophytes varied dramatically among impoundments; total chlorophyll concentrations and standing crop values ranged from 8 to 483 Mg.m-3 and 8.0 X 10(2) to 2.2 x 10(6) cells.mL-1, respectively. Regression models fit to CAMS data provided reliable estimates for and produced accurate digital cartographs of total chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations, phytoplankton standing crop, and turbidity. Although a model to effectively estimate in situ c-phycocyanin concentrations was not identified, the lack Of a suitable model may have resulted from variability of pigment extraction during quantification rather than failure Of remotely sensed imagery to detect c-phycocyanin. Models derived from imagery of impoundments directly beneath the aircraft sufficiently described in situ parameters in imagery of adjacent series of impoundments not directly below the aircraft. High-resolution airborne remote sensing provides a means for monitoring local phytoplankton dynamics in temporal and spatial scales analogous to biotic and abiotic processes affecting such dynamics and necessary for applications to ecological research and fisheries or aquacultural management.

The description of the water systems includes an evaluation of the structure and interactions of water systems in and around the lakes since the beginning of the Holocene until recent times, focussing progressively from the regional to the local systems and from the lake complex to the individual lakes. Quantitative research concerned: monthly and annual water balances for the complex of lakes and for individual lakes; numerical two- and semi-three-dimensional groundwater flow models; field experiments on turbulence and diffusion; and experimental laboratory studies on wind-driven currents. Qualitative research concerned: behaviour of environmental isotopes in groundwater; heavy metals in lake bottom sediments; phosphorus balances of the complex of lakes and of individual lakes for the existing and the simulated conditions; and remote sensing studies for the water quality pattern recognition. The interaction between the various water systems in the area has been influenced strongly in historic and recent times by human interference on both the local and regional scales of the water resources, e.g. through the reclamation of lakes, the extraction of water for public water supply, the regional transfer of water, the agricultural and urban activities etc. Two major remedial measures have been taken thus far: construction of sewer systems, and the supply with dephosphorized water from the Amsterdam-Rhine canal. These measures resulted in a decrease of the external P-load but did not result in a significant decrease in eutrophication as yet. Scenario's to improve this situation either pertain to tackling the fundamental causes of the eutrophication or to redressing their effects. The first category includes: drastic reductions in groundwater abstraction for public supply in the Gooi catchment area of the lakes and (partial?) flooding of adjacent deep polder areas to reduce the leakage losses from the lakes (both measures aim at restoration of the water balance). The second category involves less drastic water management alternatives for lake restoration: dredging P-enriched bottom sediments; reinforced flushing during summer with dephosphorized Amsterdam-Rhine Canal water; interception and rerouting of polluted inflows from the watershed; or additional P-removal from yet untreated inflows.

The effect of phosphorus release from the sediment on lake restoration was investigated. Diffusive release under aerobic conditions (20-degrees-C) decreased from 1 mg m-2 d-1 in 1984 to 0.3 mg m-2 d-1 in 1990. The generation of inorganic phosphorus due to mineralization during summer equals 3 mg m-2 d-1, which is much higher than the measured rate of diffusive release. Despite that, the phosphorus release is hardly stimulated by anaerobic conditions, which indicates that only a small amount of phosphorus is adsorbed by ferric iron in the top sediment layer. This apparent discrepancy is probably caused by the uptake of inorganic phosphorus uptake during resuspension and the loss of inorganic phosphorus with downward seepage. The estimated removal of phosphorus due to downward seepage of 0.8 mg m-2 d-1 agrees well with the average phosphorus retention in the lake. This indicates that sediment burial and diagenesis are unimportant mechanisms for withdrawing phosphorus from the nutrient cycle. Between 1982 and 1991 the total phosphorus content of the upper 2 cm of the sediment decreased from 0.94 to 0.60 g kg-1 DW. At present, about 20% of total phosphorus in this layer is potentially bioavailable, but largely incorporated in easily degradable organic matter. This pool is much smaller in deeper layers. Based on the estimated and measured rates and pool sizes, the annual average phosphorus cycle in the lakes was modelled to evaluate the effects of various restoration measures. The main predictions of the model are: 1) further reduction of the external load may cause a gradual decrease of the total phosphorus concentration in the lake water; 2) dredging and iron addition, without reduction of the external load, may give a rapid improvement followed by a slow return to the present situation; and 3) reduction of the external load, combined with a cut off of downward seepage will not improve the water quality.

A steady-state model for the coupling of the phytoplankton and detritus is discussed in relation to field and experimental data on phytoplankton growth and decomposition. According to model predictions, the phytoplankton to detritus ratio decreases hyperbolically at increasing phytoplankton growth rate and is independent of a lake's trophic state. The seston in L. Loosdrecht contains more detritus than phytoplankton as will apply to many other lakes. The model provides a basis for estimating the loss rate of the detritus, including decomposition, sedimentation and hydraulic loss. In a shallow lake like L. Loosdrecht detritus will continue to influence the water quality for years.

This reduction measure turned out to have decreased the loading only by a factor of two. A conceptual model was constructed based on laboratory measurements to describe phosphorus flow in the lake ecosystem for the summer of 1987. The role of zooplankton and fish was more important in phosphorus recycling than diffusion at the sediment-water interface. The input and output of phosphorus of the lake were at equilibrium and therefore, further reduction in external loading was needed for recovery. The results of the conceptual model agreed well with the output of the mathematical model PCLOOS. Additional measures such as dredging, flushing, chemomanipulation, or biomanipulation would be ineffective at the present level of external loading.

Therefore the Provincial Water Authorities of the Province of Utrecht proposed, after consulting the research group Water Quality Research Loosdrecht lakes (WQL), measures to reduce the present external phosphorus loading from 0.35 to 0.1 g Pm-2 y-1. Mathematical modelling suggested that such a reduction would benefit the water quality of the lakes. The results of the WQL investigation did not lead to additional measures (dredging, biomanipulation, chemomanipulation).

Development of lake restoration programmes must take into account the lake functions. Major reduction of the nutrient and pollutant loading is the primary step in lake restoration. Still, the recovery of eutrophic lakes is retarded frequently because of internal phosphorus loading by the lakes' sediments. Sediment dredging, as an additional tool for water quality management to accelerate accomplishing the desired water quality, is studied. In this paper we evaluate the preliminary results of eight lake restoration projects in the Netherlands. The lakes are compared in order to estimate the magnitude of the internal phosphorus loading. Dredging as an additional measure was carried out twice in the peatlake Geerplas. In the Nieuwkoop Lakes only the external phosphorus loading was substantially reduced from 0.9 to 0.2 g P m-2 y-1. Provisional results of these two shallow peatlake restoration projects focussed on eutrophication abatement with and without dredging, are presented. Both show a decrease in phosphorus concentration in the lakes. The necessity to dredge the lakes is discussed.

Stocking density on the farm was estimated to be 0.13 kg/m3. It was found that the system of ponds, aquatic plant tanks and gravel filters was adequate for treating the effluent from the fish tanks and ponds to a satisfactory quality for reuse, both in terms of physical-chemical and microbiological parameters. Total ammonia-nitrogen in the recycled water was 0.31 mg/l, nitrite-nitrogen was 0.045 mg/l and dissolved oxygen was 6.15 mg/l. Coliform bacteria were introduced into the system with Moina, cultivated on pigwaste-fertilised ponds, fed to the fish. Coliform levels were, however, reduced from about 11 000 MPN/100 ml to 600 MPN/100 ml in the ponds.

The data derived from: (a) inshore and offshore waters of Saronicos Gulf and (b) from nearshore and offshore waters of the island of Rhodes, Aegean Sea. The procedure followed was the application of the frequency distribution analysis to transformed data and development of nutrient concentration scales on the basis of probabilistic parameters. This procedure might be used to make predictions related to forecasting and evaluation of water quality standards.

The CREAMS denitrification component and the linked DRAINMOD-CREAMS model were modified to simulate daily hydrology (runoff, infiltration, evaporation, and soil moisture content), erosion, and nutrient processes for different WTM conditions. Measured data from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were used to validate the linked model, and then controlled drainage-subirrigation (CD-SI) was simulated to investigate the effects of different WTM systems on runoff, erosion, and nitrogen losses. Results of the study indicated that the linked models performed better than the original CREAMS model in predicting runoff, infiltration, soil moisture content, and erosion, and that the modified linked model performed better than both CREAMS and the original linked model in predicting nitrogen losses from the study site. Results also showed that the CD-SI system simulated by the modified DRAINMOD-CREAMS model predicted increased denitrification and lowered nitrate leaching, unlike the original version.

Concerns over the potential environmental impacts of poultry waste disposal have resulted in ongoing efforts to develop management practices which maintain high quality of water downstream of disposal areas. The timing of application to minimize waste constituent losses is a management practice with the potential to ensure high quality of streams, rivers, and lakes downstream of receiving areas. This paper describes the development and application of a method to identify which time of year is best, from the standpoint of surface water quality, for land application of poultry waste. The procedure consists of using a mathematical simulation model to estimate average nitrogen and phosphorus losses resulting from different application timings, and then identifying the timings which minimize losses of these nutrients. The procedure was applied to three locations in Arkansas, and three different criteria for optimality of application timing were investigated. One criterion was oriented strictly to water quality, one was oriented only to crop production, and the last was a combination. The criteria resulted in different windows of time being identified as optimal. Optimal windows also varied with location of the receiving area. The results indicate that it is possible to land-apply poultry waste at times which both minimize nutrient losses and maximize crop yield.

Chemical fertilizer application under the no-till system resulted in the least amount of total N and P in surface runoff. However, sludge application under the no-till system resulted in the least amount of NO3-N and sediment in surface runoff. The worst water quality scenarios were observed when either sludge or chemical fertilizer were surface-applied under a conventional tillage system. Nitrogen losses from the conventional tillage system were minimized when sludge was incorporated into the soil. However, phosphorus and sediment yield from such a system were significantly higher when compared to phosphorus and sediment yield from the no-till system. The results from this study indicate that the use of sludge on agricultural land under a no-till system can be a viable alternative to chemical fertilizer for nitrogen and phosphorus control in runoff. A more cautious approach is recommended when the sludge is incorporated into the soil in a conventional tillage system because of potential for high sediment and phosphorus yield in surface runoff.

The Simple Method model, the Marcus and Kearney regression model, and the CREAMS model were used to estimate annual loads under: (1) present conditions, (2) maximum land use development allowable under the Act, and (3) two sets of future land use conditions that might occur if the Act were not in place. Results indicate that the Critical Area Act can reduce the present generation of nonpoint nutrient and sediment loadings 20-30 percent from the regulated area. These reductions can occur while preserving agricultural lands and allowing limited residential and urban development. The decrease in nutrient loadings is primarily dependent upon implementation and enforcement of agricultural best management practices (BMPs). The BMPs could reduce present agricultural nutrient loadings by 90 percent to a level comparable to loadings from residential areas. The estimated effectiveness of the Critical Area Act is even greater when compared to potential future nutrient loadings if development in the area remains unregulated. Unrestricted residential and urban development could increase nutrient loadings by 200 percent to 1000 percent as compared to controlled development under Critical Area Act guidelines.The Critical Area Act primarily prevents these future increases by severely limiting woodland cutting, with lesser results obtained by requiring urban BMPs.

J	SMITH, CM				SMITH, CM			RIPARIAN AFFORESTATION EFFECTS ON WATER YIELDS AND WATER-QUALITY IN PASTURE CATCHMENTS	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							CATCHMENT; NITROGEN; FORESTS	The flow records for two pasture headwater catchments for 9 yr before, and 9 yr after riparian afforestation in one catchment were compared. Average rainfall was 1021 mm yr-1. Riparian afforestation reduced water yields by 68 to 104 mm (21-55%) when the Pinus radiata stand was 8 to 10 yr old. Delayed runoff declined by 52 to 93 mm yr-1 (27-63%). Afforestation reduced the quickflow yield in 1 vr (22 mm or 40%). Peak flows declined in small events, were not affected in medium-sized events, and may have increased in large events. The large reductions in yield indicate that the riparian zone had a disproportionately important influence on catchment hydrology. They are attributed to high transpiration losses from the riparian pine in seasons with water deficits, and higher than usual forest interception losses because of the small-scale planting. Streamwater sediment, total and dissolved N and P concentrations in these two catchments and another riparian afforested catchment were monitored for 2 yr. Concentrations were generally lower in the completely pastured catchment. Estimated annual sediment, total P, Kjeldahl N, and nitrate exports from the pasture catchment were 31 to 60%, 70%, 61 to 64% and 58 to 74% of those from the riparian afforested catchments in spite of a higher water yield. Possible explanations for the poor water quality in riparian afforested catchments are described including the lack of riparian wetlands, in-stream vegetation, and close riparian ground cover. The consequences of riparian afforestation in pasture catchments may not readily be predicted from the impacts of complete catchment afforestation.

The model was used to examine possible effects of management actions and an exotic zooplankter (Bythotrephes) on Lake Michigan food web and contaminant dynamics. The model predicts that contaminant concentrations in salmonines will decrease by nearly 20% if Bythotrephes successfully establishes itself in the lake. The model suggests that this decrease will result from lowered transfer efficiencies within the food web and increased flux of contaminants to the hypolimnion. The model also indicates that phosphorus management will have little effect on contaminant concentrations in salmonines. The modeling exercise helped identify weaknesses in the data base (e.g., incomplete information on contaminant loadings and on the biomass, production, and ecological efficiencies of dominant organisms) that should be corrected in order to make reliable management decisions.

The model is used to estimate sludge loading rates that produce steady state nitrate concentrations in percolation that meet water quality standards. Annual loading rates for aerobically and anaerobically digested sludges consistent with a 10-mg/l standard are computed for conifer and hardwood forests in the eight forest regions of New York. These rates vary from 1.7 to 2.7 Mg/ha of dry mass for conifers and from 1.4 to 2.3 Mg/ha for hardwoods among the various forest areas, or in terms of sludge nitrogen, 85 to 135 kg/ha for conifers and 70 to 115 kg/ha for hardwoods. Sludge application rates are sensitive to annual nitrogen uptakes by vegetation, and estimates of these quantities are very uncertain. A geographic information system is used to identify the amount of forest land within each region that meets state regulatory restrictions for sludge disposal. It is determined that sufficient forest land is available to accept large portions of the state's sludge production.

J	GALLIE, EA; MURTHA, PA				GALLIE, EA; MURTHA, PA			SPECIFIC ABSORPTION AND BACKSCATTERING SPECTRA FOR SUSPENDED MINERALS AND CHLOROPHYLL-A IN CHILKO LAKE, BRITISH-COLUMBIA	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; NATURAL-WATERS; MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; THEORETICAL-ANALYSIS; ALGAL CELLS; OCEAN COLOR; LIGHT; ATTENUATION	Theoretical optical water quality models used in remote sensing require the specific absorption and specific backscattering spectra for each of the colored water components in order to model reflectance (R) or to use measured reflectance to find the component concentrations. The specific absorption and backscattering spectra for suspended minerals (SM), the specific absorption spectra for chlorophyll-a (C), and the absorption spectrum for water were determined solely from irradiance measurements collected simultaneously with the concentration of SM, C, and yellow substance (YS). The glacial SM in Chilko Lake have backscattering properties similar to SM found in Lake Ontario, but only about one-third the absorption. The absorption properties of C remain uncertain with two analysis techniques giving different results at shorter wavelengths and failing to find significant values at red wavelengths. The measured absorption of water closely matches reported laboratory results of Smith and Baker (1981). Tests showed that the calibrated R-model was slightly biased (less than 10%) with a standard deviation of +/- 6-16% depending on wavelength. When the model was used to solve for component concentrations, SM were found with a standard deviation of +/- 20%, C +/- 40%, and YS +/- 30%.

The model can predict the evolution of the state of the lake, described by the concentrations of dissolved phosphorus, dissolved oxygen particulate phosphorus and organic particulate carbon, in function of phosphorus load and taking into account physical and biochemical initial- and boundary conditions. The model parameters were chosen through measurements and calibrations by short runs. A 10-year-long simulation was done, starting from the data of 1980, and its results agree quite well with the measurements. Then some 15-year-long simulations were done, which corresponded to different scenarios related to a progressive linking up of sewage systems to water treatment plants. The model predicts that a satisfactory water quality level can only be reached by reducing the total phosphorus input to less than 25 t/a.

Waste composition and production rates are presented. Land disposal of the wastes and subsequent agronomic implications are extensively discussed, but alternative methods of disposal such as composting, biogas generation and others are presented as well. Results of experimental investigations into transformations of poultry waste constituents, particularly nitrogen, are summarized. Both surface and ground water quality are reviewed in relationship to customary methods of poultry waste disposal. The body of available literature is used as a basis for recommended future research, which includes more precise characterization of wastes, improved understanding of the dynamics of poultry waste constituents, and increased efforts to quantify and model water quality impacts of waste disposal.

Twelve mesocosms (0.1 ha, 700 m3 volume) were dosed with technical-grade esfenvalerate dissolved in acetone (subsurface injection of 0-, 0.25-, 0.67-, or 1.71-mu-g/L nominal concentrations in triplicated mesocosms) on six dates at two-week intervals. We monitored dissipation rate of esfenvalerate; survival, growth, and reproduction of bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus); dynamics of benthos and zooplankton; biomass and productivity of phytoplankton; macrophyte biomass; diurnal oxygen pulse; and water quality over a five-month interval. Esfenvalerate dissipated rapidly from the water column (half-life, 10 h). Zooplankton and benthic macroinvertebrates decreased at 0.25-mu-g/L. Changes in invertebrate fauna due to esfenvalerate were partly obscured by indirect effects and seasonal dynamics. Bluegill survival, biomass, adult male survival, and reproductive success were negatively correlated with measured esfenvalerate concentrations. Although direct mortality of fish and invertebrates may be predictable from laboratory single-species tests, indirect responses of fish, zooplankton, and phytoplankton are predictable only with prior knowledge of factors controlling ecosystem structure and function.

J	LANYON, LE				LANYON, LE			IMPLICATIONS OF DAIRY-HERD SIZE FOR FARM MATERIAL TRANSPORT, PLANT NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT, AND WATER-QUALITY	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article							NITROGEN	Farm material transport to, from, and within dairy farms can create zones of plant nutrient depletion and accumulation that range in scale from local to international. The introduction, adoption, and use of fertilizers have resulted in substantial movement of plant nutrients to dairy farms. Fertilizers contributed to enhanced crop growth and frequently the correction of soil nutrient deficiencies. They also represented an opportunity to replace plant nutrients exported from a farm in crops so that it was possible for some farms to specialize in the production of crops. These exported crops often became imports for other farms that specialized in livestock. However, the nutrient-holding capacity of soil on any farm is limited, so the potential for additions to the stock of nutrients, especially of P and K, on a farm can be expected to decrease with time. After a period of net nutrient additions on a dairy farm, the quantity of nutrients that can be accommodated is controlled by the productivity of the animals, the management of the animal handling facilities, and the off-farm purchases of feeds and other materials for the animals. Field and biophysical-economic simulation studies have demonstrated that interactions between alternative management strategies and societal perspectives about water quality and the biological and economic performance of dairy farms may sometimes lead to unexpected outcomes.

A systems-oriented study of the wetlands of southwestern Lake Erie along Ohio's shoreline has been organized at two levels of hierarchy. At the ecosystem level, a specific wetland model was developed from data collected on hydrology, nutrient budgets, and aquatic metabolism. The model, calibrated from the field data, was used to predict phosphorus retention rates and to compare them with results from empirical models and field studies. A t the landscape scale, synoptic surveys of diked (hydrologically isolated with impoundments) and undiked (natural hydrology) wetlands for hydroperiods, water quality, sediment chemistry, and vegetation biomass and species illustrated several differences between these two types of wetlands. Combining data collected from these surveys with data collected from remote platforms will lead to the development of spatial dynamic models for the shoreline to deal with landscape-level questions on the management of these shoreline wetlands.

J	BALLS, PW				BALLS, PW			NUTRIENT BEHAVIOR IN 2 CONTRASTING SCOTTISH ESTUARIES, THE FORTH AND TAY	OCEANOLOGICA ACTA			English	Article							EMS-DOLLARD ESTUARY; SOLUBLE PHOSPHORUS; NITROUS-OXIDE; NORTH-SEA; WATER; PHOSPHATE; RIVER; BAY; SEDIMENTS; DISTRIBUTIONS	The distribution and behaviour of nutrients (nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, silicate and phosphate) have been examined over the course of a year in two major Scottish estuaries, the Forth and Tay. Maximum concentrations of nitrate and silicate in both estuaries occur in winter, when mixing is conservative. By contrast maximum phosphate, ammonia and nitrite concentrations (notably in the Forth) are observed in summer, these are related to lower oxygen concentrations both within the water column and sediments. Phosphate, ammonia and nitrite concentrations are high in the Forth relative to the Tay. Phosphate behaviour in plots for both estuaries show some common features including removal at low salinity, mid estuary inputs and simple dilution at high salinity. The results are interpreted on the basis of removal onto particles at low salinity followed by desorption at higher salinity together with an input from sediment porewaters. In the Forth the phosphate flux from sediments during the summer is estimated to be 1.98 +/- 1.25 mmol m-2 day-1. At this time the river input of phosphorus is only 10- 14 % of the mid estuary input. Under low river flow conditions in summer a large turbidity maximum (400-500 mg l-1 suspended solids) develops in the Forth estuary and this results in removal of phosphate. Removal is less dramatic in the Tay estuary as the turbidity is wind generated and therefore rarely exceeds 100 mg 1-1. Water quality in the Forth (as defined by the occurrence of low dissolved oxygen concentrations and the presence of species such as ammonia and nitrite) is inferior to that of the Tay. Relative to contaminated estuaries however concentrations in both estuaries are low. By virtue of its high fresh water discharge the Tay is a more significant source of nitrate to the North Sea during the winter than is the Forth. In the Forth bacterial mineralisation and nitrification of organic nitrogen occurs in the upper estuary, this results in an input of nitrate and consumption of dissolved oxygen. Further downstream broad mid estuarine peaks of nitrite and ammonia are observed indicative of a benthic source. Estimates of this source for ammonia and nitrite are 19-44 and 3.9-8.1 mmol m-2 day-1 respectively. In winter the main source of nitrogen to the Forth is from the river but in summer mid estuarine sources dominate. In the outer Tay a peak in dissolved ammonia is estimated to represent an input of 0.5-1.1 tonnes N day-1, this is attributed to sewer inputs from Dundee.

Before use, CREAMS was adapted to better represent N and P cycling in grazed pastures and the seasonal variation in hydraulic conductivity observed at the site. There was a moderately strong relationship (r2=0.81) between daily surface runoff volumes predicted by this modified model and volumes measured at the site for 62 events over a three and one half year period. Although the ability of the model to predict daily losses of sediment and nutrients was considerably less (r2 < 0.45), the model was always an unbiased predictor. This unbiased predictive ability provides good estimates of losses over longer time scales (e.g., seasonal) which is often sufficient when evaluating the impacts of land use practices on water quality. The adapted CREAMS model successfully simulated measured reductions in edge-of-field losses of sediment and nutrient upon installation of a vegetated filter strip. We conclude that although CREAMS has limitations in representing the dynamics of grazed pastures, it shows potential as a water quality management tool in pastoral watersheds.

Procedure and criteria of the assessment are discussed together with model developments (static and dynamic models for total phosphorus as well as a three-compartment P-cycle model for estimating future algae biomass levels). Population scenarios, sewage treatment options and alternatives of the future Sao Bartolomeu Reservoir for fulfilling drinking water demands for the coming 25 years are summarized. As the best compromise solution the medium size reservoir upstream to the confluence of the River Paranoa and River Sao Bartolomeu is selected. Future sewage treatment conditions are defined in order to keep trophic state at the desired level.

Three alternative treatment and disposal schemes were examined, including primary treatment, biological treatment and biological treatment combined with seasonal nitrogen removal. The critical water quality parameters were found to be chlorophyll-a and transparency and it was concluded, on the basis of the model results, that, unless a stable and sufficiently long thermal stratification of the water body is sustained, biological treatment with seasonal nitrogen removal should be adopted as the minimum degree of treatment prior to discharge.

The main classes of use for these waters are specified in the plan. Use for recreational angling imposes the strictest limits for these waters, entailing a demand for water quality class II and imposing correspondingly stringent requirements on the purification capacity of the Buchenhofen treatment plant. The Institut for Siedlungswasserbau, Wassergutewirtschaft und Abfalltechnik of the University of Stuttgart has been commissioned to evaluate realistic treatment objectives in the treatment plant and to prepare concepts for extending the plant to provide advanced treatment. The most effective form of nitrogen elimination for the advanced concept has proved to be a single-stage activated sludge process with nitrification and pre-denitrification, while the most effective method of eliminating phosphorus is simultaneous precipitation followed by flocculation filtration. Tests have shown that large activated sludge tanks are not in themselves sufficient to ensure advanced nitrification without occasional peaks. Good on-line process monitoring and control are also necessary, as is buffering of inflow peaks. A filtration stage will be added to the plant, coming on line in 1992. Advanced biological treatment based on results from a commercial-scale pilot plant should be completed by 1996. Total costs for extending the whole plant are estimated at more than DM 130 million.

Researchers and regulatory agencies are investigating the source and processes of the contamination. Agricultural best management practices (BMPs) traditionally developed to reduce non-point source pollution of surface water resources are being investigated for their impact on ground water quality. This study used the CREAMS model to simulate the long-term effects of seven different BMPs on nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) loadings to a shallow, unconfined ground water system. Two representative watersheds, 5.8 and 8.9 hectares (14.3 and 22 acres) in area, in the Coastal Plain physiographic region of Maryland were selected for study. Soils in these watersheds belong to the Matapeake silt loam series and have moderate infiltration capacity. Results from this study indicated that BMP's used in conjunction with winter cover (barley) reduced NO3-N leaching to the ground water system. It was also found that turfgrass reduced surface losses of water and nitrogen, but increased leaching losses of water and NO3-N significantly. All of the BMPs simulated in this study resulted in leachate NO3-N concentrations exceeding 10 ppm, the U.S. EPA health standard for public drinking water, indicating a need for alternate practices for reducing nitrate leaching.

J	TINKER, JR				TINKER, JR			AN ANALYSIS OF NITRATE-NITROGEN IN GROUND-WATER BENEATH UNSEWERED SUBDIVISIONS	GROUND WATER MONITORING AND REMEDIATION			English	Article								Water samples from private water supply wells in five unsewered subdivisions were tested for nitrate-nitrogen to determine the possible impact of septic systems on ground water quality. Three subdivisions are located in Eau Claire County and two in LaCrosse County, Wisconsin. The nitrate-nitrogen concentrations in the wells were analyzed in relation to ground water flow direction, the location of septic systems within the subdivision, and the hydrogeologic and physical characteristics of the subdivisions. A comparison of three nitrogen mass balance models helped to identify the possible sources of nitrate-nitrogen in the wells. The results indicate that nitrogen from septic systems and lawn fertilizer cause nitrate-nitrogen to increase in the ground water beneath the downgradient side of the subdivisions. In three of the five subdivisions the highest nitrate-nitrogen value exceeds the drinking water standard of 10 mg/L.

J	LENCE, BJ				LENCE, BJ			WEIGHTED SUM TRANSFERABLE DISCHARGE PERMIT PROGRAMS FOR CONTROL OF MULTIPLE POLLUTANTS	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							POLLUTION CONTROL; AIR-POLLUTION; MARKETS; COSTS	Transferable discharge permit (TDP) programs for controlling several pollutants may manage such pollutants as several individual commodities or as a single weighted sum of the various pollutants. This paper shows that the weighted sum permit program may be appropriate for managing pollutants that have an additive or a noninteractive effect on environmental quality. However, under this approach, administrators do not have direct control over the amount of each pollutant that is discharged, and environmental quality may be jeopardized unless the selected weighting factors induce a market equilibrium that satisfies environmental quality standards for the region. Estimates of the cost-effective weighting factors that would tend to satisfy environmental quality standards under such programs are developed here. These estimates require complete water quality information and, in the case of noninteractive pollutants, treatment costs. An approach is described for estimating the cost-effective weighting factors for noninteractive pollutants in cases where treatment cost information is unknown. This approach is demonstrated for a weighted sum TDP program for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and phosphorus. The results of this demonstration suggest that for weighted sum permits for these pollutants it is possible to determine a set of weighting factors that achieve adequate environmental protection, cost efficiency, and certainty of system outcome.

J	VINCENT, WF; GIBBS, MM; SPIGEL, RH				VINCENT, WF; GIBBS, MM; SPIGEL, RH			EUTROPHICATION PROCESSES REGULATED BY A PLUNGING RIVER INFLOW	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article							LAKE ROTOITI; NEW-ZEALAND; NITROGEN	Lake Rotoiti (North Island, New Zealand) is a deep mesotrophic lake that has declined in water quality over the last 30 years. The main river entering the lake was identified as the primary enrichment source, but its interaction with the surrounding lakewater varied with season and time of day. During winter the river was colder than the lake and penetrated 6-8 km into the main basin as an underflow. In summer the river often entered as a plunging inflow during the early morning, but it warmed during the day, and in the afternoon entered the lake as a buoyant jet that flowed directly to a nearby outlet river. From continuous temperature measurements in the inflow and lake surface it was estimated that the river plunged and penetrated the lake as an interflow or underflow for 60.2% of the year. This translated into 31% of the N and 64% of the P loading on the lake. The river also injected phytoplankton into the main basin of Lake Rotoiti, including populations of bloom-forming cyanobacteria. The underflow was the dominant term in calculating the hydraulic flushing time of the main basin, and also made a large contribution of dissolved oxygen to the subsurface waters. These complex interactions between Lake Rotoiti and its inflowing river were controlled by small temperature differences (< 3-degrees-C), and had wide-ranging implications in the eutrophication process.

A dynamic oxygen budget model is developed to analyze the diurnal water-quality data from a series of 26-hr surveys. The model formulation includes phytoplankton dynamics and photosynthetic production, sediment oxygen demand (SOD), fish respiration, carbonaceous and nitrogenous oxidation. and atmospheric oxygen transfer. The model is used to determine the components of oxygen consumption and production-in particular, the SOD and carbon-to-chlorophyll (CCHL) ratio. It is found that SOD and algal respiration are major oxygen consumption items, and the CCHL ratio is much higher than reported in previous mathematical model studies. Simulations of the diurnal DO variation are compared with data over a wide range of meteorological and ecological conditions.

The carbon-chlorophyll ratio is computed as a function of a time-variable saturating light intensity. Sediment oxygen demand is related to organic loads from the fish farm as well as algal biomass. Water-quality predictions are compared with well-documented field observations for both background and algal bloom conditions, over time scales on the order of a month. Model simulations demonstrate the importance of light intensity and photosynthetic production in dissolved oxygen variations, which are well predicted. The model also provides useful insights into the causes of severe oxygen depletion and phytoplankton dynamics in a eutrophic subtropical coastal marine ecosystem.

J	STODDARD, JL				STODDARD, JL			TRENDS IN CATSKILL STREAM WATER-QUALITY - EVIDENCE FROM HISTORICAL DATA	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							CENTRAL UNITED-STATES; ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION; SURFACE WATERS; FRESH-WATER; CHEMISTRY; PRECIPITATION; ACID; ACIDIFICATION; FOREST; SOIL	Historical data for large streams in the Catskill Mountains indicate that acidic deposition has significantly influenced water quality, but that this effect is most observable in early (pre-1945) data, and consists primarily of increased base cation (CaMg) concentrations. More recent data suggest that landscape disturbance currently exerts a stronger influence on acid/base status of large streams than does acidic deposition, resulting in increases in both CaMg and acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC). Estimates of SO42- concentration indicate that SO42- is a conservative ion in the Catskills, and stream water concentrations have decreased since reaching maximum values around 1970, consistent with temporal trends in emissions and deposition in the northeastern United States. Nitrate concentrations, on the other hand, have increased substantially in all but one stream in the past two decades, independent of any change in nitrogen deposition in the region; changes in the capacity of watersheds to retain nitrogen are hypothesized as causes of increased stream water NO3-. In small, undisturbed streams, increases in NO3- and decreases in CaMg appear to offset the effects of reduced SO42-, and lead to decreasing trends in ANC.

TM data and water-quality observations were obtained near-simultaneously in Green Bay, an embayment of Lake Michigan, and related using linear regression techniques. The high concentrations of terrestrially-derived suspended solids appear to be controlling the water volume reflectance. A simple exponential model using the band 3/band 1 (0.660-mu-m/0.485-mu-m) ratio was found to be a useful index for estimating total suspended solids and water transparency (i.e. Secchi disk depth) with an accuracy of +/- 25 per cent over the calibration data range.

Remedial actions have reduced nutrient loadings and enhanced the role of food web interactions in improving water quality. Workshops sponsored through the United States - Canada international Joint Commission have addressed the relative importance of nutrient abatement and/or food web manipulation in affecting water quality trends. Both controls have combined to enhance water clarity in Lake Michigan. Lake Ontario has already exhibited the effects of nutrient controls and may be on the verge of manifesting food web controls. Research and monitoring recommendations to elucidate the effects of nutrient and food web controls include the following: (1) water quality and fisheries agencies must coordinate monitoring activities, standardize techniques, and establish and maintain long-term data sets to evaluate the effects of water quality and fisheries programs separately and together; (2) controlled, mesoscale, whole-system experiments should be performed to quantify rates (e.g. growth, predation, etc.) of food web interactions; and (3) the scientific community should promote research which quantifies the impact of changes in food web dynamics on changes in toxic substance levels in Great Lakes fishes.

Water table level, water chemistry, plant species composition and community structure were recorded to assess the effects of increasing levels of upland disturbance on the adjacent wetlands. (2) Some increases in nitrogen, phosphorus, and chloride occurred in both surface and groundwater within wetlands beside septic system drain fields. Much larger increases in these parameters, plus increases in heavy metal concentrations, occurred in sites receiving both septic tank drainage and road run-off. (3) Hydrology was only affected by the presence of dams on the streams traversing the wetlands, and by ditches dug in association with stormwater sewer outfalls. (4) With increasing levels of suburban disturbance, there was an increasing loss of indigenous herbaceous species and an increasing incursion of upland and exotic species. Ground cover by Sphagnum spp. and cedar seedling densities all declined with increasing suburban development. Woody plant community composition and structure showed little change over the gradient. Changes in water quality were more important in determining changes in community composition and structure than were changes in hydrology. (5) The changes in species composition associated with changes in water quality support the theory that species-richness follows an optimization curve with respect to nutritional quality of the wetland. (6) The results suggest that the maximum buffer width provided for by law be required for all upland development adjacent to white cedar wetlands.

In nature, similar enclosed systems are limited by stagnant water and anoxic conditions. Consequently, 3 types of manipulations were performed: (1) turbulence with a propeller; (2) artificial fertilization; (3) pumping water into the basin. Positive correlations were found between chlorophyll content a, diatom concentration and oxygen saturation. Turbulence induced by the propeller, together with supply of nitrate and silicate, promoted diatom growth and resulted in increased oxygen concentrations. In general, the manipulations resulted in improved water quality by favoring diatoms, increased oxygen concentrations, and at the end of the investigation, increased production of calanoid nauplii. Detrended correspondence analysis of species composition indicated that phytoplankton was most affected by turbulence, while ciliates were most affected by fertilization.

Water entering the river is low in suspended solids, organic carbon, phosphorus and nitrates, typical of clear, oligotrophic waters. In contrast to many large rivers, dissolved and colloidal solids account for 90 to 95 percent of the total solids load transported by the river, giving the river a turquoise colour common of glacial meltwater streams. The river supports a diverse floral and faunal community that includes 20 taxa of submergent macroflora, at least 300 benthic macroinvertebrates and 83 fishes. A number of exotic (European) species, including 3 plants, 4 molluscs and 11 fishes, occur in the river with the macroalga, Nitellopsis obtusa, zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorphora), Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea), and white perch (Morone americana) being the most recent invaders. Production is estimated to be 200 g m-2 a-1 ash-free dry mass for submergent macrophytes and periphyton, 7 g for macroinvertebrates and 5 g for fishes. The river also supports a variety of water-oriented recreational activities, is a source of municipal and industrial water, a receiver of municipal and industrial wastes, and a shipping corridor. Industrial discharges have adversely affected aquatic life, particularly in the nearshore areas along the Canadian shoreline south of Sarnia, Ontario. In addition, channel dredging and shoreline modifications (bulk-heading and backfilling) have destroyed large areas of valuable habitat in the main channel and along the shoreline. Improvements in the nearshore benthic macroinvertebrate community of the river over the past 20 years show that the river will respond to reductions in contaminants loadings.

J	BRITTON, DL				BRITTON, DL			FIRE AND THE CHEMISTRY OF A SOUTH-AFRICAN MOUNTAIN STREAM	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						FIRE; SOUTH-AFRICA; FYNBOS; STREAM CHEMISTRY; WATER YIELD; NITRATE	COASTAL FYNBOS ECOSYSTEM; WATER-QUALITY; FOREST FIRE; YIELD; SUBSTANCES; CATCHMENTS; WILDFIRE; NITROGEN; LOSSES	The effects of a late-summer prescribed burn on the chemistry of a second-order mountain stream in the south-western Cape, South Africa, were investigated. Nitrate concentrations in stream water were significantly higher during the winter of the post-burn year. Increased concentrations of chloride, bicarbonate, polyphenols and potassium and decreased sodium concentrations were also recorded. Concentrations of ammonium, phosphate, calcium, magnesium, total dissolved solids and hydrogen ions were not significantly affected by the burn. Ionic export from the catchment was generally greater in the post-burn year. Apart from nitrate, however, values probably lie within the natural range of year-to-year variation. It is predicted that enhanced losses of nitrate will decrease progressively with the recovery of the vegetation and the re-establishment of soil/plant nutrient cycles. Atmospheric losses of nutrients in smoke were unquantified, but may be of more significance to site productivity than losses through surface runoff, which, in the case of nitrogen, appear to be compensated by precipitation inputs.

While leachates from N fertilizers applied to agricultural lands can impact the water quality in municipal wells, there is also the potential for leachates from turfgrass fertilizers to be groundwater contaminants. In this study, five plots were treated with ammonium nitrate (34-0-0,N-P-K) at rates of 0, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.4 kg N/100 m2 and irrigated. The turf received approximately 640 mm of water during the 34-d study. Analysis of soil water from 15, 6-m continuous cores showed that as much as 95% of the NO3 applied in late August leached below the turfgrass root zone. Average NO3 concentrations in the pulse ranged from 34 to 70 mg/L NO3-N. Thirty-four days after fertilization the center of the pulse was at almost-equal-to 1.2 m with the leading edge at 2 to 2.5 m. This vertical rate of movement is similar to that predicted by the one-dimensional CMLS model. The relatively high uniform NO3 concentrations in the unfertilized plot indicated that with excessive irrigation the water alone supplies NO3 in excess of the turfgrass need.

Lofty Ranges, including improvements to the quality of water supplied to the city of Adelaide. The committee is examining potential land-use and land-management policies. The writers have developed a prototype of a decision support system (DSS) that will estimate the effects of these policies on water quality and the costs of implementing the policies. The DSS consists of three modules. The policy module allows the user to build up a suite of policies in a formal syntax. The second module, the catchment model, will estimate the effects of these policies on total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and turbidity levels. The user can query the DSS about these estimates in the third module. The prototype has been evaluated by the South Australian Engineering and Water Supply Department, and a second version of the DSS is now being designed.

This paper demonstrates a method that can be used to measure effects in relation to the practical significance of the reductions for the people living in the area concerned. The approach used in the project on locally adapted regulatory impact analysis (LARIA) aims to overcome the problem of finding a correct balance between the size and cost of the effort required in relation to the benefit to society for conservation projects. The proposed methodology consists of four parts. First, the user interests in the Lake Mjosa basin are determined, and relative weights expressing the importance is given to the uses. Then, a water-quality-effect model is developed. Focus is placed on developing a phosphorus effect model taking into account the biological availability of phosphorus. The third step is a model to express the benefit to society from improvement in water quality. The fourth step is to identify and rank all available abatement measures using information from the effect model and the cost of implementation of each measure.

J	ZETTERQVIST, L				ZETTERQVIST, L			STATISTICAL ESTIMATION AND INTERPRETATION OF TRENDS IN WATER-QUALITY TIME-SERIES	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article								Three approaches to trend analysis of water quality time series are discussed: (1) seasonal model, with a test for trend based on ranks of observations, with observations assumed to be m dependent; (2) transfer function noise model, in which covariate series may be included by means of transfer functions, with the remaining noise modeled as a seasonal autoregressive moving average process; and (3) component model, with the noise decomposed into series which describe trends, and irregular and seasonal variation. Models are studied with regards to their ability to include covariate series, possibility of interpretation of trends, treatment of seasonal variation and serial dependence, and robustness for outliers. We regard the component model being the most realistic and the most informative of the three approaches. Models are applied to series of monthly phosphorus concentration in the Ljungbyan River in Southern Sweden.

Phosphorus retention in the wetland is a desirable to prevent eutrophication of Lake Erie. The model is developed with sub-models for hydrology, productivity, and phosphorus and a simulated barrier beach that can be opened or closed to Lake Erie. A simulation based on 1988 data is calibrated in step-wise fashion. Resuspension is a necessary inclusion in the model to predict phosphorus concentrations in the wetland's water column. Subsequent simulations are made for various combinations of increased flow from the watershed and changing Lake Erie water levels. Phosphorus retention varies from 17 to 52% with highest retention when high inflows are coupled with high lake levels. A nutrient budget constructed from the model for 1988 conditions showed marked differences with budgets developed from empirical models or field data. The model results suggest a near balance between inorganic sedimentation and resuspension but an active plankton sedimentation that results in a net phosphorus retention rate of 2.9 mg P m-2 day-1.

This model computes total phosphorus and hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations, taking sediment-water interactions into account. The lake is treated as two segments: the water and a surface sediment layer. A total phosphorus budget for the water accounts for inputs due to external loading and recycle from the sediments. It reflects losses due to flushing and settling. The sediment layer gains total phosphorus by settling and loses total phosphorus by recycle and burial. The recycle from the sediments to the water is dependent on the levels of sediment total phosphorus and hypolimnetic oxygen. Hypolimnetic oxygen concentration is estimated with a semi-empirical model. The model is applied to Shagawa Lake. An analysis is performed to demonstrate how its predictions replicate in-lake changes not possible with simpler phosphorus budget models.

Monitoring programs in support of contaminant modeling of large waterbodies, such as for Green Bay, are expensive and their extent is often limited by budget limitations, laboratory capacity, and logistic constraints. Therefore, it is imperative that available resources be used in the most efficient manner possible. This use, or allocation of resources, may be aided through the application of readily available models in the planning stages of projects. To aid in the planning effort for the Green Bay project, a workshop was held and studies designed to aid in the allocation of resources for a year-long intensive field study. Physical/chemical and food chain models were applied using historical data to aid in project planning by identifying processes having the greatest impact on the predictive capability of mass balance models. Studies were also conducted to estimate errors in computed tributary loadings and in-Bay concentrations and contaminant mass associated with different sampling strategies. The studies contributed to the overall project design, which was a collaborative effort with many participants involved in budgeting, field data collection, analysis, processing of data, quality assurance, data management and modeling activities.

The movement of these potential pollutants during pumping events was determined by sampling water quality at 36 stations distributed over each wetland. Automatic water sampling continued after pumping events to determine the nutrient and sediment removal rates in the water left standing on the wetlands. The total volume of water pumped during small events was effectively stored on the wetland until displaced by subsequent pumping or removed by evapotranspiration. Nutrient and sediment concentrations of this stored water, which had several days of residence time on the wetland, were near background levels before leaving the wetlands. Nutrient concentrations leaving the wetlands during these small events ranged from 0.03 to 0.04 mg/L for total phosphorus (TP) and from 0.0 to 0.1 mg/L for nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N). Pumped water completely traversed the wetland during the less-frequent, larger pumping events. Nutrient and sediment concentrations at the wetland outlet were often higher than background concentrations, ranging from 0 to 70 percent of the inflow concentrations. Nutrient concentrations leaving the wetlands during these larger events ranged from 0.06 to 0.12 mg/L for TP and from 0.0 to 4.7 mg/L for NO3-N. Sediment, TP, and NO3-N were removed from drainage water standing on the wetland. This nutrient and sediment removal was described using a first order decay model. Deposition of sediment was observed only within 800 m of the pumps, and was not resuspended during subsequent large pumping events.

The population densities, dynamics and production of Daphnia hyalina and Bosmina longirostris were studied over a 2-year period in a shallow eutrophic reservoir in eastern England. The diet of the two species was assessed and their ecology was compared in relation to environmental factors. 2. Daphnia hyalina was characterized by small overall body size, probably due to heavy size-selective predation by fish. The first generation produced from the overwintering population appeared in April and the population peaked in late spring and early summer. Adult survival was poor. Peak egg production varied between years, while mean brood size fell in summer probably due to food limitation during the cyanobacterial bloom. At this time selection for individual algal species was high and many guts were empty. Reproductive ratios were inversely related to population density. Bosmina longirostris exhibited a similar annual cycle. 3. Patterns of production were very different in the 2 years in D. hyalina. In 1981 production was high from August to early October, but in 1982 the peak was in spring. Annual production was 32.4 g C m-2 in 1981 and 13.3 g C m-2 in 1982. In 1981 B. longirostris production peaked in spring and late summer; in 1982 there was a high production in summer only. Annual production was 3.2 g C m-2 in 1981 and 2.2 g C m-2 in 1982. 4. The number of adult D. hyalina was highly correlated with water temperature and total phytoplankton biomass, but these were negatively correlated with the number of eggs, mean brood size and instantaneous birth rate. In contrast, clutch size of B. longirostris was positively correlated with water temperature while birth rate was positively correlated with both temperature while birth rate was positively correlated with both temperature and phytoplankton biomass. The biomass of both species was positively related to total phytoplankton biomass, but neither relationship explained much of the variation in zooplankton biomass. 5. The significance of the observations on plankton in terms of managing the water quality in eutrophic reservoirs is discussed.

J	CAMPBELL, EE; BATE, GC				CAMPBELL, EE; BATE, GC			GROUND-WATER IN THE ALEXANDRIA DUNE FIELD AND ITS POTENTIAL INFLUENCE ON THE ADJACENT SURF-ZONE	WATER SA			English	Article							VEGETATION	Water quality of the ground water in the Alexandria dune field was monitored with the aim of estimating the amount of nutrient input from this source into the adjacent surf-zone. Soluble reactive phosphorus contents of the ground water were not significantly different from that of the adjacent sea water. Ammonia levels were about twice that of surf water while nitrate levels were about ten times higher than that of the sea. On average, the ground water enters the surf-zone at a rate of 1 000 l per running metre of beach. This results in a net flow of nitrogen from the dune ground water to the surf-zone of 1 050 g N.a-1 for each metre of beach. This makes the ground-water flow from the dune aquifer an important source of nitrogen for surf-zone phytoplankton, in that it replaces much of the nitrogen lost from the surf-zone ecosystem. This link represents an interdependence between these two apparently distinct ecosystems.

The emergent marsh contained most of the total N in the wetland because of its large area and high N mass per unit area. Total N stored in live marsh plants, dead litter, and inorganic interstitial water were roughly similar and 50-500 x less than total peat N. A simple input-output budget indicated that most of the N entering the wetland annually passes through the ecosystem unaltered; a relatively small amount of N is imported from the river by the marsh. In the short term, mineralization of peat N is sufficient to satisfy N demands within the marsh. Mineralized N is conserved by plant uptake, microbial immobilization, and litter immobilization. The small net N exchange with the river does provide an important subsidy to the marsh over the long term, offsetting losses due to denitrification and burial. Tidal freshwater wetlands may not appear to be influenced by current water quality and yet may respond to long-term cumulative nutrient loading, especially when this loading increases because of incremental watershed development.

Selected parameters for important components of water quality are presented, such as those used in preferred combined methods in the practice of the laboratories of water and wastewater monitoring. The following components with detection limits in mg/l are concerned: ammonium 0.04, nitrite 0.07, nitrate 0.32, N(org). 0.35, o-PO4 0.02, total PO4 0.08, SiO2 0.08, sum of cations 0.79 mmole/l, Mn 0.02, Fe 0.34, Cl- 15.4 and UV-absorbance 0.01 cm-1. The detailed examination of the techniques on samples of waters has proved a statistically secured agreement of the analytical results with the results of the standard methods, with the simultaneous increase of the number of analyses by 100 ... 300% and a saving of chemicals of 80% compared with the manual analysis. The device system has the interfaces required for the further data processing by means of PC.

This paper proposes a simple model to describe the daily oxygen production by algae and validates its parameters against experimental data taken from the river Arno. This model can be easily incorporated in more general water quality schemes where other contributions to the dissolved oxygen budget are taken into account. The model explains the observed data to a satisfactory degree and its parameter values are consistent with the river conditions.

A population of coccoid to ovate eukaryotic cells with a mean size of 1.2-mu-m dominated the RFPP community in both surface and deep water samples. Abundant prochlorophyte populations were not found in any samples. Comparisons of counts with epifluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, revealed that RFPP were adequately enumerated with standard epifluorescence microscopy. These RFPP were significant contributors to total phototrophic picoplankton abundance in both lakes Michigan (24 %) and Huron (18 %), with maximum seasonal abundance during the May-June period (surface mixing layer temperatures, 3-9-degrees-C). During thermal stratification, maximum vertical abundance was found in the metalimnion/hypolimnion at the 1-5 % isolumes. RFPP were only minor contributors (1-7 %) to total primary production. Growth rates of RFPP measured with dilution and small inocula growth experiments ranged from 0.05-1.0 d-1. Microzooplankton grazing rates on RFPP measured with dilution experiments were similar to estimated growth rates, accounting for 52-280 % of growth on any given date.

Consequently, concentrations and amounts of sediment, N, and P in runoff from Conventional Till (CT), Reduced Till (RT), and No Till (NT), sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench.] watersheds in the Southern Plains, were measured during a 5-yr period to evaluate water quality impacts of sorghum culture. Mean annual sediment and total N and P loss in runoff from NT (281, 0.76, and 0.28 kg ha-1 yr-1, respectively) and RT (523, 0.99, and 0.37 kg ha-1 yr-1, respectively) were lower than from CT sorghum (8877, 7.28, and 2.5 kg ha-1 yr-1, respectively). In contrast, tillage effects on soluble N and P losses were generally small and less consistent, although soluble P concentrations exceeded limits associated with accelerated eutrophication (0.01 mg L-1). Predicted losses of soluble P and particulate N and P using desorption kinetics and enrichment ratio relationships were not significantly different from measured values for all tillage practices (r2 ranged from 0.66 to 0.99). Overall, conservation tillage (NT and RT) reduced sediment, N, and P transport in runoff relative to CT and thereby lessened the potential impact of sorghum culture on surface water quality in the Southern Plains.

The objective of this study is to determine the extent to which the area's surface and ground-water quality is influenced by different wheat cultural practices. Concentrations and amounts of sediment, N and P in surface runoff water were determined for conventional till (CT), reduced till (RT), and no till (NT) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) watersheds in the High Plain, Reddish Prairie, and Rolling Red Plain land resource areas of Oklahoma and Texas. During the 4 to 6 yr study periods, RT and NT practices were superior to CT for reducing sediment and associated particulate nutrient discharge. Mean annual discharge ranged from 230 to 15 900 kg ha-1 for sediment, 1 to 27 kg ha-1 for total N, and 0.1 to 6 kg ha-1 for total P. Irrespective of tillage practice, annual soluble nutrient losses in surface runoff water tended to be small, often < 1 kg ha-1 N or P. Successful prediction of soluble P, particulate P, and particulate N losses was achieved using appropriate kinetic desorption and enrichment ratio procedures. Soluble N in runoff posed no particular water quality problem, but recommended P levels were exceeded, even from baseline, unfertilized grassland watersheds. With regard to groundwater quality, elevated levels of NO3- (e.g., 34 mg N L-1 maximum) were observed on one Reddish Prairie NT watershed.

The river receives both point source and nonpoint source input of nutrients. Data were used to characterize the water quality and trophic state in the river. In addition nitrification, denitrification, and nitrogen assimilation rates were estimated. Transformations of added [N-15]-labelled nitrogen in water and sediment were measured seasonally at sites on the Calcasieu River. Nitrification rates were determined by adding (NH4+)-N-15 and measuring the rate of (NO3)-N-15 appearamce. Denitrification was determined using N-15 tracer and acetylene blockage techniques. Nitrification occurred in the oxidized surface of the bottom sediment from the Calcasieu River and minimally in the overlying water. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the river suggest that the Calcasieu River may become eutrophic unless means are taken for reducing nutrient loading into the system. Results show the importance of nitrification and denitrification reactions in minimizing the effect of nitrogen input.

Models and algorithms are currently being developed to infer aquatic primary production from near-surface chlorophyll concentration values determined from satellite sensors. Data from Lake Ladoga are utilized to illustrate that the algorithms currently being used to monitor near-surface chlorophyll concentrations in oceanic waters are inadequate when applied to water masses optically complicated by their proximity to land masses. Methodologies originally developed for retrieving simultaneous concentrations of chlorophyll, suspended minerals, and dissolved organic carbon from volume reflectance measurements of Lake Ontario are shown to display success in Lake Ladoga that could not be duplicated by six different oceanic chlorophyll retrieval algorithms. The principal requirements for water quality satellite monitoring are the cross sections of the optically-active components of the water body being remotely monitored. It is argued that, despite the spatial and temporal variability of such cross sections, their determination for principal water bodies should comprise both global and regional climate change studies.

J	ELSER, JJ; GOLDMAN, CR				ELSER, JJ; GOLDMAN, CR			ZOOPLANKTON EFFECTS ON PHYTOPLANKTON IN LAKES OF CONTRASTING TROPHIC STATUS	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							NUTRIENT-LIMITED LAKES; PRODUCTIVITY; ECOSYSTEMS; ALGAE; POPULATIONS; HERBIVORES; RESPONSES; PATTERNS; FIXATION; DAPHNIA	Studies were carried out in three lakes of strongly contrasting trophic state to evaluate how the effects of zooplankton on phytoplankton vary as a function of lake productivity. Chlorophyll and total P concentrations differed by 2-3 orders of magnitude among ultra-oligotrophic Lake Tahoe, meso-oligotrophic Castle Lake, and strongly eutrophic Clear Lake. Three experimental designs involving short-term (4 d) manipulations of nutrients, ambient zooplankton, and the common crustacean grazer Daphnia were performed in each lake. Algal responses were assessed at both the "aggregate," community (Chl, primary productivity, nutrient status) and species levels. Experiments in Lake Tahoe revealed a high degree of nutrient sensitivity but negligible grazing impacts by the very low densities of ambient zooplankton. Daphnia grazing had substantial impacts on Tahoe phytoplankton, however, indicating high susceptibility to grazing in this assemblage of relatively small-sized algal species. Castle Lake experiments revealed strong direct and indirect impacts of both ambient zooplankton and Daphnia on the nutrient-limited algal assemblage. The cyanobacteria-dominated algal community of Clear Lake was resistant to grazing impacts, responding relatively weakly only to the highest densities of Daphnia. Good correspondence between estimates of algal biomass made from chlorophyll measurements and microscopic examination were obtained, and, in Castle Lake, concordance between estimated community productivity turnover times made from species-specific growth determinations and community productivity measurements was observed. The contrasting responses to experimental zooplankton manipulations in the three lakes provide support for the view that the coupling between zooplankton and phytoplankton is strongest in lakes of intermediate productivity and imply that food-web alterations at the top of the food web are most likely to propagate to the level of the phytoplankton (and therefore lake water quality) in lakes of moderate trophic status.

J	RIEMANN, B; HOFFMANN, E				RIEMANN, B; HOFFMANN, E			ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF DREDGING AND BOTTOM TRAWLING IN THE LIMFJORD, DENMARK	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article								During August 1988, effects of mussel dredging and bottom trawling on particulate material, internal nutrient loads, and oxygen balance were examined at 3 shallow locations in Limfjorden, Denmark. Water samples were taken simultaneously from areas exposed to fishing activities and from unused control areas. Sampling was carried out before fishing and 0 (immediately after fishing), 30, and 60 min after fishing. Sampling and control areas, which were situated close to one another, each covered 160 000 m2 and included 9 sampling stations and 3 depths. Immediately after mussel dredging, suspended particulate material increased significantly, but 30 min after dredging these differences had decreased and had returned to the start level after 60 min. The effect per dredged m2 (1850 m2) extrapolated to the total area (160 000m2 was 1470 g suspended particulate material per m2 dredged, corresponding to an increase of 1361 % on the average suspended particulate material in the water column before dredging. Similar values for eel trawling from 2 different stations gave 960 and 1000 %, respectively. Oxygen decreased significantly after mussel dredging and average ammonia content increased, but large horizontal variations in the ammonia content prevented detailed interpretation of these increases. Changes in other nutrients were small. Changes in particulate matter and nutrients were also observed at 2 stations on a day with high (15 m s-1) followed by a day with low wind velocity (3 m s-1). Particulate matter and total phosphorus were markedly higher on the windy day. A significant proportion of dredging and trawling in the Limfjord takes place during summer, when wind speeds are mostly low, nutrients are low, and oxygen consumption and temperatures are high. During these periods, trawling and particularly dredging reduce the water quality by increasing internal nutrient loads, oxygen consumption, and possibly phytoplankton primary production. An extended evaluation of the ecological role of dredging and trawling requires an estimate of intensity of, and more information on the role of, natural wind-stress.

Lakewater quality was monitored sporadically before 1984, and routinely since then. In the first 3 years since diversion, water quality in the winter has not improved (levels of TP, TN, chlorophyll a, and Secchi depth unchanged), although DRP levels are now low. Summer chlorophylla level has halved, and it covaries significantly with TN level which has also fallen substantially. Summer TP and DRP levels have also more than halved, but remain very high (mean TP 420 mg m-3), primarily because of a large internal P load. Water clarity is still poor because levels of inorganic suspensoids and detritus have remained high.

Compared with most northern temperature lakes many New Zealand lakes show: low levels of inorganic nitrogen (N) and frequent N-limitation of phytoplankton growth; diffuse, rather than point source, nutrient inflows; a great diversity of optical properties; unusual and often variable timing of plankton growth (attributed to the pervasive influence of New Zealand's oceanic climate); low productivity and biomass of zooplankton, which appear to be limited by food rather than predators; and sensitivity to invasion by adventive macrophytes. Notable research develop-ments include improved methods of measuring nutrients, empirical predictive models that relate indices of eutrophication to nutrient loading, and significant advancements in methods of quantifying and measuring water colour and clarity.

CREAMS-NT accounts for nutrient addition through fertilization and for losses of N by volatilization, denitrification, plant uptake, leaching, and overland flow. Mineralization, nitrification, denitrification, and volatilization are simulated using first-order kinetic equations, adjusted for the effects of soil environmental conditions, including temperature, moisture, pH, soil/sludge contact, and soil cation exchange capacity. Prior to a runoff event, soil ammonium is partitioned between adsorbed and desorbed phases. CREAMS-NT predicts the transport of sediment-bound forms of N (organic-N and NH4+) in runoff using enrichment ratios, and soluble forms of N (NO3- and NH4+) are estimated using extraction coefficients. CREAMS-NT was validated using data from plot studies. Predicted yields were very close to the observed values for all N forms. The effects of tillage practice, organic waste application method, and loading rate were also well represented by the model for most N forms. CREAMS-NT has potential for use as a planning tool for assessing site suitability and water quality impact of land application of organic waste.

J	MOBIUS, CH				MOBIUS, CH			NITROGEN AND PHOSPHORUS LIMITS FOR NUTRIENT DEFICIENT INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATERS	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						NUTRIENTS; NITROGEN; PHOSPHORUS; INDUSTRIAL WASTE-WATER; PULP AND PAPER INDUSTRY WASTE-WATER; ACTIVATED SLUDGE TREATMENT; NITRIFICATION; DENITRIFICATION; SIMULTANEOUS TREATMENT; TERTIARY TREATMENT		For biological treatment of nutrient deficient industrial wastewaters, such as those of the pulp and paper industry, the addition of nitrogen and phosphorus is essential. As a certain surplus is necessary, both elements will be found in the effluent in varying concentrations. For the often used activated sludge treatment 5 parts of N and 1 part of P are said to be required for elimination of 100 parts of BOD. In-plant optimization generally leads to about 3.5 parts of N and 0.6 parts of P for 100 parts of BOD. In most plants N is added as urea and P as phosphoric acid. Optimized nutrient dosage aimed at stable operating conditions in the treatment plant generally gives average concentrations of 1 mg/l of both ammonia N and phosphate P in the treated effluent. However, due to fluctuations in loading and efficiency, variation coefficients of more than 100 % result in maximum concentrations in 24 hours mixed samples of more than 10 mg/l for N and P. Three examples of operational results are evaluated and discussed in detail. Water quality requirements will impose general limitations on N and P concentrations in treated effluents. Depending on the concentration limits and on the type of limited substance - i.e. ammonia N, total inorganic N or total N, phosphate P or total P - different strategies have to be developed. Nutrient dosage depending on the wastewater amount will become state of the art in the near future. The next step would be a loading dependent dosage. No results of technical operation are known which show the effluent concentrations obtainable with this technique. For cases in which limits cannot be met with this strategy the possibilities of nutrification, denitrification and biological P removal are discussed for nutrient deficient wastewaters. Results show that nitrification will work at low ammonia concentrations, however no steady nitrification will be obtained. Denitrification, on the other hand, seems to be difficult with low nitrate concentrations. At the present stage, no technical process meeting stringent total N or total inorganic N limits is known to exist for this type of effluent. Low P concentrations in the effluent can only be achieved by tertiary treatment, preferably final flocculation filtration processes. However, these will give rise to special problems in the treatment of pulp will wastewaters, which are discussed in the paper.

A multi-component dynamic model for nutrients in the bottom sediment-water system was incorporated into the model, a one-dimensional water temperature-water quality-ecological model. Good agreement between the model calculations and observed nutrients, chlorophyll-a, and dissolved oxygen concentrations in the water and nutrient concentrations in the bottom sediment was noted. The agreement between the model calculations and the measured nutrient flux from bottom sediment during the summer stagnation period was good. The effectiveness of sediment dredging, artificial circulation, and reduction of external phosphorus loading as eutrophication control programs on chlorophyll-a, PO4-P, and dissolved oxygen concentration in the water was assessed using a calibrated model.

First instars were added twice weekly (for 10 wk) to simulate natural oviposition. The fungus persisted for 10 wk and recycled in the mosquito larvae of both species. The overall reductions of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Ae. aegypti immatures were higher in tires (55 and 45%, respectively) and wood (67 and 38%) than in concrete containers (17 and 14%). There were low correlations of the numbers of mosquito immatures with measurements of water quality (chemical oxygen demand, ammonia nitrogen and conductivity) in the containers.

We have investigated the potential effects of climate change on the primary productivity of Castle Lake, a mountain lake in Northern California. Annual algal productivity was modeled empirically using 25 years of limnological data in order to establish predictive relationships between productivity and the climatic variables of accumulated snow depth and precipitation. The outputs of monthly temperature and precipitation from three general circulation models (GCMs) of doubled atmospheric CO2 were then used in the regression model to predict annual algal productivity. In all cases, the GCM senarios predicted increased algal productivity for Castle Lake under conditions of doubled atmospheric CO2. The primary cause of enhanced productivity was the increased length of the growing season resulting from earlier spring ice-out.

J	TUNDISI, JG				TUNDISI, JG			PERSPECTIVES FOR ECOLOGICAL MODELING OF TROPICAL AND SUBTROPICAL RESERVOIRS IN SOUTH-AMERICA	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article							BRAZIL; PHYTOPLANKTON	In this paper, the author identifies and describes some basic characteristics of tropical and subtropical reservoir in South America and the necessary modelling effort. Many reservoirs in South America have a wide geographical distribution within a latitudinal gradient that ranges from tropical rainforest to subtropical regions. The 'baseline' environment is considered the reservoir area and the hydrographic basin, including the region downstream. For the modelling effort it is necessary to establish a conceptual framework based on the following characteristics: morphometry and compartments; retention time; hydrological cycle and flow requirements; reservoir thermal stratification and circulation patterns; quantification of submerged forest biomass and its degradation in reservoirs located in the tropical rainforest; dissolved-oxygen consumption; potential for eutrophication and loading capacity; pulses in forcing functions; and suspended-material transport. In the region downstream it is necessary to consider river recovery capacity, water uses and flow regime requirements. Most reservoirs in this latitudinal gradient follow a significantly different path from the reservoirs in temperate zones, including effects of forcing functions, decomposition rats, and seasonal circulation periods. The size, volume and dimension of these large artificial ecosystems justify the implementation of several methodological approaches useful for modelling, including oceanographic techniques and intensive use of satellite images. In necessitates also a strong background on ecological processes. Rates of processes in tropical ecosystems are not well known, and such input from experimental limnology will be an important step as a basis for the modelling effort. The organization of a data bank for these reservoirs is in progress, and such a system is also fundamental for the modelling procedure. The modelling effort for tropical reservoirs is mainly due to the need for evaluation of effects, prediction of eutrophication, prognosis for possible deterioration of water quality in reservoirs with inundated forest, and introduction of management techniques for multiple uses including upstream/downstream environments. Management techniques include exploitation of spatial heterogeneity, regulation of retention time and optimal biomass production.

The model of Kirk was used to extract scattering and absorption coefficients from the measurements in waters considerably more turbid than those in which the model was previously applied. Estimated scattering coefficients were linearly related to mineral suspended solids. Estimates of total absorption coefficients were decomposed as the sum of contributions by water, dissolved organic matter, phytoplankton chlorophyll, and particulate detritus, each having a characteristic spectral shape. The 1988 data were used to develop a model of scattering and absorption coefficients based on the specific curves regressed against water-quality parameters. Diffuse attenuation coefficients in the 1989 data ranging from 1 to 10 m-1 and photic depths ranging from < 1 to 4.5 m were predicted with a C.V. of about 25%. The problem of estimating concentrations of water-quality constituents from optical measurements was indeterminate due to the similarity in shape of the specific curves of dissolved substances and depigmented particulates. Chlorophyll concentration could be estimated because it was strongly related to water-corrected absorption in the 670-nm waveband, but several outliers occurred due to biological variability in specific absorption of pigments.

J	BROOKS, CM; EFFLER, SW				BROOKS, CM; EFFLER, SW			THE DISTRIBUTION OF NITROGEN SPECIES IN POLLUTED ONONDAGA-LAKE, NY, USA	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION			English	Article							NEW-YORK; FRESH-WATER; AMMONIA; HYPOLIMNION; OXYGEN; MODEL; PH	The temporal and vertical distributions of four N species, NO3-, NO2-, total ammonia (T-NH3), and free ammonia (NH3), are documented for Onondaga Lake, an urban, polluted, hypereutrophic, dimictic, lake that receives a very high load of T-NH3. Nitrate and NO2- were lost rapidly from the hypolimnion, and T-NH3 accumulated to high concentrations (maximum > 10 mgN L-1), after the onset of anoxia, consistent with the lake's high level of productivity. The concentrations of T-NH3, NH3 and NO3- that were maintained in the epilimnion (average concentrations at a depth of 1 m of 2.81, 0.16 and 0.91 mgN L-1, respectively), and concentrations of NO2- that developed in the epilimnion (maximum of 0.48 mgN L-1), were high in comparison to levels reported in the literature. These elevated concentrations are largely a result of the extremely high loads of T-NH3, and its precursors, received by the lake. Water quality problems in the lake related to the prevailing high concentrations of N species include potential toxicity effects and severe lake-wide oxygen depletion during fall turnover.
