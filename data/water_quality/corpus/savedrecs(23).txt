Biological indices yield evidence of how a soil functions and interacts with the plants, animals and climate that comprise an ecosystem. Soil scientists can identify and quantify both chemical and biological soil-quality indicators for ecosystems with a single main function, such as agricultural lands and forest plantations. However, quantifying these indices in complex ecosystems - that have multiple uses or goals such as maintaining biodiversity, aesthetics, recreation, timber production and water quality - is much more difficult. In an ecosystem context all components - plants, animals and humans - interact with the soil differently, making soil quality indices variable. These interactions result in a combination of biological processes that make each ecosystem unique. We examined the soil and site quality of five forest stands (xeric oak-pine; two mixed hardwood, cove hardwood, northern hardwood), within the 2185-ha Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory. An initial rank of soil quality based on soil chemical and physical properties was assigned. The ranking was then compared with four common groups of soil biological indicators: (1) nitrogen availability; (2) litter decomposition; (3) soil microarthropod populations; and (4) carbon availability. We also examined estimates of overstory productivity, overstory biodiversity and total aboveground productivity for each site as indices of site quality. We found that soil and site quality rankings varied with the indicator, showing that the soil or site of greatest quality may change depending on the use or goal of the ecosystem under examination.

Previous research has shown that soil test P levels are directly correlated to runoff P levels and that aluminum (Al) will hind P in the soil. Both water treatment residuals (WTR) and HiClay Alumina (HCA) are readily available waste materials high in Al. Water treatment residuals and HCA are by-products of the potable water treatment and commercial alum production process, respectively. Our objective, was to determine if runoff P from fields excessively high in soil test P could he decreased by land applying these materials. Water treatment residuals and HCA were surface applied at rates of 0, 2.2, 9.0, and 18 Mg ha(-1) to plots high in P. We used rainfall simulation to produce runoff 1 d, I mo, and 4 mo following application. The P adsorption capacity for the WTR was 20 times higher than HCA because it was predominantly; clay (95%) and contained three times as much Al. High rates of WTR increased the total recoverable Al concentrations in the soil, whereas HCA had no effect. High rates of both materials decreased Mehlich III soil test P levels due to the increased levels of soil Al. The two highest rates of WTR decreased runoff P levels significantly below those of the control plots for all dates, whereas the two highest rates of HCA decreased P levels for only the first two dates. Relative to the control, runoff concentrations of either total or dissolved Al were not significantly increased by WTR.

J	Maguire, RO; Sims, JT; Coale, FJ				Maguire, RO; Sims, JT; Coale, FJ			Phosphorus fractionation in biosolids-amended soils: Relationship to soluble and desorbable phosphorus	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL			English	Article							P-I TEST; PHOSPHATE DESORPTION; MINERAL SOILS; SEWAGE-SLUDGE; SOLUBILITY; SATURATION; ADSORPTION; DYNAMICS; KINETICS; OXIDES	Phosphorus has been identified as a major factor involved in decreasing water quality through its role in eutrophication, and there is now a focus on controlling nonpoint agricultural P sources. This work was conducted to identify how biosolids applications under current regulations have affected the forms and release potential of P in agricultural soils. We collected samples from eight farms with a history of biosolids amendments, selecting fields that had setback areas (where biosolids applications were not permitted) to allow comparison of amended and unamended soils. We analyzed these soils for P fractions (soluble P, Al-P, Fe-P, reductant soluble P, and Ca-P; their sum equals total P), sequentially desorbable P (Fe-strip), oxalate P, Al and Fe, Mehlich-1 P, and the degree of P saturation. Our results show that following a N-based biosolids nutrient management plan can significantly increase total P (from 403 to 738 mg kg(-1)) and initially desorbable P (from 32 to 61 mg kg(-1)). The main soil components associated with P retention (Al(ox) and Fe(ox)) also tended to be increased by biosolids amendment and this may help mitigate P release. Biosolids amendment significantly increased Fe-P (from 137 to 311 mg kg(-1)), probably due to Fe added to biosolids during production, and there was also a strong trend for higher Al-P where biosolids had been applied. Desorbable P was initially greatest from biosolids sites, but with increasing extractions, the release converged towards that from the setback areas. Mehlich-1 P and P(ox) were good predictors of desorbable P release, as measured by one and five sequential extractions with Fe-strips. Desorbable P, by both one and five Fe-strip extractions, was more closely correlated with Al-P than Fe-P, especially in setback areas, indicating that Al-P is probably the most important source of desorbable P independent of biosolids amendment. This work indicates the importance of considering P availability at agricultural biosolids application sites and of maintaining setback areas near water bodies, where no biosolids may be applied, to reduce the risk of P losses.

J	Gilley, JE; Risse, LM				Gilley, JE; Risse, LM			Runoff and soil loss as affected by the application of manure	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						animal waste; erosion; land application; manure application; runoff; runoff volume; soil loss	POULTRY LITTER; FEEDLOT MANURE; PHOSPHORUS; TILLAGE; FERTILIZER; MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN	Manure has been used effectively to improve crop production and soil properties because it contains nutrients and organic matter. While it is generally accepted that the improved soil properties associated with manure application lead to changes in runoff and soil erosion, few studies have quantified these impacts. Water quality models used to assess watershed management and estimate total maximum daily load must accurately predict loading rates from fields where manure has been applied. This study was conducted to assemble and summarize information quantifying the effects of manure application on runoff and soil loss resulting from natural precipitation events, and to develop regression equations relating runoff and soil loss to annual manure application rates, For selected locations at which manure was added annually, runoff was reduced from 2 to 62%, and soil loss decreased from 15 to 65% compared to non-manured sites. Measured runoff and soil loss values were reduced substantially as manure application rates increased. Regression equations were developed relating runoff and soil loss to manure application for rates ranging from 11 to 45 Mg ha(-1), and slope lengths varying from 21 to 24 m. The equations can be used in estimating environmental impacts or to account for manure applications in water quality modeling efforts.

J	Eshleman, KN				Eshleman, KN			A linear model of the effects of disturbance on dissolved nitrogen leakage from forested watersheds	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							LONG-TERM CHANGES; ECOSYSTEM; CLIMATE; ENGLAND; QUALITY; OREGON; STREAM	The leakage of dissolved nitrogen (N), primarily in the form of nitrate, from forested watersheds in the mid-Appalachian region has important water quality ramifications for small acid-sensitive streams and for downstream receiving waters such as Chesapeake Bay. Dissolved N leakage is a common, well-documented response of forested watersheds to forest management practices such as clear-cutting. Patterns of N leakage from mid-Appalachian watersheds during the late 1980s and early 1990s have also been shown to display considerable temporal and spatial synchrony with outbreaks of defoliation by the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) larva (a nonnative forest insect pest). This evidence suggests that forest disturbance may be an important contributor to N leakage in the mid-Appalachian region. A logical first step in testing this hypothesis is evaluating the ability of a simple, unit nitrogen export response function (UNERF) model to explain temporal changes in annual N export from gaged forested watersheds in the years following disturbance. Annual N export data from seven such watersheds were analyzed as part of the study: two small (<0.5 km(2)) watersheds subjected to deforestation and five larger (1.6-12.6 km(2)) watersheds subjected to repetitive defoliation by the gypsy moth larva. Several forms of linear UNERF models, parameterized by deconvolution of annual time series of N export using linear programming or by a least squares method, were generally found to be minimally biased and to explain high percentages (38-98%) of the total variation in annual N export. Despite their neglect of spatial and temporal ecosystem nonlinearities these linear models appear reasonably robust, making them at least as useful as their more complex nonlinear brethren for purposes of regionalization.

J	Olding, DD; Hellebust, JA; Douglas, MSV				Olding, DD; Hellebust, JA; Douglas, MSV			Phytoplankton community composition in relation to water quality and water-body morphometry in urban lakes, reservoirs, and ponds	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article							BLUE-GREEN-ALGAE; RIVER-FLOODPLAIN; BASIN ARGENTINA; FLORIDA LAKES; SHALLOW LAKES; PARANA RIVER; TIME SCALES; DOMINANCE; MECHANISMS; NUTRIENTS	Distinct differences in observed summer phytoplankton communities in relation to maximum depth suggest that constraints posed by water-body morphometry may modify the trophic control of phytoplankton-community composition and structure in urban water bodies. In deep urban sites (Z(max) greater than or equal to = 5 m), phytoplankton communities tended to be predictably related to trophic status (i.e., increases in trophy were associated with increased cyanobacterial dominance, a decreased proportion of Chrysophyceae-Synurophyceae and grazable-size algae, and a decrease in community richness), although exceptions existed, owing to factors such as human intervention, age of the water body, and flushing rates. In contrast, in shallow urban water bodies (Z(max) < 5 m), trophic status was a poor predictor of phytoplankton communities. Across meso- to hyper-eutrophic conditions, shallow urban sites were rarely dominated by cyanobacteria and, when they were, the species composition differed from nutrient-rich deep urban sites. The key requirement for cyanobacterial dominance in shallow urban sites appears to be sufficiently long water residence times, viz., greater than 8-14 days. Further study should describe how the relationship between water body residence time and species-generation time may limit the development of specific nuisance algal species, aiding in the management and rehabilitation of urban water bodies.

On the basis of observation data, calculation, and mathematical modeling, the peculiarities of current regimes and the regularities of turbulent mixing processes on the shallow areas of the reservoirs were found. The transformation of release waves from hydroelectric power stations were also calculated and the inner water exchange caused by currents and water level fluctuation under these power releases and its influence on organic matter balance (by BODtot) in the shallows were estimated. The influence of the large decrease of water levels in the reservoirs upon macrophyte function and water quality formation was also analysed. The role of wind waves for phytoplankton functioning is illustrated. The possibilities of hydrodynamics management in the Dnieper reservoirs are also discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Inoue, T; Yamamuro, M				Inoue, T; Yamamuro, M			Respiration and ingestion rates of the filter-feeding bivalve Musculista senhousia: implications for water-quality control	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						box model; Lake Nakaumi; Chl.a; respiration rate; ingestion rate; Asiatic mussel	MUSSEL	To evaluate the effect of filter-feeding bivalves on water quality, batch and now type measurements were recorded to estimate the respiration and ingestion rates of Musculista senhousia, which predominates the macrobenthos of Lake Nakaumi, Japan. The results for the respiration rate experiments had a low stable rate at about 15 mg O-2 day(-1) DFW g(-1) (where DFW means dry flesh weight) at low temperatures (between 5 degrees C and 10 degrees C) that increased at middle and high temperatures (from 10 degrees C to 30 degrees C), reaching a maximum rate of about 200 mg O-2 day(-1) DFN g(-1) at 30 degrees C. The dependence of respiration rate on temperature is significant, especially between 10 degrees C and 15 degrees C (Q(10) = 6.9). The vertical 2-BOX numerical model showed that continuous stratification of the water column must be averted if M, senhousia are to survive. Ingestion rate of particulate matter also increased with temperature between 10"C and 20 degrees C. Ingestion rates at 30 degrees C, after being incubated for more than 1 day, were almost the same as ingestion rates at 20 degrees C, Filtration rates were calculated from concentrations of chlorophyl a (Chl.a), particulate total phosphorus (PTP) and particulate total nitrogen (PTN). Obvious differences were observed between the filtration rate calculated from the Chl.a concentration compared to those from PTP and PTN. This may imply that M, senhousia selectively ingested a particular species of phytoplankton, The horizontal 2-BOX model showed a relationship between the Chl.a concentration in L. Nakaumi and the water exchange rate. The ingestion potential of organic matter by M. senhousia is greater than those of the nutrient loads in the field and has less risk of depleting dissolved oxygen (DO) in the bottom layer. If. therefore, the phosphorus and nitrogen supply to M, senhousia increased, and adult M, senhousia are collected and removed efficiently, water quality in L. Nakaumi would improve.

J	Nakamura, Y; Kerciku, F				Nakamura, Y; Kerciku, F			Effects of filter-feeding bivalves on the distribution of water quality and nutrient cycling in a eutrophic coastal lagoon	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						filter-feeding bivalve; estuarine lagoon; nutrient cycling; self-purification; benthic-pelagic coupling	PHYTOPLANKTON; LAKE; METABOLISM; DYNAMICS; JAPAN; CLAM; BAY	The horizontal variation of water quality was investigated through field surveys in a cross-section of Lake Shinji, the littoral region of which is densely populated by the filter-feeding bivalve, Corbicula japonica. The distributions of chlorophyll a (chl. a) and nutrients (NH4-N and PO4-P) in the lake are greatly affected by the filtration and excretion rates of C. japonica. Minimum values for chi. a and maximum values for nutrients were both found to occur in the littoral region during summer. Chi. a concentration peaked about 1 km from the shoreline, indicating that the presence of the bivalve not only reduces the biomass of phytoplankton in the near shore region through filtration, but also stimulates primary production further offshore by supplying nutrients through excretion. Calculated results of a mathematical model reproduced well the observed horizontal distributions of chi. a and nutrients, indicating that the interaction between the filter-feeding bivalve and phytoplankton populations dominates material cycling and water quality distribution in the lake. Water mass exchange between littoral and pelagic water enables the nutrient exchange between the bivalves in the benthic zone and the phytoplankton in the pelagic zone, thereby forming a benthic-pelagic zone coupling. Other related findings were that seasonal patterns of water quality variations in the north-south cross-section were affected by metabolic rates of C. japonica, and that differences in concentrations between pelagic and littoral regions are largest when water temperature is optimal for bivalve activity.

A model was constructed for the 1995-1986 water year and calibrated within +/- 3 percent of the observed mean concentration of total phosphorus. It was found that runoff from urban areas contributed most to the loading of phosphorus to the stream. When the model was assessed by running it for the 1977-1978 water year, using water quality and land use data collected independently, agreement within +/- 7 percent was obtained. The model was then used to forecast the impact of future urban development proposed for the watershed, in terms of phosphorus loading, and to evaluate the reduction in loading resulting from several urban best management practices (BMP). It was determined that phosphorus removal will have to be applied to all the urban runoff from the watershed to appreciably reduce stream phosphorus concentration. Of the BMP designs assessed, an infiltration pond system resulted in the greatest phosphorus load reduction, 50 percent from the 1995-1996 baseline.

In comparison to other nonpoint sources (e.g., row-cropped lands), relatively little information exists regarding possible magnitudes of nutrient losses from grazed pasture, how those losses are affected by management variables, and how the losses can be minimized. The objective of this study was to measure concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and solids in runoff from fescue plots and relate those measurements to simulated forage management strategy. The study was conducted at the University of Kentucky Maine Chance Agricultural Experiment Station north of Lexington. Plots (2.4 m wide by 6.1 m long) were constructed and established in Kentucky 31 fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) to represent pasture. The experimental treatments applied to the plots varied in terms of forage height and material applied (none, manure, or manure and urine). Runoff was sampled for six simulated rainfall events applied over the summer of 1997 and analyzed for nitrate N (NO3-N), ammonia N (NH3-N), total Kjeldahl N (TKN), ortho-P (PO4-P), total P (TP), and total suspended solids (TSS). All runoff constituents exhibited dependence on the date of simulated rainfall with generally higher concentrations measured when simulated rainfall followed relatively dry periods. The effects of forage height and manure addition were mixed. Highest runoff N concentrations were associated with the greatest forage heights, whereas highest P concentrations occurred for the least forage heights. Manure/urine addition increased runoff P concentrations relative to controls (no manure/urine) for both the greatest and least forage heights, but runoff N concentrations were increased only for the greatest forage heights. These findings indicate that runoff of N and P is at least as sensitive to amount and proximity of preceding rainfall and suggest that managing forage to stimulate growth and plant uptake can reduce runoff of N.

J	Schilling, KE; Thompson, CA				Schilling, KE; Thompson, CA			Walnut Creek Watershed Monitoring Project Iowa: Monitoring water quality in response to prairie restoration	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						watershed restoration; nonpoint source pollution; water quality; nitrate; atrazine		Land use and surface water data for nitrogen and pesticides (1995 to 1997) are reported for the Walnut Creek Watershed Monitoring Project, Jasper County Iowa. The Walnut Creek project was established in 1995 as a nonpoint source monitoring program in relation to watershed habitat restoration and agricultural management changes implemented at the Neal Smith National Wildlife Refuge by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The monitoring project utilizes a paired-watershed approach (Walnut and Squaw creeks) as well as upstream/downstream comparisons on Walnut for analysis and tracking of trends. From 1992 to 1997, 13.4 percent of the watershed was converted from row crop to native prairie in the Walnut Creek watershed. Including another 6 percent of watershed farmed on a cash-rent basis, land use changes have been implemented on 19.4 percent of the watershed by the, USFWS. Nitrogen and pesticide applications were reduced an estimated 18 percent and 28 percent in the watershed from land use changes. Atrazine was detected most often in surface water with frequencies of detection ranging from 76-86 percent. No significant differences were noted in atrazine concentrations between Walnut and Squaw Creek. Nitrate-N concentrations measured in both watersheds were similar; both basins showed a similar pattern of detection and an overall reduction in nitrate-N concentrations from upstream to downstream monitoring sites. Water quality improvements are suggested by nitrate-N and chloride ratios less than one in the Walnut Creek watershed and low nitrate-N concentrations measured in the subbasin of Walnut Creek containing the greatest amount of land use changes. Atrazine and nitrate-N concentrations from the lower portion of the Walnut Creek watershed (including the prairie restoration area) may be decreasing in relation to the upstream untreated component of the watershed. The frequencies of pesticide detections aha mean nitrate-N concentrations appear related to the percentage of row crop in the basins and subbasins. Although some results are encouraging, definitive water quality improvements have not been observed during the first three years of monitoring. Possible reasons include: (1) more time is needed to adequately detect changes; (2) the size of the watershed is too large to detect improvements; (3) land use changes are not located in the area of the watershed where they would have greatest effect; or (4) water quality improvements have occurred but have been missed by the project monitoring design. Longer-term monitoring will allow better evaluation of the impact of restoration activities on water quality.

The recommended and most often applied wet chemical digestion for TNb measurement, however, is discouragingly labour intensive. Therefore, high temperature (690 degrees) catalytic (Pt/Al2O3) combustion (HTC) was investigated for simultaneous determination of TOC and TNb. Using commercially available instruments a fast and simple procedure was established by coupling a TOC-analyzer to a chemiluminescence detector (CLD) for determination of NOx gases in the combustion exhaust. Dissolved compounds as well as particulate matter were used to test carrier gases, hot zone fillings and injection Volumes influencing N-recovery rates. Injecting dissolved wastewater components (e.g. ammonium, urea, antipyrine) direct onto the catalyst yielded low N-recovery rates (40-90%) depending on concentration. Instead of increasing the oven temperature the evaporation of injected sample solution was improved which resulted in quantitative recovery rates for all investigated compounds except hydrazine. A representative number of TNb Values from river and domestic wastewater obtained by HTC-CLD were compared to wet chemical digestion. No significant differences between the two methods were found.

The objective of this study was to develop a periphyton growth model and use it to identify critical factors in ecosystem phosphorus dynamics in pristine freshwater wetlands of Everglades National Park (ENP). We simulated changes in periphyton biomass under increased total phosphorus (TP) input for comparison to an ongoing manipulative field experiment. The field experiment analyzes the responses of periphyton, macrophytes, soils, and fauna to increased TP concentrations in replicated flow-through flume channels built within ENP. Both field and model experiments introduce TP enrichments of 5, 15, and 30 mu g l(-1) above ambient concentrations (typically 5-10 mu g l(-1)). The model domain was an individual flume channel (3 m wide x 85 m long) with incident light, water temperature, and volume flux at the head as forcing functions. Base case model periphyton biomass increased with incoming TP during the wet season (June-November) and reached a maximum of 70 g C m(-2) in late August. There was strong evidence of P-limited primary production as water column TP accounted for 95.5% of the variability in average daily carbon biomass. In addition to positive responses in biomass, water column TP and net production also increased under increased TP input. TP enrichment led to lower recycling within and increased export from the model flume channel. Although our simplified model was not structured to simulate shifts in periphyton composition frequently observed as a consequence of P enrichment, the processes and ramifications of community structure are complicated and are not well understood. We suggest a two or more component formulation that can account for a continuum of oligotrophic to eutrophic conditions in order to model periphyton biogeochemical relationships in the Everglades. Refined versions of this model will be used to better simulate observed changes during the course of the field experiment in order to generate new hypotheses for further investigations.

The methods of measuring soil hydraulic properties by conventional methods do not distinguish between the soil matrix and macropores that may be present in the sampled soil. The objective of this work is to evaluate a two-domain model of infiltration using the conventionally measured soil hydraulic properties considered as soil matrix properties, supplemented by macropore How capacity measured with a tension infiltrometer. To determine the soil hydraulic characteristics a two step method was used, using field data from an infiltration redistribution experiment and running the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) in the inverse mode. The results indicate that there is the need to develop a new technique to determine appropriate soil matrix and macropore properties in macroporous field soils. The hydraulic properties determined by conventional methods are apparently the properties of soil matrix, but seem to miss the effect of larger pores that are below the 1.0 mm diameter assumed to be the lower limit for macropores. The macropore properties determined with a tension infiltrometer apparently do not distinguish between continuous and dead-end macropores, and do not give any indication about the continuity of macropores with depth.

J	Muhammetoglu, AB; Soyupak, S				Muhammetoglu, AB; Soyupak, S			A three-dimensional water quality-macrophyte interaction model for shallow lakes	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						macrophyte; dissolved oxygen; water quality model; shallow lakes; Mogan Lake	AQUATIC MACROPHYTES; BIOMASS; GROWTH; EUTROPHICATION; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; COMMUNITIES; STRATEGIES; PREDICTION; RESERVOIR; DEPTH	A dynamic three-dimensional water quality model for macrophyte-dominated shallow lakes was proposed and tested. The proposed model is capable of simulating macrophytes and its interactions with water quality constituents such as dissolved oxygen (DO), organic nitrogen, ammonia, nitrate, organic phosphorus, orthophosphate, biochemical oxygen demand, phytoplankton and the sediment layer in shallow lakes. An existing two-dimensional hydrodynamic model has been utilized in conjunction with the water quality model to simulate water levels, velocities and flow rates. The modelled macrophyte processes are photosynthesis, respiration, mortality and excretion. Hourly simulation of photosynthesis process has been realized. The hourly simulations need special attention to predict diurnal variations of DO in macrophyte dominated lakes. The proposed water quality simulation model was subjected to calibration, verification and prediction processes using the data collected from Mogan Lake, Turkey. Mogan Lake exhibits wide variations of macrophyte biomass seasonally. The lake also exhibits highly variable DO levels both seasonally and diurnally. Statistical error quantification methods have been utilized to test the goodness of fit between the water quality model predictions and field measurements. Good agreement has been achieved between model predictions and measurements. Moreover, uncertainty analysis has been carried out for macrophyte and DO constituents. The analysis showed that the magnitude of the saturated growth rate of macrophyte is the most sensitive model parameter both for macrophyte and DO. The proposed water quality simulation model gave some promising initial results as a management tool to predict the expected reductions for the undesired consequences of eutrophication problem.

J	Mankin, KR				Mankin, KR			An integrated approach for modelling and managing golf course water quality and ecosystem diversity	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						ecosystem health; birds; fish; USLE		Models can help planners assess the potential impacts of planned land development. However, pollutant yield results from common watershed water quality models are inadequate and must be coupled with other important ecosystem component models to assess the overall impact of land development and management. For example, golf course development typically replaces agricultural or native lands with intensively managed grassland with potential impacts on water quality, as well as avian and aquatic species habitat. An integrated modelling concept was demonstrated using readily available models and data for a hypothetical golf course within the Little Kitten Creek Watershed near Manhattan, KS, USA. A watershed water quality model (EUTROMOD) combined with local fish habitation data and habitat suitability index modelling was used to simulate the overall ecosystem impact of projected golf course design and management actions. Models were calibrated using data for grass and native prairie conditions, and future scenarios were simulated to guide design and management actions. Compared with the native conditions, good golf course management was simulated to increase annual nitrogen (N) yield by 148% and phospohorus (P) yield by 24% with little impact on runoff or erosion, while a poor management scenario increased the N yield by 380%. This change in aquatic nutrient levels along with concurrent projected changes in stream habitat led to a potential impact on three of four fish species analyzed. Avain habitat was also impacted depending upon design and management of non-playing area. An overall design and management plan was developed with the goal of maintaining predevelopment levels of water quality and habitat. Sustainable water quality management must include proper soil and water conservation, irrigation scheduling, and fertilizer and pesticide management. Appropriate features must be designed into numerous contiguous area (1.2 ha minimum for grassland and 0.8 ha minimum for woodland) of non-playing area trough, riparian area, etc.) to meet avian habitat needs. And a diversity of stream habitat conditions must be maintained, including clear pool and gravel-substrate riffle zones, and permanent and intermittent streams. This integrated modelling approach demonstrated the utility of a simplistic framework for analyzing and assessing ecosystem impacts of land development. Further work should integrate and test more complex models and interrelationships between models for lands undergoing a variety of ecosystem changes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the process, numerous engineering and economic spreadsheets (worksheets) have been developed to assist in the design and analysis of these systems. The spreadsheet described in this paper is based on a set of mass balance equations developed and described by Losordo and Westers. Aquaculture Water Reuse Systems: Engineering Design acid Management. Developments in Aquaculture and Fisheries Sciences vol. 27, 1994, pp. 9-60) to estimate the carrying capacity and required flow rates of recirculating aquaculture production systems. This spreadsheet can be used to estimate the recycle flowrate that is required to maintain user specified water quality conditions for a given feed input rate and water treatment system configuration. These water quality conditions include suspended solids, total ammonia-nitrogen, and dissolved oxygen concentration. The spreadsheet also provides an estimate of the new water required by the system to maintain a user specified nitrate-nitrogen concentration. In addition, the spreadsheet provides an estimate of the required biofilter volume and cross-sectional (top) surface area for the given biofilter shape, depth and specific surface area of the biofilter media. The mass balance equations used in this spreadsheet are based upon waste metabolites generated and oxygen consumed by daily inputs of feed into a system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The possibility to observe various ocean parameters and processes by existing satellite sensors, such as optical instruments, infrared radiometers, passive microwave radiometers, and active microwave systems (altimeter, scatterometer, SAR) is discussed. The basic parameters are: sea-surface temperature observed by infrared radiometers, ocean colour by spectrometers, sea-surface elevation by altimeters, and surface roughness by active and passive microwave systems, which can be used to derive surface wind and waves. A number of ocean processes can be derived from synaptic mapping of the basic parameters of larger sea areas, such as current patterns, fronts, eddies, water mass distribution, and various water quality parameters (chlorophyll, surface slicks, suspended sediments). The suitability of existing satellite data to fulfil the operational requirements for temporal and spatial coverage, data delivery in near-real-time, and long-term access to data is discussed in light of the fact that optical/infrared data in northern Europe are severely hampered by frequent cloud cover, while microwave techniques can provide useful data independent of weather and light conditions. Finally, the use of data assimilation in oceanographic models is briefly summarised, indicating that this technique is under development and will soon be adopted in operational oceanography.

J	Lamon, EC; Clyde, MA				Lamon, EC; Clyde, MA			Accounting for model uncertainty in prediction of chlorophyll a in Lake Okeechobee	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS			English	Article						algal blooms; Bayesian model averaging; Gibbs sampler; semiparametric regression; variable selection	BAYESIAN VARIABLE SELECTION; SIGMOID RELATIONSHIPS; FLORIDA	Long-term eutrophication data along with water quality measurements (total phosphorous and total nitrogen) and other physical environmental factors such as lake level (stage), water temperature, wind speed, and direction were used to develop a model to predict chlorophyll a concentrations in Lake Okeechobee. The semiparametric model included each of the potential explanatory variables as linear predictors, regression spline predictors, or product spline interactions allowing for nonlinear relationships. A Gibbs sampler was used to traverse the model space. Predictions that incorporate uncertainty about inclusion of variables and their functional forms were obtained using Bayesian model averaging (BMA) over the sampled models. Semiparametric regression with Bayesian model averaging and spline interactions provides a flexible framework for addressing the problems of nonlinearity and counterintuitive total phosphorus function estimates identified in previous statistical models. The use of regression splines allows nonlinear effects to be manifest, while their extension allows inclusion of interactions for which the mathematical form cannot be specified a priori. Prediction intervals under BMA provided better coverage for new observations than confidence intervals for ordinary least squares models obtained using backwards selection. Also, BMA was more efficient than ordinary least squares in terms of predictive mean squared error for overall lake predictions.

Application of an optimization model to evaluate alternatives to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus mass balance	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						linear programming; mass nutrient balance; Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System; optimization	DIGESTION KINETICS; FORAGE QUALITY; DAIRY FARMS; MANAGEMENT; MATURITY; ALFALFA; COWS	The objectives of this paper were to use a linear programming model previously described to evaluate different alternatives for reducing excess nutrients that may influence water quality on a case study farm (300 lactating cows on 430 ha of cropland growing alfalfa, grass, and corn). Several alternatives perceived to influence farm nutrient balance were evaluated for their potential to reduce N and P mass balance. Dividing lactating cow diets into three groups according to their level of milk production versus a one-group total mixed ration decreased mass balance (tonne/yr) from 51.7 to 44.7 for N, from 6.7 to 6.1 for P and from 16.2 to 14.8 for K with little influence on return over feed costs. Increasing forage quality (lower neutral detergent fiber and higher crude protein) did not improve N balance because of the increased N fixation from the air to the soil, but it increased returns over feed costs by $31,385. Improving yields to the maximum potential for the farm reduced mass balance by 29, 51, and 100% for N, P, and K, respectively, and increased returns over feed costs by $70,579. Changing the crop hectare proportions to more corn and less alfalfa reduced N and K balances by 19 and 29%, respectively, and increased returns over feed costs $39,383. Increasing annual milk production 10% by increasing milk production per head 10% compared with increasing animal numbers at the current average milk production per cow until total milk increased 10% gave $34,132 more return over feed costs with less N, P, and K retained on the farm.

J	Spruill, TB				Spruill, TB			Statistical evaluation of effects of riparian buffers on nitrate and ground water quality	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							AGRICULTURAL WATERSHEDS; NORTH-CAROLINA; COASTAL-PLAIN; SURFACE-WATER; STREAM; DENITRIFICATION; DYNAMICS	A study was conducted to statistically evaluate the effectiveness of riparian buffers for decreasing nitrate concentrations in ground water and for affecting other chemical constituents. Values for pH, specific conductance, alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), silica, ammonium, phosphorus, iron, and manganese at 28 sites in the Contentnea Creek Basin were significantly higher (p < 0.10) in old (>20 yr) discharging ground water draining areas with riparian buffers compared with areas without riparian buffers. No differences in chloride, nitrate nitrogen, calcium, sodium, and dissolved oxygen concentrations in old ground water between buffer and nonbuffer areas were detected. Comparison of samples of young (<20 yr) discharging ground water samples from buffer and nonbuffer areas indicated significantly higher specific conductance, calcium, chloride, and nitrate nitrogen in nonbuffer areas. Riparian buffers along streams can affect the composition of the hyporheic zone by providing a source of organic carbon to the streambed, which creates reducing geochemical conditions that consequently can affect the chemical quality of old ground water discharging through it. Buffer zones between agricultural fields and streams facilitate dilution of conservative chemical constituents in young ground water that originate from fertilizer applications and also allow denitrification in ground water by providing an adequate source of organic carbon generated by vegetation in the buffer zone. Based on the median chloride and nitrate values for young ground water in the Contentnea Creek Basin, nitrate was 95% lower in buffer areas compared with nonbuffer areas, with a 30 to 35% reduction estimated to be due to dilution and 65 to 70% due to reduction and/or denitrification.

The ADAPT model, a daily time-step continuous water table management model, was calibrated and validated for tile drainage and associated NO3-N losses using long-term monitoring data measured on three experimental plots of a Webster clay loam (fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Endoaquoll) under continuous corn (Zea mays L.) with conventional tillage treatment. For the calibration period, the model predicted mean monthly tile drainage and NO3-N losses of 4.6 cm and 6.7 kg ha(-1), respectively, against measured tile drainage and NO3-N losses of 4.6 rm and 6.9 kg ha(-1), respectively. For the validation period, the predicted mean monthly tile drainage and NO3-N losses were 4.0 cm and 6.1 kg ha(-1), respectively, against measured tile drainage and NO3-N losses of 3.7 cm and 6.5 kg ha(-1), respectively. Long-term simulations were made for a wide range of climatic conditions between 1915 and 1996 to evaluate the effect of drain sparing, drain depth, and N application rates on tile drainage and NO3-N losses. Simulation results indicate that much greater reductions in NO3-N losses occur with reduced N application rates than with increases in drain spacing or decreases in drain depth.

J	Cox, FR; Hendricks, SE				Cox, FR; Hendricks, SE			Soil test phosphorus and clay content effects on runoff water quality	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article								Dissolved phosphorus (P) in runoff increases with an increase in soil test P, but slopes found for this relationship vary by an order of magnitude. A difference in clay content contributes to this variation. Experiments were conducted on Ultisols of 5 and 32% clay by incorporating poultry (Gallus gallus domesticus) litter and triple superphosphate (TSP) to create a wide range in Mehlich 3-extractable phosphorus (M3P). Mehlich 3 P increased similarly for the two sources with rate of P applied, but the increase was greater as clay content decreased. Total P in runoff was measured and it was related primarily to the quantity of sediment. Dissolved P (mg L-1) was measured with simulated rainfall and it increased with an increase in M3P (mg dm(-3) in the surface 15-20 cm of soil). The slope of dissolved P versus M3P was 0.0040 for the 5% clay soil and 0.0014 for the 32% clay soil. With these relationships, M3P would need to be 250 mg dm-3 at 5% clay and 714 mg dm(-3) at 32% clay to result in 1.0 mg L-1 dissolved P in runoff, Dissolved P in samples of runoff collected from natural rainfall with automatic samplers was substantially less than that with simulated rainfall. Thus, there was a marked difference due to method of measurement as well as the difference noted due to clay content. Both factors should be considered if attempting to predict the level of dissolved P in runoff from soil test data.

We conducted a study to measure NO3-N leaching from dairy slurry applied to orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L., cv. Pennlate) using large drainage lysimeters to measure the direct impact of four rates of slurry (urine and faeces) N application (0, 168, 336, 672 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1)) on NO3-N leaching on three soil types. We then used experimentally-based relationships developed earlier between stocking density and NO3-N leaching loss and leachate NO3-N concentration to estimate the added impact of animal grazing. Nitrate N leaching losses from only dairy slurry applied at the 0, 158, 336, and 672 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) rates were 5.85, 8.26, 8.83, and 12.1 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively with corresponding NO3-N concentrations of 1.60, 2.30, 2.46, and 3.48 mg l(-1). These NO3-N concentrations met the 10 mg l(-1) US EPA drinking water standard. However, when a scenario was constructed to include the effect of NO3-N leaching caused by animal grazing, the NO3-N drinking water standard was calculated to be exceeded.

This study was conducted to assess the effect of dairy production on water quality within Upper North Bosque River Watershed (UNBRW) of north central Texas. The UNBRW encompasses an area of approximately 93 250 ha and included 94 dairies at the time of the study. A river basin model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool, SWAT) was applied in two phases. During the first phase, SWAT was validated for the baseline condition within UNBRW The baseline condition within UNBRW was simulated from 1988 through 1996; model output was compared to flow sediment, and nutrient measurements for 11 stream sites within the watershed for the period of October 1993 to July 1995 for SWAT model validation. The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient evaluating model efficiency of SWAT for predicting average monthly flow sediment, and nutrient loading (organic-N, NO3-N, organic-P and PO4-P) at 11 stream sites over the validation period ranged from 0.65 to 0.99, indicating reasonable predicted values. SWAT also adequately predicted monthly trends in average daily flow sediment, and nutrient loading over the validation period with Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients ranging from 0.54 to 0.94 except for NO3-N which had a value of 0.27. Nutrient loadings were consistently highest in the subwatersheds with the most dairies operations. In phase two, to evaluate the effect of dairies, SWAT was executed by replacing the manure waste application fields with grassland. The results from this phase of study indicate that loading from the watershed could be reduced about 33% for total-N (organic-N plus NO3-N) and 79% for total-P (organic-P plus PO4-P) in the UNBRW if dairy waste application fields were replaced by grassland. Empirical equations based on the output with and without dairy loading were developed to illustrate the impact of cow density and percent area covered by dairy waste application fields on sediment and nutrient loading.

J	Kranz, WL; Kanwar, RS				Kranz, WL; Kanwar, RS			Impact of tillage and tracer application method on spatial distribution of leaching losses	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						nitrate leaching; fiberglass wicks; preferential flow; monoliths	NO-TILL; PREFERENTIAL FLOW; SOLUTE TRANSPORT; RIDGE-TILLAGE; WATER-QUALITY; SOIL; MACROPORES; NITRATE; INFILTRATION; LYSIMETERS	The impact of tillage and nitrogen (N) application method on the spatial variation on leaching losses was evaluated using eight, 1-m(3) undisturbed soil monoliths. Monoliths were collected in 1992 from research plots with 15 years of continuous tillage and crop rotation history. Tillage practices imposed in the field were moldboard plow, chisel, or ridge tillage. Anion tracers were applied to simulate applying N as a surface broadcast, in a slot with surface compaction, and with water: A rainfall simulator was used to apply 100 mm of water followed 24 h later by an additional application of 430 mm to establish tracer concentrations over a range of drainage. Drainage was collected at the bottom of each monolith using fiberglass wick extractors placed in a 6 x 6 grid of 90 mm x 90 mm cells. Tracer leaching losses and flow-weighted concentrations were calculated from the initial flush of water through 24 h after water application. No significant differences were noted for cumulative drainage distribution curves or for the depth of drainage produced (p < 0.05). However in all cases, the cumulative distribution curves were above the I:I line, indicating that drainage from some cells was greater than others. Spatial analysis indicated that drainage was randomly distributed across the monolith. Tracer leaching losses were not significantly different among tillage treatments or tracer application methods for either water application event. However results for the slot with surface compaction treatment suggest that 10 times more NO3-N from moldboard plow treatment in comparison with the ridge tillage treatment. Trends in leaching losses for the SLOT (Br) with surface compaction treatment suggested that a tracer leaching pattern existed directly below the application zone. Tracer concentrations peaked above 350 mg L-1 after 100 to 170 mm of drainage for the SLOT (Br) with surface compaction application method and final concentrations remained above 70 mg L-1. Peak concentrations for the surface broadcast (BROAD) and with water application (WATER) methods peaked at less than 110 mg L-1 and were consistent among monoliths. Spatial analysis indicated that leaching losses were randomly distributed. Data supported an assertion that the moldboard plow tillage treatment combined with the slot with surface compaction (SLOT) application of N should be avoided.

J	Glasgow, HB; Burkholder, JM				Glasgow, HB; Burkholder, JM			Water quality trends and management implications from a five-year study of a eutrophic estuary	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Review						Albemarle-Pamlico ecosystem; North Carolina; algal bloom; chlorophyll; estuary; fish kills; hypoxia; Neuse River and Estuary; nitrogen; phosphorus; river; suspended solids; toxic Pfiesteria complex	NEUSE RIVER ESTUARY; NORTH-CAROLINA; FISH KILLS; NUTRIENT LIMITATION; CHESAPEAKE BAY; ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS; DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS; SHALLOW ESTUARIES; COASTAL-PLAIN; PHYTOPLANKTON	The Neuse River and Estuary, a major tributary of the second largest estuary on the United States mainland, historically has sustained excessive blooms of algae and toxic dinoflagellates, hypoxia, and fish kills. Previous attempts have been made to use shortterm databases of 2-3 years, or data sets from infrequent (monthly) sampling, to assess whether nutrient inputs to the Neuse are increasing and supporting higher algal production. These previous efforts also have relied on single-point-determined flow velocity data, at upstream sites remote from the estuary, to estimate the volume of how in quantifying nutrient loading to the estuary. We completed a five-year study of the Neuse, including a comparative inventory of nutrients to the watershed from point sources and from concentrated animal operations (CAOs) as recent nonpoint sources, as well as an intensive assessment of water quality over time in the mesohaline estuary. Estimates of nutrient loads were based on volume of flow data from shore-to-shore transect cross sections, taken with a boat-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler at the westernmost edge of the estuary. A total of 441 point dischargers contributed at least 3.34 x 10(8) L effluent/d to the Neuse system, much of which came from municipal wastewater treatment giants (2.03 x 10(8) L effluent/d, excluding periods of plant malfunctions; total annual loadings of at least 9 x 10(5) kg P and 2.1 x 10(6) kg N, with a 17% increase in human population over the past decade). The Neuse basin also included 554 CAOs, with 76% in swine production (1.7 x 10(6) animals, from a 285% increase in the past decade) and 23% in poultry (5.5 x 10(5) animals). An estimated 5.9 x 10(9) kg manure produced by swine and poultry during 1998 contributed similar to 4.1 x 10(7) kg N and 1.4 x 10(7) kg P to the Neuse watershed. About 20% of the area in the watershed now has enough manure from CAOs to exceed the P requirements of all nonlegume crops and forages. About two-thirds of the N- and P-rich feeds for these animals are imported (with 4.0 x 10(7) kg N and 1.6 x 10(7) kg P in 1998); thus, the watershed increasingly has become a nutrient sink. Over the five-year study in the Neuse Estuary study area, P loading significantly declined (by an estimated 14%), whereas TN (total nitrogen) loading significantly increased (by an average of 16%) and TNi (total inorganic nitrogen) increased by similar to 38%. The increased inorganic N (N-i), partly related to severe storms with high precipitation in years 4-5, coincided with a decrease in phytoplankton biomass (as chlorophyll a) that likely reflected displacement/washout of algal populations and cysts. Thus, while both N and P supplies have increased in the watershed, there is evidence for a significant increase in N-i loading but, as yet, no apparent signal for increased P in the lower estuary. Weather patterns ultimately control when/whether the elevated Ni supply will support increased algal production, so that estuarine algal blooms, hypoxia, and fish kills will remain difficult, at best, to predict in modeling efforts. We recommend that decadal data sets, with sufficient sampling frequency to capture nutrient loadings from major storm events, be used to assess fluctuations in algal production of lower rivers and estuaries, and relationships with changing nutrient inputs. Given increased N and P supplies in the Neuse watershed from ongoing growth of both human and swine populations, a current management goal of 30% N reduction should be altered to include increased focus on Ni and strengthened comanagement of P As for estuaries in other regions, nutrient reduction goals should be interpreted as "moving targets" that likely will have to be substantially adjusted upward, over time, to accomplish noticeable reductions in algal blooms, hypoxia, and fish kills in the lower Neuse River and Estuary.

J	Basnyat, P; Teeter, L; Lockaby, BG; Flynn, KM				Basnyat, P; Teeter, L; Lockaby, BG; Flynn, KM			Land use characteristics and water quality: A methodology for valuing of forested buffers	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						water quality; economic model; replacement cost; contributing zone	RIPARIAN FOREST; PHOSPHORUS; POLLUTION; RECREATION; DRAINAGE; VALUES; MODEL	Changes in land use/land cover, the intensity of agricultural lands management, and other activities within a basin area often result in water quality problems. Most of the time the pollutants are from nonpoint sources (NPS), which by their nature are diffuse. Centralized water treatment systems are often not economically feasible to mitigate such problems, nor are they environmentally desirable. In these situations, the role of forested stream buffers in NPS pollution assimilation becomes important. The main objectives of this paper are to present a method for assessing the extent of potential water quality improvements available through land management options and to identify the potential costs of reaching defined water quality objectives. In this study, water quality and basin characteristics data from different basins of the Fish River basin, Baldwin County, Alabama, were used to develop a valuation model. This valuation model is based on the effectiveness of "contributing zones" identified and delineated using methods described by Basnyat and others (Environmental Management[l999] 23(4):539-549). The "contributing zone" delineation model suggests that depending on soil permeability, soil moisture, depth to water table, slope, and vegetation, buffer widths varying from 16 m to 104 m must be maintained to assimilate or detain more than 90% of the nitrate passing through the buffers. The economic model suggests the value of retiring lands (to create the buffers) varies from $0 to $3067 per ha, depending on the types of crops currently grown. The total value of retiring all areas identified by the contributing zone model is $1,125,639 for the study area. This land value will then form the basis for estimates of the costs of land management options for improving (or maintaining) water quality throughout the study area.

J	Edwards, DR; Larson, BT; Lim, TT				Edwards, DR; Larson, BT; Lim, TT			Runoff nutrient and fecal coliform content from cattle manure application to fescue plots	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						grazing; runoff; nutrients; fecal coliform	4 GRAZING STRATEGIES; WATER-QUALITY; SURFACE RUNOFF; PASTURE; BACTERIA; SOIL; TRANSPORT; RESPONSES; EROSION; RANGE	Grazed pastures represent a potential source of nonpoint pollution. In comparison to other nonpoint sources (e.g., row-cropped lands), relatively little information exists regarding possible magnitudes of pollution from grazed pasture; how that pollution is affected by weather, soil, management and other variables; and how the pollution can be minimized. The objective of this study was to assess how the quality of runoff from fescue plots is influenced by duration of cattle manure application (4-12 weeks) and manure application strategy (none, weekly application of 1.4 kg/plot, and monthly application at 5.6 kg/plot). Additional analyses were performed to relate runoff quality to the timing of sample collection. The study was conducted at the University of Kentucky Maine Chance Agricultural Experiment Station north of Lexington. Plots (2.4 m wide by 6.1 m long) were constructed and established in Kentucky 31 fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) to represent pasture. Grazing was simulated by application of beef cattle manure to the plots. Runoff was generated by applying simulated rainfall approximately 4, 8 and 12 weeks following initiation of manure application. Runoff samples were collected and analyzed according to standard methods for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and fecal coliforms (FC). Runoff concentrations of N and P from manure-treated plots were low and generally not consistently different from control plot concentrations or related to manure application strategy. Runoff FC concentrations from manure-treated plots were higher than from control plot concentrations. Runoff concentrations of ammonia N, total Kjeldahl N, ortho-P and FC decreased approximately exponentially in response to increasing time of sample collection. These findings suggest that manure deposition on well-managed pasture at the rates used in this study might have a negligible impact on nutrient content of runoff.

Flow-weighted concentrations during 1990-1995 were generally low with median basin concentrations of 0.020, 0.087, 0.26, 0.010, and 0.022 milligrams per liter (mg/L) for ammonia as N, nitrate as N, total nitrogen, orthophosphate as P, and total phosphorus, respectively. The flow-weighted concentration of nitrate exceeded 0.6 mg/L in only three basins. Total nitrogen exceeded 1 mg/L in only four basins, and total phosphorus exceeded 0.1 mg/L in only four basins. The median annual basin yield of ammonia as N, nitrate as N, total nitrogen, orthophosphate as P, and total phosphorus was 8.1, 26, 86, 2.8, and 8.5 kilograms per square kilometer, respectively. Concentrations and yields of nitrate tended to be highest in northeastern and mid-Atlantic coastal states and correlated well with areas of high atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Concentrations and yields of total nitrogen were highest in the southeastern part of the nation and in parts of the upper Midwest. In the northeast, nitrate was generally the predominant form of nitrogen, and in the southeast and parts of the upper Midwest, organic nitrogen was the dominant form. Concentrations of total phosphorus were generally highest in the Rocky Mountain and Central Plain states.

J	Mukhopadhyay, B; Smith, EH				Mukhopadhyay, B; Smith, EH			Comparison of statistical methods for estimation of nutrient load to surface reservoirs for sparse data set: Application with a modified model for phosphorus availability	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						phosphorus; pollutant loading; reservoir modeling; sediments; statistics; water quality; Whitney Reservoir	LAKE; IRON; MANGANESE	Nutrient budget models for lakes and reservoirs critically respond to the input pollutant loading, yet little consensus exists on how to estimate the load, particularly for the common but challenging case of sparse nutrient concentration measurements and abundant input flow data. A statistical load calculation using cluster (in this case, annual) mean concentration and stratified (monthly) flow was compared to estimates by sample mean and ratio estimator methods for phosphorus loading to Whitney Reservoir in North Central Texas. The results varied considerably for the various estimator methods during the six-year study period with the cluster and stratified mean approach estimating extreme high loading periods not captured by the other methods. The variable loading patterns were then tested in phosphorus budget model simulations for Whitney Reservoir that considered vertical stratification of the water column, water-sediment phosphorus interaction, and seasonal variations in water quality. For independently determined settling,interlayer dispersion, recycling rates, and sediment burial rates estimated for the respective loading calculation, the cluster and stratified mean loading pattern provided a batter statistical fit of phosphorus concentration measurements in the epilimnion than when ratio estimator load calculations were used. The two loading functions described hypolimnion concentration data equally well. The lesson of this exercise is that various methods of load estimation should be examined in order to develop as reliable a management model as possible when only a sparse data set is available for calibration.

J	Lefebvre, S; Barille, L; Clerc, M				Lefebvre, S; Barille, L; Clerc, M			Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) feeding responses to a fish-farm effluent	AQUACULTURE			English	Article						oyster; fish-faeces; integrated aquaculture; biological treatment; nutrition	WATER-QUALITY CONDITIONS; THUNBERG; AQUACULTURE; ABSORPTION; SELECTION; BIVALVES; CULTURE; POND; TEMPERATURE; CLEARANCE	Bivalves have often been used in integrated fish-farming to enhance the economical value of by-products and/or to improve water quality. However, no physiological studies have dealt with the contribution of the two main sources of organic matter potentially present in a fish-farm effluent: living cells of phytoplankton and detritical matter (fish-faeces and uneaten feed). This study evaluated feeding responses of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) to a land-based fish-farm effluent comprised mainly of fish-faeces (Dicentrarchus labrax) and compared them with those obtained with a diatom (Skeletonema costatum). A particular distinction of the main sources of organic matter was made in the experiments, the two diets being evaluated separately and mixed. Feeding responses were evaluated using the biodeposit method with special attention being paid to pre-ingestive processes and absorption efficiency (AE). Experiments were carried out between May and July 1998 in the laboratory at constant water temperature (20 degrees C), Results showed that food quality (nature of particulate organic matter, POM, organic content of the total suspended matter, TSM) had no influence on clearance rates. However, clearance rates were significantly reduced for oysters in advanced stage of gametogenesis. S, costatum was preferentially ingested compared to the fish-faeces when offered in a mixed diet. Absorption efficiency and energy content (56% and 15 J mg(-1), respectively) of the fish-faeces were lower than those estimated for S. costatum (66-70%, 20 J mg(-1)). Nevertheless, these values were high for such a detritic type of food. This study confirms that both concepts of biomechanical filter and economical value improvement of fish-farming waste using oysters are of interest.

J	Li, MB; Yost, RS				Li, MB; Yost, RS			Management-oriented modeling: optimizing nitrogen management with artificial intelligence	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						nitrogen optimization; artificial intelligence; heuristic searching; simulation; water quality; nitrogen use efficiency		Increasing nitrate levels in groundwater have been attributed to inappropriate nitrogen (N) management. The application rates, timing, and methods of both N fertilization and irrigation are important management tools that determine and control the fate and behavior of N in soil-plant systems. For example, multiple applications with small amounts of fertilizer (e.g. split application) usually enhance plant uptake and reduce potential nitrate leaching, although increasing costs. Precision N management requires that the models evaluate so many alternatives that traditional N models are challenged beyond their intended use. The objective of this study was to construct and test a model that searches for optimal N management to: (1) minimize nitrate leaching; (2) maximize production; and (3) maximize profits. Management-oriented modeling (MOM), a dynamic simulation modeling with artificial intelligence optimization techniques, was developed for these purposes. MOM consists of a generator that generates a set of plausible management alternatives, a simulator that evaluates each alternative, and an evaluator that determines which alternative meets the user-weighted multiple criteria. MOM uses 'hill-climbing' as a strategic search method that uses 'best-first' as a tactical search method to find the shortest path from start nodes to goals, In a maize production scenario, MOM found an optimal management solution that would have increased the profit from $570 to $935 ha(-1) and reduced the nitrate leaching from 36 to 7 kg N ha(-1). Goal-driven simulation of MOM offers new opportunities to balance N and irrigation water management while meeting multiple objectives. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate) model was used to simulate cropping systems in the Trinity River Basin in Texas for 12 eight-digit hydrologic unit areas (HUA) using combinations of 29 soil series, 9 crops, and 3 tillage technologies. The study utilizes an indexing method to facilitate communicating the relative impacts of soils, crops, tillage, and management practices on the following agro-environmental indicators of water quality: (1) surface water runoff, (2) soil erosion, (3) nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) loss in runoff, (4) phosphorous (P) loss in runoff, (5) NO3-N loss in sediment, (6) P loss in sediment, and (7) NO3-N leaching loss. A frequency analysis was also conducted to provide an overview of the impacts; indicated by averaging broad groupings of precipitation, soil types by percent clay, percent slope, tillage practices, and crop rotations produced. When grouped by soil type, high clay content soils on average minimized NO3-N leaching of all soil types. In contrast, clay and loam soils increased runoff over sandy soils. Additionally, clay and loam soils lost more NO3-N and P in runoff as well as in sediment than sandy soils. With respect to tillage practice, no-till and reduced using no-till and reduced erosion compared with conventional tillage practices. NO3-N and P losses in sediment were reduced using no-till and reduced tillage, but the NO3-N and P losses in runoff were not particularly affected, on average, by tillage practice. With regard to crop selection and rotation, the degree of agro-environmental impact from nutrient losses was largely correlated with the applications of N and P. Though the simulation results largely agreed with previous experiences of agricultural researchers, the ultimate implication of this study is that creating indices for a multitude of comparisons of simulated water quality or other environmental impacts in complex agricultural systems can be communicated and summarized with a high degree of specificity. However, indexing simulation results for comparitive analyses was less than satisfactory, on occasion, when an index value was very large usually caused by a small value for the baseline crop. In many cases, the impact of the alternative would not be considered as extreme, though the large index value might imply the agro-environmental impact to be severe. The major advantage of indexing is the case of communicating diverse results in an uncomplicated manner. Thus, indexing provides a means of communicating water quality impacts of complex production elements in agriculture to citizens policy makers, and other decision-makers not familiar with them.

Stratigraphic analysis of fossil diatoms in Pb-210-dated cores and inferences of past total phosphorus concentrations using diatom-based models were used to reconstruct the nutrient histories of Takysie, Tchesinkut, Francois, and Tyhee lakes. Diatom microfossils indicate that these lakes are probably naturally productive, but some nutrient enrichment has likely occurred in response to human development (since A.D. 1850), particularly in Tyhee Lake. However, in Tchesinkut and Francois lakes, some reduction in total phosphorus may have occurred in recent decades. Takysie, Tchesinkut, and Francois lakes have been dominated by planktonic diatoms indicative of high productivity (e.g., Stephanodiscus, Asterionella, Fragilaria crotonensis, Aulacoseira). Tyhee Lake has been dominated by benthic Fragilaria species, but Stephanodiscus minutulus has increased in recent decades. These data were pooled with previously published paleolimnological data from British Columbia to summarize cultural eutrophication patterns in this region. Out of 11 British Columbia lakes considered, 10 were productive before human intervention, but 7 eutrophied further as a result of human activities. One lake exhibited no obvious post-1850 change in diatom assemblage, suggesting little human impact on water quality. In three of the lakes, recent improvements in water quality may have occurred in response to recent mitigation efforts.

A simulation model, developed and validated for a series of created experimental marshes in Northeastern Illinois, was aggregated and simplified to estimate the nutrient retention capacity of hypothetical large-scale coastal wetland restoration in Michigan and Ohio. Restoration of 31.2 km(2) of wetlands on agricultural land along Saginaw Bay, Michigan, would retain 25 metric tons-P year(-1) (53% of the phosphorus flow from the upstream watershed). Hydrologic restoration of 17.3 km(2) of mostly diked wetlands in Sandusky Bay, Ohio, would retain 38 metric tons year(-1) (12% of the phosphorus flow from the upstream watershed). A wetland distribution model developed for the Saginaw Bay site illustrated a technique for identifying sites that have high potential for being transition zones between open water and upland and thus logical locations for wetland restoration.

It is hypothesized that excessive nitrogen (N) leakage (export) from forested watersheds is a potentially useful, integrative "indicator" of a negative change in forest function which occurs in synchrony with changes in forest structure and species composition. Our research focuses mainly on forest disturbance associated with recent defoliations by the gypsy moth larva (Lymantria dispar) at spatial scales ranging from small watersheds to the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed. An approach for assessing the magnitude of forest disturbance and its impact on surface water quality will be based on an empirical model relating forest N leakage and gypsy moth defoliation that will be calibrated using data from 25 intensively-monitored forested watersheds in the region and tested using data from more than 60 other forested watersheds in Virginia. Ultimately, the model will be extended to the region using spatially-extensive data describing: 1) the spatial distribution of dominant forest types in the mid-Atlantic region based on both remote sensing imagery and plot-scale vegetation data; 2) the spatial pattern of gypsy moth defoliation of forested areas from aerial mapping; and 3) measurements of dissolved N concentrations in streams from synoptic water quality surveys.

A stratified sampling approach was adopted owing to the extreme and rapid changes in riverine discharge, which varied by up to 10 000 times over the study period. Nutrient concentrations were lowest during baseflow. During storm discharge, dissolved inorganic and organic and particulate nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations increased two- to five fold, and followed hysteresis patterns that were attributed to the integration and/or depletion of catchment nutrient sources during an event. Dissolved organic nitrogen and particulate phosphorus were the dominant nutrient forms. Land use and antecedent conditions had a large influence on nutrient concentrations and exports. During the 1995-96 year (slightly above the mean annual discharge) 96% of nitrogen and 98% of phosphorus loads were transported in less than 6% of the time. When averaged across the catchment, monthly riverine nutrient loads varied by up to 1061-fold during the study and exports were approximately four-fold greater during the second year relative to the first. The subtropical Richmond River catchment has greater intra- and potential interannual variability in nutrient loads and exports when compared with temperate catchments from other parts of the world. It is suggested that in tropical and subtropical Australian catchments with large intra- and interannual variation in discharge, the need for parameterizing the antecedent conditions, such as the degree of nutrient storage, may make it difficult to model spatial and temporal (short time-scale) nutrient exports.

We quantified seasonal and spatial patterns in the concentrations of nitrate N and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) at 17 sites distributed among tributaries and along the mainstem of the River Raisin, Southeastern Michigan, and also determined land cover, surficial geology, and discharges from waste water treatment plants (WWTPs). Annual flow-weighted mean concentrations (FWMCs) ranged from nondetectable le, els to 18.1 mg L-1 for nitrate and to 184 mu g L-1 for SRP. Nitrate concentrations increased from headwaters to river mouth, and were highest in spring and in association with high runoff episodes. Mean nitrate concentration correlated strongly with the ratio of agricultural to forested land upstream of the sampling location. Concentrations of SRP also increased markedly from headwaters downstream, and exhibited little seasonal variation other than a modest increase during the summer period of low flow. Geology and phosphorus loading from WWTPs best predicted SRP concentrations. The annual yield of nitrate was consistent with expectations based on land use. Point source loading contributed a negligible fraction of the river's discharge of nitrate and at most one-fourth of its SRP discharge, Compared with findings from headwater sites and other, less altered rivers, nutrient concentrations in this catchment appear strongly influenced by human activity.

Management activities to address water quality impairment require a watershed-level approach. However, uncertainty and stochasticity are ubiquitous in watershed-level assessment and management. We describe and demonstrate a method for incorporating uncertainty analyses in watershed-level modeling using Wister Lake in Oklahoma as an example. Natural stochasticity, parameter error, and error due to aggregation of data are quantified separately to allow fur a comparison of the various sources of uncertainty in modeling activities. Parameter error was found to be the greatest contributor to overall output uncertainty. Several example management scenarios are presented to illustrate the utility and flexibility of including uncertainty quantification in watershed-level management and decision making.

The Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) has been evaluated for many years, however detailed sensitivity analyses of the model to various agricultural management systems and their representative input parameters are lacking. This study presents results of RZWQM output response sensitivity to selected model input parameters. Baseline values for the parameters were measured for an experiment on a manured corn field in eastern Colorado. Four groups of model input parameters (saturated hydraulic conductivity, organic matter/nitrogen cycling, plant growth, and irrigation water/manure application rates) were selected and three model output responses (plant nitrogen uptake, silage yield, and nitrate leaching) were used to quantify RZWQM sensitivity to selected model input parameters. A modified Monte Carlo sampling method (Latin Hypercube Sampling) was used to obtain parameter see for model realizations. The model parameter sets were then analyzed separately using linear regression analysis. In general, RZWQM output responses were most sensitive to plant growth input parameters and manure application rates. The plant nitrogen uptake and silage yield model output responses were less sensitive to nitrogen cycling and irrigation rate input parameters than those observed in previous field experiments. This finding may warrant further study on the effects of water and nitrogen stresses on crop growth. Finally, the results showed that model output responses were more sensitive to the average saturated hydraulic conductivity of the entire soil profile than to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of individual soil layers.

An NIRSystems 6500 scanning monochromator unit was calibrated against wet chemistry data. Total solids (TS), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) were measured. Correlation coefficients (r) ranged from 0.688 to 0.976, Ratios of data range:standard error of prediction (SEP) varied from 7.0 to 13.6 for the various chemical constituents and manure sources. Based on the individual ratios we conclude that NIR techniques will allow us to predict TS, TKN, NH3-N, and K in all three manure types. Further work will be required before P is predictable.

Effects of seasonal and interannual variations of the net freshwater supply (runoff plus rainfall minus evaporation) on salinity variation within the bay were also examined. Particular attention was paid to the effects of runoff, which are the focus of ambitious plans to restore and conserve the Florida Bay ecosystem. From 1965 to 1995 the annual runoff from the Everglades into the bay was less than one tenth of the annual direct rainfall onto the bay, while estimated annual evaporation slightly exceeded annual rainfall. The average net freshwater supply to the bay over a year was thus approximately zero, and interannual variations in salinity appeared to be affected primarily by interannual fluctuations in rainfall. At the annual scale, runoff apparently had little effect on the bay as a whole during this period. On a seasonal basis, variations in rainfall, evaporation, and runoff were not in phase, and the net freshwater supply to the bay varied between positive and negative values, contributing to a strong seasonal pattern in salinity, especially in regions of the bay relatively isolated from exchanges with the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean. Changes in runoff could have a greater effect on salinity in the bay if the seasonal patterns of rainfall and evaporation and the timing of the runoff are considered. One model was also used to simulate spatial and temporal patterns of salinity responses expected to result from changes in net freshwater supply. Simulations in which runoff was increased by a factor of 2 (but with no change in spatial pattern) indicated that increased runoff will lower salinity values in eastern Florida Bay, increase the variability of salinity in the South Region, but have little effect on salinity in the Central and West Regions.

They have considerable impact on water storage and runoff, water quality, atmospheric exchanges of carbon, and important elements such as nitrogen. In less remote parts of Canada, wetlands have suffered from reclamation, exploitation, contamination and degradation, which have seriously impaired their ecological function. Public recognition of their environmental significance has highlighted the need for a better understanding of the hydrological processes, to better plan and manage wetland areas, restore degraded systems, and predict responses to global change. This paper reviews current hydrological research in all types of Canadian wetlands. The scope of hydrological processes discussed herein includes runoff, surface and groundwater flows, evaporation, microclimate, water balance, geochemical and solute transport phenomenon, carbon dynamics, isotope studies, exploitation and restoration. Field, laboratory and modelling studies are included. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Kitsiou, D; Karydis, M				Kitsiou, D; Karydis, M			Categorical mapping of marine eutrophication based on ecological indices	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						marine eutrophication; spatial distribution; thematic map; ecological index; unsupervised classification; supervised classification; overlay; geographical information systems	PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS; WATER-QUALITY; SPATIAL INTERPOLATORS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; SIMILARITY INDEXES; ENVIRONMENT; DIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEMS	The present work is concerned with the development of methodological procedures for studying the spatial distribution of eutrophication in the marine environment. Seven ecological indices (S, number of phytoplankton species; N, total number of individuals; D-Mg, Margalef's index; D-Mn, Menhinick's index; D-Od, Odum's species per thousand individuals; H', Shannon's Diversity index; E, Evenness index), based on phytoplankton community data collected from Saronicos Gulf, Greece were used for describing the eutrophication state of the sea environment. A representation of the spatial distribution for each ecological index was developed using the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation method. A eutrophication scale for each index was also developed for indicating four different trophic levels in the marine environment (eutrophic, upper-mesotrophic, lower-mesotrophic, oligotrophic); categorization of the interpolated values of each index resulted in a clear illustration of these trophic levels on seven thematic maps. Two methodological procedures were finally applied for synthesizing the information of these thematic maps. The purpose was the development of a final map illustrating the spatial distribution of eutrophication in the study area. The first procedure was based on the integration of unsupervised and supervised classification methods, widely used in the field of remote sensing, while the second one on the overlay technique, simply carried out within the frame of a Geographical Information System (GIS). The hybrid unsupervised/supervised classification method can assess the optimal number of classes in which data values from simultaneously considered parameters could be allocated, while the overlay technique is an additive procedure not taking into account existing trends in the dataset. The advantages and disadvantages of each procedure are further discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Denitrification was successfully achieved using a starch and cellulose mixture as the carbon source, instead of carbon from plant growth, and a 30 mg l(-1) nitrate-nitrogen synthetic feed concentration. For 1, 3, and 7 day HRTs, the MW achieved nitrate-nitrogen plus nitrite;nitrogen (nitrate/nitrite-nitrogen) removals of 82%, 98%, and 88%, respectively. The effluent nitrate/nitrite-nitrogen levels were not significantly different, based on their 95% confidence intervals. For all HRTs, average effluent organic-nitrogen concentrations were less than 2.0 mg l(-1) and average effluent ammonia-nitrogen values were less than 0.5 mg l(-1). For 356 mg l(-1) chemical oxygen demand (COD) addition to the MW, the MW achieved COD removals of 84%, 89%, and 98% for the 1, 3, and 7 day HRTs, respectively. Volatile fatty acid effluent levels were below the detection limit. Residual organic matter in the treated water may make further treatment necessary.

J	Seda, J; Hejzlar, J; Kubecka, J				Seda, J; Hejzlar, J; Kubecka, J			Trophic structure of nine Czech reservoirs regularly stocked with piscivorous fish	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						biomanipulation; top-down effect; zooplankton structure	COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; PLANKTIVOROUS FISH; LAKE RESTORATION; BIOMANIPULATION; ZOOPLANKTON; MANIPULATION; PLANKTON; EUROPE; SIZE	For nearly 20 years, most Czech reservoirs supplying drinking water have been under statutory protection which permitted reservoir managers to manipulate fish stocks in order to maintain a sustainable water quality. The most common biomanipulative measure adopted was stocking with piscivorous fish (mostly 5 cm fry) using an annual stocking level of approx. 25 000 fish per reservoir. Nine reservoirs were studied for signs of top-down food web effects, as predicted by the trophic cascade hypothesis based on levels of total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a (Chl a), zooplankton biomass (ZB) and zooplankton community structure. In all nine reservoirs, only small Daphnia species were recorded, such as D. galeata and D. cucullata. The proportion of large-bodied daphnids retained on a 0.71 mm sieve was less than 10% of the total crustacean biomass in all reservoirs. The relationship of Chl a level - TP, and of ZB - Chl a, was positive under enhanced piscivory and did not differ statistically from the relationships in other reservoirs with natural fish stocks. This implies that bottom-up forces remained stronger than top-down ones in the studied reservoirs, despite the stocking of piscivorous fish. The failure of this attempt at biomanipulation may be due to an insufficient stocking rate of predatory fish and/or inadequate data on the resident planktivorous fish levels.

J	Randhir, TO; Lee, JG				Randhir, TO; Lee, JG			Effect of water quality standards on farm income, rise, and NPS pollution	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						water quality; nonpoint source pollution; water policy/regulation/decision making; watershed management; economics; pollution modeling	NONPOINT-SOURCE POLLUTION; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; PROTECTION POLICIES; REGIONAL-ANALYSIS; LAND	Enforceable standards play a crucial role in the design and implementation of most water quality policies. The impacts of these standards an farm income and nonpoint source (NPS) pollution can provide valuable information to develop economic policies that can improve water quality with minimal loss in income and minimal risk. This study uses an integration of nonlinear programming and a simulation model to assess the impacts of enforceable standards at technology and farm boundary levels. The results indicate that the type of pollutant regulated, enforcement type, and the level of standard had a significant impact on farm income and water quality. Choice of farm boundary standards over technology standards is dependent on the impact of the policy on other NPS pollutants, in addition to the reduction of nitrate and phosphorus pollutants. Enforcing farm boundary standards on nitrates had desirable effects on subsurface and percolate nitrogen and variance in income. Technology standards were uncertain in their effects because of the restriction on the choice of technologies available to farmers.

Being recharged to an important degree from groundwater sources within the carbonate bearing bedrock, the waters are enriched in base cations and they art: of relatively high alkalinity (approx. 4000 mu Eq./l) and pH (similar to 8). Many chemical constituents such as sodium, chloride, boron, nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus vary over time in response to changing flow conditions. For most determinands, concentrations decrease with increasing flow in response to dilution of point and groundwater sources by rainfall. However, for barium and nitrate, concentrations increase with flow and this is indicative of increased runoff from the agriculturally impacted soils. While this feature is certainly expected for nitrate due to fertiliser application, the pattern for barium is at face value unexpected as it would normally be expected to behave like other divalent base cations such as calcium, coming from aquifer leaching. However, it seems that agricultural disturbance of the land can also lead to enhanced runoff: a feature now becoming apparent in several UK studies. The concentrations of micro-organic herbicides vary over time in response to the different times of application and only isoproturon shows a clear response to varying flaw conditions. With regards to biological processes, this is manifest by changes in pH, dissolved carbon dioxide and silica. At most times of the year the waters are oversaturated with respect to atmospheric CO2 (Epco(2)) by a factor of approximately 6 and at these times pH is approximately 7.7 and silica concentrations are approximately 4 mg-Si/l. However, in the early spring period pH increases to values over 8, Epco(2) declines to about the atmospheric levels and silica declines to approximately 1 mg-Si/l. This change probably reflects the dynamic diatom blooms and decays common in this river. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The groundwater inputs ensures that the waters are calcium and bicarbonate bearing and have relatively uniform concentrations. Agricultural inputs result in enhanced levels of nutrients, nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) in particular. For nitrate, the concentrations are higher during the winter months due to increased surface runoff. In contrast, SRP shows a more erratic behaviour with higher concentrations occurring during the early storm hydrograph rise following summer baseflow recession. Within the stream, biological activity results in: (a) marked diurnal fluctuations in the dissolved levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen; (b) a strong seasonal pattern in chlorophyll a levels; and (c) dissolved silica concentration reductions during the early spring period. Carbon dioxide levels are particularly high in the groundwater (typically approximately 60 times the atmospheric value) as observed at a spring discharge. However, within the stream, considerable degassing occurs although values remain an order of magnitude above atmospheric pressure. The findings are discussed in the context of the water quality functioning of agriculturally and sewage impacted southern eastern UK rivers. For example, the work shows that unlike for riverine systems with point sewage discharges or limited groundwater storage, there is a very poor link between chemical concentrations and flow even for components such as SRP and boron which are often connected to sewage discharges.

The main reason for treating solids to be discharged from flow-through systems is to reduce potential negative impacts on the surrounding aquatic environment. In reuse and recycle systems, solids management will be required to maintain culture water quality. In such cases, solids management will often be designed to be combined with other unit processes. Solids concentrations in the untreated effluent from flow-though farms are low at around 5-50 mg l(-1), and do not appear to have altered greatly within the last 20 years. These solids can commonly carry 7-32% of the total nitrogen and 30-84% of the total phosphorus in the wastewater. Feed quality and feeding management can be manipulated to reduce the quantity of waste solids produced. Decreases in the specific water consumption within a farm, increase the concentration of solids in the effluent, which results in an increase in particle separation efficiency. Particles should be separated from the culture stock and the primary effluent flow quickly and efficiently (i.e. at high solids concentrations). This can be achieved by within-tank separation systems, often comprising a separate low-flow particle outlet. Rotating microscreens are commonly used at land-based intensive fish-farms in Europe. Screen mesh pore sizes of 60-200 mu m are common. There is little advantage in using pore sizes smaller than 60 mu m. Low concentration aquaculture solids usually settle discretely in sedimentation tanks, i.e. with no agglomeration of particles that would increase their settling velocity. Such basins are prone to many technical problems, and in most situations are unlikely to be suitable for the treatment of solids in the primary wastewater from aquaculture facilities. Sedimentation basins may be appropriate for secondary de-watering or thickening. Overflow rates of 1.0-2.7 m(3) m(-2) h(-1) have been reported. Bead filters and Rotation columns have been shown to perform well for solids removal in limited flow-rate recycle systems. The sludge produced by separation technology can be thickened and stabilised by the addition of lime, to kill pathogenic diseases and restrict putrefaction.

The principle of inversion of the model, in terms of chlorophyll a plus phaeopigments concentration, chl, sediment refractive index, m(r), and absorption coefficient of yellow substance at 440 nm, a(y)(440), is exposed. The inversion procedure is applied to experimental data collected in the Ebro river plume area. The obtained estimates of chl are accurate only in order of magnitude. However, we demonstrate the m(r) and a(y)(440) determinations are robust against chl variations within -50%, +100% of experimental values. Investigation of possible variations with wavelength of m(r), using measured concentrations and a(y)(440) estimates, evidences a slight dependency as was previously observed. We support in conclusion that the inversion procedure could be exploited in a two-step process. First a(y)(440) and the mean value of m(r) are estimated from measured water quality parameters. The m(r) is calculated at each wavelength considering a(y)(440) value determined in the first step. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

J	Waite, IR; Carpenter, KD				Waite, IR; Carpenter, KD			Associations among fish assemblage structure and environmental variables in Willamette Basin streams, Oregon	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY			English	Article							BIOLOGICAL INTEGRITY; WATER-QUALITY; RIVER; ECOREGIONS; PATTERNS	As part of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment Program, fish were collected from 24 selected stream sites in the Willamette Basin during 1993-1995 to determine the composition of the fish assemblages and their relation to the chemical and physical environment. Variance in fish relative abundance was greater among all sites than among spatially distinct reaches within a site (spatial variation) or among multiple sampled years at a site (temporal variation). Therefore, data from a single reach in an individual year was considered to be a reliable estimator of the fish assemblage structure at a site when the data were normalized by percent relative abundance. Multivariate classification and ordination were used to examine patterns in environmental variables and fish relative abundance over differing spatial scales (among versus within ecoregions). Across all ecoregions tall sites), fish assemblages were primarily structured along environmental gradients of water temperature and stream gradient (coldwater, high-gradient forested sites versus warmwater, low-gradient Willamette Valley sites); this pattern superseded patterns that were ecoregion specific. Water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and physical habitat (e.g., riparian canopy and percent riffles) were associated with patterns of fish assemblages across all ecoregions; however, pesticide and total phosphorus concentrations were more important than physical habitat within the Willamette Valley ecoregion. Consideration of stream site stratification (e.g., stream size, ecoregion, and stream gradient), identification of fish to species level (particularly the sculpin family), and detailed measurement of habitat, diurnal dissolved oxygen, and water temperature were critical in evaluating the composition of fish assemblages in relation to land use. In general, these low-gradient valley streams typical of other agricultural regions had poor riparian systems and showed increases in water temperature, nutrients, and fine grain sediments that were associated with degradation in the native fish assemblages. There was an association of high abundances of introduced species and high percent external abnormalities in medium-sized river sites of mixed land use and high abundances of tolerant species in small streams of predominantly agricultural land use.

Using documented slow-release fertilizer data, a first-order decay equation was fit with reasonable accuracy for both surface (Efficiency R-2 0.63) and incorporated (Efficiency R-2 = 0.70) applications. In both cases the decay coefficient was best represented using a two-parameter model. Temperature and seven-day dissolution amount were determined as best descriptive parameters for the surface model while soil moisture and temperature were used for the incorporated model. Temperature was the more sensitive parameter for the surface applied model while soil moisture was the more sensitive input for the incorporated model. Each model was validated with a limited amount of data. The surface applied model was validated with a prediction efficiency of 0.82 while the subsurface model was validated with a prediction efficiency of 0.63. Even though the models are based on a limited amount of data, incorporation of these results in water quality models will pet-mit the initial simulation of SCUs and allow better simulations of real world situations.

The basic hypothesis of the overall research is that three general mechanisms are responsible for SBNR and that all three can operate, to different degrees, within any biological nutrient removal (BNR) system. The three mechanisms are (1) biological reactor (bioreactor) mixing patterns that allow the anoxic and anaerobic zones necessary for BNR to develop, referred to as the bioreactor macroenvironment. (2) the development of anoxic and anaerobic zones within the floc, referred to as the floc microenvironment, and (3) the presence of novel microorganisms. System design and operating parameters will determine the relative importance of each mechanism. The objective of the overall research project is to identify the factors affecting the relative contributions of the three mechanisms to SBNR. thereby allowing SBNR to be implemented and controlled more effectively in full-scale plants. In the research reported in this paper the operating characteristics of seven full-scale wastewater treatment plants using the staged, closed-loop bioreactor process known as Orbal were evaluated to determine the degree of SBNR occurring. Low effluent total nitrogen concentrations from a process without distinct anoxic zones indicate that simultaneous nitrification and denitrification occur reliably in these facilities. Nitrogen removal is encouraged at these facilities by use of solids retention times sufficiently long to allow nitrifiers to grow under the low dissolved oxygen concentrations in channel 1 of the process. Environmental conditions are relatively uniform throughout each channel, and distinct anoxic and aerobic zones do not seem to form. This suggests that the anoxic conditions necessary for denitrification may develop principally within the biological flocs. Biological nitrogen removal was characterized using the International Association on Water Quality Activated Sludge Model Number 1. Influent and effluent total phosphate and biochemical oxygen demand data and microbiological observations suggest that biological phosphorus removal occurs. Distinct anaerobic zones were not observed, but anaerobic conditions may develop within the lower portion of channel 1. These systems are good candidates for further study of SBNR.

J	Carmichael, JJ; Strzepek, KM				Carmichael, JJ; Strzepek, KM			A multiple-organic-pollutant simulation/optimization model of industrial and municipal wastewater loading to a riverine environment	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							WATER-QUALITY; MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN; TAXES	A simulation/optimization model is developed to demonstrate the need for inclusion of interactive pollutant effects in multiple-pollutant wastewater management, by comparing single- and multiple-pollutant least cost approaches that maintain downstream ambient quality levels. The model chooses biological oxygen demand (BOD), N, and P abatement levels for point sources that minimize the combined wastewater treatment costs of the pollutants in order to achieve chosen ambient quality standards. Nonlinear pollutant interactions result in a nonlinear Jacobian matrix of marginal water quality impacts, creating a nonlinear constraint set. The jacobian is iteratively updated by the simulation model using iterative solutions from the optimization model. The open modeling framework allows other types of programming problems to be solved as well, such as mixed integer and mixed integer nonlinear problems. Single- and multiple-pollutant management approaches are applied to a case study of the Nitra River Basin in Slovakia. The regrets resulting from implementing BOD-only or fixed Jacobian solutions are shown, and the robustness of the solution procedure is demonstrated by varying the initial pollution abatement levels.

J	Hakanson, L; Parparov, A; Hambright, KD				Hakanson, L; Parparov, A; Hambright, KD			Modelling the impact of water level fluctuations on water quality (suspended particulate matter) in Lake Kinneret, Israel	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						suspended particulate matter; lake water quality; lake management; mathematical lake model; Lake Kinneret; Monte Carlo simulations	PHYTOPLANKTON; STRATIFICATION; PREDICTION; SEICHE	A dynamic (time dependent) mathematical model of the monthly cycling of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in lakes with variable water levels has been developed. The model has been applied for the large subtropical Lake Kinneret (Israel), which has variable water levels related to domestic freshwater needs and climatological conditions. The main conclusions from this work are: 1. Uncertainty analyses (Monte Carlo simulations) have shown that the two most important model uncertainties concern sedimentation and erosion related to a lowering of the wave base ( = the water depth separating areas where discontinuous and continuous sedimentation of fine matter occurs). The best way to improve the reliability of the mean monthly SPM-predictions would be to improve the modelling parts related to sedimentation and a lowering of the wave base. All other processes are of less importance for the SPM-predictions (e.g. inflow, outflow, primary production, resuspension, mineralization and mixing). 2. A successive, gradual lowering of the wave base seems to correspond to the 'worst case' scenario likely to alter SPM-values the most. 3. In the 'worst case' scenario, very high levels of SPM may be maintained for a long time (>10 years), which would likely cause serious changes to the Lake Kinneret ecosystem. These results indicate the existence of a narrow threshold range of artificial changes of lake morphometry (water level lowering of about 4-5 m from the maximum water level), which may cause significant deterioration of water quality in Lake Kinneret.

J	Alongi, DM; Johnston, DJ; Xuan, TT				Alongi, DM; Johnston, DJ; Xuan, TT			Carbon and nitrogen budgets in shrimp ponds of extensive mixed shrimp-mangrove forestry farms in the Mekong delta, Vietnam	AQUACULTURE RESEARCH			English	Article							FISH PONDS; NUTRIENT BUDGET; SEDIMENT	Mass balance estimates of carbon and nitrogen flux through two extensive shrimp ponds in the Mekong delta, Vietnam, were constructed to identify major sources and sinks of organic matter potentially available for shrimp production. Nutrient transformations in the sediments were measured to further assess rates of decomposition and burial and quality of organic matter. Tidal exchange was the major pathway for inputs and outputs of carbon and nitrogen in both ponds, with net primary production, nitrogen fixation and precipitation being minor inputs. No fertilizers or artificial feeds were added to either pond. The nutrient budgets identified burial and respiration as the next most important outputs after tidal exchange losses of particulate and dissolved carbon and nitrogen. There was no measurable denitrification in either pond, and NH4+ volatilization was negligible. Mineralization efficiency of carbon in the water column was high (> 100%) in pond 23 reflecting rapid respiration rates; efficiency was lower (36%) in pond 12 waters. Mineralization efficiency of sediment nutrients averaged 34% for C and 41% for N in the pond with a higher annual shrimp yield (pond 12); lower mineralization efficiencies (11% for C, 10% for N) were calculated for the lower yield pond (pond 23). High burial efficiencies for both C (66-89%) and N (59-90%) in the sediments of both ponds suggest that little organic matter was shunted into biological production. Conversion efficiency for shrimp averaged 16% for C and 24% for N from pond 12, and 6% for C and 18% for N from pond 23. The high quantity but low quality of organic matter entering the ponds coupled with other factors, such as poor water quality, limits shrimp productivity. On average, nutrient outputs were greater than inputs in both ponds. This imbalance partly explains why shrimp yields are declining in these ponds.

Based on up to 30 years of experimental and monitoring data, the outflow, N, and P exported from this Pennsylvania watershed is examined in terms of critical source areas. Most of the surface runoff and P export occurs from areas near the stream. About 90% of the algal-available P exported in outflow was generated during the largest 7 storms/year. In contrast, nearly all the nitrate (NO3) exported originated as subsurface flow entering the soil or ground water some distance from the stream, acid mostly occurred during nonstorm flow periods. The NO3 export observed over the long term corresponds to the N excess computed by N balance obtained by farmer survey for agricultural land. By combining land use, hydrologic processes; watershed position, soil P status, and N balance information for agricultural land, the major source areas for P and N are predictable and identifiable. We apply these ideas and techniques to our research watershed and present the results as an example of this approach. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In the Choptank basin, forest was strongly associated with low stream total nitrogen (TN) and nitrate (NO3-) concentrations (r(2) similar to 0.70), and forest placement along first order streams was important in maintaining low stream nitrogen (N) concentrations (r(2) similar to 0.35). In addition, a multiple regression model explained similar to 40% of the stream total phosphorus (TP) variance and indicated that forest directly adjacent to streams (0-100 m) acted as a TP source and forest further away (100-300 m) from streams acted as a TP sink. In contrast, stream nutrients in the nearby Chester basin demonstrated a strong relationship with soil hydrologic properties. Forest had no significant effect on stream N and P because the finer-textured soils, higher stream slopes, and higher runoff potential of the Chester basin appeared to result in less baseflow compared to that in the Choptank basin. This reduced the opportunity for forest to intercept N via plant uptake and denitrification in the high runoff potential soils of the Chester basin. The high percentage of stormflow (40%) coupled with high stream slopes resulted in high soil erosion potential, which may explain the higher TP stream concentrations measured in the Chester compared to that in the Choptank. Differences in the hydrologic pathway appear to explain the different effects of forest on water quality in these two basins. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

GIBSI runs on a personal computer and provides a user-friendly framework to examine the impacts of agricultural, industrial, and municipal management scenarios on water quality and yield. A database (including spatial and attribute data) and physically-based hydrological, soil erosion, agricultural-chemical transport and water quality models comprise the basic components of the system. A geographical information system and a relational database management system are also included for data management and system maintenance. This paper illustrates potential uses of GIBSI by presenting two sample applications applied to a 6680 km(2) complex river basin (63.2% forest, 17.2% agricultural land, 15.3% bush, 3.1% urban development and 1.2% surface water; population: 180 000) located in Quebec, Canada: (i) a timber harvest scenario and (ii) a municipal clean water program scenario. Simulation results of the timber harvest scenario showed how clear-cut activities could lead to earlier and larger spring runoff than in the investigated reference state. Results of the municipal clean water scenario revealed that substantial reduction in coliform counts and total phosphorus could be made by constructing and operating wastewater treatment plants. These applications provide a framework of how GIBSI can be used as a decision support system and ultimately as a means of incorporating sound science into political decisions involving river basin management.

MULTIVARIATE TECHNIQUE FOR BASEFLOW SEPARATION USING WATER QUALITY DATA	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING			English	Article								A procedure for baseflow separation was developed. The uniqueness of the procedure is that it uses water quantity (flow rate) as well as the quality (NO(3), total Kjeldahl nitrogen and total suspended solids) data for baseflow separation. Cluster analysis (CA), a multivariate statistical procedure, was used to group the water quality samples on the storm hydrograph to identify the end point of the baseflow separation line. The proposed procedure was applied to 30 storms in two watersheds, located in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont regions of Virginia, with different hydrologic characteristics. In addition to being a more physically based approach, the CA method also provided consistently better baseflow estimates, compared to two traditional approaches. One of the unique features of the CA method was that it conformed to the premise that baseflow increases after a storm event. For improving the performance of the CA method, regular time interval sampling and inclusion of additional water quality variables (e. g., Ca(++) and HCO(3)(-)) are suggested.

Ecological models suggest the lake responded by eutrophying, reflecting higher nutrient influx resulting from increased erosion. A decline in lake productivity followed as the forest vegetation recovered and erosion slowed. Lastly, as the forest switched from early and middle successional species to mature species, lake productivity increased as erosion increased nutrient inflow, especially phosphorus. However, this eutrophication response was delayed or buffered, perhaps due to wetland development surrounding the lake. The lake never fully returned to its initial, pre-hemlock decline state, but oscillated between more eutrophic and more mesotrophic or oligotrophic stages, possibly reflecting other disturbances in the catchment and climatic change.

J	Murdoch, PS; Baron, JS; Miller, TL				Murdoch, PS; Baron, JS; Miller, TL			Potential effects of climate chance on surface-water quality in North America	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						global water change; water quality; ecological thresholds; droughts; floods	NORTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES; FRESH-WATER; NEW-YORK; FORESTED WATERSHEDS; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES; CATSKILL MOUNTAINS; AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS; NEURAL-NETWORK; BOREAL LAKES	Data from long-term ecosystem monitoring and research stations in North America and results of simulations made with interpretive models indicate that changes in climate (precipitation and temperature) can have a significant effect on the quality of surface waters. Changes in water quality during storms, snowmelt, and periods of elevated air temperature or drought can cause conditions that exceed thresholds of ecosystem tolerance and, thus, lead to water-quality degradation. If warming and changes in available moisture occur, water-quality changes will likely first occur during episodes of climate-induced stress, and in ecosystems where the factors controlling water quality are sensitive to climate variability. Continued climate stress would increase the frequency with which ecosystem thresholds are exceeded and thus lead to chronic water-quality changes. Management strategies in a warmer climate will therefore be needed that are based on local ecological thresholds rather than annual median condition. Changes in land use alter biological, physical, and chemical processes in watersheds and thus significantly alter the quality of adjacent surface waters; these direct human-caused changes complicate the interpretation of water-quality changes resulting from changes in climate, and can be both mitigated and exacerbated by climate change. A rigorous strategy for integrated, long-term monitoring of the ecological and human factors that control water quality is necessary to differentiate between actual and perceived climate effects, and to track the effectiveness of our environmental policies.

During the period 1987-1997 abandoned lands increased from 1.7 to 10.5% and arable lands decreased from 41.8 to 23.9%. At the same time, the runoff of total-N, total-P, SO4 and organic matter (after BOD5) decreased from 25.9 to 5.1, 0.32 to 0.13, 78 to 48, and 7.4 to 3.5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The most significant decreases occurred in agricultural subcatchments while the changes were insignificant in the forested upper course catchment. A simple empirical model which incorporates land-use pattern, fertilization intensity, soil parameters and water discharge accurately described the variations of total-N and total-P runoff in both the whole catchment and its agricultural subcatchments (R-2 varies from 0.95-0.99 for N to 0.49-0.93 for P). In small agricultural subcatchments the rate of fertilization is found the most important factor for nitrogen runoff, whereas in larger mosaic watersheds land use pattern plays the main role. Seven alternative scenarios compiled on the base of the empirical model allow to forecast potential nitrogen and phosphorus losses from the catchment. This information can be used in further landscape and regional planning of the whole region.

J	Attrill, MJ; Power, M				Attrill, MJ; Power, M			Modelling the effect of drought on estuarine water quality	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Thames; flow; temperature; pH; chlorinity; solids; oxygen	CHESAPEAKE BAY; TURBID ESTUARY; FOOD-WEB; FLOW; RIVER; FISH; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; SEDIMENT; INVERTEBRATES	Long-term data assembled for monitoring the water quality of the Thames estuary between 1977-1992 were used to examine the changing influences of physico-chemical variables on estuarine water quality during drought conditions. Seasonal and monthly means were computed and tested for significant differences. Time series data were used to estimate regression models explaining observed variations in water quality parameter measurements during the predrought (1977-1988) and drought (1989-1992) periods. Stability tests were used to establish significant differences in predrought and drought models and to make inferences about the significance of drought induced low flows on water quality. Significant mean seasonal and monthly differences were found for flow, chlorinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and suspended solids. Total oxidisable nitrogen showed no significant change. Regression analyses were consistent with these results and highlighted the significance of drought related changes in flow and temperature for the determination of estuarine water quality. This suggests that management policies designed to mitigate the effects of drought be extended to consider their effects on estuarine water duality given the ecological importance of these areas.

J	Parent, S; Morin, A				Parent, S; Morin, A			N budget as water quality management tool in closed aquatic mesocosms	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						nitrogen budget; marine mesocosm; management tool	MARINE FISH; NITROGEN; TOXICITY; NITRATE	Following a high rise in nitrate levels in St Lawrence mesocosm of the Montreal Biodome in 1995, inputs, outputs and changes in N pools were independently measured to estimate the N budget of the system. The resulting budget had only an 8% difference between the inputs (CV = 11.1%) and the sum of the outputs and changes in N pools (CV = 9.6%). N inputs amounted to 342 kg for 1995; 58% was contributed by the food for fish and invertebrates and 35% by the seabird guano. Filtration and general cleaning removed 20% of the inputs. The pool vacuum cleaner designed by the Biodome staff proved to be an important addition to the system since it increased by 30% the efficacy of the life support systems (LSS) at removing N, and removed detritus glued to surfaces or trapped in sediments that could not be removed by the LSS; 65% of N accumulated in mesocosm mainly as NO3 (92%), but also as fish and invertebrate biomass (8%). Assuming 21 mM as the maximum NO3 concentration for survival of the animals on display, the N budget showed that, without integrated dissimilation or assimilation processes, marine aquaria similar in design and operation to the SLM must be opened after 5-7 years of operation unless N inputs can be reduced or N outputs increased. As suggested by the budget, the removal of one seabird species (gannets) and an increase in partial water changes (from 9 to 16% per year) in 1996 have, since then, stabilized the level of NO3 to 12-13 mM. The N budget was effective in identifying the role of each component in the system, suggesting changes in the operating practices, and predicting the impact of these changes. It is a useful water quality management tool for artificial environments, such as closed aquatic mesocosms. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The equations of heat aid mass transfer in the lake were solved together with equations governing physical and biological processes under real atmospheric conditions coupled with an integrated model of bubble plume. The verification of the model was conducted using data of Lake Calhoun (USA). Using the developed model, numerical experiments were carried out far an imaginary lake in the Hiroshima region of Japan with different gas flow rates of bubble plume, different numbers of bubble ports, different starting dates of bubbler and different bubbler depths. The optimization of the improvement of water quality in the lake can be obtained by using the appropriate gas flow rate and number of bubble ports, and applying it at an appropriate period of the year.

The effect of ammonia on the short-term growth of juvenile silver perch was evaluated in a 39-day experiment. Survival was not significantly affected by exposures up to 0.36 mg l(-1) un-ionised ammonia-nitrogen (UAN), the highest concentration tested in this study. Growth was reduced at 0.36 mg I-1 UAN. The EC, (the concentration at which growth is reduced by 5%) was estimated to be 0.06 mg l(-1) UAN. Some changes in gill histopathology were observed in fish exposed to ammonia.

Judgements on the temporal structure of data sets are frequently rather subjective. By examining the temporal structure of chlorophyll variation in Lough Hyne with hierarchical techniques, it was possible to identify the important temporal scales objectively. Suggestions can also be made about appropriate sampling programmes for similar coastal systems. There was significant variation in measured chlorophyll concentrations between seasons and between months within seasons. High chlorophyll concentrations were more likely during spring and autumn, as would be predicted from the seasonal cycle of stratification in the lough. Seasonality could also be detected in the tidal inflow to the lough from adjacent coastal waters. More intensive sampling during the summer did not reveal any temporal structure in surface water samples. However, there were 14 day periodicities associated with measurements of depth integrated chlorophyll, oxygen, salinity, water column stability and attenuation coefficient. It is suggested that these periodicities are consistent with spring neap tidal forcing. No interannual variation in chlorophyll concentrations was detected. Examination of the power in the analysis of variance suggested that the monthly sampling frequency was unlikely to have detected differences of less than 145% between the means of pairs of years. A sampling interval of less than a week would be needed to have confidence in detecting differences of 50% between annual means.

The catchment was separated into four morphological units and core sampling was carried out to analyze pedological horizons. Five stations were surveyed along the stream. The water quality was investigated seasonally through both physical and chemical variables (oxygen, pH, temperature, phosphorus, nitrate) and with the French normalised biological index. The analysis of macroinvertebrates was made with regard to the spatial heterogeneity of the streambed and the community structure, then categorized by habitat preferences and functional feeding groups. The land at the top of the catchment area, consisting of hydromorphic soils, was used for cattle breeding. This generated the increase in suspended sediment and nutrients concentration in the water. However, the decrease in nutrients from up to downstream, and the evolution of the benthic communities, indicated an improvement in water quality. The high degree of self-purification in the catchment area may result from the combined action of ungrazed hydromorphic soils, ponds and natural purification of the stream. Moreover, the geomorphological characteristics of the catchment influence physical and chemical variables, as well as the biological traits of the macroinvertebrates. As a consequence, the indices of taxa diversity, weighted according to substrates types, seemed to be the most accurate descriptors of the environmental changes. Thus, the resilience of the aquatic ecosystem may be influenced by the degree of complexity of the watershed geomorphology.

J	Power, JF; Wiese, R; Flowerday, D				Power, JF; Wiese, R; Flowerday, D			Managing nitrogen for water quality-lessons from Management Systems Evaluation Area	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Review							CHLOROPHYLL METER; CROPPING SYSTEMS; TILLAGE SYSTEM; CORN LEAVES; SAND PLAIN; NO-TILL; FIELD; SOIL; NITRATE; MODEL	The! Management Systems Evaluation Area (MSEA) project was initiated in 1990 to evaluate existing and develop new N management technologies to reduce the potential adverse impacts of agricultural practices on surface and ground water quality, Field research sites were established in nine Midwestern states. Results from MSEA research showed that nitrate leaching was greatly reduced by changing from furrow to sprinkler irrigation. At least 95% of the nitrate N percolating through tiled soils was intercepted and discharged into surface waters. Computer models indicated that routing tile discharge through wetlands would greatly reduce the nitrate load. Nitrate losses also were reduced by establishing controlled water tables using drainage lines for subirrigation. Preplant and presidedress soil nitrate tests were effective in determining proper N fertilizer rates and reducing nitrate losses. Banding ammoniated fertilizers slowed nitrification rates and nitrate leaching, especially if soil over the bands was packed, A major new technology was proof that crop greenness can be used to monitor crop N sufficiency, and that N deficiencies after the V8 stage can be corrected by sidedressing or fertigation (reactive N management). Inexpensive sensors or aerial photographs can be used to assess crop greenness. Using Global Positioning Systems (GPS), N-deficient areas of the field ran he managed differently from the remainder of the field. These results point to the need to develop site-specific or precision farming systems to control nitrate losses to water resources and reduce the impart of natural variability in both soils and weather.

J	David, MB; Gentry, LE				David, MB; Gentry, LE			Anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus and riverine export for Illinois, USA	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							NORTH-ATLANTIC OCEAN; WATER-QUALITY; OXIDE EMISSIONS; SURFACE WATERS; NITRATE; DENITRIFICATION; CORN; ECOSYSTEMS; DRAINAGE; AGRICULTURE	Agricultural nonpoint sources are important contributors of N and P to surface waters. We determined N and P net anthropogenic inputs for Illinois, examining changes during the last 50 yr and linkages to surface water:export of N and P. Inputs (fertilizer, atmospheric deposition, and IV, fixation) were compared to exports (grain export, after accounting:for animal and human consumption, plus animal product export) from 1945 through 1998 using state-reported data on fertilizer sales,crop production, and human and animal populations. Large inputs of N were found beginning about 1965, coinciding with increased N fertilizer applications (about 800 000 Mg N yr(-1)). The N input (about 400 000 Mg N yr(-1)) was 8.6 million Mg N for the 1979 to 1996 crop Sears, with a corresponding riverine flux of 4.4 million Mg N:(51% of et anthropogenic inputs discharged by rivers). Using literature estimates of field and in-stream denitrification, we could account for nearly all of the missing N in a mass balance. For P, a different pattern was found for state net anthropogenic inputs with a large input from 1965 to 1990, and on average no net inputs since 1990. For rivers, we estimated that 16% of the total N load and 47% of the total P load was from sewage effluent. We estimate that Illinois contributed 15 and 10% of the annual total N and P loads of the Mississippi River, respectively, and that any reduction strategy in Illinois must address agricultural sources.

The objective of this study was to measure the effect of site characteristics and poultry litter application on runoff and nutrient transport from grazed pasture and forest sites at different landscape positions. Sixteen pairs of 1 x 2 m plots were established on Nixa (loamy-skeletal, siliceous, active, mesic Glossic Fragiudults) and Clarksville (loamy-skeletal, siliceous, semiactive, mesic Typic Paleudults) cherty silt loams. One plot of each pair received 4.5 Mg ha(-1) of poultry litter. Rainfall was simulated at 75 mm h(-1) for 1 h (25-yr return period storm) one month after litter application. A composite runoff sample was analyzed for dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), total phosphorus (TP), ammonia N (NH3-N), nitrate N (NO3-N), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and total suspended solids (TSS), Poultry litter-treated plots had consistently higher concentrations of all water quality parameters tested compared to untreated plots. Concentration of DRP in runoff from untreated pints was linearly correlated with three soil P tests (0.35 < r(2) < 0.85), Soil P on litter-treated plots had little effect on runoff DRP, which averaged 2.20 mg L-1 High variation in runoff resulted in only NO3-N showing significantly greater losses due to poultry litter treatment at two pasture sites. Results indicate that variation in runoff has a significant effect on nutrient transport from grazed pastures receiving poultry litter.

J	Clerk, S; Hall, R; Quinlan, R; Smol, JP				Clerk, S; Hall, R; Quinlan, R; Smol, JP			Quantitative inferences of past hypolimnetic anoxia and nutrient levels from a Canadan Precambrian Shield lake	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY			English	Article						eutrophication; chironomids; diatoms; anoxia; oxygen levels; nutrients; Ontario	CENTRAL ONTARIO LAKES; BOREAL LAKES; RECONSTRUCTION; CHIRONOMIDAE; INDICATORS; DIPTERA; ACIDIFICATION; ASSEMBLAGES; COMMUNITIES; RECOVERY	Paleolimnological analyses were used to infer limnological changes during the past similar to 300 yrs in the west basin of Peninsula Lake, a small (853 ha) Precambrian Shield lake in Ontario, Canada, that has been subjected to moderate cultural disturbances (forest clearance, cottage and resort development). This study represents a pioneering attempt to use sedimentary chironomid assemblages and weighted-averaging models to quantify past hypolimnetic anoxia (expressed as the anoxic factor, AF). Impacts of forest clearance and human land-use on deepwater oxygen availability and surface water quality were assessed by comparing chironomid-inferred AF and diatom-inferred total phosphorus concentration ([TP]) to changes in terrestrial pollen and historical data. This study also discusses the ability of chironomids to quantitatively infer changes in AF. Pre-disturbance chironomid assemblages were stable and dominated by taxa indicative of oxygen-rich hypolimnetic conditions (e.g., Protanypus, Heterotrissocladius, Micropsectra type), while diatoms indicated oligotrophic lake status (diatom inferred [TP] = 5-7 mu g . l(-1)). Chironomids characteristic of lower oxygen availability (e.g., Chironomus, Procladius) increased following land-clearance, road construction, establishment of a grist mill and lakeshore development beginning ca. 1870. Increased abundances of Tanytarsus s. lat., a multigeneric group of mainly littoral chironomids, since 1900, indicated that littoral chironomids may have comprised a greater proportion of fossil assemblages during periods of eutrophication and prolonged anoxia. Abundances of meso-eutrophic diatom taxa (e.g., Fragilaria crotonensis, Asterionella formosa, Aulacoseira ambigua, A. subarctica) increased concurrent with European settlement (ca. 1870) and diatom-inferred [TP] doubled (similar to 6-12 mu g . l(-1)), further indicating that naturally- oligotrophic Precambrian Shield lakes were extremely sensitive to initial land-clearance activities. Recent increases in oligotrophic diatom taxa (e.g., Cyclotella stelligera) indicate a shift to more oligotrophic conditions since ca. mid-1960s, with greatest changes since ca. 1980. The chironomids Heterotrissocladius and Micropsectra type also increased at this time suggesting greater deepwater oxygen availability. These recent water-quality improvements, possibly in response to enhanced nutrient removal from detergents and sewage, climate-related reductions in external phosphorus loads, and catchment (but not lake) acidification and reforestation, suggest that habitat for commercially-valuable cold-water fishes has improved in recent decades despite greater recreational lake-use. Paleolimnological assessment of trophic status changes in Peninsula Lake using fossil diatom and chironomid assemblages were in good agreement. Diatom inferences of [TP] and chironomid inferences of AF both suggest that Peninsula Lake was historically oligotrophic, became oligo-mesotrophic after European settlement, and returned to oligotrophy in recent yrs. Chironomid inferences of [TP] consistently underestimated the trophic status of Peninsula Lake, possibly due to its relatively large hypolimnion. These results suggest that AF represents a useful tool for quantitatively reconstructing the past trophic status of deeper, stratified lakes.

J	King, JM; O'Day, MJ				King, JM; O'Day, MJ			Applying fuel cell experience to sustainable power products	JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th Grove Fuel Cell Symposium Fuel Cells - The Competitive Option for Sustainable Energy Supply	SEP 13-16, 1999	LONDON, ENGLAND	Queen Elizabeth II Conference Ctr		fuel cell; power plant; IFC		Fuel cell power plants have demonstrated high efficiency, environmental friendliness, excellent transient response, and superior reliability and durability in spacecraft and stationary applications. Broader application of fuel cell technology promises significant contribution to sustainable global economic growth, but requires improvement to size, cost, fuel flexibility and operating flexibility. International Fuel Cells (IFC) is applying lessons learned from delivery of more than 425 fuel cell power plants and 3 million h of operation to the development of product technology which captures that promise. Key findings at the fuel cell power plant level include: (1) ancillary components account for more than 40% of the weight and nearly all unscheduled outages of hydrocarbon-fuelled power plants; a higher level of integration and simplification is required to achieve reasonable characteristics, (2) hydrocarbon,on fuel cell power plant components are highly interactive; the fuel processing approach and power plant operating pressure are major determinants of overall efficiency, and (3) achieving the durability required fdr heavy duty vehicles and stationary applications requires simultaneous satisfaction of electrochemical, materials and mechanical considerations in the design of the cell stack and other power plant components. Practical designs must minimize application specific equipment. Related lessons for stationary fuel cell power plants include: (1) within fuel specification limits, natural gas varies widely in heating value, minor constituents such as oxygen and nitrogen content and trace compounds such as the odorant; (2) city water quality varies widely; recovery of product water for process use avoids costly, complicated and site-specific water treatment systems, but water treatment is required to eliminate impurities and (3) the embedded protection functions for reliable operation of fuel cell power conditioners meet or exceed those required for connection to the utility grid, but: current standards do not recognize embedded protection functions, and, often, utilities mandate external protective devices. Consequently, current activity to develop such standards under IEEE auspices is important in eliminating the cost of extra protection equipment. Key fuel cell lessons learned from IFC's experience base along with the status of development for future vehicle and stationary power plants at IFC are discussed. These lessons have been applied to the 200 kW stationary fuel cell power plant as the information has become available. They are now being applied to a 50-kW, ambient pressure, polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell power plant that uses gasoline as the fuel. This power plant is intended for experimental bench testing demonstrations associated with vehicle power plans applications. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

J	Di, HJ; Cameron, KC				Di, HJ; Cameron, KC			Calculating nitrogen leaching losses and critical nitrogen application rates in dairy pasture systems using a semi-empirical model	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						nitrate; cycling; urine; urea; effluent; water quality; modelling	AMMONIUM FERTILIZER; SHED EFFLUENT; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; FLOOD IRRIGATION; N-MINERALIZATION; NITRATE; SOIL; LYSIMETER; GRASSLAND	A simple, semi-empirical model for estimating nitrogen (N) leaching losses and critical N application rates in dairy pasture systems is described. The model uses the annual rates of major N flux processes in the soil-plant system to determine the potentially leachable N pool(mineral N and mineralisable N), and estimates the N leaching loss based on measured relationships between the N leaching loss and the potentially leachable N in the soil. The N flux processes considered in the model include fertiliser or effluent N applications, biological N fixation, soil N mineralisation and immobilisation, plant N uptake, animal N return at the urine patches, ammonium volatilisation, and denitrification. The impact of drainage on N leaching is taken into account by normalising the N leaching loss to a per 100 mm drainage basis. A quadratic equation is used to describe the relationship between the N leaching loss and potentially leachable N. Tests of the model predictions against other experimental data showed reasonable agreements between the estimated N leaching losses with those measured. The modelled critical N application rates which would cause the annual average N concentration in the drainage water to reach the drinking water standard (11.3 mg N l(-1)) are: 390-392 kg N ha(-1) for cut and carry and 162-192 kg N ha(-1) for grazed pastures if urea is used; and 588-600 kg N ha(-1) for cut and carry, and 248-301 kg N ha(-1) for grazed pastures if dairy shed effluent is used.

J	Pautler, MC; Sims, JT				Pautler, MC; Sims, JT			Relationships between soil test phosphorus, soluble phosphorus, and phosphorus saturation in Delaware soils	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL			English	Article							NORTHERN BELGIUM; WATER-QUALITY; PHOSPHATE; SORPTION; AVAILABILITY; PERSPECTIVE; AGRICULTURE; PARAMETERS; PROTECTION; DRAINAGE	Methods to identify agricultural soils that contribute to nonpoint-source pollution of surface waters by P are of increasing importance, particularly in areas with high animal densities (animal units per hectare of cropland). Our objective was to determine the relationship between agronomic: soil test P (STP = Mehlich 1) and other soil P tests proposed to measure the potential for P loss by erosion, runoff, and leaching. We compared STP with soluble P, P in the "fast desorbing pool" (strip P), and soil P saturation for 127 soils (122 from Delaware and five from the Netherlands). Soil test P was significantly correlated with total P (r = 0.57***, significant at the 0.001 level), soluble P (r = 0.71***), strip P (r = 0.84***), and oxalate-extractable P (P-ox; r = 0.84***). Strip P was a better predictor of soluble P than STP (r(2) = 0.76***). The ratio of strip P/P-ox (the percentage of reversibly sorbed P in the fast desorbing pool) increased as P sorption capacity, estimated from oxalate-extractable Al and Fe (Al-ox + Fe-ox), decreased. We also determined the degree of P saturation (DPS) using three methods: Langmuir P sorption isotherms; oxalate extractions of P, Al, and Fe; and STP plus a single-point P sorption index (PSI). Soluble P, STP, and desorbable P increased for DPS values >30%, similar to upper DPS limits in the Netherlands and Belgium. Soils rated agronomically excessive in STP (>50 mg kg(-1)) had higher ratios of soluble P, strip P, and P-ox to total P than those in agronomically optimum or lower categories.

As part of a Water Quality Demonstration Project in the eastern Coastal Plain, we monitored stream water quality at the watershed outlet. Four methods of assessing stream water quality were compared. These methods were time-composite sampling with continuous flow measurements (TC), flow-proportional sampling with independent measurement of flow (FP), grab sampling with instantaneous flow measurements (IG), and grab sampling for quality assurance/quality control checks using daily USGS flow measurements (UG). Flow measurements using the TC and IG methods were highly correlated (r(2) = 0.97). Because of more intensive measurements during high flow, the FP method sampled greater flow rates during the sampling period. For all four methods, nitrate-N, ammonia-N and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) concentrations were not correlated to streamflow. Because of the significantly greater flow sampled, the FP method predicted significantly greater mass loading rates for both nitrate-hi ammonia-hi and TKN. Grab sampling (IG and UG) and the TC methods were not significantly different for the entire sandy period; however a few monthly differences were significant.

The usefulness of the DPY (difference from the previous year) method was confirmed for removing the watershed change (e.g. land cover, population, etc.). From the analysis of the relationships between air temperature and water temperature on a monthly basis, the delay of time was seen to be negligible, but the gain was reduced due to the high frequency of change. As the amount of precipitation affected their relationship on a yearly basis, the slopes of 1.0-1.2 degrees C water temperature/degrees C air temperature were determined with the DPY method by excluding the combinations of the years having large difference in annual precipitation. The deterioration of lake water quality, such as increases in COD (chemical oxygen demand) and decreases in transparency, was quantitatively assessed as corresponding to an increase in air temperature. In addition, we found that higher precipitation led to high nitrogen concentrations on a monthly basis, as well as on a yearly basis, probably induced by both the runoff of soilwater having high concentrations and the lowering of residence times of lake water.

J	Alexander, RB; Smith, RA; Schwarz, GE				Alexander, RB; Smith, RA; Schwarz, GE			Effect of stream channel size on the delivery of nitrogen to the Gulf of Mexico	NATURE			English	Article							COASTAL MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; MISSISSIPPI RIVER; WATER-QUALITY; FRESH-WATER; DENITRIFICATION; RESPONSES; EXCHANGE; BUDGET; SYSTEM	An increase in the flux of nitrogen from the Mississippi river during the latter half of the twentieth century has caused eutrophication and chronic seasonal hypoxia in the shallow waters of the Louisiana shelf in the northern Gulf of Mexico(1-5). This has led to reductions in species diversity, mortality of benthic communities and stress in fishery resources(4). There is evidence for a predominantly anthropogenic origin of the increased nitrogen flux(2,5-7), hut the location of the most significant sources in the Mississippi basin responsible for the delivery of nitrogen to the Gulf of Mexico have not been clearly identified, because the parameters influencing nitrogen-loss rates in rivers are not well known. Here we present an analysis of data from 374 US monitoring stations, including 123 along the six largest tributaries to the Mississippi, that shows a rapid decline in the average first-order rate of nitrogen loss with channel size-from 0.45 day(-1) in small streams to 0.005 day(-1) in the Mississippi river. Using stream depth as an explanatory variable, our estimates of nitrogen-loss rates agreed with values from earlier studies. We conclude that the proximity of sources to large streams and rivers is an important determinant of nitrogen delivery to the estuary in the Mississippi basin, and possibly also in other large river basins.

It is shown using the mathematical model 'Rostherne' that winter levels of ambient Si have a major influence both on spring levels of ambient P and on the summer cyanobacterial maxima. Additions of Si to the lakes could be used for the fine regulation of the biogeochemical balance and may prescribe a recipe for improvement of water quality, as well as a new solution to the problem of eutrophication.

Numerous studies have been conducted to examine the effects of soil and crop management practices on nitrate leaching, however, there are few studies which examine new technologies to reduce nitrate leaching from agricultural land. In this study, technological advances in water table management are used in combination with conservation tillage and intercropping treatments to determine if nitrate leaching can be effectively reduced in a clay loam soil. There were two water table management treatments and four crop management treatments arranged in a 2 by 4 factorial arrangement with two replicates. The water table management treatments consisted of controlled drainage/subirrigation system (CDS) and a free drainage system (FD). The crop management treatments consisted of moldboard plow tillage with and without an annual ryegrass intercrop (MP, MP + IC) and soil saver (modified chisel plow) with and without an annual ryegrass intercrop (SS, SS + IC), The data was modeled using LEACHM and a mean error difference procedure was used to determine how well the model predicted the field data. The model worked well when the difference between the predicted and measured values approached zero. When the CDS system was modeled, the mean error difference values ranged from -1.67 to 0.33 mg N l(-1) for the I crop management treatments whereas the values were considerably greater when the FD system was modeled with values ranging between 7.48 and 12.7 mg N l(-1). Hence the LEACHM model predicted nitrate leaching better on plots under CDS system than on plots under FD, Both the Leaching Estimation and Chemistry Model (LEACHM) predicted scenarios and field sampled data showed that CDS reduced nitrate leaching substantially. Model calibration by using one full year of field data was found to be acceptable, but for predictions based on shorter calibration periods unsatisfactory results were obtained.

Water quality declined dramatically following European settlement in the mid-1800s and reached its highest inferred nutrient concentrations during the first half of the twentieth century. After treatment of sewage began in 1972, surface water total phosphorus rapidly returned to near oligotrophic conditions. Diatom assemblages reflected the period of nutrient enrichment, as well as the subsequent recovery. Chironomid assemblages exhibited trends consistent with decreased availability of dissolved oxygen to deepwater habitats since ca. 1886, with profundal taxa being largely absent since ca. 1958 when deepwater anoxia became more severe. Despite remediation efforts, Gravenhurst Bay still experiences long periods of anoxia, and chironomid assemblages have shown no sign of recovery to the improved surface water quality. We suggest that chironomid assemblages responded more strongly to changes in deepwater oxygen availability than to epilimnetic nutrient concentrations, especially during periods of pronounced hypoxia.

Sulfur of sulfate aerosol in the broader region (mean delta(34)S of 7.5 parts per thousand CDT) was isotopically heavier than sulfur of airborne SO2 (mean delta(34)S Of 4.7 parts per thousand). The annual atmospheric S deposition to the Jezeri watershed decreased markedly in 1993, 1994, and 1995 (40, 33, and 29 kg/ ha.yr), reflecting reductions in industrial S emissions. Sulfur export from Jezeri via surface discharge was twice atmospheric inputs, and increased from 52 to 58 to 85 kg/ha.yr over the same three-year period. The delta(34)S value of Jezeri streamflow was 4.5 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand, intermediate between the average atmospheric deposition (5.4 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand) and soil S (4.0 +/- 0.5 parts per thousand, suggesting that the excess sulfate in runoff comes from release of S from the soil. Bedrock is not a plausible source of the excess S, because its S concentration is very low (<0.003 wt.%) and because its delta(34)S value is too high (5.8 parts per thousand) to be consistent with the delta(34)S of runoff. A sulfur isotope mixing model indicated that release of soil S accounted for 64 +/- 33% of sulfate S in Jezeri discharge. Approximately 30% of total sulfate S in the discharge were organically cycled. At Nacetin, the same sequence of delta(34)S(IN) > delta(34)S(OUT) > delta(34)S(SOIL) was observed. The seasonality found in atmospheric input (higher delta(34)S in summer, lower delta(34)S in winter) was preserved in shallow (<10 cm) soil water, but not in deeper soil water. delta(34)S values of deeper (> 10 cm) soil water (4.8 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand) were intermediate between those of atmospheric input (5.9 +/- 0.3 parts per thousand) and Nacetin soils (2.4 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand), again suggesting that remobilization of soil S accounts for a significant fraction (roughly 40 +/- 10%) of the S in soil water at Nacetin. The inventories of soil S at both of these sites are legacies of more intense atmospheric pollution during previous decades, and are large enough (740 and 1500 kg S/ha at Jezeri and Nacetin, respectively) to supply significant sulfur fluxes to runoff for several more decades. The ongoing release of this stored soil S may significantly delay the recovery of water quality under declining atmospheric S deposition. Analysis of possible scenarios that would result in different S isotope composition of rainfall, runoff and soil suggested that biologic S isotope fractionation must be involved. Mineralization of organic soil S was recorded in two opposite but complementary vertical isotope trends: while soil water had lower delta(34)S values in deeper horizons, bulk soil had higher delta(34)S values in deeper horizons.

J	Sigua, GC; Steward, JS				Sigua, GC; Steward, JS			Establishing pollutant load reduction targets for the Indian River Lagoon, Florida	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						nutrient; N; P; TSS; loading; estuary; IRL; seagrass; runoff		Establishment of seagrass-based pollutant load reduction targets is a major aim of water quality management in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL) estuary. It is believed that light and water clarity are the Limiting factors affecting seagrass abundance and distribution in the Lagoon. Thus, targeted reductions of nutrients, dissolved organic matter and/or suspended sediments should achieve desired seagrass coverage goals. On an annual average, the Lagoon is receiving external loadings of 5,346, 771, and 54,408 metric tons per year of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and total suspended solids (TSS), respectively. Most of the loadings are stormwater generated; thus, implementation of reduction targets will key in on major urban and agricultural stormwater systems. The process of developing targets requires the establishment of light requirements for seagrass. Two methods are being employed to develop such targets. One method is the application of a predictive, 3-D model that accounts for the essential interactive processes of the Lagoon: hydrology, hydrodynamics, water quality, nutrient uptake/release, seagrass growth rates, and light attenuation. The other method is based simply on the comparison of loading rates between: a developed sub-basin with associated seagrass impacts and an undeveloped sub-basin with adjacent healthy seagrass coverages. The latter method will provide the initial and preliminary targets that can be tested, confirmed, or modified by application of the 3-D model.

Agriculture constitutes 93 percent of all land use in eastern Iowa. As part of the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Quality Assessment Program, water samples were collected (typically monthly) from six small and six large watersheds in eastern Iowa between March 1996 and September 1997. A Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to determine land use and quantify inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus within the study area. Streamflow from the watersheds is to the Mississippi River. Chemical fertilizer and animal manure account for 92 percent of the estimated total nitrogen and 99.9 percent of the estimated total phosphorus input in the study area. Total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads for 1996 were estimated for nine of the 12 rivers and creeks using a minimum variance unbiased estimator model. A seasonal pattern of concentrations and loads was observed. The greatest concentrations and loads occur in the late spring to early summer in conjunction with row-crop-fertilizer applications and spring runoff and again in the late fall to early winter as vegetation goes into dormancy and additional fertilizer is applied to row-crop fields. The three largest rivers in eastern Iowa transported an estimated total of 79,000 metric tons of total nitrogen and 6,800 metric tons of total phosphorus to the Mississippi River in 1996. The estimated mass of total nitrogen and total phosphorus transported to the Mississippi River represents about 19 percent of all estimated nitrogen and 9 percent of all estimated phosphorus input to the study area.

Thus, the influence of spatial and temporal variables was analysed statistically using empirical time series of different nutrient species from 35 well-documented catchments (2-35 km(2)), which have been monitored for an average of 5 years. In the spatial analysis several significant correlations between winter median concentrations and catchment characteristics were found. The strongest correlation was found between inorganic nitrogen and land use, while concentrations of different phosphorus species were highly correlated to soil texture. Multiple linear regression models gave satisfactory results for prediction of median winter concentrations in unmeasured catchments, especially for inorganic nitrogen and phosphate. In the analysis of temporal variability within catchments, internal variables from a dynamic hydrological model (HBV) were linked to concentration fluxes. It was found that phosphorus and inorganic nitrogen concentrations were elevated during flow increase at low-Bow conditions, while they were diluted as the wetness in the catchment increased. During unmonitored periods regression models were successful in predicting temporal variability of total phosphorus, phosphate and inorganic nitrogen, while organic nitrogen and particulate phosphorus could not be predicted with this approach. Dividing the data into different flow categories did not improve the prediction of nutrient concentration dynamics. The results and literature review presented, confirm parts of the present HBV-W model approach and will be useful for further development of nutrient routines linked to dynamic hydrological models.

Among all levels of the food web (plants, herbivores, carnivores), the plant-animal interface is the most variable and least predictable link(4-6). In hypereutrophic lakes, for example, biomass and energy transfer is often inhibited at the phytoplankton-zooplankton link(4), resulting in an accumulation of phytoplankton biomass instead of sustaining production at higher trophic levels, such as fish. Accumulation of phytoplankton (especially cyanobacteria) results in severe deterioration of water quality, with detrimental effects on the health of humans and domestic animals, and diminished recreational value of water bodies(7,8). We show here that low transfer efficiencies between primary producers and consumers during cyanobacteria bloom conditions are related to low relative eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 omega 3) content of the primary producer community. Zooplankton growth and egg production were strongly related to the primary producer 20:5 omega 3 to carbon ratio. This indicates that limitation of zooplankton production by this essential fatty acid is of central importance at the pelagic producer-consumer interface.

In a previous project, we adapted a sequential extraction procedure for characterizing P in manure into different fractions. This procedure features extracting a manure sample with deionized water (H2O) repeatedly until the water soluble P is exhausted, followed by repeated similar extractions with 0.5 M Na-HCO3 (NaHCO3), 0.1 M NaOH (NaOH), and 1.0 M HCl (HCl). The present study employs the same procedure for determining P fraction distributions in an array of manure samples including dairy, swine, and broiler poultry with various manure handling systems. Regardless of manure type or source, water soluble P is the largest single fraction, accounting for 39 to 94% of the total extractable P. Inorganic P dominates the total extractable P in general with a minimum of 63% and a maximum of 98%. Phosphorus release through repeated l-h shaking and extraction follows a general pattern of rapid decrease as the number of repetitions increases. Yet, P release in water extracts continues in considerable amounts after the first two repetitions removed nearly two-thirds or more of the cumulative water soluble P. A simple extraction of l-h shaking with water removed at least 30% of the water soluble P fraction or 16% of the total extractable P, which appears to be a suitable quick test for estimating the relative magnitude of the most vulnerable P fraction in animal manures. There appear to be some differences in P fraction distributions across animal species; for example, the swine and broiler poultry samples exhibited relatively higher proportions of NaHCO3 and HCl-extractable fractions than the dairy manures. Moreover, some manure storage and handling practices apparently resulted in changed P fraction distributions with decreases in water soluble P and increases in the less vulnerable fractions. Additional studies may help us identify manure management tactics for reduced potential losses of P into the environment.

While it is generally accepted that the improved soil properties lead to changes in runoff and soil erosion, few studies have quantified these impacts. Water quality models used to develop watershed assessments and total maximum daily load estimates need a method to account for these changes to accurately estimate loading rates from fields where manure has been land applied. This study was conducted to assemble and summarize information quantifying the effects of manure application on runoff and soil loss resulting from natural precipitation events, and to develop regression equations relating reductions in runoff and soil loss to annual manure application rates. For selected locations on which manure was added annually, runoff was reduced from 1 to 68%, and soil loss decreased from 13 to 77%. Measured runoff and soil loss values were found to be strongly influenced by manure application rates. Regression equations were developed relating reductions in runoff and soil loss to manure application rates for application rates ranging from 11 to 45 Mg/ha, and slope lengths varying from 22 to 39 m.

J	Sun, H; Houston, JE; Thomas, DL				Sun, H; Houston, JE; Thomas, DL			Modeling voluntary participation in a cost-sharing agricultural water quality management program	ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article							GEORGIA COASTAL-PLAIN	This economic analysis of farmers' voluntary adoption of water quality management alternatives integrates three biophysical simulators to predict crop yields and soil erosion/water quality impacts under uncertain weather and market conditions. Farmers' willingness to cost-share was used to estimate expectations of net returns and associated water and soil pollution based upon government cost-share scenarios. Simulations integrated into mathematical programming results indicate that irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer applications do not alter water quality in the Gum Creek Watershed as much as generally anticipated. Under limited government payments, pollution abatement through reduction of irrigation and/or nitrogen fertilizer applications significantly reduces farmers' net revenues and hence, without threats of other regulatory means, more farmers opt out of a voluntary program. Abatement of nitrogen runoff and leaching should consider other management alternatives and include non-agricultural sources of pollution.

J	Bonnet, MP; Poulin, M; Devaux, J				Bonnet, MP; Poulin, M; Devaux, J			Numerical modeling of thermal stratification in a lake reservoir. Methodology and case study	AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article						numerical modeling; hydrodynamics; lake	WATER-QUALITY; PHYTOPLANKTON; SIMULATION; SHALLOW	A numerical model of the hydrodynamic and thermal structure of an artificial lake was designed and developed as a basis for an ecological water-quality model. It allows the quantification of the vertical mixing processes that govern not only the thermal structure but also the nutrient exchanges, and more generally the distribution of dissolved and particulate matter between the different parts of the lake. The vertical temperature profiles were calculated by solving the one-dimensional heat transfer equation that takes into account the internal heat sources and sinks, advection due to inflow and outflow and the molecular and eddy diffusions. A finite-difference discretization of first-order in time and second-order in space was chosen. The numerical time-step was three hours and layers were one-meter in thickness. These time- and space-scales are well-suited to perform a precise simulation of the different processes occurring over a seasonal period. Moreover, this simulation requires only a reasonable amount of computer time. This model was used to study an artificial lake, (i.e. a reservoir), located in the high Loire valley (Roanne, France). To precisely identify the physical processes followed with an accurate numerical modeling, on-site data were acquired intensively over three years. Temperatures were monitored hourly at 11 different levels in the three main reaches of the reservoir to study the lake hydrodynamics and thermal behaviour. Meterological measurements were made every 20 minutes. One-year data were used for calibration, whereas the model was validated using the data collected over the other two years.

Water and soil were obtained from an inactive U ore processing site near Tuba City, Arizona. Two observation wells provided the irrigation water. One was located upgradient from the contaminated site, and was located in the center of the plume downgradient from the area contaminated by the milling operations. A 50/50 mix of the two well waters was used as a third treatment. Concentrations of Se and U in aboveground tissues of saltbush were significantly (P < 0.05) elevated when irrigated with the undiluted contaminated water, but not to unacceptable levels. In the case of Sudan grass, Mo, Se, U, NO3-N, and S were significantly (P < 0.05) elevated in the contaminated water treatment, and all except NO3--N were elevated with the diluted contaminated water, but again within acceptable limits. Saltbush productivity was not significantly (P > 0.05) affected by the three irrigation treatments. Sudan grassaboveground biomass results suggest that the undiluted contaminated plume water could be used for effective crop production, although productivity was significantly better with the nutrient-amended baseline water and the diluted contaminated water. Root biomass was significantly greater in the baseline water irrigation.

J	Cox, JW; Ashley, R				Cox, JW; Ashley, R			Water quality of gully drainage from texture-contrast soils in the Adelaide Hills in low rainfall years	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH			English	Article						pasture; runoff; duplex; acid-sulfate	DEGRADED LANDSCAPES; PHOSPHORUS; CARBON; CATCHMENTS; FEATURES; MOVEMENT; NITROGEN; ANCIENT; AREAS	The volume and quality of drainage water in a gully cutting through a series of waterlogged, saline, sodic, and sulfidic Xeralfs in the Adelaide Hills, South Australia, was studied over 3 years. This was done to gain a better perspective of the relative quantities of contaminants being exported from agricultural catchments in low rainfall agricultural environments. It was found that in low rainfall years, when little overland flow occurs and gully flow is predominantly groundwater discharge and throughflow, loads in the drainage gully were up to 41 kg/ ha. year of sodium and 2 kg/ ha. year of sulfur. Losses of sulfur, magnesium, and calcium followed a similar trend to sodium losses and could be predicted with significant accuracy. The losses of phosphorus (5-7 g/ha. year) and nitrate (<2 g/ ha. year) were less predictable. Phosphorus concentrations were of environmental concern each year whereas nitrate concentrations were only above environmental guidelines in the driest year. All phosphorus in the gully drainage was transported in the dissolved form. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations were usually >26 mg/L and will be costly to treat if used for public water supply.

Most contaminants affecting water quality in rural areas can be grouped into one of three classes: simple inorganic ions, more complex organic molecules, and particulates. Contaminants of all three classes can result from animal manure. In particular, it potentially provides the source of nitrate, phosphate, toxic metals, and bacteria as well as materials that generate high biological oxygen demand. The concentration of contaminants entering water can be different for each class of contaminant, as they are affected by different processes. Organic molecules are affected by vapour pressure, and solubility in water and soil organic matter, simple inorganic compounds are influenced by exchange and adsorption, whereas the transport of microorganisms are affected by surface charge and population dynamics. The organic matter in manure also alters the physicochemical properties of the soil, thereby increasing the mobility of contaminants and resulting in losses from soil under conditions that might suggest that the materials would be less available to leaching and runoff. Preferential flow paths can develop due to structures present in the surface soil or in the subsurface due to soil horizon boundaries. Preferential flow can carry water and contaminants to depth very rapidly. This reduces potential interactions occurring between the soil and contaminants in solution, and, again, can result in greater impact on water quality than might be expected.

J	Carignan, R; D'Arcy, P; Lamontagne, S				Carignan, R; D'Arcy, P; Lamontagne, S			Comparative impacts of fire and forest harvesting on water quality in Boreal Shield lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article							BUDGETS	Water quality was monitored in Boreal Shield lakes for 3 years following their simultaneous impact by clearcut logging or wildfire. Seventeen similar undisturbed lakes served as references. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the light attenuation coefficient (epsilon (PAR)) were up to threefold higher in cut lakes than in reference and burnt lakes. Compared with median values for reference lakes, cut and burnt lakes had higher concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) (two- to three-fold), total organic nitrogen (TON) (twofold), and K+, Cl-, and Ca2+ (up to sixfold). NO3- and SO42- concentrations were up to 60- and 6-fold higher, respectively, in burnt lakes than in reference and cut lakes. In most cases, impacts were directly proportional to the area harvested or burnt divided by the lake's volume or area. These simple models correctly predicted the changes observed in three lakes harvested during the study. Some of the observed effects occur on different time scales. Mobile ions released by fire (K+, Cl-, SO42-, NO3-) or harvesting (K+, Cl-, some DOG) are rapidly flushed out of the watershed (50% decrease in 3 years). Other constituents or properties (TP, TON, DOG, epsilon (PAR), Ca2+, Mg2+) show little change or are still increasing after 3 years and will take a longer time to reach normal levels.

One current concern involves the amount and forms of phosphorus (P) being added to land with manure. The objective of this experiment was to determine the forms and availability of P in soils receiving 4 years of continuous dairy manure applications. Soil samples were collected from lysimeter plots established in 1991 to study the impact of dairy manure applications on surface water and groundwater. Soil P was fractionated into available (NaHCO3), iron (Fe)- and aluminum (Al)-bound (NaOH), and calcium (Ca)-bound (HCl) forms. These data were related to manure application rates, soluble P concentrations, and anion exchange membrane (AEM) bound P. Results indicate that the potential to move P by leaching through these loessial soils is very low even at high manure application rates. Large manure additions resulted in increases in all P forms; however, the inorganic pools increased more than the organic pools. The AEM values were a good tool for predicting potential P movement by soil erosion or runoff with membrane bound P being strongly correlated with manure application rate (r(2)=0.82) and available P (NaHCO3). Best management practices for manure disposal need to consider the potential for P movement through erosion and runoff, and the AEM technique provides a means for evaluating this potential.

B	Merrill, JZ; Cornwell, JC		Weinstein, MP; Kreeger, DA		Merrill, JZ; Cornwell, JC			The role of oligohaline marshes in estuarine nutrient cycling	CONCEPTS AND CONTROVERSIES IN TIDAL MARSH ECOLOGY			English	Proceedings Paper	Meeting on Concepts and Controversies in Tidal Marsh Ecology	APR, 1998	VINELAND, NJ				TIDAL FRESH-WATER; SALT-MARSH; SEDIMENT ACCUMULATION; NITRATE REDUCTION; CHESAPEAKE BAY; AQUATIC SEDIMENTS; HEAVY-METALS; DENITRIFICATION; NITROGEN; NITRIFICATION	Oligohaline marshes, poised at the land-sea margin, often occur where the estuary is most enriched in inorganic particles and nutrients. Although light can limit the production of planktonic communities, high nutrient concentrations and regular tidal inundation results in highly productive macrophyte and algal communities. Despite potentially important water quality values, relatively few detailed studies of N and P cycling in oligohaline marshes are evident in the literature. Because of the temporal variability in marsh flux studies, the net annual retention of N and P is best assessed by measurement ofN and P burial in the sediment. In the Chesapeake Bay and other estuaries and subestuaries, high rates of tidal marsh N and P burial indicate an important water quality function. A recent study shows the marshes of a Chesapeake Bay tributary retain a large portion of nitrogen and phosphorus entering the river from above the fall line. The marshes trap 35% of the nitrogen and 81% of the phosphorus which would otherwise be recycled, exported, or buried in the subtidal sediments of the estuary. Although there are few studies, high nitrate supply rates, potentially high nitrification rates, and high rates of sediment metabolism can result in high rates of denitrification. More complete studies of tidal marsh nutrient cycling, particularly nitrogen cycling, are needed for a better understanding of the importance of these tidal freshwater marshes to estuarine nutrient balances. Alternative methodologies for denitrification measurement are needed for more accurate measurements, and more attention needs to be paid to scaling individual measurements to whole marsh ecosystems. A new method for the measurement of net N-2(g) exchange was applied to a Chesapeake Bay tributary to develop an annual estimate of net denitrification in the marsh sediments. Denitrification rates were similar to 60 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) with high seasonal variability. Annual calculations were made based on a loose correlation to annual ambient nitrate concentrations. This preliminary calculation suggests that an additional 10% of the fall line nitrogen may be removed by such marsh systems. More measurements of net N-2(g) exchange and computer simulation models are required to determine the net removal of fall line nitrogen by the upper estuarine marshes.

Application to an irrigation channel in a Valencian community, Spain	DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATION OF COMPUTER TECHNIQUES TO ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES VIII	ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES SERIES		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Development and Application of Computer Techniques to Environmental Studies	JUN 28-30, 2000	BILBAO, SPAIN	Wessex Inst Technol, Univ Basque Country				This paper presents the sensitivity analysis developed with a mathematical model for Dissolved Oxygen over an irrigation channel in Valencian Community, Spain. This channel transports water from agricultural irrigation, wastewater and industrial discharges, and the processes of dispersion, transport and interaction between the water constituents have been studied. The Dissolved Oxygen (DO) model, developed in finite differences, integrates the Nitrogen cycle and the BOD study within the DO equations. As a result, we can evaluate the concentration of every constituent in the system. We can make also an estimation of the influence of each parameter in the comparison between the data given by the model and the collected data in the real channel. The results have been contrasted with other mathematical surface water model such as QUAL2E. The results have been calibrated with data collected in the channel during a measurement campaign, and in the process of calibration, the sensitivity analysis has been used as a tool for optimising this verification process. The study has pointed out the more influencing parameters in the concentrations over the whole system, and the optimum methodology for calibrating the model, which can be used also in unsteady state pollution situations and in branched systems. As a conclusion we show the results of the sensitivity analysis comparing the more important factors influencing the concentration of DO, BOD, Organic Nitrogen, Nitrite and Nitrate and the calibration methodology for this case.

Traditional in situ sampling is time-consuming, expensive, and can only be taken for small areas with limited samples. It also needs a long-term observation program to acquire biological growth records. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to estimate algal biological parameters, which are important factors of eutrophication control, by using water quality modeling and remote sensing techniques. Algal growth rate and respiration rate were estimated using a one-dimensional water quality model (QUAL2E) and two-dimension spatially distributed water quality data derived from SPOT satellite imagery for the Te-Chi Reservoir in Taiwan. A. nonlinear calibration model was developed by minimizing the average difference between observed and simulated values using a least squares method. The calibration model using a mathematical approach provides an alternative method to estimate biological parameters of algae besides in situ sampling and experiment. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The economic model isa spatial mathematical programming model of US and Canadian swine industries. It is a partial equilibrium model, which is dynamic, regional and incorporates a risk variable. The objective function maximizes market welfare defined as the Marshallian measures of producer and consumer surpluses plus government payments. The objective function does not maximize social welfare, which includes the economic benefits derived from water quality, because economic values for improved water quality do not exist for the areas of interest. The objective is to maximize the area under each region's pork demand Function, adding government payments and subtracting all production, slaughter, processing, storage and distribution costs. The Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) is the environmental model used in concert with the economic modal. Nitrates and phosphates are the environmental indicators. Phosphates being less soluble than nitrates, are lost mainly in runoff and erosion, and hence affect surface water, while nitrates are lost in runoff and leachate contaminating ground and surface waters. The accumulation of phosphates accelerates the eutrophication process while high levels of nitrates in drinking water have been associated with maethemoglobinea, a potentially lethal blood disorder affecting infants under 6 months of age. Since welfare measures are calculated at the regional level, and water quality occurs at the local level, the trends rather than the magnitudes of water quality and welfare changes, are compared to determine if economic and environmental objectives conflict. There are four scenarios: two trade scenarios encompassing important liberalization endeavors and two environmental scenarios simulating potential nutrient management plans. In three cases out of eight, there are trade-offs between welfare and water quality. In the Southeast; including North Carolina, regional welfare decreases due to increased manure disposal costs imposed under both. nutrient plans. Welfare decreases are partly compensated by decreases of nitrates and phosphates in runoff. In Quebec, the elimination of the ban on US live hog imports in Canada allows imports of hogs from the Midwest into Quebec, which accompanies a decrease of hog inventories in Quebec. The welfare change is negative and the change in water quality with respect to nitrogen is positive. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The model predictions were in general agreement with field data in simulating the global growth and decay of phytoplankton. The WASPS model was used for investigation of phytoplakton-nutrient dynamics as well as the comparison with both mathematical and numerical models developed here. The water quality simulation with fine resolution has been performed by a coupled hydrodynamic, transport, and eutrophication model. The hydrodynamic component simulates the main tidally-driven advective flows throughout the Masan Bay and the transport component of the model simulates the movement of dissoved materials in response to the tidally-driven advective and dispersive processes coupled with freshwater from 12 streams flowing into Masan Bay. The transport was determined by a new hybrid method [1] which takes forward-tracking for advection and finite difference approximation for diffusion. All submodels including eutrophication model operate on the same grid. Results are compared with field data obtained in 1995 and they show an encouraging degree of similarity.

J	Havens, KE; Aumen, NG				Havens, KE; Aumen, NG			Hypothesis-driven experimental research is necessary for natural resource management	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						resource management; experimental research	CONSERVATION AREA 2A; ST LUCIE ESTUARY; FLORIDA EVERGLADES; WATER-QUALITY; HUMAN APPROPRIATION; SUBTROPICAL LAKE; NUTRIENT; RESTORATION; CLADIUM; TYPHA	Effective management of natural resources must be grounded in a solid scientific understanding of the ecosystem and its responses to natural and human-induced stress. Such an understanding does not arise easily from observational data and models that are not substantiated by experimental data. Cause-and-effect relationships are more easily documented when observations and/or models are supplemented by hypothesis-driven experimental research. In this paper we present three examples from south Florida where hypothesis-driven experimental research has been combined with observational data collection to address specific resource management questions. These include research to determine: (I)the cause of cattail expansion in the Everglades; (2) a threshold phosphorus concentration for the Everglades; and (3) optimal salinity criteria for Florida estuaries. In each case, the results have led to a better understanding of ecosystem function and more sound guidance for resource managers than was possible without the hypothesis-drive experimental research. Resource managers need to recognize the merits of this holistic approach to environmental science and management if we are to have success in reversing detrimental human impacts on natural ecosystems.

J	Caruso, BS				Caruso, BS			Comparative analysis of New Zealand and US approaches for agricultural nonpoint source pollution management	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						agriculture; nonpoint source pollution; water quality management; New Zealand	PASTURE; WATER; SEDIMENT; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; NETWORK; DESIGN	Nonpoint source (NPS) pollution from widespread agricultural/pastoral land use in New Zealand can result in receiving water quality problems, but the Resource Management Act of 1991 requires the sustainable management of land and water resources. Many similar types of problems occur in the United States, where the Clean Water Act is the primary legislation addressing NPS pollution and progress has been made on the development and use of a variety of management approaches. However, little evaluation and comparison of approaches or cooperation between the two countries has occurred in the past. This type of analysis could provide information that is useful for more effective management of the problem. The goal of this study is to evaluate and compare approaches used in New Zealand and the United States for management of agricultural NPS pollution. The role of the central government in New Zealand is generally limited to research and policy development, and regional councils are responsible for most monitoring and management of the problem. The role of the federal government in the United States includes research and monitoring, policy development, and regulation. States also have a significant management role. Both countries rely on voluntary approaches for NPS pollution management. Very few national water quality standards exist in New Zealand, whereas standards are widely used in the United States. Loading estimates and modeling are often used in the United States. but not in New Zealand. A wide range of best management practices (BMPs) are used in the United States, including buffer strips and constructed/engineered wetlands. Buffer strips and riparian management have been emphasized and used widely in New Zealand. Many approaches are common to both countries, but management of the problem has only been partly successful. The primary barriers are the inadequacy of the voluntary approach and the lack of scientific tools that are useful to decision-makers. More work needs to be performed on the evaluation of approaches developed in both countries that could be applied in the other countries. In addition, more cooperation and information/technology transfer between the two countries should be encouraged in the future.

In this paper, we discuss deposition of three air pollutants: atrazine; total phosphorus; and nitrogen (total Kjeldahl nitrogen and nitrate) to Lake Michigan. Throughout 18 months in 1994-1995, over 600 atmospheric samples (gas, particulate, and precipitation combined) were collected and analyzed for persistent organic pollutants and nutrients. Here the measurements and modeled deposition estimates are presented for atrazine, phosphorus, and nitrogen. Results indicate that concentrations of atrazine in precipitation have remained constant over 5 years (0.10-0.40 mu g L-1), consistent with the nearly constant sales rate of the herbicide over that time period. Actual loading of atrazine to the lake was less in 1994-1995 (1.04 x 10(3) kg y(-1)) than in 1990-1991 (2.6 x 10(3) kg yr(-1)). This difference in loading is due to lower overall precipitation in 1994-1995. Phosphorus concentrations in precipitation, on the other hand, have decreased from an average of 57 mu g as P L-1 in 1976 to an average of 6.36 mu g as P L-1 for 1994-1995.

J	Boyer, JN; Sterling, P; Jones, RD				Boyer, JN; Sterling, P; Jones, RD			Maximizing information from a water quality monitoring network through visualization techniques	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						water quality; estuary; geostatistics; salinity; nutrients; chlorophyll; Florida Bay; coral reef; management	FLORIDA-BAY; KEYS	This paper describes a variety of visualization techniques that have been very useful for demonstrating important aspects of a water quality monitoring programme in South Florida. The first level of visualization was at the single station or grouped stations using the box-and-whisker plot as a graphical/statistical tool. This plot was used to compare intra-annual variability and correlation between total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a (chl a) at a site in Florida Bay. Secondly, time was added as a dimension to produce a 9-year, monthly time series plot of declining salinity at a site in NE Florida Bay. It was shown how a centred moving average could be used to smooth out the noise and disclose inter-annual oscillations. Time series of anomalies from long term means were discussed as a means of displaying correspondence and coupling among variables. Thirdly, the utility of 2-D contour maps of variables was demonstrated in showing sources and mixing of fresh water across the hydroscape as well as nutrient loading to the South Florida ecosystem. From this expanded spatial view, it was observed that the water quality of different bays and coastal areas are differentially affected both by external and internal processes and how management of pump operations and canal conductance can overwhelm the natural hydrological cycle and have far reaching impacts in Florida Bay and the SW Florida Shelf. We also showed that contouring was useful for elucidating causal relationships among variables over the spatial domain. Time step animations of monthly salinity contours in Florida Bay showed the importance of mixing with western boundary waters to alleviation of hypersaline conditions. These animations also showed that it is the shifting lags between TP concentration and chi a which make it so difficult to derive a simple regression model. Finally, a 3-D volumetric rendering of the area between Key West and the Tortugas was used to describe a strong density stratification event during July 1998 and to visualize the source of water masses and general circulation patterns in this region. It is concluded that visualization techniques are useful not only to show patterns in the data but in developing new hypotheses for future research and monitoring activities. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

However, its export in watershed runoff can accelerate the eutrophication of receiving fresh waters. The specialization of crop and livestock farming has created regional imbalances in P inputs in feed and fertilizer and output in farm produce. In many areas, soil P exceeds crop needs and has enriched surface runoff with P. This paper provides a brief overview of P management strategies to maintain agricultural production and protect water quality that were discussed at the conference, "Practical and Innovative Measures for the Control of Agricultural Phosphorus Losses to Water," sponsored by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and held in Antrim, Northern Ireland, June 1998. The purpose of the conference was to assess current strategies for reducing the loads and concentrations of P from agricultural land to surface waters. Topics discussed at the interdisciplinary conference and reviewed here included sustainable P management in productive agriculture; assessing land application of P; evaluating and modeling P transport and transformations in soil, runoff, streams, and lakes; and implementation of integrated best management practices (BMPs). From these discussions, measures to control agricultural P transfer from soil to water may be brought about by optimizing fertilizer P use-efficiency, refining animal feed rations, using feed additives to increase P absorption by the animal, moving manure from surplus to deficit areas, and targeting conservation practices, such as reduced tillage, buffer strips, and cover crops, to critical areas of P export from a watershed.

While this approach has had clear advantages for standing waters, potential benefits for flowing freshwater systems are more difficult to predict. As a consequence of the unidirectional and dynamic nature of flow in rivers, temporal and spatial separations between the source of P and the point of potential impact are introduced when considering a whole watershed. The ability to quantify the residence time of P within any particular part of a river system is therefore essential so that the specific contribution of individual P sources to biological demand ran be determined. The smaller algal biomass productivity measured in flowing, compared with standing, waters at a similar supply rate of P indicates the need to consider the roles of other watershed factors in modifying the relationship between growth and P supply. The site-specific nature of responses to P suggests a need to develop a hierarchical classification system where individual river sections can be ranked according to their likely responsiveness to P. The ecoregion concept, combined with stream order, would integrate spatial and temporal aspects of gradient, land use, flow velocity, and water quality. For this to be successful, we must demonstrate a link between perturbations to the terrestrial P cycle, the delivery of P to flowing waters, and a biological impact.

J	Liu, WC; Hsu, MH; Kuo, AY				Liu, WC; Hsu, MH; Kuo, AY			Sensitivity analysis of a mathematical model of chlorophyll distribution in the tidal Keelung River	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						chlorophyll distribution; numerical model; Keelung River; water quality; sensitivity analysis; light extinction	PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS; ESTUARIES; DELAWARE; CHESAPEAKE; TURBIDITY; GROWTH; BAY	Large temporal and spatial variations in chlorophyll concentration found in estuarine and coastal waters have been attributed to a diverse set of physical, chemical and biological factors. The Keelung River has the largest tidal excursion and the most serious pollution problem among the three tributaries of the Tanshui River system in northern Taiwan. It receives extremely high anthropogenic nutrient loadings from municipal and industrial discharges with little or no treatment. The observed data show very high nutrient concentrations in the river, with total nitrogen of order of several milligrams per liter and total phosphorus of 1 mg/l. However, the summer chlorophyll 'a' concentrations are generally less than 10 mu g/l. A time-dependent, laterally averaged, two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model (HEM-2DT) was applied to the tidal reach of the Tanshui River estuarine system to simulate the phytoplankton dynamics, nutrient cycling and dissolved oxygen distribution. The numerical model was calibrated and verified with observed chlorophyll 'a' and nutrient distributions in the Keelung River, and then used to investigate the various factors regulating chlorophyll 'a' distributions in that river. The sensitivity analyses include water-column light extinction, nutrient reduction, freshwater discharge, boundary condition and effect of salinity distribution. The result reveals that light availability is the predominant limiting factor of phytoplankton growth, while nutrient concentrations an not limiting. The reduction of nutrient N and P Loadings have no effect on chlorophyll 'a' concentration in the Keelung River.

The Riparian Ecosystem Management model (REMM) has been developed for researchers and natural resource agencies as a modeling tool that can help quantify the water quality benefits of riparian buffers under varying site conditions. Processes simulated in REMM include surface and subsurface hydrology; sediment transport and deposition; carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus transport removal and cycling; and vegetation growth. Management options, such as vegetation type size of the buffer zone, and biomass harvesting also can be simulated. REMM can be used in conjunction with upland models, empirical data, or estimated loadings to examine scenarios of buffer zone design for a hillslope. Evaluation of REMM simulations with field observations shows generally good agreement between simulated and observed data for groundwater nitrate concentrations and water table depths in a mature riparian forest buffer. Sensitivity analysis showed that changes that influenced the water balance ol soil moisture storage affected the streamflow output. Parameter changes that influence either hydrology or rates of nutrient cycling affected total N transport and plant N uptake.

J	Eghball, B; Gilley, JE; Kramer, LA; Moorman, TB				Eghball, B; Gilley, JE; Kramer, LA; Moorman, TB			Narrow grass hedge effects on phosphorus and nitrogen in runoff following manure and fertilizer application	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						beef cattle manure; erosion; eutrophication; fertilizer; hypoxia; no-till; water quality	FILTER STRIPS; SOIL; MOVEMENT	Runoff losses of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from field applied manure can contribute to surface water pollution. Grass hedges may reduce runoff losses of nutrients and sediment The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of narrow switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) hedges (similar to 0.75 m wide) on the transport of P and N from afield receiving beef cattle feedlot manure under tilled and no-till renditions. This study was conducted on a steep (12 % average slope) Monona silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls) soil near Treynor, Iowa. The experiment was a split-plot with no-till and disked systems as main plots and subplots of manure, fertilizer and check with or without a grass hedge. A rainfall simulator was used and runoff was collected from both the initial and the following wet simulations. Only 38% of the no-till plots and 63% of disked plots had any runoff during the initial 6.4 cm hr(-1) water application. A single narrow grass hedge reduced runoff concentrations of dissolved P (DP) by 47%, bioavailable P (BAP) by 48%, particulate P (PP) by 38%, total P (TP) by 40%, and NH4-N by 60% during the wet simulation on the no-till plots receiving manure, compared with similar plots with no hedges. The corresponding reductions in concentrations as a result of a grass hedge for DP, BAP, PP, TP, and NH4-N on the disked plots were 21, 29, 43, 38, and 52%, respectively. Runoff NH4-N concentration from fertilizer applied to the disked plots was reduced by 61%, NO3-N by 21%, and total N (TN) by 27% during the wet simulation when grass hedges were used. Grass hedges also reduced total quantities of DP, BAP, TP, and NH4-N during the wet simulation. The TP loss was 3.3% of applied P fertilizer and was 0.3% of applied manure P.

Public record were wed to document the manure management practices of 10 CAFOs housing 59,700 finishing hogs in a 1,554 ha area of Hamilton County, Iowa. Together, the CAFOs generated an estimated 811,500 kg of nitrogen (N) each year, more than 70% of which volatilized into the atmosphere. CAFOs minimized the area required for applying manure by underestimating manure N content, projecting above average crop yields, and applying manure to soybeans. Some fields were claimed by more than one CAFO, and some field sizes were overestimated Manure application based on crop demand for phosphorus would require 9,350 ha of cropland, compared to the 990 ha used by CAFOs. Several policy changes could alleviate the nutrient management problems inherent in CAFOs.

This paper investigates the environmental and economic consequences of altering nitrogen fertilizer practices for a central Illinois watershed. A model of the watershed is employed to assess the impacts of the alternative management practices. The model incorporates heterogeneity of soil types and characterizes lake water quality as a weather-driven random process affected by production practices. Results indicate that improvements in surface water quality can be obtained while increasing fram profits by reducing nitrogen fertilizer application levels. Varying the timing of fertilizer application does improve water quality, but also increases the variability of farm profits.

NSGA Northwest is a Navy Communications Facility on which the Navy, the Marines, the Coast Guard and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) have facilities. The watershed has a baseline nonpoint source pollution (NPS) contributing to the Northwest River that eventually influxes to the Chesapeake Bay. Stormwater runoff discharge from the watershed influxes to the Northwest River, approximately 6.44 km (4 miles) upstream of the intake from the City of Chesapeake's potable water supply. A distributed parameter water quality model and Geographic Information System (GIS) framework was implemented to develop a spatiotemporal waste load allocation (WLA) protocols and total maximum daily load (TMDL) estimation to abate the current level of NPS pollution at the same time to preserve the quality of drinking water supply at the Northwest River. A Unix-based Arc/INFO GIS was linked to an event-based, large problem domain distributed parameter water quality model to generate runoff synthesis and subsequent transport of pollutants and sediment from the watershed. Linking such models to GIS can facilitate better data manipulation and analysis than conventional methods of manually and separately preparing data. This bilateral linkage framework resulted in a powerful, up-to-date tool that would be capable of monitoring and instantaneously visualizing the transport of any pollutant as well as effectively identifying critical areas of the NPS pollution. The framework was also used to simulate various "what if" scenarios of event-based and background load (BL) of pollutants to develop WLA and TMDL through regulatory best management practice (BMP) protocols. Results showed that the optimal BMP scenario achieved an average reduction of about 41% in soluble and sediment-attached nitrogen and about 62% reduction in soluble and sediment phosphorous from current NPS pollution levels.

J	Pryor, SC; Barthelmie, RJ				Pryor, SC; Barthelmie, RJ			Particle dry deposition to water surfaces: Processes and consequences	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN DEPOSITION; ORGANIC NITROGEN; AMMONIUM-NITRATE; GREAT-LAKES; AEROSOL; FLUXES; BAY; ACID; SEA; ECOSYSTEM	Algal blooms (increased abundance of phytoplankton) are an increasingly common phenomenon which has been causally linked to increased fluxes of nutrient (particularly nitrogenous) compounds to aquatic ecosystems. These blooms have implications for water quality and human health in addition to ecosystem productivity, health and ecological diversity. Anthropogenic emissions of nitrogen to the atmosphere are estimated to be comparable to, or greater than, biogenic emissions but are considerably more concentrated in space. Although fluvial pathways typically dominate the annually averaged nitrogen flux to coastal waters, atmosphere-surface exchange represents a significant component of the total flux and may be particularly critical during the summertime when both the riverine input and ambient nutrient concentrations are often at a minimum. In this chapter, we present an overview of the physical and chemical processes which dictate the quantity (and direction) of atmosphere-surface fluxes of trace chemicals to (and above) water surfaces with particular emphasis on the role of particles. Dry deposition (transfer to the surface in the absence of precipitation) of particles is determined by meteorological conditions, atmospheric concentrations, surface type/ condition and the specific chemical and physical properties of the particle. Dry deposition can be conceptualized as a three-step process: (1) the gas or particle is moved toward the surface by thermally or mechanically driven eddies; (2) it is transferred by diffusion across a thin layer close to the surface where turbulence is absent; and (3) the gas or particle is captured by the surface. In the case of larger particles a second parallel pathway exists; particles are drawn towards the surface by gravity, Atmospheric particles determine dry deposition fluxes not only by serving as a conduit for transfer but also because of their action as sources or sinks of trace gases. The example given here is the transfer of nitric acid to sea salt particles as a result of heterogeneous chemistry acting as a competing sink to surface removal. To illustrate the importance of current uncertainties in our understanding of dry deposition processes and to highlight the role of some of the key parameters in determining the transfer rate (the deposition velocity) a simple model of particle dry deposition is presented. The model describes the calculation of the rate at which a particle of a given size and chemical composition will be moved towards the surface under given environmental conditions. Observational and experimental techniques for measuring dry deposition fluxes are also reviewed. The techniques used for gases are largely reliant on use of highly temporally resolved sampling (e.g., concentrations sampled 10 times per second) or highly accurate and precise measurements of concentrations, either in the vertical to resolve the gradient to or from the surface or conditionally sampled by the direction of transfer (to or from the surface). These stringent measurement requirements represent significant barriers to application to measurement of particle dry deposition fluxes although, as discussed, innovative solutions are now becoming available. In the final section, we examine meteorological controls on deposition to the coastal zone. This region of the world's oceans and seas is most significantly impacted by human activities. More than half of the world's population lives within 100 km of a coast and hence the overwhelming majority of anthropogenic fluxes to aquatic systems occur in the coastal zone. We discuss the particular challenges that arise from efforts to simulate and measure fluxes close to the coastline. These arise in part from the complexity of atmospheric flow in this region where energy and chemical fluxes are highly inhomogeneous in space and time and thermally generated atmospheric circulations are commonplace.

We evaluated the dynamics of P concentration and load in surface irrigation runoff across a range of soil P availabilities. Ortho-P was related to soil P availability while total-P was related to sediment concentration. Ortho-P concentration increased as the water advanced down the field and then decreased with time. Total-P concentration decreased with both time and distance. Prediction of P losses under surface irrigation will not be possible unless soil erosion can be predicted. Additional studies are needed to identify and describe the physical and chemical processes affecting P losses from irrigated soils.

The closed system consisted of rearing thank, foam-separation and nitrification units, pH and temperature controlling units, and a circulation pump. Fish were fed commercial pellet diet for 90 days. Average values of oxygen saturation and turbidity in the rearing water through the culture were 96% and 3.1 TU, respectively. Ammonia was mostly kept at less than 1 mg-N/l, and nitrate increased linearly according to the amount of diet supplied. It is estimated that 33% of dietary carbon (C) was accumulated in the fish, as well as 52% of nitrogen (N), and 26% of phosphorus (P). The carbon released as CO2 was 63%. Nitrate in the rearing water corresponded to 28% of N-input, and 66% of P was settled in the nitrification unit as precipitate.

In bio-optical models the quantum efficiency of carbon fixation derived from C-14 incorporation rates, the photosynthetically absorbed radiation derived from the underwater light climate, and the phytoplankton absorption spectra are used to calculate time- and depth-integrated primary productivity. Due to the increased sensitivity of commercially available fluorometers, chlorophyll a in vivo fluorescence became a new tool to assess the photosynthetic activity of phytoplankton. Since fluorescence data yield only relative photosynthetic electron transport rates, a direct conversion into absolute carbon fixation rates is not possible. Here, we report a procedure how this problem can be adressed in freshwater phytoplankton. We adapted a marine bio-optical model to the freshwater situation and tested if this model yields realistic results when applied to a hypertrophic freshwater reservoir. Comparison of primary productivity derived from C-14 incorporation to primary productivity derived from Chi a fluorescence showed that the conversion of fluorescence data into carbon fixation rates is still an unsolved problem. Absolute electron transport rates calculated from fluorescence data tend to overestimate primary production. We propose that the observed differences are caused mainly by neglecting the package effect of pigments in phytoplankton cells and by non-carbon related electron flow (e.g., nitrogen fixation). On the other hand, the C-14 incorporation rates can be artificially influenced by ''bottle effects", especially near the water surface, where photoinhibition, photorespiration, and Mehler reaction can play a major role.

This study analyzes the patterns of tile flows and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations in tile water in relation to rainfall events using field measured data as well as invoking the macropore option of the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM98). The increase in NO3-N concentration in tile flow during the growing season in comparison with the decrease in NO3-N concentrations after the crop harvest following heavy rainfalls support the role of dual flow theory, soil matrix flow and preferential flow. These results and model simulations suggest that variation in macropore during the growing season can have significant effect on tile flow and NO3-N concentrations in tile water for soils similar to the study area.

Field experiments were conducted to quantify tillage (chisel, moldboard, ridge and no-till) effects on subsurface drain flow and losses of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), atrazine, and alachlor to shallow groundwater. Rapid increase in subsurface drain flow rates following heavy rains indicate the preferential movements of rain water to subsurface tile drains. The sudden decreases in NO3-N concentrations and increase in the concentrations of atrazine, and alachlor in subsurface drain water, particularly under no-till and ridge till systems, supports the role of preferential flow paths to carry contaminants to shallow water table depth and its overall effects on groundwater quality.

Biosolids, yard waste, and West Palm Beach biosolid/yard waste co-compost (WPCC) were incubated for six months in a raised-bed, polyethylene-mulched, vegetable cropping system and in a raised-bed citrus cropping system. Compost samples were packed into PVC columns (8 cm high and 5 cm diameter) and inserted vertically into the upper layer of Oldsmar sand (sandy, siliceous, hyperthermic Alfic Arenic Haplaquods) of each cropping system. The top of each column was capped to reduce leaching and volatilization loss of N and the bottom was fitted with a 400-mesh nylon screen to allow movement of water. A compost sample and a soil core (20 cm high and 6 cm diameter) below each column were taken at 30-d intervals to measure the amount of N mineralized. Nitrogen mineralization rates ranged from 2.5% (yard waste) to 29% (biosolids), based on a KCl extraction estimation. Nitrogen mineralization rates were higher in the citrus than in the vegetable production system with the biosolids and yard waste, whereas the reverse occurred with the WPCC. The dominant mineral N was NH4-N in the biosolids and yard waste, but NO3-N dominated in the WPCC. The increased concentration of mineral N in the soil sample below each column was positively related to mineral N concentration in the composts. Timing and rate of compost applications that contain high concentrations of N are critical because NO3-N accumulated in soil from organic amendment mineralization may be leached and can potentially affect water quality.

This paper presents laboratory results of the effect of land-dried biosolids on acid generating (AG) waste rock. The impact was determined through analysis of water percolated through soil columns. The experiment consisted of four columns that were Subjected to weekly water additions over 8 to 10 hour cycles. Materials in the columns were layered in various combinations using land-dried biosolids, neutral waste rock, AG fines and AG waste rock. The leaching schedule was designed to simulate 17 weeks of non-winter field conditions. Percolate water quality was monitored weekly for: pH, conductivity, sulphate, acidity, alkalinity, dissolved metals and hardness. Waste rock and biosolids were characterized in terms of pH, particle size distribution, and nutrient and total metal concentrations. Acid-Base Accounting (ABA) was performed for both the neutral and AG waste rock and the AG fines. All four columns were saturated and reached the desired baseline condition for data comparison after two leaching cycles. There appeared to be a significant difference between the mass released from columns treated with land-dried biosolids when compared with the control column results. For example, when comparing Column 2 results with its control column results, the mass released from Column 2 between week 3 and week 17 was roughly 50% lower in: acidity at pH 4.5, acidity at pH 8.3, sulphate, aluminum, cobalt, manganese, and phosphorus; 60% lower in iron and arsenic; and 80% lower in zinc and cadmium. The mass collected from Column 2 was about 30% higher for calcium, 45% for hardness and 134% for magnesium in compared with control column results.

The major features of the ecological functioning of the reservoir were analysed on the basis of results obtained in a 3-year routine sampling programme where the main variables of water quality were determined upstream, downstream and within the reservoir. Planktonic and benthic processes were also investigated in 1 year. A model of the reservoir was developed by coupling the RIVE model (which describes the major microbiological processes involved in the ecological functioning of aquatic systems), with a description of the morphology and hydrology of the reservoir. The model was used to simulate the seasonal and year-to-year variations of nutrients (N, P, Si) and phytoplankton biomass, and to compare them with the observed data. The model was then used to explore the effect of different control factors on denitrification, namely residence times and phosphorus loading. The results showed little influence on the absolute amount of nitrate denitrified within a realistic range of residence times and phosphorus loading. The Marne reservoir appears however to be a significant sink for nitrate (40% of the influx is eliminated), but this reduction represents only 10% of the nitrate flux at the outlet of the Marne sub-basin.

B	Johansson, JOR; Greening, HS		Bortone, SA		Johansson, JOR; Greening, HS			Seagrass restoration in Tampa Bay: A resource-based approach to estuarine management	SEAGRASSES: MONITORING, ECOLOGY, PHYSIOLOGY, AND MANAGEMENT	MARINE SCIENCE SERIES		English	Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Subtropical and Tropical Seagrass Management Ecology - Responses to Environmental Stress	OCT 14-16, 1998	FT MYERS, FL					Historical (pre-1930s) seagrass meadows in Tampa Bay are believed to have covered 31,000 ha of the shallow bay bottom. However, impacts to the bay from increasing population and industrial development of the Tampa Bay area resulted in large seagrass reductions. By 1982, approximately 8,800 ha of seagrass remained. Recently, Tampa Bay seagrass monitoring programs have shown that the trend of seagrass loss has been reversed. The bay-wide seagrass cover in 1997, was estimated at 10,930 ha. In Hillsborough Bay, the bay segment that historically has had the poorest water quality, seagrass increased from near 0 ha in 1984 to about 57 ha in 1998. The Tampa Bay seagrass expansion apparently started,in response to water quality improvements that occurred from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s, which included reductions in phytoplankton biomass and water column light attenuation. These improvements followed;a nearly 50% reduction in external nitrogen loading from domestic and industrial point-sources, primarily discharging to Hillsborough Bay, that occurred in the early 1980s. However, most recently, high rainfall amounts during the years 1995, 1996, and the 1997-1998 El Nino event increased nitrogen loading to the bay. Both phytoplankton biomass and light attenuation increased in all major bay segments during this period of high rainfall. These influences on seagrass growth are often detrimental and appear to have reduced the rate of seagrass expansion during the last few years. The reduced rate of expansion is most evident in the Hillsborough Bay section of Tampa Bay for which the most detailed and current seagrass information: is available. Recognizing the link between nitrogen loading, water quality, and seagrass protection, local, state, and federal partners working cooperatively through the Tampa Bay National Estuary Program (TBNEP) have agreed to adopt nitrogen loading targets for Tampa Bay based on the light requirements of Thalassia testudinum. A long-term goal has been adopted to achieve 15,400 ha of seagrass coverage, or 95% of the seagrass estimated for 1950. Reaching the goal will require preservation of the approximately 10,400 ha of seagrass present in the bay in 1992 and restoration of an additional 5,000 ha. Field measurements in Tampa Bay indicate that 20-25% of surface irradiance is required for sustained growth of T. testudinum. Two independent water quality models were used to estimate nitrogen loading rates and associated water column chlorophyll a concentrations required to maintain irradiance levels at the apparent maximum depth of seagrass growth in 1950 for each major bay segment. Based on monitoring data, it appears that light levels can be maintained at these depths in most bay segments with the existing nitrogen loading rates. However, to achieve the longterm seagrass restoration goal, increases in nitrogen loading associated with a projected increase in the watershed's human population must be offset. TBNEP partners have, therefore, identified and committed to specific nitrogen load reduction projects to ensure that nitrogen management targets are met. An interagency bay-wide seagrass monitoring program has been established to document the progress of Tampa Bay seagrass protection and restoration. Citizen-based educational and voluntary programs are underway to help reduce propeller scarring of seagrass meadows and to plant seagrass in areas which currently lack vegetation.

J	Sohma, A; Sato, T; Nakata, K				Sohma, A; Sato, T; Nakata, K			New numerical model study on a tidal flat system - Seasonal, daily and tidal variations	SPILL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY BULLETIN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Marine Environmental Modelling Seminar	MAR, 1999	LILLEHAMMER, NORWAY					We developed a new numerical model to investigate the dynamics of tidal flat ecosystems and their role in water quality in terms of the carbon cycle. This model was applied to Isshiki, a natural tidal flat area, which is the largest in Mikawa Bay, Japan. This model dealt with variations of biochemical or physical interaction among dissolved oxygen and C-N-P species (comprised of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus elements) both on a short-time scale (<24 h) as well as over a long-time scale (seasonal variation), The model indicated that the time dependence on phytoplankton, NH4-N, NOx-N, and PO4-P are more sensitive to daily environmental variation than to seasonal environmental variation, This means that the rotation speed of these materials in the tidal flat area is fast. Here, we defined the rotation speed as the ratio of total fluxes of substance to the mass of the substance, Phytoplankton with a high rotation speed in the tidal flat area means that the tidal hat has the potential to recover from rapidly increasing phytoplankton: red tide. The model also indicated that the peculiar feature of the tidal flat is the mineralization of organic material. The effect on a long term base, is that it prevents the accumulation of sediment, which results in controlling the increase of oxygen consumption in benthic system, which is the cause of oxygen depleted water.

And yet the onset of HAB, a worldwide problem, is notoriously difficult to predict. This paper describes the design, development, and initial operation of a real time, remotely controlled, early warning system for algal blooms and red tides in a coastal field research station. The system measures solar radiation, wind velocity, tidal level and velocity, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll fluorescence at three depths, supplemented by regular onsite sampling for subsequent chemical analysis of nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations, and taxonomic examination. An example of successful detection and monitoring of an algal bloom event (and also a red tide) is given. Preliminary results of modelling chlorophyll concentrations using artificial neural networks (ANN) are also presented. Different network structures are trained on a six year biweekly water quality data set, and tested on an independent 3 year data set. Unlike previous work on limnological and riverine applications, the results show that rather good predictions of long term trends in algal biomass can be obtained using only Chlorophyl-ad and (or without) total inorganic nitrogen (time delayed for one week) as input nodes. On the other hand, the phase error of predictions renders the ANN method unsuitable for short term forecasts of algal blooms - which can take off and collapse in 7-10 days.

The data indicated that groundwater in the associated alluvium generally is <20 years old with estimated recharge rates from about 10 to >100 cm year(-1). Most groundwater is derived from surface water, as shown by H2O and U isotope analyses. Seasonal losses of canal water to the aquifer cause changes in groundwater quality. in the deepest parts of the alluvium, some water quality may reflect precipitation recharge, older river water, or cross-formational flow. The distribution and isotopic composition of NO3- are consistent with increased fertilizer use over time. Relatively high U concentrations in groundwater may be attributed to dissolution of volcanic ash or other minerals in underlying bedrock. The relatively high concentration of U in surface water at times is attributed to seepage from U-rich groundwater and flow of U-rich surface water from a tributary.

Four years (1993-1996) of field data from an Iowa site were used for model calibration and validation. The SCS curve number and effective rooting depth were adjusted to minimize the difference between simulated percolation below the root zone and measured subsurface drain flows. Model predictions of percolation water below the root zone followed the pattern of measured drain flow data, giving an average difference of 10% and -5% between predicted and measured values for manured and UAN-fertilized plots, respectively, for four years from 1993 to 1996. Model simulations for overall NO3-N losses with percolation water were comparable to measured NO3-N losses with subsurface drain water gibing an average difference of 20% for manured plots. The model overpredicted NO3-N losses, particularly for soybean on plots which received manure in the previous year. Predicted NO3-N losses with subsurface drainage from fertilized plots were much lower than measured values with an average difference of -32%. The best fit line with zero intercept showed correlation coefficients of 0.73 and 0.66 between monthly predicted and measured NO3-N losses with subsurface drain flows for manured and UAN-fertilized plots for four years from 1993 to 1996, respectively. The results of the study show that the N-transformation processes and the associated rate factors based on soil temperature and soil water levels may need to be refined for consistent simulation of NO3-N losses with subsurface drainage water when fertilized with either swine manure or UAN for corn production.

The concentration of total mercury in the lake water samples was similar to those observed in other natural water systems. Mercury concentration in the lakes correlated positively with aluminum, total organic carbon, color, iron, and total nitrogens and inversely with pH and sulfate. The lake water quality parameters were placed in three distinct groups using principal component and cluster analyses. The chemical constituents in the groups were identified as being associated with lake watershed geology, atmospheric washouts of long range transported acidic pollutants and dust particles, and a marine source. Stepwise multiple regression applied to the variables in the same principal component and strongly correlating with mercury identified total organic carbon, total nitrogen, pH, aluminum and iron as the best predictors for total mercury concentrations in the study lakes.

J	Mattson, A; Li, J; Sherman, K				Mattson, A; Li, J; Sherman, K			Urban stormwater management strategy for the Severn Sound remedial action plan	WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA			English	Article						Areas of Concern (AOCs); Great Lakes basin; Severn Sound; stormwater management; microbiological pollution; urban stormwater pollution; pollution control planning		Urban stormwater has been identified as a significant source of phosphorus to Severn Sound and a potential source of bacterial contamination which can affect recreational bathing areas within the Sound. In order to develop an effective remedial action plan, a cooperative study of urban stormwater impacts was initiated in the Severn Sound Area of Concern (AOC) through a joint partnership that included Environment Canada (Great Lakes 2000 Cleanup Fund), the Ontario Ministry of the Environment the Simcoe County District Health Unit, and various municipalities in the Sound. The study objectives were (1) characterization of dry weather and runoff quantity and quality; (2) monitoring effects of stormwater runoff on the bacterial concentrations at an urban bathing area; and (3) development of pollution control plans for the participating urban municipalities in the Severn Sound watershed with an overall goal of a 20% reduction of stormwater phosphorus loads. In general, the event mean concentrations of most runoff pollutants lie either within the range or below ranges reported by previous stormwater studies in Canada and the U.S,, while some runoff pollutant concentrations (e.g., E. coli, heavy metals and nutrients) exceed the Ontario provincial water quality objectives. The bathing area sampling program recorded E. coli concentrations exceeding 600 organisms/100 mt at an outfall right after storm events started. Based on the limited sampling, it appears that rain events of approximately 20 mm or more may result in impingement of water with elevated E. coli counts on this bathing area within 6 hours of the onset of a rain event In order to update pollution loading estimates and develop pollution control plans, a retrofit stormwater management model was applied. The planning model estimates an annual phosphorus loading of 1083 kg/year and a 20% reduction of phosporus loading, using source controls such as downspout disconnections and oil/water interceptors, drainage system controls such as grassed ditches and exfiltration systems, and downstream control such as water quality ponds. Pollution control plans were developed for each participating municipality based on the retrofit opportunities identified through the modelling exercise. The estimated cost is about $4 million. These plans provide specific recommendations regarding the implementation of various stormwater retrofit measures and their financial requirements. A water quality pond identified by the pollution control plan for the Town of Penetanguishene has since been implemented.

As part of this program, stream channel reference sites located in Rock Creek are used to monitor both water quality and geomorphic parameters. Rock Creek is a highly buffered system, with high alkalinity and pH values. With the exception of chloride and total organic carbon, all ion concentrations showed a strong negative correlation to instantaneous discharge. Sodium, calcium, and potassium showed the strongest correlation to discharge. A high correlation exists between sulfate and potassium, magnesium, and calcium. Magnesium and sulfate had the highest ion concentrations in Rock Creek, and calcium concentrations were also substantial. Nutrient levels in Rock Creek are low; most samples of total nitrogen, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, nitrite, ammonia, total phosphate, and ortho phosphate fell below detection limits. Permanent cross-sections showed some erosion and deposition and movement of the thalweg within the channel. Rock Creek is classified as a Rosgen Type A3 stream, which are described as steep, entrenched and confined, with low sinuosities and unconsolidated, heterogeneous, noncohesive channel materials. The A3 bedform has a step/pool cascading channel and stores large amounts of sediment in the pools and behind debris dams. This paper describes previous work conducted in Rock Creek, protocol development for stream channel reference sites, and provides a preliminary analysis of both water chemistry and channel morphometry data.

J	Yi, Y				Yi, Y			Modeling growth of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in a cage-cum-pond integrated culture system	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						bioenergetics; model; growth; Nile tilapia; integrated	FISH BIOENERGETICS; AQUACULTURE PONDS; SIZE; TEMPERATURE; METABOLISM; YIELD	A bioenergetics model was developed to simulate growth of both caged and open-pond Nile tilapia in a cage-cum-pond integrated culture system. The model incorporated six key variables affecting Nile tilapia growth in the cage-cum-pond integrated culture system: body size, water temperature, photoperiod, dissolved oxygen, unionized ammonia and food availability. Caged tilapia were given artificial feed, while growth of open-pond tilapia was dependent on uneaten artificial feed from the caged tilapia and natural foods derived from cage wastes. In the model, availability of natural foods was estimated by a relative feeding level parameter, which was a function of potential net primary productivity based on fish standing crop and the limiting nutrients in the ponds. The model was validated using growth data for both caged and open-pond tilapia in 28 ponds. The model described 96 and 85% of the variance in growth of caged and open-pond tilapia, respectively. Statistical analyses indicated significant agreements between predicted and observed values for both cage and open-pond systems. The model showed that the growth of open-pond tilapia was limited by phosphorus limiting primary production when the total number of tilapia stocked in cages was not greater than 200 fish pond(-1), beyond which the limiting nutrient was phosphorus at the beginning of experiments and then shifted to nitrogen. The percentages of the culture period during which nitrogen limitation occurred increased from 0 to 84.4% with the increase of artificial feed inputs. The model revealed nitrogen from biological nitrogen fixation accounted for 44.2-74.8% of total nitrogen available for primary production. Under the model assumptions, pelleted feed accounted only for 13.8-14.6% growth of open-pond tilapia when dissolved oxygen was above the critical limit (1.2 mg 1(-1)) for caged tilapia during entire experimental period, however, the percentages ranged from 19.0 to 51.0% when dissolved oxygen was below this critical limit. Sensitivity analysis showed that parameters for caged tilapia affected growth of open-pond tilapia but not the reverse, and lowering water quality by decreasing dissolved oxygen or raising unionized ammonia for 10% further reduced growth of caged tilapia, but increased growth of open-pond tilapia.

The present study focused on updating existing estimates of the riverine nutrient contributions and on improving the favailable information on temporal and spatial variation in such input. The results show that the gulf received an average of 113,300 tons of nitrogen, 2050 tons of phosphorus and 64,900 tons of dissolved silica (DSi) annually during the time period 1977-1995. There was large interannual variation in loads, e.g., a factor two difference was found between the two most extreme years (1984 and 1990); this was attributed mainly to natural variation in water discharge. The seasonal distribution of nutrient loads exhibited a distinct pattern for practically all studied constituents, especially nitrate. Loads were high during the spring-flow and relatively low during the low-flow summer period. Examination of the spatial variation of nutrient loads showed that the Daugava River alone accounted for approximately 60% of the total riverine load. The highest area-specific loads of nitrate and phosphate were observed in the agriculturally dominated Lielupe River, and the highest loads of organic-nitrogen (org-N) and total phophorus (tot-P) were found in the Parnu River. However, the values for all the studied rivers and constituents were rather low (phosphorus) or moderate (nitrogen and silica) compared to those reported for many other drainage areas of the Baltic Sea. This was true despite the inefficient sewage treatment and intensive agriculture in the studied basins in the 1970s and 1980s. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Cruise, JF; Limaye, AS; Al-Abed, N				Cruise, JF; Limaye, AS; Al-Abed, N			Assessment of impacts of climate change on water quality in the southeastern United States	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						climate change; regional assessment; water quality; modeling	MODEL; GIS	An assessment of current and future water quality conditions in the southeastern United States has been conducted using the EPA BASINS GIS/database system. The analysis has been conducted for dissolved oxygen, total nitrate nitrogen and pH. Future streamflow conditions have been predicted for the region based on the United Kingdom Hadley Center climate model. Thus far, the analyses have been conducted at a fairly coarse spatial scale due to time and resource limitations. Two hydrologic modeling techniques have been employed in future streamflow prediction: a regional stochastic approach and the application of a physically based soil moisture model. The regional model has been applied to the entire area while the physically based model is being used at selected locations to enhance and support the stochastic model. The results of the study reveal that few basins in the southeast exhibit dissolved oxygen problems, but that several watersheds exhibit high nitrogen levels. These basins are located in regions of intense agricultural activity or in proximity to the gulf coast. In many of these areas, streamflow is projected to decline over the next 30-50 years,thus exacerbating these water quality problems.

For some priority substances, the pollutant entries via suspended solids during the flood period are estimated to be approximately 1/3 of the usual annual load. Among these priority pollutants there are total organic carbon (TOC), nitrogen, and the heavy metals Cu, Pb and Zn. For the concentrations of the priority pollutants in suspended solids accumulation factors from 2 to 4 in the comparison with normal conditions were observed. On the basis of the analysis of sediments sampled after the flood, main sources of the pollutants should be evaluated. As reference area with an industrial background as well as a typical pollutant pattern the region around Glogow/Legnica is proposed.

Simulation of nitrogen dynamics	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						rice; crayfish; model; nitrogen; integration	SEDIMENTS; AMMONIUM; NITRIFICATION; SURFACTANTS; ADSORPTION; MODEL; FIELD	In the lower Mondego river valley, part of the agricultural lands have been converted into rice fields during the recent years. Meanwhile, an imported and non-native species, the Louisiana Red Crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) has invaded the fields and are hampering the establishment of especially the young rice plants. The species is lowering the potential income of the farmers and is, therefore, considered a pest. A project financed by EU was set up to define a 'best possible strategy' for the management of crayfish populations in rice fields aiming to make possible the integration of the two crops in the same system. This paper presents the first outlines of a model for the nitrogen cycle in a freshwater, aquacultural farming system with combined growth and harvest of rice and crayfish. The fertilization of the rice-fields is connected with high inputs of nitrogen as artificial fertilizers. Not all the nitrogen added as fertilizers actually ends up improving the rice-growth. Usually, a major part enters the general biogeochemical N-cycle of the field. The quantities added mean that this may also play a major role in determining the water quality of the rice field. Maintaining an adequate water quality is important for the integration of the rice field with aquaculture of P. clarkii. The model has passed the phase of verification and reached a state of calibration and will be integrated with other submodels of the system. Ammonia is more abundant than the nitrate during the wet season, whereas the nitrate dominates during dry season, indicating that removal of nitrogen by denitrification will take place during this time of the year.

The lake is highly eutrophic and it has a high value for fisheries and recreation. A water quality model was developed in order to make predictions of the effects of the different possible restoration measures (reduction of nutrient loading, water level regulation) planned to be carried out. Two phytoplankton groups, diatoms and cyanobacteria, were included in the model. Their contribution to the total algal biomass is dominating. The other state variables of the model are concentration of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), concentration of inorganic nitrogen and concentration of dissolved oxygen. The ecological model was constructed using continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) hydraulics. The zero-dimensional approach could be used because the lake is shallow and has no thermal stratification. According to the model, external nutrient loading has a very small effect on the biomass of cyanobacteria, whereas the effect is clearer when diatoms are concerned. The contribution of water level to biomass is very significant for both diatoms and cyanobacteria.

One riparian community was characterized by Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) and tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia caespifosa (L.) Beauv,), while the second community was dominated by beaked sedge (Carex rostrata Stokes) and water sedge (Carex aquatilus Wahl.). Three vegetation height treatments were evaluated: control (natural condition), moderate treatment (clipped to IO-cm height and clipped material removed), and heavy treatment (clipped to ground level, clipped material removed, and litter vacuumed up). A 10-m wide riparian buffer zone was an efficient filter as about 84% NO3--N and 79% PO4-3-P was removed from the applied water and sediment.

J	Rosenthal, WD; Hoffman, DW				Rosenthal, WD; Hoffman, DW			Hydrologic modelings/GIS as an aid in locating monitoring sites	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						streamflow; loading; nonpoint source; model; Texas	GIS	With the increasing importance and awareness of non-point source pollution, critical siting of water quality monitoring stations becomes important. Within large watersheds this siting becomes difficult because of the time and expense to travel the entire watershed and evaluate the area. Previous work has shown that hydrologic models can assist in evaluating water quality in large watersheds. In this study the hydrologic model SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) was used to simulate flows, sediment and nutrient loadings on a 9000 km(2) watershed in central Texas for the period 1970-1984. The model is a continuous, daily time step model that predicts surface runoff percolation, lateral subsurface flow, groundwater flow, transmission losses and flood routing. The Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) and available Natural Resources Conservation Service databases provided input into SWAT Subwatersheds demonstrating areas of highest per acre loadings were identified from model output. Modeled output of streamflow, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment loadings were analyzed. For 1972-1974, the correlation coefficient between observed and simulated streamflow was 0.83, while the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient was 0.57 indicating the model is a better predictor than using the mean. Average annual loads from the entire basin were 3.9 kg ha(-1) NO(3) and 0.03 kg ha(-1) soluble P. Subwatersheds in the lower part of the watershed had loads which were higher than the watershed average and as a result monitoring stations have been installed. The results demonstrate that a hydrologic model and available spatial databases can be used to aid in locating sites.

Testing of the water quality and nutrient cycling component for a Coastal Plain riparian system	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						riparian buffers; ecosystem model; nonpoint source pollution; nutrient cycling; denitrification; nitrogen; phosphorus	SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER; NITRATE REMOVAL; BUFFER SYSTEMS; FOREST; NITROGEN; DENITRIFICATION; CARBON; PHOSPHORUS; DYNAMICS; WASTE	The Riparian Ecosystem Management Model (REMM) was used to simulate nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) cycling and transport in a Coastal Plain riparian buffer system near Tifton, Georgia. The riparian buffer consisted of zone 3 (grass next to a row crop field); zone 2 (mature pine forest downslope from zone 3); and zone 1 (hardwood forest downslope from zone 2, adjacent to a stream). Uncalibrated simulation results for a Jive-year period were compared to measured values for the same time period at the research site. In general, simulated water table nutrient concentrations were within one standard deviation of observed values on an annual basis. Surface runoff loads exiting zone 3 for most N and P forms were simulated within one standard deviation of the observed In contrast zone 2, surface runoff loads for inorganic N species were apt order of magnitude lower than observed. Although some of the surface runoff differences (observed vs. simulated) were large in relative terms, the overall trends within the riparian buffer were generally well-represented and differences were not large in absolute terms. Simulated values for one of the most important processes responsible for effectiveness of riparian zones - denitrification, were within the range of those observed. Much of the temporal dynamics of the observed data were also captured in the REMM simulations. Certain constraints of the model use are discussed, but REMM appears to be useful for representing many of the specific processes and general trends in riparian ecosystem buffers.

J	Stambuk-Giljanovic, N				Stambuk-Giljanovic, N			Water quality evaluation by index in Dalmatia	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						water quality index; water quality; water pollution; water quality evaluation; drinking water; Dalmatia		This article describes the process of determining the water quality index (WQI) for Dalmatian County waters as well as the results of the application of the index for water evaluation in Dalmatia (Southern Croatia) for a three year period (1995, 1996; 1997). WQI includes the following nine parameters: temperature, mineralization, corrosion coefficient, K = (Cl + SO4)/HCO3, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, protein N, total phosphorus and total coliform bacteria (MPN coli/100 ml) for which concentrations C-80 are calculated. After completing the nine parameters the results of C80 were recorded and transferred to the score table to obtain the q-value. The q-value used is an attempt to quantify environmental factors which would otherwise be qualitative. For each parameter the q-value was multiplied by a weighting factor based upon the relative significance of the parameter. The nine resulting Values were then added to arrive at an overall WQI. The WQI is obtained so that the water quality evaluation (WQE) can be divided by water quality evaluation (WQE)(MAC) which satisfies the maximum admissible concentration (MAC) of first class water. It includes both underground and surface water, which can be used in its natural state or after being disinfected for drinking water. Spring and river waters in Dalmatia which contain low sulphate and chloride concentrations are of high sanitary quality. This duality can be estimated by the WQI (quality index), which varies around 1. The increase of sulphate as well as chloride in springs, rivers and underground waters decreases the WQI value; in fact, it causes deterioration of the water quality according to the established standard for drinking water.

The total amount of wastewater available according to the references given is around 1.32 million m(3)/d. The total water salinity ranges between 1000-7273 mg L-1 in different areas. The quality of the wastewater ranges between low salinity-low sodium to very high salinity-very high sodium hazards which could create substantial soil and crop management problems when used for irrigation. Application of certain mathematical models has shown that the use of these wastewaters can affect the exchangeable-sodium-percentage (ESP) and soil salinity to create substantial soil and crop management problems. However, wastewater quality demands careful assessment if it were to be reused as a supplemental source of crop irrigation for agricultural expansion. Experiments have shown that use of wastewaters in Saudi Arabia as a supplemental irrigation has not only increased crop production, water use and nitrogen use efficiencies but also served as a source of plant nutrients. It was also found that the use of wastewater can save up to 50% application of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer if the wastewater contains 40 mg N L-1. The short- and long-term uses of different types of wastewaters for irrigation did not show any significant increase in the bioaccumulation of heavy metals in crops and soils. However, there exists much potential for reuse of wastewater in agriculture after appropriate treatment and by following certain management practices such as leaching requirements, proper crop selection, estimation of crop water requirements, adoption of improved irrigation methods and application of right amount of fertilizer.

Restoration of this lake started in 1985. The main measure was the reduction of external nutrient load by the supply of phosphate-free water. Water quality and aquatic vegetation were monitored and the usefulness of a modelling approach in designation of management programs was investigated. The monitoring showed that for the first 4 years, recovery was retarded, possibly because of phosphorus release from the lake-bed sediments. After 10 years, turbidity was reduced and characteristic vegetation with Najas marina and Characeae species had re-established in large parts of the lake. Due to spatial heterogeneity it appeared necessary to dredge the lake-bed sediments locally. The model predicted most changes in aquatic vegetation correctly, indicating its predictive value. However, to predict restoration perspectives for rare species, expert judgement still remains necessary. Suggestions are made for selection of successful management measures depending on the conditions of lake ecosystems. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bernier, C; Gallichand, J				Bernier, C; Gallichand, J			Hydrological modeling of the water quality of an agricultural watershed	CANADIAN AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING			French	Article								Degradation of surface water quality is an important problem in Quebec. In agricultural areas, pollution sources are related to agricultural practices. Hydrological modeling is a tool which can help establishing less polluting farming practices. The HSPF model was tested for a period of two years on a 5.3 km(2) agricultural watershed and results presented on a weekly basis for outflow, sediment, total nitrogen, nitrate and nitrite, and ammonium. The first year served for calibration and yielded correlation between observed and simulated values of 0.87, 0.88, 0.95, 0.96 and 0.62 for outflow, sediment, total nitrogen, nitrate and nitrite, and ammonium. The second year was used for verification and correlation coefficients of 0.66, 0.54, 0.63, 0.73, and 0.62 were obtained for the same variables. For the two years of the study, HSPF underestimated outflow by 18%, sediment by 38%, total nitrogen by 25%, and overestimated nitrate and nitrite by 23%, and ammonium by 45%.

J	Mankin, KR; Koelliker, JK; Kalita, PK				Mankin, KR; Koelliker, JK; Kalita, PK			Watershed and lake water quality assessment: An integrated modeling approach	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						agricultural hydrology; AGNPS; modeling; nonpoint source pollution; water quality		Watershed planning groups and action agencies seek to understand how lake water quality responds to changes in watershed management. This study developed and demonstrated the applicability of an integrated modeling approach for providing this information. An integrated model linking watershed conditions to water-quality of the receiving lake incorporated the following components: (1) an event-based AGNPS model to estimate watershed pollutant losses; (2) annualization of AGNPS results to produce annual lake pollutant loadings; (3) a baseflow separation package, SAM, to estimate baseflow; (4) estimates of nutrients in baseflow and point sources; and (5) linkage of watershed loadings directly to EUTROMOD lake water quality algorithms. Results are presented for Melvern Lake, a 28-km(2) multipurpose reservoir with a 900-km(2) agricultural watershed in east central Kansas. Reasonable estimates of current lake quality were attained using an average phosphorus availability factor of 31 percent to calibrate model results to measured in-lake phosphorus. Comparison of a range of possible scenarios, including all cropland changed to no-till (best case) and all CRP and good-condition grasslands changed to cropland (worst case), indicated only a (4 percent change for in-lake phosphorus and a (2 percent change for chlorophyll a. These results indicated that this watershed is not sensitive to projected changes in land use and management.

J	Zhang, J; Gornak, SI				Zhang, J; Gornak, SI			Evaluation of field-scale water quality models for the Lake Okeechobee regulatory program	APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						water quality; total phosphorus; modeling; nutrient management; regulatory program	PHOSPHORUS; FLORIDA	FHANTM (Field Hydrologic And Nutrient Transport Model), FHANTM 2.0 (FHANTM version 2.0), and EAAMOD-FIELD (A Flow and Phosphorus Model for High Water Tables) are field-scale water quality models developed specifically for south Florida conditions. These models predict welter table levels, discharge and phosphorus lends in response to weather soil, land use, and nutrient management conditions. FHANTM has been used in the Lake Okeechobee regulatory program for evaluating high phosphorus discharge sites north of Lake Okeechobee. Most sites were formerly dairies or were heavily stocked with beef cattle in the past. These sites have flat topography, sandy soils, high water tables, and a moderate drainage system. FHANTM 2.0, which is significantly different from FHANTM, was developed for generalized use in modeling beef/calf operations. EAAMOD-FIELD has undergone extensive development and testing in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) south of Lake Okeechobee. The EAA has a flat topography, organic (histosols) soils, high water tables, and an extensive drainage system. To ensure that the regulatory program was using the best model available, a comparison was made among FHANTM, FHANTM 2.0, and EAAMOD-FIELD. Model documentation and algorithms were reviewed. Simulated surface runoff and phosphorus loadings were compared to measured data for two sites from April 1989 through December 1991. Statistical correlation of monthly and annual values was analyzed. Based on model review and data analyses, we concluded that EAAMOD-FIELD was the best model to use for the regulatory program.

J	Zhu, SM; Chen, SL				Zhu, SM; Chen, SL			An experimental study on nitrification biofilm performances using a series reactor system	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						ammonia; nitrification; biofilm; biofilter	STEADY-STATE; CULTURE; KINETICS; AMMONIA; DESIGN; WATER; MODEL	Total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) concentration is often a key limiting water quality parameter in intensive aquaculture systems. Removing ammonia through biological filtration is thus the first objective in recirculating aquaculture system design. In this study, the performance characteristics of a steady-state nitrification biofilm were explored using a series of reactors. Four nitrification kinetics parameters were estimated using the data collected from the experimental system, including minimum TAN concentration, half saturation constant, maximum TAN removal rate and maximum specific bacterial growth rate. Experimental data showed that a minimum TAN concentration was needed to support a steady-state nitrification biofilm. For the temperature of 27.2 degrees C, the mean minimum TAN concentration was 0.07 mg/l. For a single substrate-limiting factor, the relationship between TAN removal rate (R) and TAN concentration (S) was represented by an empirical equation [R = 1859(S -0.07)/(S + 1.93)]. The characteristics of nitrite oxidation were also demonstrated by the experiment system. The results of this study will help to better understand the characteristics of nitrification biofilters applied in recirculating aquaculture systems. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Gammarus lacustris released between 5.2 and 18.1 ng P.L-1.h(-1) (adults only and adults plus immatures, respectively) in the pelagic region during nighttime vertical migration. Additional P released into and removed from the water column due to predation on zooplankton was estimated at 1.87 and 2.3 ng P.L-1.h(-1), respectively The net daily regeneration of 52.2-181.4 ng P.L-1.day(-1) by the G. lacustris population represented 9.5-32.9% of the total P regenerated by the planktonic community. The majority of the P released by G. lacustris represents "new" P to the pelagic zone because it originated in sediments. We conclude that G. lacustris can represent an important link in benthic-pelagic coupling in oligotrophic mountain lakes.

Water quality data collected by or for the different national environmental agencies were compiled and analysed statistically to identify and remove inconsistent or obviously incorrect observations. Moreover, sampling tours were undertaken to acquire additional information about the present nutrient concentrations in the largest rivers in the study area. Gaps in the time series of approved data were then filled in by employing statistical interpolation and extrapolation methods. Thereafter, the concentration and runoff data were combined to obtain estimates of monthly nutrient loads for the time period 1970-93. The results of the calculations showed that although there had been substantial changes in land use, atmospheric deposition and wastewater treatment in many parts of the study area, the total riverine loads of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to the Baltic Sea have been fairly constant since 1980, and most likely also since 1970. Moreover, the interannual variation was clearly correlated to the runoff. The mean annual loads for the time period 1980-93 were found to be about 825 000 tonnes N and 41 000 tonnes P, respectively. This implies that (i) several other investigators have strongly underestimated the riverine loads of nutrients, especially the nitrogen, and that (ii) the riverine loads by far exceed the input to the Baltic Sea from other sources, {i.e.} atmospheric deposition, direct emissions from cities and industries along the Baltic Sea coast and nitrogen fixation by marine algae.

J	Withers, PJA; Peel, S; Mansbridge, RM; Chalmers, AC; Lane, SJ				Withers, PJA; Peel, S; Mansbridge, RM; Chalmers, AC; Lane, SJ			Transfers of phosphorus within three dairy farming systems receiving varying inputs in feeds and fertilizers	NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						dairy systems; feeds; fertilizers; phosphorus; P surplus	NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT; DIETARY PHOSPHORUS; WATER-QUALITY; CATTLE; MANURE; PERFORMANCE; EXCRETION; SAMPLERS; MODEL	Inputs of phosphorus (P) above requirements for production on dairy farms lead to surplus P with increased risk of P transfer in land run-off to surface waters causing eutrophication. The impact of reducing surplus P inputs in purchased feeds and fertilizers on milk and forage production was investigated in a comparison of three dairy farm systems on chalkland soils in southern England over a 3-year period. In accordance with current commercial practice, no attempt was made to regulate P inputs in system 1, which accumulated an average annual surplus of 23 kg P ha(-1). Progressive reductions in purchased feed and/or fertilizer inputs into systems 2 and 3 decreased surplus P to 17 and 3 kg ha(-1), respectively, without apparently limiting either milk or herbage dry matter production. The estimated reduction in faecal P output from system 3 cows fed a low P diet compared to system 1 cows fed a high P diet was 26%. Milk P concentrations significantly (P < 0.001) increased in systems 2 and 3 which included maize in the diet. Output of P in milk and meat products, as a proportion of the total dietary P inputs, increased from 28% in system 1 to 36% in system 3. Surplus P was greatest in continuous maize fields receiving both dairy manure and starter P fertilizer. Withholding P fertilizer in system 3 did not reduce P offtake in cut herbage on soils of moderate P fertility. Total annual losses of P in storm run-off and leaching were no greater than annual inputs of P from the atmosphere (0.5 kg ha(-1)). The results indicate there is scope to reduce surplus P on commercial dairy farms without sacrificing production targets at least in the short term. Purchased feeds are the largest of the P inputs on intensive dairy farms, yet these are rarely quantified on commercial holdings.

J	Yuan, Y; Mitchell, JK				Yuan, Y; Mitchell, JK			A method to evaluate pollutant loads from tile drains	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						agricultural watersheds; water quality; nonpoint source pollution; pollutant loads estimation	PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; RUNOFF	The quantification of pollutant loads from agricultural non-point source pollution is difficult because: (1) there is no direct means of continuously recording pollutant concentration; (2) and available human resources and funds always limit sampling. For those reasons, sampling strategy and pollutant concentration interpolation methods are essential to estimate pollutant loads. In this study, a method was tested to evaluate pollutant loads using daily flow volume and daily mass load regression for nitrate-nitrogen, orthophosphate-phosphorous and atrazine. The method worked well for nitrate-nitrogen, but generally did not work well for either orthophosphate-phosphorous or atrazine. Nitrate-nitrogen load was calculated for several tile-monitoring stations based on this method. Results were compared with volume interpolation methods; the difference between the two methods is not significant at the 95% level of confidence.

Lake Springfield is the water supply reservoir for the city of Springfield, Illinois. water from the lake is also used for cooling the city's power plant complex. The model was calibrated and verified on Lake Springfield using monitored data in 1986 and 1988, Eight water quality constituents were simulated. Calibration, verification, and predictions were made only for temperature, dissolved oxygen. nitrate-nitrogen, and phosphate-phosphorus. The calibrated and verified model was used to predict water surface elevations and constituent concentrations in the three lakes, individually and in combination, with meteorological and estimated flow data for a twenty-month period in 1953-1954, the most severe drought of record. The model provided a useful fool in the water quality evaluations of the three lakes.

J	Worrall, F; Burt, TP				Worrall, F; Burt, TP			The impact of land-use change on water quality at the catchment scale: the use of export coefficient and structural models	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						water quality; agricultural catchments; export coefficient modelling; nitrate	DECISION-MAKING; N-MOVEMENTS; NITROGEN; SOIL; MANAGEMENT; TOOL	The consequences of a decline in soil nitrogen following ploughing of permanent pasture and land-use change are explored in terms of nitrate export at the catchment scale. The release of reserves of organic nitrogen built up in grassland soils is modelled as a first-order kinetic decay. The build up of reserves of nitrogen upon reversion to pasture is modelled both as a first-order process and under the assumption that new grassland can absorb all the nitrogen applied to it. Results show that the release and sequestration of nitrogen in these reservoirs shows supply-limited hysteresis, and consequently the ploughing-up of permanent pasture has the dominant effect. Allowing for the present land-use and the effect of rainfall, the model is compared to streamwater nitrate concentrations measured in the Slapton Wood catchment, south west England. Significant overestimates are observed that suggest that nitrogen released from ploughing up of grassland is either in an organic form or that significant denitrification capacity is available. Optimising the model against the data from Slapton Wood catchment confirms there is an elastic capacity for denitirification within the catchment. At the catchment scale the grassland reservoirs acts as a constant source of nitrogen whilst the effect of the reversion of land to permanent pasture, at the catchment scale, attains rapid equilibrium and does not continue to remove significant levels of nitrogen after the first year.

J	Thierfelder, T				Thierfelder, T			Empirica/statisttcal modeling of water quality in dimictic glacial/boreal lakes	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						modeling lake water quality; catchment characteristics; watershed management	PHOSPHORUS	In an empirical/statistical approach to the interaction between watershed characteristics and lake water quality, the inter-lake variance of 87 chemically monitored dimictic glacial/boreal lakes is correlated to the distributed properties of catchment descriptors. In a total, 33 classes of land cover, soils and bedrock are identified and described with respect to element morphology and hydrology. Together with descriptors of catchment/lake morphology, hydrology and climate, they serve as explanatory variables in the construction of statistical regression models that assess the chemical lake water constituents: conductivity, hardness, Secchi depth, color, alkalinity, total phosphorus and pH. As a result, the four former variables (cond, H, Secc, col) are simulated with precision enough for quantitatively predictive purposes, whereas the three latter (alk, TP, pH) provide a rather qualitative - although highly significant - estimate. Using normalized regression coefficients, catchment descriptors are ranked with respect to their general importance. It is found that only fifteen landscape elements - out of the 33 totally identified - and seven other catchment/lake descriptors occur as significantly correlated to the inter-lake variance of water quality. The ranking of element descriptors provide a basis for decisions regarding the location of projects that affect the properties of landscape elements (e.g. damming, irrigation, mining). When applied in watershed management, projects that intend to conserve lake water quality should be located within as low ranked elements as possible, whereas the location of projects that strive to manipulate lake water quality may be calculated as a function of the chemical alteration desired. With the analyzed database being large enough to encompass a wide population of typical lakes, the results should be applicable in many dimictic glacial/boreal lakes throughout the world.

Water clarity ranged widely, with the diffuse vertical attenuation coefficient for photosynthetically active radiation (K(dI)PAR) varying from 0.26 to 17.2 m(-1), and UVR attenuation varied positively and significantly with K(dI)PAR. Particle concentration (total suspended solids, TSS) was the single most useful water quality characteristic for predicting broadband UVB (305-320 nm) and UVA (320-400 nm) attenuation.. Dissolved organic carbon concentration (DOC) and fluorescence were much less important than TSS in predicting UVR attenuation over the typical range of water clarity (K(dI)PAR < 2 m(-1)). The predominant role of TSS in UVR attenuation could not be explained by phytoplankton or other absorbing organic matter in the particulate phase, suggesting instead an important role for scattering. Attenuation spectra through the UV region were not monotonic at the higher particle concentrations and could not be modelled solely as a function of DOC as previously reported for other lakes. Attenuation at 310 and 320 nm confirmed the conclusion from spectrally integrated measurements that particles are the dominant agents of variable UVR attenuation in Lake Erie.

J	Barber, ME; Juul, STJ; Wierenga, RE; Funk, WH				Barber, ME; Juul, STJ; Wierenga, RE; Funk, WH			Determining primary productivity of Lake Roosevelt with C-14	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							LIGHT; PHYTOPLANKTON; MODEL; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; TEMPERATURE	During two sampling trips in 1997, primary productivity was measured at 11 stations in Lake Roosevelt using a radioactive carbon tracer capable of determining subtle changes in water quality. Both spatial and temporal variations in productivity were observed. For the August 1997 field trip, productivities on the mainstem reservoir ranged from 485 to 1,243 mgC/m(2)/d, with an average value of 783 mgC/m(2)/d. Temporal differences between the August and October trips varied by as much as 880 mgC/m(2)/d. The data are compared to measurements taken over a four-year period to determine subtle, long-term changes in the water quality. Productivity at Lake Roosevelt is heavily influenced by tributary inflow, and generally increased in the reservoir reaches below the mouths of the tributaries. Mainstem sites between the tributaries had lower productivities than the upstream and downstream tributary sites, indicating that nutrients may be rapidly utilized in the immediate vicinity of the inflows. However, productivities in the tributary arms were consistently low, despite the fact that their physicochemical properties stimulated growth in the reservoir. The productivity data illustrate the difficulty in characterizing a large water body as a homogeneous quantity in terms of assessing loading impacts. The results also demonstrate that long-term changes in water quality can be masked by short-term events. The longterm trend is that Lake Roosevelt, a eutrophic/mesotrophic lake, is becoming an oligotrophic lake, but seasonal rainfall events influence the lake's specific characterization.

J	Doering, PH; Chamberlain, RH				Doering, PH; Chamberlain, RH			Water quality and source of freshwater discharge to the Caloosahatchee Estuary, Florida	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						aquatic ecosystems; water quality; ocean studies; estuary; nutrients; freshwater discharge	LIGHT REDUCTION; RIVER ESTUARY; NUTRIENT; BEHAVIOR; PATTERNS; CARBON; MODEL	The Caloosahatchee River has two major sources of freshwater: one from its watershed and the other via an artificial connection to Lake Okeechobee. The contribution of each source to the freshwater discharge reaching the downstream estuary varies and either may dominate. Routine monitoring data were analyzed to determine the effects of total river discharge and source of discharge (river basin, lake) on water quality in the downstream estuary. Parameters examined were: color, total suspended solids, light attenuation, chlorophyll a, and total and dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus. In general, the concentrations of color, and total and dissolved inorganic nitrogen increased, and total suspended solids decreased, as total discharge increased. When the river basin was the major source, the concentrations of nutrients (excepting ammonia) and color in the estuary were relatively higher than when the lake was the major source. Light attenuation was greater when the river basin dominated freshwater discharge to the estuary. The analysis indicates that water quality in the downstream estuary changes as a function of both total discharge and source of discharge. Relative to discharge from the river basin, releases from Lake Okeechobee do not detectably increase concentrations of nutrients, color, or TSS in the estuary.

An agricultural diversion and return-flow were monitored in great detail to determine mass loading rates of nutrients from agriculture in the area. Once characterized, the cumulative impacts of agricultural diversions and return-flows were evaluated using the Water Quality Assessment Program (WASP) to model nitrogen, phosphorus, periphyton, and dissolved oxygen. Monitoring showed that a significant proportion of the water diverted for agricultural purposes returned to the river as surface point return-flow (estimated at 13.9 percent +/- 0.1 percent), and as groundwater diffuse return-flow (estimated at 27 percent +/- 6 percent). Modeling efforts demonstrated the significant effect of assumed regional groundwater quality (nitrate) upon predicted periphyton growth and associated diel fluctuations of dissolved oxygen.

J	Bocci, M				Bocci, M			Modelling the growth of Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) feeding on natural resources in enclosures in Laguna de Bay (Philippines)	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Oreochromis niloticus; fish growth model; aquaculture; Laguna de Bay; tropical lakes	DIGESTION; INGESTION; CICHLIDS; RATES; SIZE	Laguna de Bay (Philippines), one of the largest freshwater bodies in the Southeast Asia, is located near Metro Manila. The lake is an important resource for the local population because of fish production: fishing and aquaculture are relevant activities for the economy of the area. Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is one of the cultured species and it is grown within net cages in the lake. In this paper, a model is proposed to describe the growth of Nile Tilapia under natural conditions; food sources have been considered to be phytoplankton, zooplankton and suspended organic matter (detritus), without additional feed supply. The metabolic approach has been adopted to describe fish growth. The parameters characterising fish metabolism have been estimated for O. niloticus or similar species, according to literature information. The model has been applied to twelve growing conditions representative of increasing stocking densities and of different growing periods. Model results have been successfully compared with the experimental data reported in literature. This model has been used to estimate the amount of natural food (phytoplankton) exploited by the culture of O. niloticus with the final aim to quantitatively relate lake's water quality with fish growth and production.

J	Graetz, DA; Nair, VD; Portier, KM; Voss, RL				Graetz, DA; Nair, VD; Portier, KM; Voss, RL			Phosphorus accumulation in manure-impacted Spodosols of Florida	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						phosphorus accumulation; spodosols; dairies; beef cattle pastures	SOIL-PHOSPHORUS; TRANSPORT; AVAILABILITY; ADSORPTION; PHOSPHATE; RETENTION; SORPTION; CAPACITY; DAIRIES; DENSITY	Accumulation of phosphorus (P) in soils receiving long-term application of manure has been linked with degradation of water quality in nearby streams and lakes. The objective of this research was to determine the amounts and depth distribution of phosphorus (P) in Florida Spodosols used for dairies and beef ranches, and to relate them to various soil chemical parameters. Land areas of both active and abandoned dairies were sampled based on estimated cattle density. High cattle-density areas of both the active and abandoned dairies, i.e., the intensive and holding areas, had mean total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in the surface horizon (A) of 2500 mg kg(-1) and 750 mg kg(-1), respectively compared to 30 mg kg(-1) in the native area, i,e., an area largely unimpacted by animals and humans. The dairy and beef cattle pastures and the forage areas (low cattle density areas) had a mean TP concentration of 114 mg kg(-1). Concentrations of TP in the E, Bh, and Bw soil horizons were also greater in the high cattle density areas than in the low cattle density areas or in the native areas. Water-soluble P concentrations (WSP) were higher in all soil horizons of the high cattle density areas compared to the low cattle density areas and the native areas. Water-soluble P concentrations in the surface horizons of the high cattle density areas averaged 3.4% of TP which suggests that a substantial amount of P could be transported either vertically or laterally with subsurface drainage. Double acid-extractable P (DAP) concentrations, which could be used as an indicator of potentially leachable P, were considerably higher than WSP concentrations and averaged lover all land-uses) 42, 44, 57 and 31% of TP for the A, E, Bh, and Bw horizons, respectively. The association of WSP, DAP, and TP with the soil chemical parameters measured in this study showed a varied relationship with double acid-extractable Ca and Mg and oxalate-extractable Fe and Al. Overall, these results show the accumulation of large amounts of P in high cattle density areas. Significant amounts of this P were in forms that are potentially leachable, i,e., WSP and DAP. Higher concentrations of all P forms in the subsurface horizons (E, Bh, Bw) of high cattle density areas confirm the downward transport of P in these manure-laden Spodosols.

J	Rejesus, RM; Hornbaker, RH				Rejesus, RM; Hornbaker, RH			Economic and environmental evaluation of alternative pollution-reducing nitrogen management practices in central Illinois	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						nitrate pollution; site-specific management; precision farming; nitrogen management practices	GROUNDWATER; IMPACTS	Nitrogen fertilizer application from production agriculture is likely the largest contributor to non-point source nitrate pollution in the United States. This type of pollution from the agricultural sector is an important policy issue because it may cause serious environmental and health risks to society. There have been studies that examined the different effects of nitrogen timing and rate practices, but none has yet compared the economic and environmental effects of these practices to site-specific management (SSM) precision technology. This paper examines the economic and environmental impacts of alternative nitrogen management practices, including SSM, within the Lake Decatur watershed of central Illinois. Thus, this study provides evidence on how different nitrogen management practices perform in terms of their effect on water quality and profitability. Data for the analysis were derived from the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agronomic simulation model due to unavailability of actual on-site data. The analysis revealed that SSM of nitrogen fertilizer has great potential in reducing the mean and variability of nitrate pollution in the watershed while improving profitability of producers, relative to the current practice in the watershed. The management practice where fertilizer is applied during the spring at 140 kg ha(-1) provides reduction in mean and variability of nitrate pollution comparable to that of SSM. However, SSM technology substantially reduces the variability of net returns compared to the other management practices analyzed. Hence, SSM of nitrogen fertilizer has the potential to reduce nitrate pollution while reducing economic variability and maintaining profitability. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A 5-year field experiment was conducted on a Brandon loam soil (fine loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Endoaquoll) (Orthic Humic Gleysol) with the objective of measuring N uptake and grain yield of two maize hybrids under different N amendments [no amendment, NH4NO3 at 100 and 200 kg N ha(-1), and stockpiled and rotted dairy manure at 50 and 100 Mg ha(-1) (wet wt.)] to determine differences in N use efficiency (SUE) and its components, N uptake efficiency and N utilization efficiency. The N amendments increased the grain yield (by an average of 20%) and NUE (by an average of 17.5%) of a modern hybrid (Pioneer '3902') more;han that of an old hybrid ('Pride 5'). The difference method that was used to estimate N recovery indicated that, over the course of the study, Pioneer 3902 took up 48% of inorganic fertilizer N and 20% of the manure N, compared with 42 and 16%, respectively, for Pride 5, Manure application resulted in total N uptake comparable to the 200 kg N ha(-1) treatment. Grain yields of manure treatments in 1993 and 1994 were generally lower (5-15%) than the 200 kg N ha(-1) treatment. During the latter periods (1995 and 1996) of the study with repeated application under continuous maize, all manure treatments produced grain yields equal to or slightly greater (6-13%) than the fertilizer treatment. Dairy manure application increased N uptake and grain Yield of maize. The NUE, based on added mineral N levels, for all manure treatments was greater than for the 200 kg N ha(-1) treatment.

J	Lorimor, JC; Xin, H				Lorimor, JC; Xin, H			Manure production and nutrient concentrations from high-rise layer houses	APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						poultry; waste; water quality		Four commercial high-rise layer houses were monitored for a year to determine manure production and nutrient concentration characteristics. Each house contained 80,400 to 124,500 mature Hy-Line W-36 birds. The solid manure collected as it accumulated beneath the cages for a year prior to being hauled out. The objective of the research was to accurately characterize the manure production to facilitate better nutrient planning. Manure volume and bulk density were measured and samples were collected monthly and analyzed for moisture, Kjeldahl nitrogen, ammonia, phosphorus, potassium,, calcium, and other chemical constituents. The measured manure production averaged 5.6 Mg (or 6.2 ton) . (1000 birds)(-1)(year(-1) on a dry basis. On a wet las-is) basis the measured production was 9.52 Mg (or 10.5 ton) . (1000 birds)(-1)(year(-1) at 41% moisture. The measured manure N-P2O5-K2O contents were 18.5-41.0-26.0 kg/Mg (37-82-52 lb/ton) on an "as-is" basis or 30.8-69.0-44.0 kg/Mg (62-138-88 lb/ton) on a dry basis. When manure production and nutrient concentrations were combined measured nitrogen production was 52.8% less, phosphorus was 29.5% greater and potassium was 27.8% greater than the respective current Iowa estimates. The average calcium concentration for all four sites studied for the year was 10.0% las-is basis). The manure handling system had a significant impact on manure characteristics. Scraper systems had a lower moisture content and a lower percentage of the nitrogen in ammonia form (29.8% moisture, NH3 = 20% of TKN) than systems that dropped the manure into storage immediately (46.9% moisture, NH3 = 30% TKN).

The model quantifies processes governing internal nutrient cycling and phytoplankton growth. It estimates the impact of nutrient loads on water clarity, a pivotal water quality parameter for seagrass meadows. The model estimates impacts over long time periods and large areas, using tidally-averaged modelling: tidally-averaged impacts were described by dispersion coefficients, calibrated with 1985-1994 salinities. These coefficients and monthly freshwater inflows were used to simulate both salinity and eight water quality variables. They involved four interacting systems: dissolved oxygen, phytoplankton, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Model results were compared with monthly measurements and yearly-averaged estimates for 1985-1994. Tampa Bay was phosphorus enriched and nitrogen limited for algal growth. A component analysis indicated that the internal nutrient cycling and transport exceeded external loadings (external inputs from the watershed are the ultimate source of nitrogen). Cycling of nitrogen was governed primarily by phytoplankton, including growth, death and mineralization of organic-N. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

Effects of compost and N fertilizer management strategies on corn (Zen mars L.) yield and NO3--N leaching were evaluated in a 3-yr study on a Hubbard loamy sand soil (sandy, mixed, Udorthentic Haploboroll). Two composts were each applied st either 90 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) from 1993 to 1995, or at 270 Mg ha(-1) in one application in 1993, The compost and non-amended plots were sidedressed annually with N fertilizer as urea at 0, 125, and 250 kg ha(-1). Biochemical properties of the compost as well as compost management strongly affected crop response and fate of N, Compost increased grain yield with no significant yield response to IV fertilizer with the single compost application in Year 1 and the annual compost application in Year 3. Plant N uptake increased with N fertilizer rate, except in the 270 Mg ha(-1) compost treatments in Year 1, Over the 3-yr period, NO3--N leaching with the 270 Mg ha(-1) compost application was 1.8 times greater compared to that with the annual application. The estimated N mineralization ranged from 0 to 12% and 3 to 6% in the annual and single compost addition, respectively, Under the conditions of this study, annual compost application with reduced supplemental N fertilizer was the best management strategy to reach optimum crop yield while minimizing NO3--N leaching losses.

J	Ham, JM; DeSutter, TM				Ham, JM; DeSutter, TM			Seepage losses and nitrogen export from swine-waste lagoons: A water balance study	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; CLAY LINERS; MANURE; EVAPORATION; MACROPORES; SOILS; MODEL	Seepage losses from animal-waste lagoons could affect ground water quality. Water balance methods were used to study seepage and N export from three swine-waste lagoons in southwestern Kansas. Lagoons ranged in size from 0.8 to 2.2 ha and had an average waste depth of 5.6 m. Compacted soil liners were 0.30 to 0.46 m thick and built with native soil or, in one case, a soil-bentonite mixture, Seepage was calculated from measurements of evaporation and changes in depth when the addition or removal of waste was precluded or quantified, Seepage rates were 1.1, 1.1, and 0.8 mm d(-1) from the three lagoons, with the lowest rate occurring at the site with a 0.46-m liner augmented with bentonite. The in situ coefficient of permeability of the soil liners ranged from 7.8 x 10(-8) and 1.5 x 10(-7) cm s(-1). In two lagoons built with silt loam liners (no bentonite), permeabilities on a whole lagoon basis were about five times less than those measured from soil cores collected before the addition of waste. Results imply that permeability was reduced by organic sludge on the bottom of the lagoons, The average ammonium-N concentration in the lagoons was 665 mg L-1, accounting for almost all of the soluble N, Calculations indicate that the ammonium-N export rates were between 2187 and 2726 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), but more information is needed regarding the fate of N deposited in the soil beneath lagoons.

II. Calanus finmarchicus (Copepoda) eggs	MARINE BIOLOGY			English	Article							INDUCED DAMAGE; B RADIATION; SHORT-TERM; PHOTOREACTIVATION; PHYTOPLANKTON; EXPOSURE; WATERS; SOLAR	The copepod Calanus finmarchicus Gunnerus is a key component of the planktonic food web in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada. In this region, productivity-determining biophysical interactions occur in the upper 0 to 30 m of the water column. The eggs and nauplii of C. finmarchicus are found in this layer. Measurements of the diffuse attenuation coefficients for solar ultraviolet-B radiation (280 to 320 nm, UV-B) at various locations in this region indicated maximum 10% depths (the depth to which 10% of the surface energy penetrates) of 3 to 4 m at a wavelength of 310 nm. This represents a significant percentage of the summer mixed-layer water column: organisms residing in this layer are exposed to UV-B radiation. Laboratory experiments using a Xenon-arc-lamp based solar simulator revealed that C. finmarchicus embryos exposed to UV-B exhibited high wavelength-dependent mortality. The strongest effects occurred under exposures to wavelengths below 312 nm. A significant percentage of nauplii hatched from eggs exposed to these wavelengths exhibited malformations indicative of errors in pattern formation during embryogenesis. At the shorter wavelengths (<305 nm), UV-B-induced mortality was strongly dependent on cumulative exposure. The biological weighting function (BWF) derived for UV-B-induced mortality in C. finmarchicus eggs is similar to that reported for naked DNA. This suggests that the UV-B-induced mortality effect on C. finmarchicus embryos is a direct result of DNA damage. There was no evidence of a detrimental effect of ultraviolet-A radiation (320 to 400 nm). Calculations based upon the BWF indicate that, under current noon surface irradiance, 50% of C. finmarchicus eggs located at or very near (within 10 cm) the ocean surface will be dead after 2.5 h of exposure. Under solar spectral irradiance simulating a 20% decrease in ozone layer thickness, this time drops to 2.2 h. These are first-order estimates based upon irradiance taken at a time of day during which the values would be maximal. Nonetheless, they illustrate the relative changes in UV-B effects that will result from ozone layer depletions expected over the coming decades. It is also important to point out that variability in cloud cover, water quality, and vertical distribution and displacement within the mixed layer, can all have a greater effect on the flux of UV-B radiation to which C. finmarchicus eggs are exposed than will ozone layer depletion at these latitudes.

J	Laws, EA; Ziemann, D; Schulman, D				Laws, EA; Ziemann, D; Schulman, D			Coastal water quality in Hawaii: the importance of buffer zones and dilution	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						buffer zone; coastal zone; dilution; estuaries; mixing processes; ocean disposal; outfalls; recreational waters; sewage; water quality	SEA	A study of the relationship between point and nonpoint source freshwater discharges and marine water quality were studied during a period of 1 year in Mamala Bay, a coastal indentation on the south shore of the island of Oahu, Hawaiian Islands. Despite the fact that 100-300x10(6) m(3) year(-1) of land runoff/groundwater seepage and 150x10(6) m3 year(-1) of treated sewage effluent enter Mamala Bay and its tributaries, coastal water quality as judged by standard chemical and physical parameters is high at virtually all locations in the bay. The explanation for the high water quality reflects several important factors. First, much of the nonpoint source discharge enters either estuaries or harbors, which function as buffer Zones by trapping some of the sediment and nutrients that would otherwise enter the coastal ocean. Second, the principal point source discharges are located in water sufficiently deep that I:heir wastewater plumes are trapped below the surface most of the time. When the plumes surface they are sufficiently diluted that their impact on parameters, such as nutrient concentrations, is undetectable. Third, the coastal current system is greatly diluted by exchange with the offshore ocean. Based on a simple box model, the degree of mixing with the offshore ocean is roughly 40 times the rate of input of fresh water from point and nonpoint sources. The offshore wastewater outfalls have no discernible effect on water quality at any recreational beach along the shoreline. The principal impact on water quality at the recreational beaches comes from nonpoint source discharges, and with the exception of one beach located directly adjacent to a stream mouth, that impact is on the composition rather than the concentration of the plankton. There is a systematic shift from a chlorophyte- to a diatom-dominated phytoplankton community due to the high silicate concentration in groundwater and land runoff, and there is a systematic increase in the delta(15)N of suspended particles due to the high delta(15)N bf the biologically available nitrogen in groundwater seepage.

J	Axt, JR; Walbridge, MR				Axt, JR; Walbridge, MR			Phosphate removal capacity of palustrine forested wetlands and adjacent uplands in Virginia	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL			English	Article							FLOODED-DRAINED SOILS; FRESH-WATER WETLANDS; PHOSPHORUS RETENTION; SORPTION; ALUMINUM; ADSORPTION; BEHAVIOR; MECHANISMS; IRON	We examined the ability of soils in six nontidal palustrine forested wetlands (PFOs) in Virginia's Piedmont (PD) and Coastal Plain (CP) (n = 3 per physiographic province) to remove dissolved inorganic P from solution, and we compared the P sorption capacities of wetlands with those of streambanks (within wetlands) and adjacent uplands. We hypothesized that wetland soils would have higher P sorption capacities than streambank and upland soils due to the higher concentration of noncrystalline (oxalate-extractable) Al and Fe (Al-o and Fe-o) favored by periodic flooding. We found that P sorption capacities varied both as a function of landscape position and soil depth. Wetlands had higher P sorption capacities than uplands in surface soils (0-15 cm), while below 50 cm the relationship was reversed. Streambank areas within wetlands generally had the lowest P sorption capacities. As hypothesized, Al-o was correlated with P sorption capacity in wetland soils (r(2) = 0.80) but so was soil organic matter (as estimated by mass loss on ignition [LOI]) (r(2) = 0.78); in fact, Al-o and organic matter were positively correlated in wetland soils (r(2) = 0.83). In contrast, clay and silt content were the two soil parameters most highly positively correlated with P sorption capacity in upland soils (r(2) = 0.87). Overall these results suggest that differences in soil chemistry exist among landscape positions (wetland, streambank, upland) that have important implications with regard to P sorption capacity. Since wetlands and uplands may remove P from different hydrologic sources (i.e., surface runoff in wetlands and groundwater in uplands), hydrology may be a key factor in determining water quality functioning.

We assessed the effect of fallow-wheat, and continuous wheat under zero-tillage and cultivator-tillage management on phosphorus concentration in the grain (GPC), phosphorus uptake in the grain, NaHCO3 extractable-P (Olsen-P) and on forms and distribution of P in the surface 10 cm of the soil for a 12-year tillage field experiment established on an Orthic Brown Chernozemic soil (Aridic Haploboroll) in southwestern Saskatchewan, Canada. Grain yield was the main factor affecting GPC, with the lower-yielding continuous-wheat system having the highest GPC, most likely resulting from luxury uptake of P. Phosphorus taken in the grain, however, was directly proportional to grain yield. Olsen-P in the soil was highly variable from year to year, and was not affected by tillage or rotation. From 1982 to 1989, when P removed in the grain was less than P applied as fertilizer, Olsen-P in spring samples increased, on average, by 0.9 mg kg(-1) year(-1) in the fallow-wheat and by 1.4 mg kg(-1) year(-1) in the continuous-wheat crapping systems. From 1990 to 1994, when grain yields increased due to more favourable moisture conditions, crop removal of P exceeded P fertilization, and Olsen-P concentration remained relatively stable. Converting the original cultivator tilled fallow-wheat system to zero-tilled continuous wheat produced a significant increase in total soil P as a result of increased accumulation of labile and moderately labile forms of P in the surface 6 cm of the soil, especially in organic forms. When either zero-tillage or continuous-wheat were adopted by themselves, there were no changes in the amounts of P in the different pools. The proportion of organic P in the labile and moderately labile pools in the surface 6 cm of soil, however, increased significantly with respect to the cultivator tilled fallow-wheat control. This reflected increased levels of crop residues returned to the soil in the continuous-wheat cropping system and reduced rates of residue decomposition in the zero-tillage system. The increase in labile forms of P near the surface in zero-tilled soils may have substantial impact on soil sampling for prediction of P fertilizer requirements, and on surface water quality in reduced tillage systems.

However little is known about the impacts of this practice in the region. DRAINMOD-N, a recently developed drainage water quality model, offers the potential to evaluate nitrate leaching. The model was validated by comparing simulated results with measurements of water table depth, drain flow, cumulative nitrate leaching, and cumulative denitrification, from conventional drainage and subirrigation field plots planted to corn. Replicated plots of 15 m x 75 m were either under conventional free drainage or subirrigation at a weir setting of 0.5 m below the soil surface. DRAINMOD-N predicted water table depth to within a range of +/- 160 to 210 mm, drain flow to within +/- 2 mm/d and nitrate leaching to within +/- 8 kg N/ha. DRAINMOD-N models denitrification using first order kinetics. This did not accurately describe field measurements of cumulative denitrification, as by day of year 270 cumulative denitrification was underestimated by 64 to 83%. Therefore, the model was modified by replacing the original denitrification function with the Michaelis-Menten relationship, which simulates denitrification as a first order process when nitrate is limiting and as a zero order process for non-limiting nitrate. This modification had little effect (< 2%) on the modified model's prediction of nitrate leaching. For cumulative denitrification, however the prediction error with the modified model was of 23 to 60% less than with DRAINMOD-N.

J	Thierfelder, T				Thierfelder, T			Standard probability density functions of characterizing water quality variables in dimictic glacial boreal lakes	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION			English	Article						lake water quality data; limestone treatment; normal distribution; transformation functions		With the secure supply of healthy fresh water being a threatened essentiality for the global society, compatibility among scientists working with water quality issues must be considered as highly prioritized. To achieve this, a standard that facilitates compatible comparisons between statistical models that describe and/or predict lake water quality should contribute. A large population of dimictic glacial/boreal lakes - with variable ranges wide enough to represent a majority of such lakes - is therefore analyzed with respect to probability density functions of the seven characterizing water quality variables pH, alkalinity, conductivity, hardness, color, Secchi depth, and total phosphorus concentration. With the lakes being limestone treated, the primary variables are transformed to normal distribution in cases: 1; 'Before limestone treatment', 2; 'After limestone treatment', and 3; 'The entire database' (case 1 + case 2). It is concluded that the transformation functions derived in case 3 are sufficiently valid as optimal transformation functions in all three cases. This suggests that the transformation functions derived approximate the probability density functions of these important water quality variables in the generic class of dimictic glacial/boreal lakes, and that they should be well suited as transformation standards in natural, as well as in limestone treated lakes.

J	Suzuki, Y; Takahashi, M; Haesslein, M; Seyfried, CF				Suzuki, Y; Takahashi, M; Haesslein, M; Seyfried, CF			Development of simulation model for a combined activated-sludge and biofilm process to remove nitrogen and phosphorus	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						wastewater treatment; nitrogen and phosphorus removal; activated sludge; biofilm; immobilization; model		A simulation model was developed for a combined activated-sludge and biofilm process that was developed in Japan to achieve nitrogen and phosphorus removal without extending existing treatment facilities. The process consists of an activated-sludge process of three zones (anaerobic, anoxic, and aerobic) and a biofilm process in the form of fluidized media in the aerobic zone. In this process, nitrification is carried out by nitrifiers on the fluidized media and denitrification and phosphorus removal are performed by activated sludge. First, a biofilm model was developed by modifying components, biological processes, and detachment mechanism of an existing model using experimental results from the fluidized-bed process. Second, the biofilm model was incorporated in the International Association on Water Quality Activated Sludge Model No. 2 with the addition of a mechanism of transferring detached biofilm to activated sludge. Parameter values of this model were fitted using data from a pilot plant during a period of no rainfall. The model was then evaluated with pilot-plant data for a period of rainfall. The model developed for the combined activated-sludge and biofilm process described water quality of the pilot plant well. Necessary improvements are also discussed.

J	Koning, N; Roos, JC				Koning, N; Roos, JC			The continued influence of organic pollution on the water quality of the turbid Modder River	WATER SA			English	Article							SOUTH-AFRICA; VAAL RIVER; PHYTOPLANKTON PRODUCTIVITY; BALKFONTEIN; NUTRIENTS	The Modder River is a relatively small river which drains an area of 7960 km(2), in the central region of the Free State Province, South Africa, and has a mean annual runoff of 184 x 10(6) m(3). Botshabelo is a city which was developed in the catchment area of the river and treated sewage is released into the Klein Modder River. This study determined seasonal and spatial patterns in the system as well as the continued influence that Botshabelo's treated sewage outflow has on the water quality of the river. It was determined that the Modder River and Klein Modder River follow distinctive seasonal patterns in terms of algal growth and physical factors. There were periods when the waters of the Modder River and Klein Modder River are of acceptable quality:however, outflows from Botshabelo have a detrimental effect on the water quality, in terms of nutrient concentrations and algal biomass. The inflow of the Klein Modder River into the Modder River caused on average, 112% increase in phosphate-phosphorus (PO4-P), 171% increase in nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and a 50% increase in chlorophyll-a concentration in the Modder River. The long-term detrimental effect of Botshabelo on the system can clearly be seen by comparing predicted nutrient increases with measured values.

Transparency was significantly higher and the content of N and P decreased inside the communities, as did the rate of sedimentation of organic suspended matter in the Phragmites australis community. Modeling revealed that macrophyte restoration could decrease phytoplaniton biomass, increase fish biomass, exergy, structural exergy, zooplankton/phytoplankton ratio and transparency (Xu et al., 1999b). It is concluded that macrophyte restoration can purify lake water, regulate lake biological structure and control eutrophication.

J	Yu, N; Culver, DA				Yu, N; Culver, DA			Estimating the effective clearance rate and refiltration by zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, in a stratified reservoir	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						Dreissena; effective clearance rate; filtration rate; particulate inorganic matter; phytoplankton; refiltration; reservoir; water mixing	WESTERN LAKE ERIE; SUSPENSION-FEEDING BIVALVES; WATER-QUALITY MANAGEMENT; BENTHIC BOUNDARY-LAYER; MYTILUS-EDULIS-L; FILTRATION-RATE; ALGAL CONCENTRATION; FILTERING IMPACTS; FOOD; SESTON	1. The grazing impact of zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha Pallas, is often evaluated by applying the individual filtration rate measured in the laboratory to the field abundance and then by comparing the total volume of water filtered with the whole lake volume. Since this approach overlooks refiltration, it overestimates the grazing impact of zebra mussels. To deal with this problem, the present authors developed an in situ method for collecting faeces and pseudofaeces to measure the actual volume of water that is cleared of suspended particles by Dreissena in a unit time under a given set of environmental conditions. This is termed the effective clearance rate (ECR). 2. The experiment was conducted in Hargus Lake, OH, U.S.A., a small thermally stratified reservoir, to test the effects of spatial aggregation, mussel density and the concentration of particulate inorganic matter (PIM) on the effective clearance rate of Dreissena. 3. Over 40 measurements, the ECR values ranged from 15.3 to 68.6 mt ind(-1) h(-1). Much of the variation can be explained by colony form, mussel density and seston concentration. The effects of these variables were all statistically significant. The average ECR for isolated individuals was higher than that for those in clumps (40.4 versus 32.8 mt Ind(-1) h(-1)), which is attributed to increased refiltration in the cores of the clumps. The ECR decreased with increased zebra mussel density because of intensified competition for food particles within the group. The ECR increased with increased PIM concentration in the lake water, which may be interpreted as a result of enhanced water mixing which ultimately caused increases in both sediment resuspension and particle delivery to the mussels. 4. Taking the filtration rates for a 20-mm mussel to be between 116 and 234 mt ind(-1) h(-1), based on data from the literature, the clumped mussels under the present experimental conditions would have a refiltration ratio between 3.4 and 6.9. 5. The present authors developed an areal clearance model which predicts that seston removal by the Dreissena population is limited by the particle delivery from the ambient water to the mussel bed and will reach a maximum value beyond which no further increase will occur with increased population density. 6. It is concluded that the direct grazing impact of zebra mussel on phytoplankton in thermally stratified lakes is much less effective than predicted from simple filtration rate estimation.

Point-sources of sewage, and waste-water from fish-rearing ponds, produced the rest. Inputs of phosphorus in soluble reactive form (SRP) totalled 5 t, i.e. 63% of the TP loading in 1995, as compared with 1985 values of 11.8 t and 59%. Point-sources of SRP contributed 54% of the total SRP input in 1995 cf. 69% in 1985. Loadings from three sewage treatment works (STW) totalled 3.1 t TP in 1995 as compared with 5.3 t in 1985; this included 2.6 t SRP (cf. 3.6 t). Daily per capita outputs of the upgraded Kinross North and Milnathort STWs were 0.68 g and 0.81 g TP, respectively, compared with pre-upgrade values of 1.77 g and 2.03 g. Nett reductions in TP and SRP loadings between 1985 and 1995, are 55% and 59% respectively. These values are attributable as much to the lower rainfall of 890 mm over the period of study in 1995, compared to 1250 mm in 1985, as to 'managed' elimination of P usage at a major industrial source, and upgrades of STWs. In spite of these cutbacks, a combination of the lower rainfall and an extraordinarily hot summer in 1995 negated the expected reduction in lake phosphorus and chlorophyll levels. The lowered specific areal loading of ca. 0.7 g P m(-2) estimated for 1995 still considerably exceeds the ideal maximum for the loch. These statistics nevertheless ignore the significance of a reduction of ca. 7 t in P entering the system in bio-available form, a recently completed upgrade of a major STW and channelling of effluent from a small works out of the catchment.

The objective of this study nas to compare nutrient runoff as affected by grazing animal depositions vs. poultry litter application, Simulated rainfall was applied tn:ire to 1.5 by 6.0 m runoff plots of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) with treatments of no waste (CT), dairy calf feces and urine (DFU), poultry litter (PL), and dairy calf feces and urine with poultry litter (DFU + FL). Chemical properties of the runoff samples including pH, electrical conductivity (EC), C, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total nitrogen (TN), NH4-N, NO3-N, K, Mg, S, B, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Na, and Zn were determined. Plots receiving poultry litter had significantly greater losses of most nutrient parameters for hath rainfall simulations. For the nutrient parameters of primary interest with regard to water quality, 5.0, 29.5, and 21.9% of the TN, NH4-N, and SRP applied in the PL treatment were transported in runoff during the first rainfall simulation as compared to 3.9. 5.0, and 15.3%, respectively, for the DFU treatment. Comparable percentages of the applied nutrients were lost from the PL and DFU treatments even though the PL treatment,with the exception of NH4-N, provided at least six times the amount of each nutrient. A severe rainfall er ent shortly after poultry litter application produces significantly greater nutrient lasses as compared to similar application of grazing animal depositions at the rates used in the experiment.

Refuge managers are concerned about local water-quality effects and the amount of birdborne nutrient load that might cause eutrophication in roosting ponds and(or) be exported to downstream systems. We initiated this research effort to test the hypothesis that daily feeding migrations by geese represented a significant source of nutrients to wetland systems at the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge in the middle Rio Grande River valley of New Mexico. We documented the role of geese in translocating nutrients through a combination of time budget and mass balance models for birds, bioassays of phytoplankton growth, and stable isotope methods that trace the source of nitrogen to food webs. Geese increased the nutrient loading rates in some wetland ponds by up to 40% for total nitrogen and 75% for total phosphorus. Bioassays revealed that nitrogen was consistently limiting to primary production by algae in the ponds. Chlorophyll levels increased in proportion to bird densities. Fish and crayfish from the ponds intensively used by birds had very low stable nitrogen signatures relative to those from the Rio Grande River. This result derived from the low N-15 in alfalfa and corn, which were the primary forage for birds, and accumulated through food webs in proportion to bird use of individual ponds as roosting areas. In general, the wetland ponds functioned efficiently in retaining the birdborne, allochthonous nutrient load and only modest amounts of the total nitrogen or phosphorus were exported downstream.

A study was conducted to evaluate tillage effects on the movement of water and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) in the root zone under continuous corn (Zea mays L) production. Four tillage treatments considered were: chisel plow (CP, moldboard plow (MP), no-tillage (NT), and ridge-tillage (RT), The root zone water quality model (RZWQM: V.3.25) was used to conduct these simulations, Three years (1990-1992) of field observed data on soil water contents and NO3-N concentrations in the soil profile were used to evaluate the performance of the model. The RZWQM usually predicted higher soil water contents compared with the observed soil water contents. The model predicted higher NO3-N concentrations in the soil profile for MP and NT treatments in comparison with CP and RT treatments, but the magnitude of simulated NO3-N peak concentrations in the soil profile were substantially different from those of the observed peaks, The average NO3-N concentrations for the entire soil profile predicted by the model were close to the observed concentrations except for ridge tillage (percent difference for CP=+5.1%, MP=12.8%, NT=+18.4%, RT=-44.8%). Discrepancies between the simulated and observed water contents and NO3-N concentrations in the soil profile indicated a need for the calibration of plant growth component of the model further for different soil and climatic conditions to improve the N-uptake predictions of the RZWQM.

The RZWQM was calibrated for corn and soybean crops separately using crop-specific calibration parameters. The main crop specific parameters of maximum nitrogen.uptake rate (g/plant/day), proportion of photosynthesis to respiration, and amount of biomass (g) needed to obtain leaf area index of 1.0 were calibrated to 2.0, 0.12, 10.0 for corn and 0.5, 0.005 and 1.5 for soybean, respectively. The predicted subsurface drain flows and NO3-N concentrations in the drainage water were compared with the measured values. The predicted subsurface drain flows followed the pattern of measured drain flows, giving an average difference of about +2.0% and -9.7% for corn and soybean, respectively. The predicted NO3-N concentrations in tile water were in good agreement with the measured values for all simulation periods (overall average difference was less than 1%). The evaluation of the model for validation years (1995 and 1996) showed correlation coefficients of 0.66 and 0.57 between predicted and measured NO3-N concentrations for corn and soybean, respectively. The overall predicted NO3-N losses were within 5% of the observed NO3-N losses for both cropping systems. This shows that the crop specific parameters of the RZWQM have the potential to simulate satisfactorily the effect of crop rotation-and swine manure application in alternate years and N-fixation by soybean on NO3-N losses with subsurface drain flow.

A two-dimensional, two-layer hydrodynamic model of tidal flows and salt transport calculated the water level, velocity and salinity in each grid cell of 50 m square in each layer within the culture area approximately every 30 s during a tidal cycle. Results from this flow model provided hydraulic data for input into a three-dimensional tidal water quality model, which was run to simulate water quality due to specified pollutant loadings from the marine fish culture operations. Simulated output from the models agreed reasonably well with observed field data, except for dissolved oxygen and nitrate levels in surface waters. This could be due to a conservative estimation of re-aeration rates in the model system. In applying the models to sub-tropical waters of Hong Kong, the simulation predicted the extent of pollution and area affected under varying fish stock and pollutant loadings. It was shown that impacts of fish culture activities on water quality at the test culture site were localized owing to strong advection by tidal residual flows. The higher simulated level of organic nitrogen in the bottom waters over the year at the lest fish culture sire was due to increased release of organic nitrogen through decay of wasted feed from the sea bed and from trash fish feed. Models of marine fish culture and environmental effects have applications in determining acceptable stocking levels, and the effects of changing feed and culture species, and for locating suitable culture sites in coastal areas.

J	Wolfinbarger, WC				Wolfinbarger, WC			Influences of biotic and abiotic factors on seasonal succession of zooplankton in Hugo Reservoir, Oklahoma, USA	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						seasonal succession; bottom up factors; top down factors; zooplankton; edible phytoplankton; primary productivity	POPULATION-DYNAMICS; DAPHNIA-PULICARIA; CLUTCH-SIZE; BODY-SIZE; PREDATION; LAKE; FOOD; COMMUNITY; INTERFERENCE; REPRODUCTION	I measured water quality variables, primary productivity, biomass of phytoplankton palatable to zooplankton and zooplankton abundance in mesotrophic Hugo Reservoir, Oklahoma (U.S.A.) at weekly to biweekly intervals between March and September, 1996. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to estimate the influence of abiotic factors and resource availability in structuring the zooplankton assemblage over the season. Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to determine spatial and temporal variation in zooplankton abundances and to make comparisons between repeated measures ANOVA and CCA in analyzing the zooplankton assemblage. In addition, I analyzed relationships among cladoceran reproductive parameters (egg ratio, instantaneous birth rate, reproductive ratio and mean brood size) and environmental factors over the season using product moment correlation. Results showed little evidence of bottom-up control of the zooplankton assemblage. CCA and correlations suggested temperature was the most important factor regulating assemblage structure over the season. Several inverse relationships were seen among cladoceran reproductive parameters and temperature. Declines in Holopedium gibberum Zaddach, Bosmina longirostris Muller and Ceriodaphnia lacustris Birge during June corresponded with increases in mean temperature to above 25 degrees C. Increases in birth rates at the time of population declines suggested that population declines were a result of increased mortality rates (likely due to high water temperature or predation). Spatial variation in the zooplankton assemblage coincided with differences in both temperature and turbidity among sites. Lower abundances of Daphnia parvula Fordyce and C. lacustris and a higher abundance of rotifers at the up-reservoir site coincided with higher mean temperature of the water column and higher turbidity than down-reservoir sites. CCA and ANOVA showed similar results for the spatial and temporal variation in the zooplankton assemblage while CCA provided a more clear approach for analyzing the effects of environmental variables on the assemblage.

These data are intended to provide a benchmark for comparison with future metal concentration data measurements. The Steinhatchee River estuary is a relatively pristine bay located within the Big Bend Wildlife Management Area on the North Central Florida Gulf of Mexico coastline. The river flows 55 km through woodlands and planted pines before emptying into the Gulf at Deadman Harbor. Water quality in the estuary is excellent at present. There is minimal development within the watershed The estuary is part of art extensive system of marshes that formed along the Florida Gulf coast during the Holocene marine transgression. Sediment accretion rate measurements range from 1.4 to 4.1 mm/yr on the basis of lead-210 measurements. Seventy-nine short cores were collected from 66 sample locations, representing four lithofacies: clay- and organic-rich sands, organic-rich sands, clean quartz sands, and oyster bioherms. Samples were analyzed for texture, total organic matter total carbon, total nitrogen, clay mineralogy, and major and trace-metal content. Following these analyses, metal concentrations were normalized against geochemical reference elements (aluminum and iron) and against total weight percent organic matter. Metals were also normalized granulometrically against total weight percent fines (< 0.062 mm). Concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) for all metals except mercury. Mercury concentrations were determined by cold-flameless atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Granulometric measurements were made by sieve and pipette analyses. Organic matter was determined by two methods: weight loss upon ignition and elemental analysis (by Carlo-Erba Furnace) of carbon and nitrogen. X-ray diffraction was used to determine clay mineralogy. Trace-metal concentrations were best correlated when normalized with respect to sediment aluminum concentrations. Normalizations indicate that most major and trace-metal concentrations fall within 95% prediction limits of the expected value. This finding suggests that little significant metal contamination occurred within this system prior to 1993 sediment sampling. Exceptions include lead mercury, copper, zinc, potassium, and phosphorous. Lead and mercury are elements that generally enter this watershed through atmospheric deposition; thus anomalous levels of these metals are not necessarily associated with activities within the watershed of the Steinhatchee River estuary. Anomalous concentrations of other metals such as zinc, copper, and phosphorous probably do originate within the Steinhatchee watershed. Copper failed to correlate well with any geochemical or granulometric normalizer; and this condition was not limited to a single facies or area within the estuary. This finding may indicate copper contamination in the system. Increased zinc and copper levels may be attributed to marine paints. Phosphorous levels also appeared to be elevated in a few locations in the two marsh facies sampled. This may be due to nutrient loading from two small communities, Jena and Steinhatchee, or from the application of this element in fertilizer to reduce moisture stress to young planted pines on tree farms within the watershed.

In situ water quality data and reflectance imagery collected on 10 different dates were used to calibrate a general optical equation relating satellite-derived reflectance (R-d), nominally R-(630 nm) to K-PAR. Additional spectral data (e.g., absorption, subsurface reflectance), related reflectance and K-PAR to changes in phytoplankton pigments, organic matter, and suspended sediments. Optically, Pamlico Sound, North Carolina is dominated by scattering from suspended sediments, whereas the tributary rivers are dominated by absorption from both dissolved and particulate organic matter. A general relationship developed between R-d and K-PAR (r(2)=0.72) in Pamlico Sound was found useful in a variety of environmental conditions; however a relationship between R-d and suspended sediment concentration was less robust, and affected by changing sediment characteristics. In the rivers, high and variable absorption in the visible wavelengths precluded development of a relationship between R-d and K-PAR. The relationship developed between R-d and K-PAR in Pamlico Sound is similar to those determined for Delaware Bay and Mobile Bay in previous studies, suggesting possible broader regional application of algorithms for coastal bays and estuaries having similar sediment characteristics, with direct application to SeaWiFS data.

The specific wetland conditions (horizontal flow, long hydraulic retention time) encourage both nitrification and denitrification in the same "reactor system" simultaneously. Nitrogen was removed fdr the entire duration of the experiment. No significant amounts of nitrite were formed. The average efficiency of nitrogen removal corresponded to that of wetland systems used for domestic wastewater treatment cited in the literature. The pilot plant acts like a filter with a limited filtration capacity for low molecular (< 1 kDa) and especially large (> 0.3 mu m) organic components. Consequently, the decolorisation of the water and the removal of the total organics decreased over time. Nevertheless, the decolorisation and the removal of the DOC proportions of organics within the size range of 1 kDa to 0.3 mu m increased. Calculations show that it ought to be feasible to use a constructed wetland system as part of a complex remediation programme to improve overall water quality and in particular to remove large amounts of NH4+ nitrogen.

J	Thierfelder, T				Thierfelder, T			The role of catchment hydrology in the characterization of water quality in glacial/boreal lakes	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						catchment hydrology; lake water quality; distributed statistical modeling	FLOW; PHOSPHORUS; ALKALINITY; RUNOFF; MODELS; AREAS	In an empirical/statistical approach, the relationship between watershed characteristics and the inter-lake variance of chemical lake water composition is analyzed. The lake water quality data sampled in 87 extensively monitored glacial/boreal lakes is hence supplemented with digital landscape information covering the categories: geology, soils, land cover, and topography. With standard I : 50 000 scale maps as the source of information, 33 classes of landscape elements are identified and described with respect to morphological and hydrological characteristics. When regression models based on the combined morphology/ hydrology information are compared with models excluding the hydrology information, the hypothesis whether or not information regarding hydrological watershed characteristics improves the performance of existing models can be tested. It is concluded that the introduction of hydrological element descriptors significantly improves the overall performance of regression models describing the inter-lake variance of lake water: hardness, color, pH, total phosphorus concentration, alkalinity, conductivity, and Secchi depth. When these variables are ranked according to the amount of model performance achieved, the general importance of surface hydrology in the process of emitting and transporting associated substances through the landscape can be assessed. Out of the 33 landscape elements totally digitized, ten are identified as significantly correlated to the inter-lake variance of characterizing lake water quality. When they are ranked according to their influential power, the consequence of watershed interference can be qualitatively assessed. The results should be easily implemented in watershed management and because of the general validity given by the extensive empirical database - valid in many glacial/boreal watersheds throughout the world.

This study was conducted to assess the ability of the Root Zone Water Qualify Model (RZWQM) to simulate dryland and irrigated corn (Zea mays L.) production systems in semiarid eastern Colorado. The model was first parameterized for corn using field data from a single season. Different parameters were identified for irrigated and dryland corn. The parameterized model was run on independent data sets from the following year (irrigated) and different soils and sites (dryland) and model results mere compared with field measurements. Differences between modeled and measured components of soil water content, evapotranspiration, grain yield and biomass, and crop N uptake ranged from 1 to 23% in the dryland study and from 1 to 28% in the irrigated study, On a seasonal basis, model estimates of seepage below the roof zone were within 3% of measured values, while NO3-N leaching was overpredicted by 79%. Note that model parameterization relied solely on single-season data. This could potentially produce bias in parameter values due to tbe narrowness of the prevailing conditions during that single season. For this reason and for the purpose of using the model to assess the long-term impact of alternative practices, further work on parameterization and evaluation of the model needs to focus on using experimental observations from multiple seasons.

This model was originally designed to study the eutrophication in the central part of the Venice lagoon. Four model outputs and six input factors are considered in this paper. Sensitivity analysis is performed using the Sobol' method:and linear regression based methods. Results of this study suggest that nitrogen load, the main controllable factor, plays a major role in governing the primary production of the whole system. However, the "history" of the system, represented by the initial density of benthic algae, is even more important in determining the occurrence of dramatic events, such as anoxic crisis, which may happen in particular areas.

J	Benham, BL; Mote, CR				Benham, BL; Mote, CR			Investigating dairy lagoon effluent treatability in a laboratory-scale constructed wetlands system	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						water quality; wetland systems; effluent; dairy lagoons; waste treatment; nutrient removal; constructed wetlands	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; ARTIFICIAL WETLANDS; NITROGEN REMOVAL; AQUATIC PLANTS	Dairy lagoon supernatant treatability was evaluated using 10 laboratory-scale (1.5 m x 0.45 m) constructed wetlands. Selected design and operational variables were examined. Tested treatments were combinations of three organic loading rates (high, medium, and low) and three types of microbial attachment sites (vegetated, inert, and none). Five combinations (two replications each) of organic loading rate and microbial attachment sites were tested. Removal efficiencies were based on analysis of influent/effluent waste constituent levels. Dominant nitrogen removal mechanisms were determined from an examination of influent/effluent nitrogen speciation. In addition, an analysis of waste degradation kinetics provided insight with respect to the applicability of a widely used design model. Results showed consistently high nitrogen-removal efficiencies (65 to 81%) for all treatments. Nitrogen speciation results indicate that nitrification/denitrification was the dominant nitrogen removal mechanism. Carbon removal was less efficient (6 to 39%), and varied with influent strength. Waste utilization kinetic rate-constants from the five treatments were not statistically different (alpha = 0.05). The design model uses microbial attachment site parameters, such as specific surface area, to modify a base reaction rate-constant (i.e., a rate-constant for a system with no microbial attachment sites). In this case, the rate-constant for the control (treatments with no microbial attachment sites) was not statistically different from either the vegetated or the inert treatments.

J	Thebault, JM; Qotbi, A				Thebault, JM; Qotbi, A			A model of phytoplankton development in the lot river (France). Simulations of scenarios	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						model; river; eutrophication; phytoplankton	CONTINUOUS CULTURE; NUTRIENT STATUS; SEINE RIVER; ALGAL CELLS; PHOSPHATE; GROWTH; LIGHT	A multidisciplinary study was conducted to predict water quality in the Lot River and to estimate the impact of nutrient inputs on algal production: measurement surveys, estimation of nutrient inputs, hydraulic modeling and biological modeling. This paper presents the biological model that simulates the evolution in phytoplankton (chlorophyll and biovolume), nutrients (N-NH4, N-NO3, P-PO4) and detrital elements (N and P) in the developed stretch of the river (300 km). The model takes into account the measured or estimated nutrient inputs. The variables calculated by the hydraulic model, such as illumination and water temperature, are introduced by forcing. The model was first calibrated with measurements taken in a series of dynamic water mass monitoring studies, during the low-water periods of 1991 and 1992. The simulations correctly reproduce evolution in the different variables measured on site, through a broad range of low-water flow values (from 9-94 m(3) s(-1)), with a single set of coefficients. We then chose three scenarios to attempt to evaluate the impact of a modification in nutrient inputs: large-scale connection of towns to sewage treatment plants and improvements in their efficiency; the consequences of saturation of existing sewage treatment plants; the simultaneous effects of stratification of the deep downstream reaches and of high nutrient inputs linked to summer tourism activities.

J	Tarutis, WJ; Stark, LR; Williams, FM				Tarutis, WJ; Stark, LR; Williams, FM			Sizing and performance estimation of coal mine drainage wetlands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						coal mine drainage; constructed wetlands; efficiency; first-order removal; loading rate; removal kinetics; sizing; zero-order removal	CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; WATER-QUALITY; IRON; KINETICS; REMOVAL; MODEL; PHOSPHORUS; RETENTION; MECHANISM; DESIGN	The effectiveness of wetland treatment of acid mine drainage (AMD) was assessed using three measures of performance: treatment efficiency, area-adjusted removal, and first-order removal. Mathematical relationships between these measures were derived from simple kinetic equations. Area-adjusted removal is independent of pollutant concentration (zero-order reaction kinetics), while first-order removal is dependent on concentration. Treatment efficiency is linearly related to area-adjusted removal and exponentially related to first-order removal at constant hydraulic loading rates (flow/area). Examination of previously published data from 35 natural AMD wetlands revealed that statistically significant correlations exist between several of the performance measures for both iron and manganese removal, but these correlations are potentially spurious because these measures are derived from, and are mathematical rearrangements of, the same operating data. The use of treatment efficiency as a measure of performance between wetlands is not recommended because it is a relative measure that does not account for influent concentration differences. Area-adjusted removal accounts for mass loading effects, but it fails to separate the flow and concentration components, which is necessary if removal is first-order. Available empirical evidence suggests that AMD pollutant removal is better described by first-order kinetics. If removal is first-order, the use of area-adjusted rates for determining the wetland area required for treating relatively low pollutant concentrations will result in undersized wetlands. The effects of concentration and flow rate on wetland area predictions for constant influent loading rates also depend on the kinetics of pollutant removal. If removal is zero-order, the wetland area required to treat a discharge to meet some target effluent concentration is a decreasing linear function of influent concentration (and an inverse function of flow rate). However, if removal is first-order, the required wetland area is a non-linear function of the relative influent concentration. Further research is needed for developing accurate first-order rate constants as a function of influent water chemistry and ecosystem characteristics in order to successfully apply the first-order removal model to the design of more effective AMD wetland treatment systems.

J	Johnes, PJ				Johnes, PJ			Understanding lake and catchment history as a tool for integrated lake management	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Hydrobiologia	MAR, 1996	UNIV LEICESTER, LEICESTER, ENGLAND		UNIV LEICESTER	nitrogen; phosphorus; non-point source; export; catchment modelling	LAND-USE CHANGE; WATER-QUALITY; AGRICULTURAL CATCHMENTS; LOUGH NEAGH; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; PHYTOPLANKTON; WASHINGTON; DYNAMICS; SHALLOW	Sustainable lake management for nutrient-enriched lakes must be underpinned by an understanding of both the functioning of the lake, and the origins of changes in nutrient loading from the catchment. To date, limnologists have tended to focus on studying the impact of nutrient enrichment on the lake biota, and the dynamics of nutrient cycling between the water column, biota and sediments within the lake. Relatively less attention has been paid to understanding the specific origins of nutrient loading from the catchment and nutrient transport pathways linking the lake to its catchment. As such, when devising catchment management strategies to reduce nutrient loading on enriched lakes, assumptions have been made regarding the relative significance of non-point versus point sources in the catchment. These are not always supported by research conducted on catchment nutrient dynamics in other fields of freshwater science. Studies on nutrient enrichment in lakes need to take account of the history of catchment use and management specific to each lake in order to devise targeted and sustainable management strategies to reduce nutrient loading to enriched lakes. Here a modelling approach which allows quantification of the relative contribution of nutrients from each specific point and non-point catchment source over the course of catchment history is presented. The approach has been applied to three contrasting catchments in the U.K. for the period 1931 to present. These are the catchment of Slapton Ley in south Devon, the River Esk in Cumbria and the Deben Estuary in Suffolk. Each catchment showed marked variations in the nature and intensity of land use and management. The model output quantifies the relative importance of point source versus non-point livestock and land use sources in each of the catchments, and demonstrates the necessity for an understanding of site-specific catchment history in devising suitable management strategies for the reduction of nutrient loading on enriched lakes.

J	Reynolds, CS				Reynolds, CS			Modelling phytoplankton dynamics and its application to lake management	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Hydrobiologia	MAR, 1996	UNIV LEICESTER, LEICESTER, ENGLAND		UNIV LEICESTER	phytoplankton; dynamics; modelling	CULTURE	Conceptual models assist the understanding of complex, multivariate problems. Management models should offer reliable predictions of the outcome of alternative approaches to problems which assist the manager to decide the optimal course of action. It is rare for one model to fulfil both purposes. Excessive phytoplankton production in lakes, reservoirs and rivers presents, at best, a potentially conspicuous detraction from water quality or, at worst, a lethal cocktail which must be excluded from recreational waters and potable supplies. Thus, the difficulties may relate as much to the type of organisms present and to the problems they may cause as they do to the biomass that may be achieved. Examples will be cited of some particular problems of lake and reservoir management that have been confronted in recent years. The range of model solutions available to plankton biologists is reviewed. The philosophies of these are unsympathetic to specific management problems; the models are shown to be unhelpful and potentially misleading in the context of the questions usually asked. Even when quite general questions are submitted to generalised models, imprecision can lead to erroneous judgements. Approaches to making much more process-based models and expert systems are advocated. The ability to identify and quantify the principal regulatory processes in operation, including the effects of light, turbidity and physical mixing and those relating to the trophic structure, is highlighted. Dynamic simulations, based upon the population ecology of several selected species simultaneously can give reasonable fits to observable phenomena. Applying altered model components to simulate viable options can be tested for their likely comparative impacts. A yet more recent approach to modelling lake metabolism is introduced for its potential as a guide to determining management impacts and priorities at particular sites. The objective of the paper is to encourage the development of site-specific functional models which are oriented to both conceptual and management issues. We have to overcome the widespread but naive "my lake is phosphorus-limited" syndrome if we are to learn how to better manage our standing waters.

J	Melzer, A				Melzer, A			Aquatic macrophytes as tools for lake management	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Hydrobiologia	MAR, 1996	UNIV LEICESTER, LEICESTER, ENGLAND		UNIV LEICESTER	macrophytes; macrophyte index; bioindication; water quality; lakes	MYRIOPHYLLUM-SPICATUM; DIATOM ASSEMBLAGES; PHOSPHORUS; EUTROPHICATION; TRANSLOCATION; NUTRITION; SEDIMENTS; ONTARIO; CANADA; ROOTS	Aquatic macrophytes can serve as useful indicators of water pollution along the littoral of lakes. In Bavaria, the submerged vegetation of about 100 lakes has been investigated by SCUBA diving over the past decade to evaluate the state of nutrient pollution. All lakes are marl lakes located in the northern calcareous alps and the prealpine region. The lakes differ in size, morphology, water residence time, nutrient loading, trophic status, recreational activities, and other characteristics. In all cases the entire shoreline of the lakes has been investigated. Among the investigated lakes are the three biggest Bavarian lakes, i.e. Lake Chiemsee, Lake Starnberg and Lake Ammersee. Mapping of the submerged vegetation occurred in four different depth zones, and variable shoreline sections. The length of each section was determined by the uniformity of the vegetation; as it changed, a new section was designated. Within each section and zone species were recorded and abundance of all observed macrophytes was estimated semi-quantitatively on a five-point scale. Nine different groups of macrophytes were recognised, including, in total, 45 different species of macrophytes. On the basis of this catalogue of indicator species, in combination with the abundance of the species, a 'macrophyte index' was devised, which ranges from 1 (unpolluted) to 5 (heavily polluted). Six groups of values of the macrophyte index, each represented by a different colour or grey-scale (in this publication), are presented to allow a clear illustration of the results. Important information for the successful restoration of lakes in Upper Bavaria has been obtained from the distribution patterns of the submerged vegetation. Many unknown waste water inflows or diffuse sources could be detected due to abrupt changes in the macrophyte index. Furthermore, the success of waste water removal by 'ring canalisation', resulting in a re-oligotrophication of many Bavarian lakes can be followed by changes in the macrophyte index.

The management of the fish stock may be a measure of water quality, of fish stock composition or a measure of both and may vary from very drastic removal of planktivorous and benthivorous fish to a more gradual change in the population by continual predator management and less drastic reduction of inedible prey. For lake restoration, drastic removal is the most efficient in order to obtain clear water and vegetation and a subsequent fish community adapted to this. Continual management will result in a more gradual change and may be more acceptable to the interest of both fishermen and water quality managers.

Many different models exist for water and pollutant movement, causing problems of selection because each model has often been constructed for specific purposes, and the choice of an appropriate one is difficult: wrongly applied models can lead to unreliable results and misleading information. The selection of a model for estimating phosphorus loss from a lowland English catchment is described. 14 models, whose underlying principles had been published, were evaluated. 'SWAT' was found to be the most suitable. It has several favourable qualities, but also several shortfalls which may impair its predictive ability. Their identification enables the model code to be re-written. Reliability estimation is needed to ensure that the ranges of model prediction are known.

In order to find synthetic descriptors useful for following the spatial and temporal variations of biogeochemical phenomena occurring in the considered ecosystem, the data set has been factorized using principal component analysis. A graphical display of scores, by means of boxplots and biplots, helped in the interpretation of the data set. The first factor conditioning the system is related to the input of freshwater from the estuary of the Isonzo River and to the stratification of the seawater (thermohaline discontinuity), while the second and third components describe interactions between biological activity, nutrients and physicochemical parameters; typical spring and autumn phytoplankton blooms were identified, in addition to an exceptional winter bloom conditioned by anomalous meteorological/climatic conditions. The fourth principal component explains the reducing activity of seawaters, which often increases when the decomposition of organic matter is relevant. The simple linear model proposed, and the related graphs, are shown to be useful tools for monitoring the main features of such a complex dynamic environmental system. The outlined approach to the considered complex data structure presents in a cognitive easy way (graphical outputs) the significant variations of the data, and allows for a detailed interpretation of the results of the monitoring campaign. Temporal and spatial effects are outlined, as well as those related to the depth in the water column.

J	Edwards, DR; Moore, PA; Workman, SR; Bushee, EL				Edwards, DR; Moore, PA; Workman, SR; Bushee, EL			Runoff of metals from alum-treated horse manure and municipal sludge	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						manure; sludge; metals; runoff	SEWAGE-SLUDGE; WATER-QUALITY; POULTRY LITTER; LAND APPLICATION; SOIL; NITROGEN; BIOAVAILABILITY; DISPOSAL; COPPER; IMPACT	Land application of organic soil amendments can increase runoff concentrations of metals such as Fe and Zn, metalloids such as B and As, and non-metals such as P and S that have the potential for causing adverse environmental impacts. Aluminum sulfate, or alum (Al-2(SO4)(3).(14H(2)O), can reduce concentrations of some materials in runoff from sites treated with organic amendments. The objectives of this study were to (a) quantify concentrations of selected constituents (Al, As, B, Ca, Cd, Co, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, P, Pb, S, Se, Ti, and Zn) in runoff from plots treated with horse manure (mixed with stall bedding) and municipal sludge, (b) assess runoff quality effects of alum addition to those treatments, and (c) determine time variations in concentrations of the constituents. Horse manure and municipal sludge were applied to twelve 2.4 by 6.1 m fescue plots (six each for the manure and sludge). Alum was added to three of the manure-treated and three of the sludge-treated plots. Simulated rainfall (64 mm/h) was applied to the 12 treated plots and to three control (no treatment) plots. The first 0.5 h runoff was sampled and analyzed for the constituents described above. Addition of manure or sludge had no effect on runoff concentrations of the majority of constituents. In some cases (e.g., Al, As, Fe, Zn), however, concentrations were near or in excess of threshold values recommended for marine wildlife protection. Alum addition increased runoff of Al, Ca, K, and S, due likely to its composition and by the addition of lime to counteract the acidity of alum. Concentration decreases of more than 50 percent were noted for P for the horse manure treatment. No alum effect was detected for P in runoff from the sludge-treated plots, possibly due to relatively stable P forms in the sludge. Runoff concentrations of Al, As, Fe, K, Mn, and P followed an approximately first-order decline with respect to time. Runoff concentrations of Ca and S, however, peaked during the second runoff sample (four minutes following initiation of runoff), suggesting that differences in mobility and/or transport mechanisms exist among the materials investigated.

For this purpose a laboratory scale unit was designed to evaluate the effect of continuous flow metals mixture in forms if triple and penta metals in Nile water algae. Clear changes in algal biomass in terms of chlorophyll a (chl a) took place when subjected to metals combination. The rise or decline in chi a was in relation with other algal pigments (chl b, chi c, carotenoides and phenophytin), protein and carbohydrate content of algal cells. Substantial changes in phytoplankton community structure was detected and the most tolerant group was blue-green algae followed by green algae while diatoms was the most sensitive group. The most dominant species in all cases were blue-green alga Oscillatoria mougeotii and green alga Scenedesmus quadricauda. In addition clear changes in morphological shape was observed for tolerant species belonging to the three algal groups. Nile water algae has ability to remove and accumulate metals in the following order therefore Zn > Cd > Ni > Cu > Cr. In addition, phytoplankton has ability to recovered from the stress of metals when eliminated from the media and the recovered biomass was nearly equivalent to that before exposing to metals stress. The overall effect of metals mixture depending on the type and number of metals, the algal community structure and ratio between different morphological forms of algae (unicellular, colonial and filamentous).

Root-zone N losses to surface and groundwater were estimated as the N surplus (the excess of N additions from inorganic fertilizer, manure, and atmospheric deposition over N removals by the crop and denitrification) for the root zone of land in agricultural production. The N surplus for the study area as a whole was 68 (kg N) ha(-1) land in agricultural production, whereas an N surplus of < 50 (kg N) ha(-1) would be expected under optimal N management. Calculation of N surplus values on the basis of individual districts as compared to the entire study area predicted a greater effect of agricultural production on water quality because of a non-optimal distribution of nutrients. High N surplus values within individual districts, up to 238 (kg N) ha(-1), were attributed to animal intensification, particularly poultry and swine production which does not require a local land base for feed production. Root-zone N losses increased between 1981 and 1991, primarily because of the concentration of animal production in specific geographical areas and on a diminished agricultural land base. Improved fertilizer and manure management was predicted to reduce the N surplus of the study area from 68 to 5 (kg N) ha(-1'); however, less than one-half of this reduction could be practically realized at this time. Improved animal diets were predicted to reduce the N surplus from 68 to 45 (kg N) ha(-1), with most of the reduction occurring in areas with high root-zone N losses. The results demonstrate the value of using an N balance approach to evaluate the environmental effect of agricultural production on air and water quality, and to assess how this effect could be reduced through improved management practices.

J	Weilguni, H; Humpesch, UH				Weilguni, H; Humpesch, UH			Long-term trends of physical, chemical and biological variables in the River Danube 1957-1995: A statistical approach	AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article						long-term study; time series; simulation; physical; chemical and biological variables; Danube; quantitative ecology		A 39-year series (1957 - 1995) of data on fourteen physical, chemical and biological variables from the Austrian section of the River Danube west of Vienna - Nussdorf was analysed statistically to detect long-term trends of the variables in relation to human activities (represented by time), discharge and water temperature. Principal component analysis distinguished four main components explaining 72 % of the total variance: PC1 contains total phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus, ammonium and potassium permanganate values, PC2 contains nitrate-N, chloride and oxygen, PC3 contains BOD5 and nitrite-N, and PC4 contains numbers of bacteria. Trends in time were most pronounced for variables in PC1, but also occurred in PC2; variables in PC3 and PC4 had no trends. Seasonal patterns were marked for variables in PC2, slightly less in PC1, and least in PC3 and PC4. Concentrations were minimal in summer and maximal in winter, inversely related to discharge (maximal in summer). Following reductions in point-source nutrient inputs to the Danube, in both Germany and Austria, mean concentrations in the river have fallen by at least half since the 1980s. Chloride and nitrate-N also show trends towards lower concentrations. The Danube is well-oxygenated, with concentrations near air saturation values. A mathematical relationship between concentrations of the variables and river discharge (Q), water temperature (T) and time (t), was established to determine mean trends and predictions against a background of considerable seasonal and stochastic variability; for the single variables Q explained 0-20 % and T explained 2-58 % of the variation in the concentrations. The relationship was highest for variables in PC2 and lowest for those in PC3 and PC4, where Q and T had little or no influence. Reasons for rising and falling long-term trends with time are discussed in detail. Austria now contributes only minor proportions to the nutrient load of the Danube, which is causing eutrophication of the Black Sea downstream, and water quality of the Austrian section of the river is good.

J	Silva, RG; Cameron, KC; Di, HJ; Hendry, T				Silva, RG; Cameron, KC; Di, HJ; Hendry, T			A lysimeter study of the impact of cow urine, dairy shed effluent, and nitrogen fertiliser on nitrate leaching	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH			English	Article						pasture soil; urea; drainage; water quality	FEEDLOT MANURE APPLICATIONS; AFFECTED AREAS; PASTURE; FATE; FLOW	The effect of cow urine, dairy shed effluent (DE), and urea fertiliser on nitrate leaching was determined using undisturbed soil lysimeters (500 mm diameter by 700 mm deep) with ryegrass (Lolium perenne){white clover (Trifolium repens) pasture. Cow urine was applied to the lysimeters, at rates of 0 and 1000 kg N/ha in May 1996. Urea and DE were applied to urine-applied and non-urine-applied lysimeters at rates of 0, 200, and 400 kg N/ha in 4 split equal applications in May, August, and November 1996 and February 1997. Natural rainfall was supplemented with simulated rainfall in winter and spring (May-October) to achieve the 75th percentile of winter-spring rainfall records in the region. Flood irrigation was applied 6 times during summer-autumn (November{April) at 100 mm per application, which is a typical practice used by dairy farmers in the region. Drainage water was collected and analysed for nitrate, nitrite, bromide (added tracer), and ammonium. Over the first year of the experiment (May 1996{April 1997), 12% of the urine-N applied was lost through leaching, mainly in nitrate form. When urine (1000 kg N/ha) was applied in combination with DE (200 kg N/ha) and urea (200 kg N/ha), the mineral N leaching loss increased to 14% of the total N applied. The annual average nitrate concentrations in the drainage from the lysimeters that received urine alone, or urine+DE and/or urea, were 33-57 mg N/L, with a mean peak concentration of 110 mg N/L. These nitrate concentrations were significantly higher than in those treatments that did not receive urine (1-5 mg N/L). Because, on average, about 25% of the area of a grazed dairy paddock receives urine per year, the field-scale leaching losses were calculated by taking into account the dilution erect of drainage water from non-urine patch areas of the paddock. The calculated annual paddock losses were 33-60 kg N/ha, and on average the annual paddock nitrate concentrations were 10-17 mg N/L. This demonstrates the importance of accounting for the dilution of nitrate in the leachate from non-urine patch areas of the paddock. The annual average concentration from the treatment DE at 400 kg N/ha was significantly lower than that from the urea treatment at the same rate. This was probably because of the different chemical forms of N in each material, and needs to be taken into account when developing regional rules for land application of urea and effluents.

The "top" (surface sediments, present-day) and "bottom" (generally from >30 cm deep, representing historical conditions) samples from sediment cores collected from lakes and reservoirs were analyzed for diatom assemblages. The distribution of diatom species was closely related to several environmental variables, primarily lake water pH, total phosphorus, and chloride. Using weighted-averaging calibration and regression approaches, we constructed predictive models to infer these variables from the diatom assemblages. The diatom-based inference models were then used to assess the current status of lake water quality and to assess historical changes in lake water conditions in natural lakes over the past 150 years. Changes were also assessed in reservoirs. Population estimates of historical changes in limnological variables were made for all lakes of the northeast United States and also for lakes in the Adirondacks, New England Uplands, and Coastal Lowlands/Plateau ecoregions. The extent of cultural impact has been quite variable among the ecoregions, with marked water quality deterioration occurring in hundreds of lakes. Chloride and phosphorus levels have increased, especially in lakes that currently have high concentrations. Low-pH lakes have become more common in all three ecoregions. The maximum abundance of low-pH lakes was recorded in the Adirondacks, an area receiving the highest acidic precipitation in the northeast. In the Coastal Lowlands/Plateau, there has been a clear increase in eutrophic lakes, as inferred by total phosphorus. This was accompanied by a marked increase in the number of lakes with high chloride levels.

Phosphorus (P) is often the key nutrient found to be limiting in both estuarine and freshwater ecosystems. As such, the ability of wetlands and streams to retain P is key to determining downstream water quality. This article reviews the processes and factors regulating P retention in streams and wetlands and evaluates selected methodologies used to estimate P retention in these systems. Phosphorus retention mechanisms reviewed include uptake and release by vegetation, periphyton and microorganisms; sorption and exchange reactions with soils and sediments; chemical precipitation in the water column; and sedimentation and entrainment. These mechanisms exemplify the combined biological, physical, and chemical nature of P retention in wetlands and streams. Methodologies used to estimate P retention include empirical input-output analysis and mass balances, and process kinetics applied at various scales, including micro- and mesocosms to full-scale systems. Although complex numerical models are available to estimate P retention and transport, a simple understanding of P retention at the process level is important, but the overall picture provided by mass balance and kinetic evaluations are often more useful in estimating long-term P retention.

Field data from 1985 to 1990 were used to parameterize the models. Phytoplankton kinetic rates and constants were obtained from a related in situ study; others from modeling literature. The hydrodynamic model was calibrated to estimates of daily lake volume; the water quality model was calibrated for ammonia, nitrate, ortho-phosphate, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a, biochemical oxygen demand, organic nitrogen, and organic phosphorus. Water quality calibration suggested the model characterized phytoplankton and nutrient dynamics quite well. The model was Validated (Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample goodness-of-fit test at P < 0.05) by reparameterizing the nutrient loading functions using an independent set of field data. The models identified several factors that may contribute to the spatial variability previously reported from other research in the reservoir, despite the superficial absence of complex structure. Sensitivity analysis of the phytoplankton kinetic rates suggest that study site-specific estimates were important for obtaining model fit to field data. Sediment sources of ammonia (10-60 mg m(-2) day(-1)) and phosphate (1-6 mg m(-2) day(-1)) were important to achieve model calibration, especially during periods of high temperatures and low dissolved oxygen. This sediment flux accounted for 78% (nitrogen) and 50% (phosphorus) of the annual load. Spatial and temporal variability in the lake, reflected in the calibrated and validated models, suggest that ecological factors that influence phytoplankton productivity and nutrient dynamics are different in various parts of the lake. The WASPS model as implemented here does not fully accommodate the ecological variability in Lake Marion due to model constraints on the specification of rate constants. This level of spatial detail may not be appropriate for an operational reservoir model, but as a research tool the models are both versatile and useful. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

S	Mishima, S; Matsumoto, N; Oda, K		Brebbia, CA; Uso, JL		Mishima, S; Matsumoto, N; Oda, K			Nitrogen flow and environmental risk in relation to agriculture in Japan	ECOSYSTEMS AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT II	ADVANCES IN ECOLOGICAL SCIENCES		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Ecosystems and Sustainable Development (ECOSUD 99)	1999	ISL LEMNOS, GREECE	Wessex Inst Technol, Univ Juame 1				Residual nitrogen on agricultural fields, due to the difference between inputs (fertilizer, manure, etc.) and outputs (cropping, denitrification), is thought to be one of the environmental risks caused by agricultural practice. Nitrogen in nonutilized livestock wastes discharged to the environment also cause environmental risk. These factors will cause environmental problems such as the degradation of water quality and, therefore degrade the sustainability of agriculture. In this study, we estimated these nitrogen flows due to agricultural practice in each of 47 prefecture in japan by using a database for estimating nitrogen flow in a region. Residual nitrogen on farmland in Japan was estimated at 92 kg ha(-1) and it ranged from 46 to 225 kg ha(-1) among prefectures. Non-utilized livestock waste in Japan was 17 kg ha(-1) and it ranged from 2 to 69 kg ha(-1) among prefectures. Though residual nitrogen on farmland may be affected by high application of chemical fertilizer, dispersion of residual nitrogen and nonutilized livestock waste indicate the mitigation plans are different in each prefecture. For this purpose, we pick up 2 characteristic prefectures and simulated the changes of residual nitrogen and non-utilized livestock waste when farming methods that have been developed to reduce environmental risks were incorporated.

ANN predictions are better than what can be obtained by a simple correlation of the rainfall with overflows. Work on ANN prediction of water quality (suspended solids, phosphorus, BOD, and fecal coliform) in the three rivers within the combined sewer area has been started. It appears that the sampling strategy for the evaluation of the water quality after the deep tunnels came on line can be improved by focusing more on the overflow events in time and space rather than on routine, regular sampling in the rivers during periods of no overflow.

In this framework, a bilateral linkage was implemented between the distributed model, Agricultural Nonpoint Source Pollution Model (AGNPS) and the Geographic Information System (GIS) to investigate a spatiotemporal nonpoint source pollution problem from a 750-acre watershed in the NSGA (Naval Security Group Activity) Northwest base at the Virginia/North Carolina border. AGNPS is an event-based, distributed parameter model that simulates runoff and the transport of sediment and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous) from predominantly agricultural watersheds. In this study rather than manually implementing AGNPS simulation, extracted data are integrated in an automated fashion through a direct bilateral linkage framework between the AGNPS model engine and the GIS. This bilateral linkage framework resulted in a powerful, up-to-date tool that would be capable of monitoring and instantaneously visualizing the transport of any pollutant as well as effectively identifying critical areas of the nonpoint source (NPS) pollution. The framework also allowed the various "what if" scenarios to support the decision-making processes. Best Management Practices (BMP) for the watershed can be generated in a close loop iterative scheme, until predefined management objectives are achieved. Simulated results showed that the optimal BMP scenario achieved an average reduction of about 41% in soluble and sediment-attached nitrogen and about 62% reduction in soluble and sediment phosphorous from current NPS pollution levels.

Salinity increases landward due to evaporation of water, while other water quality parameters show different concentration gradients, indicating sources or sinks within the lagoon such as waste discharges or algal uptake. A numerical hydraulic model is presented to simulate the salinity profile taking into account evaporation. The model could be extended to incorporate nutrient uptake due to algal growth as well as the effect of waste discharges at the landward end of the lagoon, thus explaining the different inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus profiles in the lagoon. The main factors responsible for the unique hydrodynamic and water quality characteristics of the lagoon are identified as (i) high evaporation, (ii) negligible lateral mixing effects, (iii) long, narrow basin and shallow depth, (iv) low mass exchange with the main estuary because of a long connection channel, and (v) uncontrolled discharge of animal waste.

The mathematical model used in the simulation, which is based on the IAWQ Activated Sludge Model No.2 with a few modifications, has been developed. A multistep predictor-corrector method of variable step-size is adopted to solve vector nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The simulation for experimental results from laboratory has been conducted to evaluate the validity of the model and to calibrate coefficients and parameters. As the results of dynamic simulation for typical wastewater characteristics and operating strategy, organics removal converges rapidly to the steady-state but nitrification, denitrification, and phosphorus removal converge slowly. The reaction rate of nitrification is the most important factor affecting the treatment efficiency of a process during the unsteady-state. The competition for short chain fatty acids between the denitrifying organisms and the phosphorus accumulating organisms during the anoxic period of fill, dominates the unsteady-state characteristics of biological nutrient removal in a sequencing batch reactor process. In simulations at various initial conditions, all water quality components converge to the constant values but the converging speed also depends on the competition for short chain fatty acids.

Muddy sediment was accumulated on the stones of the riverbed in the backwater of the dam which was investigated, and communities of emergent plants were in the sediment. Within the areas of vegetation it was dark, and the concentration of Chi-a and the total number of phytoplankton both were lower than outside. Diatoms with a diameter of 50 mum or more showed particularly marked reduction. The density of epiphyton increased in places where the vegetation density was low. The water quality showed a marked decline in the concentration of particulate matter within the area of emergent plants, compared with that outside. For example, the decline in concentration of particulate phosphorous within the area of vegetation averaged 25%. A decline in concentration of NH4+-N within the vegetation averaged 13%, and it was understood that nitrification had occurred within the area of vegetation. However, we found that the communities of emergent plants in the backwater area nitrified very small amounts of NH4+-N in the river water compared with the riverbed. We thought it important that proliferation of phytoplankton was prevented by shade provided by plant bodies in the backwater area. The existence of emergent plants gives physical and chemical diversity to the water environment of rivers and influences the density of organisms.

Spectral profiles of upwelling irradiance were obtained using a portable spectroradiometer and correlated with measurements of chlorophyll-a collected from three sites in the East Johor Straits. Water quality measurements of total suspended solids, total nitrogen and total phosphorus were also made to provide additional parameters to assess the trophic state of the ecosystem. Overall, the system represents a highly variable, eutrophic system, with chlorophyll levels ranging from 1.6 mu g/L to 140 mu g/L, total nitrogen ranging from 2 to 7 mg/L, total phosphorus ranging from 0.009 to 0.277 mg/L and total suspended solids ranging fi om 2 to 20 mg/L. Characteristic absorption of chlorophyll was observed in the blue (440nm) and red (672nm) bands. Reflectance was observed in the green band (560nm) while sun-induced fluorescence of chlorophyll was observed in the near infrared band(692nm). The spectral profiles obtained were used to derive algorithms for estimating chlorophyll using colour ratios: blue green (OD440 / OD560), red-near infrared (OD672 / OD692) and red-green (OD672 / OD560) ratios. It was found that the red-near infrared ratio (R-2 =0.70) produced the best correlation with chlorophyll, followed by the blue-green (R-2 =0.62) and red-green (R-2 =0.47) ratios respectively.

The dissolved P contents obtained (0.8 to 0.5 mg P / L) are the result of a desorption process. They are far over the eutrophication threshold and might therefore damage the quality of surface water. On the other hand the effect of this organic amendment on soil structure led to a significant decrease in erosion and thus in total P losses. Thus, the negative impact of sludge on water quality, may often be hidden by the dominance of particulate-bound phosphorus in the average budget.

We simulated the indirect effects of zebra mussel grazing on Daphnia by artificially reducing phytoplankton concentration for in situ Daphnia reproduction experiments. The response of Daphnia reproduction to reduced phytoplankton was evaluated for both the in situ experiments and field observations in Oneida Lake, New York, U.S.A. Oneida Lake has had an abundant population of zebra mussels since 1992. Our experiments revealed that fecundity of individuals from two species of Daphnia was positively related to phytoplankton concentration during the spring clearwater phase, although there was no discernible effect of food concentration on fecundity in summer cyanobacteria-dominated assemblages. The experimental results suggest that Daphnia fecundity responds to chlorophyll a concentrations < 2 mu g l(-1). The years since zebra mussels became abundant in Oneida Lake have been characterized by high water clarity, low chlorophyll concentrations, long clearwater phases, and low Daphnia biomass compared with the previous 17 years.

J	Pinto-Coelho, RM; Greco, MKB				Pinto-Coelho, RM; Greco, MKB			The contribution of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and zooplankton to the internal cycling of phosphorus in the eutrophic Pampulha Reservoir, Brazil	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						hosphorus cycling; zooplankton excretion; Eichhornia crassipes	MART SOLMS; LAKE WATER; NITROGEN-EXCRETION; PLANT-DENSITY; RELEASE; MACROPHYTES; DECOMPOSITION; PLANKTON; GROWTH	The contribution of zooplankton and the water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes, to the internal cycling of phosphorus was investigated in Pampulha Reservoir, in the shallow and eutrophic Pampulha Reservoir. In the last 20 years, algal blooms, as well as outbreaks of the macrophyte, have been observed with increasing frequency. Previous investigations have suggested that phosphorus is the limiting nutrient controlling the plant production in this ecosystem. A restoration program is currently underway aiming at the complete removal of external nutrient input. Therefore, the knowledge of the magnitude of some internal metabolic processes would be desirable in order to estimate the time lag that would be necessary for the recovery of water quality. The production and loss of macrophyte biomass was monitored in limnocurrals between May 1994 and April 1995. The zooplankton was also monitored during this period at a central sampling point. The biomass losses of macrophytes were followed in marked plants during their growing season. The P-content of macrophyte biomass was also measured monthly. Excretion rates of zooplankton collected in the reservoir were determined using short time experiments at the laboratory. This study demonstrated that zooplankton was more important for the P-cycling during the dry season when it was able to recycle a maximum of 26% d(-1) of total phosphorus in lake water. The macrophyte contribution was more important during the rainy season (especially at the end of the rainy season). In April 1995, the macrophytes were able to recycle as much as 26% d(-1) of the total phosphorus present in the water. At this time of the year, both communities recycled more than 40% d(-1) of the total phosphorus available in water. Therefore, it was demonstrated that zooplankton and macrophytes play a key role in the internal cycling of a limiting nutrient in this reservoir.

Chlorophyll-a levels were low both in spring and in summer, probably due to the high discharge in 1995 as compared to other years. Nutrients were never depleted. Zooplankton densities were very low. Diatoms and green algae had positive net apparent growth rates of 0.38 d(-1) and 1.01 d(-1), respectively, as calculated from cell counts. Grazing experiments estimated the zooplankton grazing rate in the order of 0.05 d(-1) or 8% of the chlorophyll-based growth rate. As in previous years, the plankton densities decreased in the lower part of the Rhine. The loss rate could not be explained by zooplankton grazing, respiration and sedimentation. From earlier published data the potential impact of benthic filter feeders was calculated. This exercise suggests that filtration by zoobenthos can explain the observed decrease in plankton density in the Rhine.

The results show clear differences in nitrogen concentrations and specific loads between agricultural and forested sub-basins, whereas for phosphorus the dependence on land use is less evident. The simultaneous measurement of stream discharge and nutrient concentrations permitted a quantitative evaluation of the input from point respectively diffuse sources and loads from the tributaries as well as the retention capacity by self-purification or sedimentation of the different phosphorus and nitrogen forms in the various sections of the Sure river.

The approach is tested in application of the spatially-distributed coupled hydrological / water quality model SWIM for modelling hydrological processes and nitrogen dynamics in the upper Stepenitz basin (subbasin of the Elbe, 575 km(2)). Both hydrological and hydrochemical validations of the model were successful for this basin. The differences in nitrogen cycling for different soils revealed by the simulation provide a basis for further scenario evaluation and eventually for recommendations for nonpoint source pollution control at the river basin scale.

The model, developed for the river Seine, was used after minor modifications of the kinetics of microbial processes. The impact of benthic filter feeders (Dreissena polymorpha) was introduced into the model to better explain phytoplankton decline in the canalized sector of the river. Hydro-geomorphology, meteorology and point and non-point sources of nutrients were analyzed as required by the model, according to the stream order concept at the scale of the whole drainage network of the main tributaries and along the main branch of the river Mosel, from Millery to Koblenz. The model was validated on water quality data (phytoplankton biomass -Chl a-, nutrients, oxygen) collected at half-monthly intervals during the period 1993-1995. A reasonable agreement was found at both the seasonal and spatial scales. The validated model was used to calculate the oxygen budget that shows variations in the contributions of biological processes (net primary production, bacterial and benthic respiration, nitrification) along successive stretches of the main river branch. Bacterial respiration dominates in sectors particularly affected by effluent inputs. Benthic filter feeders colonising these canalized sectors contribute to increases in respiration and oxygen deficit through their own respiration and their impact on phytoplankton. Several possible management scenarios, aimed at improving oxygenation, were tested with the model. An 80% reduction of both phosphates (to reduce eutrophication) and organic matter (to decrease bacterial activity) restores autotrophic conditions in the 7(th) order sector.

In the river Moselle in midsummer 1994 a strong oxygen decline between Hauconcourt and Palzem was correlated with a decrease of algal biomass. Further oxygen depletion in later summer in both rivers was a result of oxygen-consuming processes, bacterial carbon oxidation and nitrification, in times of low phytoplankton biomass and photosynthesis. As computed by our model, algal biomass is reduced in summer and autumn by highly efficient grazing of the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha. From July until September 1994 in the upper part of the river Moselle, a mean reduction of chlorophyll a of about 50% was computed. A dynamic approach is used to compute the seasonal increase of D. polymorpha population density and filtering capacity as well. The longitudinal decrease of mussel population density in the Moselle towards the river mouth is a consequence of the decreasing food concentration mainly due to the filtering activity of D. polymorpha in upstream reaches.

As a result, an algorithm was developed to handle the practical aspects of designing, implementing and assessing the results of a neural network based model as a lake management tool. To illustrate the advantages and limitations of the neural network model, a case study was carried out to estimate the chlorophyll-a concentration in Keban Dam Reservoir as a function of sampled water quality parameters (PO4 phosphorus, NO3 nitrogen, alkalinity, suspended solids concentration, pH, water temperature, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen concentration and Secchi depth) by a neural network based model. Alternatively, the same system was solved with a linear multiple regression model in order to compare the performances of the proposed neural network based model and the traditional linear multiple regression model. For both of the models, the linear correlation coefficients between the logarithms of observed and calculated chlorophyll-a concentrations were calculated. The correlation coefficient R, the best linear fit between the observed and calculated values, was evaluated to assess the performances of the two models. R values of 0.74 and 0.71 were obtained for the neural network based model and the linear multiple regression model, respectively. The study showed that the neural network based model can be used to estimate chlorophyll-a with a performance similar to that of the traditional linear multiple regression method. However, for cases where the input and the output variables are not linearly correlated, neural network based models are expected to show a better performance.

To analyse the nature of internal loading we studied 1. the seasonal phosphorus concentrations of 265 Danish shallow, mainly eutrophic lakes; 2. seasonal phosphorus mass balances and retention for eight years in 16 eutrophic lakes, and 3. phosphorus mass balances and changing sediment phosphorus profiles for 15 years in one hypertrophic lake. Lake water, inlets and outlets were routinely sampled 10-26 times annually. Total phosphorus (TP) concentrations during summer were two-four times higher than winter values in lakes with a mean summer total phosphorus concentration (TPsum ) above 0.2 mg P l(-1). Annual phosphorus retention decreased with increasing TPsum and was lower than predicted from the Vollenweider model, particularly in lakes with TPsum above 0.2 mg P l(-1). The seasonal phosphorus retention in lakes with TPsum below 0.1 mg P l(-1) was positive during the whole season, except July and August when mean retention ranged from -10 to -30% of inlet loading. In lakes with TPsum above 0.1 mg P l(-1), the retention was positive during winter, but negative from April to September. The negative retention was most pronounced in lakes with the highest TPsum, particularly in May and July when mean retention ranged from -50 to -68% in lakes with TPsum above 0.2 mg P l(-1). The retention was generally less negative in June, when a clearwater phase typically occurs and close to 0 also in lakes with a high TPsum. Mass balances from the hypertrophic lake have now shown a 15-yr net annual negative retention following reduced external loading. Sediment profiles suggest phosphorus release from depths down to 25 cm and that net internal phosphorus loading may persist for another 15 yrs. It is concluded that internal loading of shallow eutrophic lakes may have a considerable and persistent impact on summer TP after reduced external loading.

The study incorporated a detailed programme of water quality and flow monitoring, land-use surveys, soil surveys, and stream ecology surveys. The monitoring not only generated a better understanding of the effects of intensive dairy farming on stream water quality, but also provided input and calibration data for a distributed basin-scale water quality model, which was set up to test the effects of a number of land-use change scenarios. The results of the monitoring programme showed higher levels of nutrients compared to other New Zealand streams, but sediment levels were not particularly high. The model scenario testing confirmed that any further intensification of land use could lead to stream nitrate-nitrogen concentrations above WHO guidelines.

The release and build up of reserves of organic nitrogen developed in grassland soils is modelled as a first-order kinetic decay and shows supply-limited hysteresis. In comparison with observed data, overestimates are achieved at times of maximum release of nitrogen reserves, implying that new sinks of nitrogen or the form of nitrogen release needs to be explored.

The hillslope was taken as a basic modelling unit corresponding to the scale where cultivation practices and the full range of hydrological processes occur, A quasi-two-dimensional model was used to describe water movement along a characteristic hillslope, which represented a typical cross-section of the fields. The nitrogen leaching with subsurface drainage flux and surface runoff was modelled using a simplified representation of the nitrogen cycle. The characteristic hillslope model was used together with measured runoff and water quality data to evaluate water and nitrogen balance during winter rye cultivation in southern Finland from 1995 to 1996. The results showed that most of the nitrogen was leached through subsurface drains, although leaching with surface runoff may become important just after fertilizer applications.

This paper shows an adaptation to the soil curve number approach for continuous rainfall input, and the event mean concentration approach to simulate stream loading of total suspended solids, phosphorus (P) and Kjeldahl nitrogen. Simulated P loads were within 4.5% of measured values. Simulation using 1820, 1990 and predicted 2020 land covers showed that runoff has increased by 3.5 times since 1820, but will change little in the future. However, it appears that the large increases in pollutant loads that have occurred in the last 170 years will increase in the future. This emphasizes the need to implement non-point source pollution controls in the studied watershed.

The results demonstrated that despite the higher initial disinfectant residue, the increase in bacteria in the conventionally treated and postozonated water was higher than in the water additionally treated with GAC filtration and u.v.-disinfection. Accordingly, a significant decline in assimilable organic carbon in the postozonated water was observed throughout the main, whereas in the GAG-filtered water this decline was shifted to the GAC filters. In the GAC filtered water the conversion of ammonia to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate was more intense than in postozonated water. The findings confirm that GAC filtration increases the biological stability of drinking water even when treating cold humic waters in which biodegradation is generally limited by phosphorus. However, it appears that biological treatment favours the slow kinetics of nitrifying bacteria, thus allowing nitrification to occur even under cold water conditions in a distribution system.

Calibration of the model was performed using 1991 field data. Four remedial options, namely improvements to the waste water treatment plants (WWTPs), the combined sewer overflows (CSOs), industrial discharges, and removal of WWTP, CSO, and industrial discharges were examined. The model simulated well the response of the harbor under various loading conditions. Improvements in the harbor's water quality were found to range from minor in the case of CSO improvements to significant in the case of WWTP improvements. Specifically, the chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, and ammonia nitrogen concentrations were reduced by as much as 2% in the case of CSO improvements, between 4 and 14% for the industrial loading improvements, and between 24 and 50% for the WWTP improvements case.

J	Nicholls, KH				Nicholls, KH			Evidence for a trophic cascade effect on north-shore western Lake Erie phytoplankton prior to the zebra mussel invasion	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						Lake Erie; phosphorus; phytoplankton; trophic cascade	ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; TOP-DOWN CONTROL; STIZOSTEDION-VITREUM; WATER-QUALITY; MICHIGAN; RECOVERY; RESTORATION; SIMULATION; LIMITATION; SEDIMENTS	Increasing summer total phosphorus (TP) concentrations measured in samples from a municipal water intake off the north shore of western Lake Erie during 1976 to 1983 were inconsistent with TP loads tot eh western basin of Lake Erie and with phytoplankton densities in the intake samples, both of which declined over the same time interval. The long-term (1976 to 1988) summer TP data were inversely correlated (r = -0.858) with summer average maximum daily wind velocities, suggesting that low wind velocities contributed to anoxia at the sediment-water interface and high sediment TP release rates in summer. While TP loading reductions in the late 1960's and early 1970s likely contributed to phytoplankton declines, continued phytoplankton declines during the late 1970s to early 1980s could not have been caused by continued reductions in TP loadings while TP concentrations increased. The phytoplankton declines of the 1980s are more likely attributable to changes in the trophic cascade associated with dramatic declines in some species of zooplankivorous fish during the 1970s and 1980s as a result of a restored walleye population. Long term phytoplankton densities were fit (R-2 = 0.902) to a multiple regression model with western Lake Erie TP loads and an index of zooplanktivore density as independent variables; the zooplanktivore component of this model was the most significant contributor ti the prediction of phytoplankton density. The implications of these findings for maintenance of good lake water quality include the need to maintain strong piscivore populations as well as reduced phosphorus loads.

J	Worrall, F; Burt, TP				Worrall, F; Burt, TP			A univariate model of river water nitrate time series	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						nitrates; time-series; agricultural pollution; water quality	CATCHMENTS; MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN	Four time series were taken from three catchments in the North and South of England. The sites chosen included two in predominantly agricultural catchments, one at the tidal limit and one downstream of a sewage treatment works. A time series model was constructed for each of these series as a means of decomposing the elements controlling river water nitrate concentrations and to assess whether this approach could provide a simple management tool for protecting water abstractions. Autoregressive (AR) modelling of the detrended and deseasoned time series showed a ''memory effect''. This memory effect expressed itself as an increase in the winter-summer difference in nitrate levels that was dependent upon the nitrate concentration 12 or 6 months previously. Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) modelling showed that one of the series contained seasonal, non-stationary elements that appeared as an increasing trend in the winter-summer difference. The ARMA model was used to predict nitrate levels and predictions were tested against data held back from the model construction process - predictions gave average percentage errors of less than 10%. Empirical modelling can therefore provide a simple, efficient method for constructing management models for downstream water abstraction. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Watershed Science Institute (WSSI), in cooperation with a number Of partners, is developing a process for creating unique, watershed-scale models to examine dynamic phosphorus (P) flows into, out of; and within watersheds using a mass balance approach. The Watershed Ecosystem Nutrient Dynamics (WEND) model tracks watershed P balances over time within each of the several land-use sectors. Long-term impacts of various strategic policy decisions on P cycling both within and export from watersheds can be modeled The Winooski River Watershed in Vermont is a case watershed in which WEND has been used to evaluate the impacts of long-term strategies an nutrient use efficiency. The objective of this study was to describe the effects of three scenarios (status quo, increased rate of development, and increased conservation policies) an P cycling. The model showed increased water quality impairment over 80 years under the status quo and development scenarios. Under the conservation scenario, P movement into the drainage network was significantly reduced. This suggests that the WEND model could be adopted as an NRCS tool for improved watershed-scale P management.

This study investigated the long-term impact of applications of P in poultry lifter on the loadings of P and sediment to streams in two subbasins of the Illinois River Watershed. The influences of application rate and environmental characteristics were examined utilizing a transport model, a geographical information system (GIS), and 30 years of daily weather data. Simulated runoff and sediment concentrations of P increased linearly with poultry litter application rate. Most P loadings to streams were in the dissolved form, as overall sediment transport was low, particularly in areas with excellent stands of forage. Because only pasturelands received poultry lifter and the initial concentrations of P in the soils in the forested areas were low, the forested areas contributed little runoff and sediment P to streams. Areas of high P loadings coincided with soils having high curve numbers (CN) and poor internal drainage. Therefore, subbasins of the watershed containing a greater proportion of pasture and soils with poor drainage characteristics have higher loading rates to streams. Predicted runoff, sediment, and P loadings in both subbasins were highly variable.

As much as 10 per cent of the 6.2 million ha of previously intensively farmed agricultural land were set-aside abruptly. In the spring of 1991, a lysimeter trial (filled with soils common in the catchment area of the Elbe River), was set up to investigate the impact of set-aside on the water and solute balance. The studies proved that restricting agricultural use in areas previously farmed intensively by converting them into permanent, or rotation fallow will result in measurable changes in deep percolation (ground-water recharge) and water quality in less than one year. The results of the lysimeter studies were extrapolated to calculate the effects of set-aside in a catchment area (about 2500 ha) with similar meteorological and soil conditions. The calculations showed that increasing the area under rotation fallow from 8 to 15 per cent increases the nitrogen load of the stream draining the catchment by about 5 per cent.

J	Leung, KMY; Chu, JCW; Wu, RSS				Leung, KMY; Chu, JCW; Wu, RSS			Nitrogen budgets for the areolated grouper Epinephelus areolatus cultured under laboratory conditions and in open-sea cages	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						nitrogen budget; assimilation efficiency; grouper	MARINE FISH; WATER-QUALITY; ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT; EXCRETION; AQUACULTURE; PHOSPHORUS; POLLUTION; AMMONIA; SYSTEM; FUTURE	The nitrogen budget of grouper Epinephelus areolatus (Forskal) in a culture system can be represented by the mass balance equation: consumption (C) = feed input (I) - feed wastage (W) = production (P) + mortality (M) + excretion (E) + faecal production (F). A nitrogen budget was constructed for individual groupers cultured for 1 mo under laboratory conditions; and an annual nitrogen budget was also constructed for a cohort of E. areolatus cultured in an open-sea-cage farm and fed with trash fish. Consumption was determined independently both by feeding experiments as well, as by summation of P, M, E and F, to provide an estimate of the accuracy of the budget equation. In the laboratory budget, 27.5% of N consumed was channelled to growth, while 64.4% was excreted in the form of ammonia and 8.1% lost in faeces. The N-assimilation efficiency was 91.9%, while the net N-retention efficiency was 29.9%. For the annual budget constructed for the open-sea-cage farm, only 8.6% of total N input into the farm was harvested in the form of fish production, while loss to mortality was 3.7%. Ammonia excretion was the most important N loss (46.0%), followed by feed wastage (37.7%) and faecal production (4.0%). 66% of total N input could be accounted for in the laboratory N budget for individual groupers, but only 48% of N input into the culture system could be accounted for in the annual nitrogen budget constructed for open-sea-cage farming. It was estimated that 87.7% of the total N input to the farm was lost to the environment (equivalent to 321 kg N t(-1) of fish production). Such a value is almost 3 times as high as N loss from temperate salmonid farms.

J	Oldham, CE; Lavery, PS				Oldham, CE; Lavery, PS			Porewater nutrient fluxes in a shallow fetch-limited estuary	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						porewater fluxes; resuspension; subtidal pumping; ammonium	STRATIFIED FLUID; SOLUTE EXCHANGE; SEDIMENTS; MICROSTRUCTURE; LAKE; WAVE; PHYTOPLANKTON; RESUSPENSION; DISSIPATION; TURBULENCE	The Swan River Estuary is a shallow meso-eutrophic system in SW Australia. The dominant summer wind pattern in the region includes a strong SW sea breeze each afternoon. We hypothesised that such a regular and significant wind event may be important in causing the release of sediment porewater with subsequent effects on water quality and nutrient dynamics. To test this, we conducted a multidisciplinary field experiment in 1996 during which we measured temperature microstructure profiles (to yield turbulence parameters), velocity profiles, light profiles and nutrient profiles. Bottom shear stresses were estimated via the viscous-dissipation method, which can be used in stratified and unstratified water bodies or during convective cooling, all of which are likely to affect sediment-water dynamics in shallow systems. We observed that, after the sea breeze began, there was a dramatic breakdown of temperature stratification, an increase in mean velocities and an increase in turbulence levels at the sediment-water interface. This coincided with a doubling of water column ammonium concentrations. However, this pulse of nutrients was shown to occur prior to conditions necessary for sediment resuspension. We therefore attribute the increased porewater fluxes to interactions between increasingly energetic hydrodynamics and the benthic environment. The technique used here to measure porewater fluxes as a function of hydrodynamic forcing is an excellent alternative to benthic chamber experiments, which isolate the sediments from the overlying hydrodynamics.

J	Meeuwig, JJ				Meeuwig, JJ			Predicting coastal eutrophication from land-use: an empirical approach to small non-stratified estuaries	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						eutrophication; estuaries; land-use; phosphorus; nitrogen; regression	PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; CHESAPEAKE BAY; PHOSPHORUS; CHLOROPHYLL; LAKES; PHYTOPLANKTON; LIMITATION; PATTERNS; NITROGEN; ENRICHMENT	Few models exist to directly and quantitatively predict the effect of land-use on coastal water quality even though it is recognized that land-use is a major determinant of coastal water quality. Such models are needed because (1) land-use is a major source of nutrients transported to estuaries, (2) land-use integrates multiple factors that may determine the mean algal biomass and (3) land-use is more easily managed than single nutrients when nutrient sources are nonpoint. Regression models accurately predict lake eutrophication as a function of land-use. Similar models do not exist for estuaries. A data set was compiled for 15 estuaries in Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada, that includes phytoplankton biomass as chlorophyll a (chl), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), estuary morphometry and land-use characteristics. A regression model predicting chi as a function of estuary volume and area of agriculture was developed. This model accounts for 68% of the variance in chi, a level similar to that of models based on TN (r(2) = 0.72) or total phosphorus (r(2) = 0.66). The estuary models based on land-use and total nutrients demonstrate low yields of chi when compared to analogous lake models; this low yield is likely attributable to high levels of herbivory by suspension feeding mussels. Despite these low yields, the pattern between chi and land-use is sufficiently accurate such that environmental managers can predict the effects of changing land-use on estuary water quality in PEI with a known level of error.

Hourly changes of tide levels and currents are computed by a link-node model assuming Mt tidal forcing, Phytoplankton growth is assumed to be limited by solar radiation, nitrogen and temperature. The model incorporates light acclimation by algae, self-shading, photosynthetic production, nutrient uptake, and a dynamic determination of the carbon to chlorophyll ratio. In particular, sediment-water-pollutant interactions are modelled via an anaerobic benthic layer segment. Using recorded pollution loads and environmental forcing as input, the model predictions of daily-averaged water quality are compared with the extensive water quality monitoring data of the Environmental Protection Department (EPD), The predicted spatial distribution and trends of algal biomass, inorganic nitrogen, dissolved oxygen (DO), as well as sediment oxygen demand (SOD), are in general agreement with field observations.

A major concern is pollution resulting from nitrogen and phosphorus lost to the environment from feed wastage and fish excretion. The purpose of the study was to assess the environmental conditions in a river system affected by fishponds, Nutrient fluxes and productivity measurements were obtained from Sta, Rita River, a river estuary used as a discharge and an irrigation area of approximately 316 ha of fishponds, During the dry season, when freshwater influence is absent, salinity values inside the river were higher than outside (in the bay). Nutrient trends during ebb and flood periods were similar except for some lag in the profiles that indicate tidal oscillation, The absence of river flow during the dry period resulted in a negligible flux of nutrients along the river. During the met season, the increase in nitrate concentrations indicates river inputs while the decrease in phosphate values imply less of freshwater influence but more from ponds and domestic wastes. Similarity in productivity estimates signifies good agreement between direct and indirect methods. The absence of flushing during the dry season translates to trapping of nutrients discharged from the ponds in the drainage canals. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

For the calibration of both models use was made of the data of an in-situ leaching experiment, conducted in 1991-1992. Thereafter, the calibrated models were used to simulate the nitrate leaching for the period 1991-1995. The comparative analysis between both model approaches reveals that the simplified model is able to predict sufficiently accurate the observed nitrate leaching. The detailed approach however has the advantage of given a more accurate estimate of the nitrogen mineralization, N deposition and denitrification, resulting in a more precise modeling of the nitrate leaching to surface waters and groundwater.

In deep temperate aquatic ecosystems, vertical density stratification can significantly influence the distribution of dissolved oxygen that can, in turn, affect the nutrient dynamics in the ecosystem. In shallow subtropical and tropical aquatic ecosystems, hydrodynamic processes often lead to significant exchange of sediments and nutrients between the water and sediment columns. This chapter reviews a few recent studies in subtropical aquatic ecosystems to demonstrate the significant effects of hydrodynamic processes on nutrient distribution. In addition, the chapter provides a brief review of models for simulating nutrient distribution in estuaries and lakes. Deficiencies of regression-based models and box-type models necessitate further development of multidimensional process-based models for assessing the impact of nutrient loading on water quality in aquatic ecosystems.

Specific monitoring and data-reduction procedures for determining compliance with interim and long-term objectives are built into the Settlement Agreement (USA et al., 1991), EAA Regulatory Rule (SFWMD, 1992b), and Everglades Forever Act (State of Florida, 1994). These procedures provide measures of performance for the phosphorus control program that are important from ecological, management, and legal perspectives. Interpretation of monitoring data with respect to long-term or anthropogenic impacts is facilitated by application of a model, which attempts to differentiate long-term, hydrologic, and random variance components. The model has been used to develop tracking procedures for several Everglades locations. Variations in flow, phosphorus concentration, and phosphorus loads at major structures in the EAA and WCAs over the 1978 to 1996 period are summarized. The structure, calibration, and application of a model for tracking ENP Shark River Slough inflow P concentrations are described. Interpretations and limitations of tracking results are described.

Hydrologic/water quality models (CREAMS-WT, FHANTM, FHANTM 2.0) have been developed and modified for use in Florida's flat, sandy, high water table (flatwoods) soils. GIS-based decision support system tools (LOADSS, IDM, BRADSS) for farm and watershed-scale water quality planning have been developed based on these hydrologic/water quality models. These tools can be used for analyzing the effects of phosphorus control practices at different geographic scales. LOADSS was designed to allow regional planners to alter land uses and management practices in the Lake Okeechobee watershed and then view the environmental and economic effects resulting from the changes on a regional scale. IDM was constructed specifically for application on dairies in the Lake Okeechobee watershed for evaluation of the water quality effects of specific combinations of dairy management systems. BRADSS was recently developed for use as a tool for evaluating water, nitrogen, and phosphorus losses from individual ranches in the Lake Okeechobee watershed when various management practices are implemented on individual fields of the ranch. There is great public concern about the quality of Florida's environment and the potential adverse environmental impacts from agriculture if appropriate management practices are not implemented. The search for solutions to the many problems related to nutrient management that affect water resources implies a continued demand for the development of modeling systems that can be used to analyze, in a holistic approach, the impact of alternative management policies. These tools have great potential to help determine the best combinations of management to minimize adverse nutrient impacts on the environment while generating reasonable socioeconomic outcomes for the people who depend on these lands and serve as the direct stewards of these natural systems.

Simulation models are an integral part of the process of understanding complex ecological systems, providing a means to evaluate potential ecosystem response to changes in management. To evaluate various management alternatives on the Everglades ecosystems, we developed a spatially explicit ecosystem model for Water Conservation Area 2A (the Conservation Area Landscape Model, or CALM). The CALM simulates interactions among hydrology, chemistry, and biology of the marsh systems across the landscape, synthesizing ecosystem behavior in response to changing environmental inputs. Calibration results for 1980 to 1996 indicated good hydrologic and ecological agreement with observed data. Observed and simulated water stage were well correlated (r(2) = 0.70). North-south gradients of simulated dissolved inorganic phosphorus in the surface waters (50 - 4 mu g P L-1) and in the pore waters (950 - 10 mu g P L-1) were spatially and temporally realistic. Likewise, simulated and observed data along the gradient had similar values of peat accretion (5.5 - 3.1 mm y(-1), respectively), macrophyte biomass (1100 - 300 g C m(-2), respectively), calcareous periphyton biomass (0 - 52 g C m(-2), respectively), and community shifts in periphyton and macrophytes. The model captures the feedbacks among plants, hydrology, and biogeochemistry through process-based algorithms, including the influence of spatial patterns on these processes. For example, in a 17-year (1980 to 96) simulation sensitivity analysis of increased evaporative losses, there were more pronounced regions of increased soil P remineralization associated with reduced hydroperiods, which in turn increased macrophyte growth. If future management of the area lowers water levels below those that occurred in the 1980s, the simulation under drier conditions indicates that changes in the system's biogeochemistry are likely to occur beyond those directly linked to reduced allochthonous nutrient loads. In another simulation scenario in which external phosphorus loads were reduced, the CALM indicated that some landscape measures, such as sorbed phosphorus and macrophyte biomass, would not be immediately affected (improved) in all currently-impacted areas. That scenario indicated that internal cycling of phosphorus would likely continue to maintain a eutrophic state in some impacted areas for years, with soil porewater P increasing for a decade, albeit at reduced rates compared to a simulation with actual, observed loads. In that reduced-load scenario run, appearance of calcareous periphyton within the currently-impacted zone reflected the reduction in surface water nutrients compared to the nominal run. However, macrophyte biomass land thus shading) was not greatly reduced in much of that zone, thus preventing calcareous periphyton from attaining high densities that are found in pristine areas. We are currently working on refinements and further model verification in anticipation of applying the model framework toward evaluating Everglades restoration alternatives in the entire Everglades/Big Cypress region.

Trade-offs in model reliability, model complexity, and cost/ease of application are considered for three broad classes of model frameworks: empirical models, simple budget models, and more complex nutrient food-web models. Questions of spatial, temporal, and kinetic resolution important to the development of a model framework are addressed, The capabilities and limitations of two readily available water quality management models, WASP and CE-QUAL-W2, are described, Finally, focus is placed on the shortcomings of the existing nutrient-food web models, those tools from which a new generation of phosphorus management models will evolve. Research gaps, as well as cases where science has evolved, but incorporation into model frameworks has lapsed, are identified. A plea is made to integrate field monitoring programs and experimental studies at all stages of model development. Researchers are encouraged to reexamine phosphorus models developed in the 1970s and 1980s, incorporating recent scientific advances and bringing a fresh perspective on phosphorus modeling to bear on issues of concern to water quality managers.

J	Rode, M; Frede, HG				Rode, M; Frede, HG			Testing AGNPS for soil erosion and water quality modelling in agricultural catchments in Hesse (Germany)	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH PART B-HYDROLOGY OCEANS AND ATMOSPHERE			English	Article							POLLUTION; SEDIMENT; PHOSPHATE; DELIVERY	Until recently, no suitable computer model was available to quantify P and N yields of nonpoint sources into surface water in Central German watersheds. The event-based erosion and nutrient transport model AGNPS (Version 3.65), developed in the USA, was adapted to Central German landscape conditions and linked to a GIS. Drawing on a two-year program of water quality measurements and on hydrologic data collected over 33 years, this modified model was tested in two medium-sized agricultural watersheds in the state of Hesse (Germany). With deviations of 1.7% and 3.8%, runoff volumes for all observed and simulated flood events showed a high level of agreement in both watersheds. Only for one of the two watersheds were sediment and total phosphorus yield computed satisfactorily, with average errors of 5% (sediment) and 6% (total P). However, the model correctly registered the overall dynamics of the system as well as the differences of sediment and total P yield between the two watersheds. The modified AGNPS model can thus be employed by environmental agencies as a useful planning tool. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Precision management practices according to differences in soil type found under a center pivot irrigation sprinkler may have the potential to improve N-use efficiency. No Nitrogen Leaching Economic Analysis Package (NLEAP) model simulation of effects of different soil types and crops on residual soil NO3--N (RSN) has been conducted under a similar irrigation system. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.), potato (Solanum tuberosum L), winter cover rye (Secale cereale L.), and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were grown on sandy loam and loamy sand areas of a center-pivot. A new NLEAP 1.2 version simulated soil type and crop effects on RSN (P < 0.001). NLEAP is a potential technology transfer tool that can be used to protect water quality by evaluating the effects of crops and soil types on RSN and can potentially be used with precision agriculture management practices.

The model consists of two parts, a hydrodynamic model and a marine ecosystem. Tidal currents, water temperature, salinity and water density are calculated in a bay with/without a Mega-Float in the hydrodynamic model. A marine ecosystem model including nutrients, phytoplankton, zoo-plankton and organic matters has developed in detail. Simulation results with/without a Mega-Float of 4.75 km length, 1.5 km breadth and 1.2 m draft are presented in Tokyo Bay. Changes of marine environmental factors by the installation of the Mega-Float are studied for some configurations of a Mega-Float and breakwater. Lastly, some potential technologies for the environmental preservation and restoration are studied.

Seasonal variations in the marine climate follow the expected unimodal seasonality only for temperature, while most other forcing factors show a complex variance structure, with dominant time scales of 50-100 days (e.g. wave action), and with some of the factors acting as random factors ('white noise') at the annual scale (e.g. rainfall), thereby limiting the predictability of the system. The resulting ecosystem seasonality is unconventional and poorly linked to temperature. The prolonged period of high atmospheric pressure and associated high irradiance and calm waters in late winter is the main seasonal trigger in the NW Mediterranean Sea, setting the development of a phytoplankton bloom, as well as the recruitment of the benthos, Decadal changes in the Mediterranean marine climate are characterized by the dominance of oscillations with a 22-year period, suggesting an important solar forcing on the climate. This forcing masks the monotonous trends, such as the warming and increased sea level in the Mediterranean, expected from anthropogenic forcing. Records of decadal changes in the ecosystem often display a monotonous trend in the deterioration of water quality, indicative of human effects as the main forcing agent, while climatic forcing, which displays oscillatory variation, is of secondary importance. The paucity of long-term records precludes a robust analysis of ecosystem response to decadal climatic forcing. This absence can be partially remediated by the ability to interrogate the long-lived organisms that represent an important. albeit endangered component of Mediterranean biodiversity, to extract records (e.g. growth, temperature, changes in the nature of the dissolved inorganic carbon pool) of the changes they have witnessed.

Traditional measurement of water quality requires on-site sampling and laboratory work, which is expensive and time consuming. Due to these imitations, the sample size is often too small to have a high reliability of the corresponding results especially for a large water body. Remote sensing provides a new technique to monitor water quality over a wide area with a two-dimensional data distribution instead of sample points. In this research, French satellite SPOT was chosen as remotely sensed data source and provided images to derive chlorophyll concentration, Secchi depth, and phosphorus concentration for a water body. By comparing a set of on-site samples and the corresponding brightness values on a SPOT image taken on the same date, a regression model converting satellite data to water quality variables was defined. A systematic image process was developed to transfer SPOT data to water quality variables. This system provides not only an instantaneous and repetitive eutrophic status assessment but also a visualizing water quality variation. An image process and GIS software IMAGINE was adopted to carry out the process in a case study of the Te-Chi Reservoir in Taiwan. The final product is a set of thematic maps of eutrophic status (represented by Carlson's TSI) of the reservoir.

This urban growth, including rapidly changing land uses, has resulted in increased pollutant loads to the river and tributaries from both wastewater treatment plants and urban runoff. The Tualatin River does not meet water quality standards for dissolved oxygen, pH, and temperature. As required by the Clean Water Act, load limits for total phosphorus and ammonia where instituted for the river in 1988. The watershed will see load allocations for temperature in 1997. In response, the Unified Sewerage Agency has initiated comprehensive programs to reduce loads from its wastewater treatment plants and from urban runoff. Specific programs include comprehensive water quality investigations, watershed strategic and tactical planning, obtaining statutory authorities to implement the plans, public information, and operational strategies for controlling urban runoff quantity/quality. The efforts thus far have shown improvements in water quality as predicted. The activities also demonstrate the need for holistic watershed planning to effectively manage quality and quantity of water.

The effects of selection of model spatial scales, parameter calibration and effects of management actions are investigated in detail for three reservoirs. The 1-D and 2-D versions of DYRESM were applied to a long narrow reservoir where there are significant longitudinal gradients in suspended solids. The 1-D model consistently overestimated observed concentrations. This result has important consequences not only on the model output but, if calibrating parameters in the model, on the ability to directly input measured values of parameters into a numerical model. A further application involves estimation of sediment nutrient release in an oligotrophic reservoir subjected to a proposed inflow diversion. Validation of a parameter for sediment phosphorus release in this reservoir enabled confidence limits of model output to be refined substantially. The resultant output indicates that the hypolimnion will become anoxic and that levels of chlorophyll a will increase to levels not encountered historically in this reservoir. A further application of the DYRESM-WQ model for reservoir management involves implementation of artificial destratification for control of oxygen levels in the hypolimnion of a mesotrophic reservoir The importance of the position of the bubbler in the water column is illustrated. The three applications indicate that model time and space scales, process representations and calibration affect simulation output. This paper also describes recent developments undertaken in hydroecological modelling: the development of an ice-cover version of DYRESM-WQ, and development of CAEDYM, an ecological model which has been developed specifically to address issues of process representation and calibration of ecological water quality models.

The most important physical difference between the two systems is the dominance of large-scale circulation patterns in the four basins of the elongated lake that contrasts the prevalence of longitudinal flow along the reservoir. As a consequence, each basin of the lake can be considered as homogeneously mixed. Unidirectional physico-chemical gradients prevail in the reservoir and result in a longitudinal variability of the major nutrient removal mechanisms. Species composition and biomass of the phytoplankton changes accordingly. Sediments are the key of long-term behavior of both waterbodies. The reservoir sediments are a mixture of the original soils and fresh deposits. We use a mass balance approach to evaluate the development of sediment composition in both the reservoir and the lake. The reduction of the external phosphorus load resulted in a temporary increase of the internal load in both the Upper Reservoir and Basin 1 of Lake Balaton. We analyze the difference in the trophic response of the two systems by the OECD model, and consider the influence of the species composition of the phytoplankton.

The biologically non-affected variables change rapidly in the upstream reservoirs and then remain constant while biologically affected ones showed a prolonged response that can be explained only if considering the cascade as an entire system. The changes in the first reservoir in the system accords to the predictions of the serial discontinuity concept (SDC): the river continuum (RCC) is basically affected. However, changes on the downstream reservoirs become continuous again and show that the same processes remain operative throughout the entire river continuum. Therefore, a cascading reservoir continuum concept (CRCC) can be proposed for handling the ecological processes at a system level. A comparison of the present data with those recorded previously for some of the reservoirs show a fast growing eutrophication of the upper reservoirs in the cascade. On the basis of the CRCC and the present ecological status and water quality of the Tiete cascade a progressive downstream eutrophication can be forecasted thus calling attention for urgent need of restoration measures at the headwaters.

NO3-N and atrazine concentration data obtained from two monolith weighing lysimeters containing two different Kansas soils were used to calibrate and validate the nitrogen and pesticide versions of LEACHM. Since LEACHM (ver. 3.0) does not include any means to deal with macropore flow the macropore flow subroutine from RZWQM (Root Zone Water Quality Model) was incorporated into LEACHM. Measured concentrations of NO3-N and atrazine were compared with those predicted by LEACHM with and without the macropore flow subroutine. In general, concentrations predicted by both models tend to follow the trend of measured concentrations. Addition of the macropore flow subroutine improved the predictions a little especially for atrazine transport in silty clay loam soil. However, no such improvement was observed in sandy loam soil. Overall, the results of this study showed that addition of the macropore flow component had potential for improving prediction capability of LEACHM in silty clay loam soils. The use of more sire specific macroporosity data is likely to improve the model predictions.

All of them are linked to representative experimental catchment areas in the field. This allows the verification and extrapolation of lysimeter results. The objective of this paper is to discuss a strategy for using and scaling-up of lysimeter results to a field and catchment scale. It will be shown that the N-loss determined with lysimeters falls within the variation of N-balance based model calculations, and also within ground water recharge rates calculated with models commonly used in hydrology. Extrapolation of lysimeter data to a catchment with similar soils provides a reliable basis for estimating the N-leaching caused by a change in agricultural land use. On the basis of the N-loss from the soil and the N-load of the stream, the calculations show that an increase in the proportion of one year rotation fallow from 10 to 25% results in nearly a 10% increase in the N-load of the stream. However, from the point of view of protecting drinking water quality, rotation fallow for one year is not recommended because of the resulting intensified leaching of nitrates.

That means the emission estimations are wrong, the measured loads are wrong or retention and losses of nutrients in the hydrosphere are of decisive importance. An interpretation of water quality monitoring of the Danube at Vienna from about 400 days and the comparison of emissions from It (sub-) catchment areas of Austrian Danube tributaries and measured loads in these rivers, underline the importance of retention and losses of nutrients in the hydrosphere and increase the understanding of the relevant processes, even a lot of questions remain, and quantification of some processes on regional scale is not possible yet. Nevertheless, as an overall summary it can be concluded, that a high average area specific surface water runoff assists transport of nutrients in the hydrosphere. Respectively the importance of retention and losses increases with decreasing area specific runoff. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of the IAWQ. All rights reserved.

The study involved the application of a eutrophication-dissolved oxygen model which, following validation on the basis of field measurements, was applied to predict the impact of three different biological treatment configurations, with and without nutrients removal, as well as three alternative disposal sites on the quality of the receiving waters. The simulation results show that nitrogen is the limiting nutrient and that its removal during treatment results in a substantial improvement of the quality of the recipient. The disposal site is a critical factor in the case of a biological treatment scheme exhibiting carbon removal, but it is of limited importance in the case of treatment systems with nitrogen removal.

The hydraulic model employed in this study considers backmixing or intermixing, which can represent the actual process more accurately than the idealised flow schemes commonly employed for modelling and/or design of the activated sludge bioreactor. The kinetic model of the International Association on Water Quality (IAWQ) - Activated Sludge Model No. 2 (ASM No. 2) was reduced to submodels representing the anaerobic, anoxic and aerobic zones. Validation of simulated results against pilot-scale experimental data suggested that the new computational algorithm is able to predict the behaviour of components of interest reasonably well despite uncertainties with processes and parameters related to phosphorus accumulating organisms. Predicted transient properties may be gainfully employed for improvement to the operation and control of the process. (C) 1999 IAWO Published by Elsevier Science Ltd All rights reserved.

The biological treatment of Parada WWTP is a conventional activated sludge process. Since 1992 only one of the three available aeration tanks has been used. Activated Sludge Model No.1 was used as a base for modelling of the activated sludge system. To accomplish all the calculations, AQUASIM software was applied. The model was calibrated and verified with data from Parada WWTP operation. Very good correlations between measured data and simulation results were achieved using stoichiometric and kinetic parameter values proposed by the authors of IAWQ Model No. 1. However, characterisation of the actual wastewater was necessary. Computer simulations with a verified and extended model were done to study whether the capacity of the treatment plant is enough for biological nitrogen removal. Very high effluent qualify can be achieved if the first tank volume is used for denitrification, the second and third tank volumes are used for BOD removal and nitrification, the recirculating effluent flow ratio is 1.5 and the sludge age is 15 days.

The programs focus on nutrient discharge because of its critical effect on eutrophication of the Lagoon. One of these programs is concerned with the long term variation of water quality. It shows the positive effect induced by the interventions on point source pollution of urbanised areas. It results in the reduction of ammonia concentration and in the increase of dissolved oxygen downstream of major cities. It also shows the negative effect of increases in corn crops in upland areas on the nitrate nitrogen concentration at the sources of major rivers. The short term monitoring program shows the quick variation of nutrient concentrations during rain events in the rivers, and the close relation between the diffuse pollution sources and the deterioration of water quality. The total nutrient loads measured at the monitored river outlets confirm the loads predicted by mathematical models for the whole basin, and the importance of the diffuse pollution loads on the global loads discharged into the Lagoon. The progress in reduction of point source pollution increases the role of the diffuse sources, and demands for urgent and strong intervention on those to reach the final goal of stable mesotrophic conditions in the water body. Finally, data analysis of the monitoring programs also indicates an effective strategy for further monitoring of the river basin focused on the effectiveness of the pollution abatement program, and the real time central of water quality for the management of the Lagoon of Venice.

The potential for applying this model in a real-time context is demonstrated as a tool to support decisions regarding treatment plant operation during storm events, when it is often not possible to sustain full treatment of the incoming sewage flow. Discharges to the River Cam of treated and untreated urban wastewaters from Cambridge and the Cambridge Sewage Works are addressed as a hypothetical case study. Alternative treatment strategies are defined for improving receiving water quality and assessed through simulated water quality downstream of the discharge; the stare variables of the model include the concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand, ammoniacal- and nitrate-nitrogen, and dissolved oxygen (chlorophyll-a concentrations are also calculated but not considered herein). Strategies are assessed and ranked according to the reduction in maximum pollutant concentration (or the increase in minimum concentration, in the case of dissolved oxygen) promoted by each alternative, relative to conventional operation. The consequences of discharging overflows at an alternative position in the river, rather than together with the treatment-plant effluent, are also evaluated. Run times for the MCSTR model are of the order of just a few minutes (at most), thus allowing the potential for its use in real time as a decision-support aid.

Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are major contributors to the eutrophication of surface water bodies, and nitrogen can also cause high nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) levels in groundwater. High levels of nutrients cause excessive alga growth, depleting dissolved oxygen in the water as the algae decomposes, and reducing the amount of habitat for animals. Loss of N is also an economic for the farmers besides it's negative environmental impacts. Monitoring nutrient loss from the landscape with diverse soils, geology, topography, land use, and management scenarios is very laborious and expensive. Therefore, an alternate assessment technique is necessary to provide an estimate of the critical areas of pollution within a given watershed. Evaluation of the critical areas of pollution within a watershed makes the determination of proper remediation means for the pollution infected areas possible. This study describes the usage of geographic information system (GIS) and appropriate indexing procedures for evaluating the critical areas of pollution in two selected watersheds; one in northern Maryland, USA and the other in southern Sweden. The watershed in Maryland has an area of about 346 ha and soils are predominantly Penn silt loam series. The watershed in southern Sweden is about 1,460 ha with sand being the dominating soil. The assessment parameters used in determining proper pollution indexes vary from one location to the next. However, they are principally similar. Parameters considered in Maryland include soils, geology, topography, distance from stream, land cover/land use, nutrient management practices. Such data and appropriate indexing equations were used to develop runoff potential, erosion potential and leaching potential for each watershed segment, thus enabling the computation of overall watershed pollution index. The indexing strategy for determining nitrogen leaching in southern Sweden included factors such as crop type, tillage, manure application, and fertilizer overdose. These factors were used as multipliers to adjust the "normal leaching rates" for the type of soil in southern Sweden. Results obtained from these two studies will be presented and usage of the indexing technique as a management tool will be discussed. Practical aspects of using such strategy for pollution identification and possible remediation will be presented.

J	Tsanis, IK; Prescott, KL; Shen, H				Tsanis, IK; Prescott, KL; Shen, H			Modelling of phosphorus and suspended solids in Cootes Paradise marsh	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						hydrodynamic modelling; phosphorus; suspended solids; wetlands		A two-dimensional depth-averaged hydrodynamic/mass transport model was used to study the temporal and spatial distribution of the water quality parameters in Cootes Paradise marsh. The model predicted phosphorous concentrations reasonably well, both for an overall average of the entire marsh and for individual sites. Suspended solids were also simulated and the model accounted for contributions of particulate matter due to carp and due to wind resuspension of the bottom sediments. Both overall averages and site comparisons for suspended solids were comparable to field values. The effects of dry and wet conditions, carp, wind speed and critical shear stress for deposition and resuspension on the suspended solids concentration were studied. According to data generated by the computer model, carp and wind are contributing approximately one third each to the concentrations of suspended solids in Cootes Paradise.

Seagrass habitat primary production and water quality relationships	ESTUARIES			English	Article							ZOSTERA-MARINA L; SUBMERSED AQUATIC VEGETATION; NEUSE RIVER ESTUARY; SALT-MARSH; POTAMOGETON-PERFOLIATUS; NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT; TEMPERATE ESTUARY; NORTH-CAROLINA; GROWTH; EELGRASS	Seagrasses are indicators of ecosystem state because they are sensitive to variations in water composition and clarity resulting from watershed-level impacts. A simulation model designed to study Zostera marina (eelgrass) habitat dynamics in a variable littoral zone environment was used to address the potential ecological responses to eutrophication in lower Chesapeake Bay. The adjacent channel boundary environment is a source of dissolved and particulate materials to the littoral zone. In the simulations, concentrations of key water quality variables in the adjacent estuarine channel boundary were either halved or doubled relative to the base case to investigate light versus nitrogen effects. The role of the seagrass meadow in littoral zone carbon and nitrogen dynamics was evaluated when meadow size was changed in the model. Particulate and dissolved organic carbon accounted for 83% of the submarine light attenuation in the seagrass meadow In all model runs, the water column concentrations of chlorophyll a and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) were below the habitat criteria proposed as critical to seagrass survival. Eelgrass community production was carefully regulated by the interactive effects of light, nitrogen, and grazing on epiphyte growth. Increased eelgrass coverage in the littoral zone led to a simulated doubling of ecosystem primary production but reduced the fraction of production by planktonic and sediment microalgae. The simulation model presented here demonstrated the importance of material input from the channel in littoral zone biogeochemical dynamics. Submarine light regulated primary production more strongly than inorganic nitrogen concentrations in the model. External DIN concentrations influenced seagrass survival indirectly: enrichment stimulated growth of epiphytes and phytoplankton and promoted shading of the seagrass leaf. The model was based upon a unimpacted ecosystem and deteriorated water quality negatively influenced primary production greater than the increases triggered by improved conditions. Increased material loading to the littoral zone reduced submarine light availability, increased phytoplankton production, lowered ecosystem production, and reduced subtidal vegetated habitat. This simulation model of the estuarine littoral zone model combines hydrodynamics, biogeochemical sources and sinks, and living resources in order to better understand structure, function, and change in aquatic ecosystems.

J	Juracek, KE				Juracek, KE			Analysis of lake-bottom sediment to estimate historical nonpoint-source phosphorus loads	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						water quality; nonpoint source pollution; phosphorus; sediment; Hillsdale Lake; Kansas		Bottom sediment in Hillsdale Lake, Kansas, was analyzed to estimate the annual load of total phosphorus deposited in the lake from nonpoint sources. Topographic, bathymetric, and sediment-core data were used to estimate the total mass of phosphorus in the lake-bottom sediment. Available streamflow and water-quality data were used to compute the mean annual mass of phosphorus (dissolved plus suspended) exiting the lake. The mean annual load of phosphorus added to the lake from point sources was estimated from previous studies. A simple mass balance then was used to compute the mean annual load of phosphorus from nonpoint sources. The total mass of phosphorus in the lake-bottom sediment was estimated to be 924,000 kg, Kith a mean annual load of 62,000 kg. The mean annual mass of phosphorus exiting in the lake outflow was estimated to be about 8,000 kg. The mean annual loads of phosphorus added to the lake from point and nonpoint sources were estimated to be 5,000 and 65,000 kg, respectively Thus, the contribution to the total mean annual phosphorus load in Hillsdale Lake is about 7 percent from point sources and about 93 percent from nonpoint sources.

J	Prato, T; Kang, C				Prato, T; Kang, C			Economic and water quality effects of variable and uniform application of nitrogen	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						economics; precision farming; water quality; modeling/statistics	CORN	Nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates for achieving optimum crop yields often vary within a field due to spatial variability in soil moisture and nitrogen content and other crop growth factors. When there is substantial within-field variability in these factors, uniform application of N (UAN) may not be economically efficient in terms of maximizing net return because N is likely to be over-applied in some areas and under-applied in other areas of the field. In addition, over-application can adversely affect water quality. A sample of fields in a Midwestern agricultural watershed is used to test for statistically significant differences in N application rates, crop yields, surface and ground water quality and net returns between UAN and variable application of N(VAN) for four cropping systems. Profitability and water quality benefits of VAN are sensitive to the distribution of soil types within a field. Water quality effects and profitability of UAN and VAN vary with cropping systems. VAN is not uniformly superior to UAN in terms of increasing net returns and improving water quality for the farming systems and watershed evaluated in this study.

Data from studies of crustacean zooplankton communities, however, do reveal some of the major mechanisms important in the biological recovery process. Important influences on recovery include factors related to habitat quality and the ability of organisms to colonize. During recovery, existing species and colonists from internal and external sources interact to form a new community. The relative roles of internal and external influences remain poorly understood. Four general community types can be identified as possible outcomes of the recovery process: the original community, a normal alternate community, a community limited by dispersal, and a community limited by biological resistance. Empirical data indicate that, given suitable water quality, about a decade is sufficient to permit substantial recovery of zooplankton communities if there are no severe physical or biological barriers to restructuring.

Dilution bioassays were run to ascertain-the qualitative and quantitative patterns in nutrient limitation. Algal growth was frequently and strongly nutrient limited, particularly when temperature was >22 degrees C. By itself, N was more often stimulatory than P, though strong additional enhancement of growth by P and trace nutrients was often detected. Monod growth kinetics indicated that half-saturation constants for N limited growth for the entire algal assemblage were in the range 20-200 mu g N/L, relatively high compared to literature values, and increased with increasing temperature. Maximal growth was also an increasing function of temperature. A single temperature-dependent model was fit to the growth dynamics for all experiments showing N-limitation. The model mu = 0.0256.T([DIN]/66.0 + [DIN]) where mu is specific growth rate (d(-1)), T is temperature (degrees C) and [DIN] is dissolved inorganic N (mu mol/L) fit the experimental results reasonably well (r(2) = 0.82). However, only a modest predictive power for growth in the controls (our best estimate of growth in situ) was achieved (r(2) = 0.26). Thus, even with unusually detailed, site-specific fitting of model parameters, accurately modeling algal growth in natural ecosystems can remain a challenge.

J	Kotlash, AR; Chessman, BC				Kotlash, AR; Chessman, BC			Effects of water sample preservation and storage on nitrogen and phosphorus determinations: Implications for the use of automated sampling equipment	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						autosampling; nitrogen; storage; phosphorus; preservation; water quality	QUALITY	The effects of freezing, acidification, refrigeration and extended storage without refrigeration on measured concentrations of forms of nitrogen and phosphorus were assessed in water samples taken from polluted and unpolluted streams in dry and wet weather. Emphasis was placed on likely changes associated with the use of automatic samplers in field conditions. The response of measured nutrient concentrations to different preservation methods and to extended storage without preservation varied widely between samples. For polluted streams where nutrient concentrations were high (ammoniacal nitrogen > 0.1 mg l(-1); oxidised nitrogen, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total and filterable phosphorus > 1 mg l(-1)), there was generally little proportional change in nutrients other than ammoniacal nitrogen after up to 6 d of storage without preservation. Where nutrient concentrations were low, up to 90% of ammoniacal nitrogen, 50% of oxidised nitrogen, 84% of total Kjeldahl nitrogen and 67% of total phosphorus was lost after 6 d. If samples cannot be retrieved immediately, automatic samplers should be refrigerated where possible. Acidification is a suitable alternative for preservation of nitrogen. Samples for filterable phosphorus should be filtered as soon as possible after collection. in some circumstances, unpreserved samples may provide an acceptable level of accuracy for evaluation of broad temporal trends or estimation of nutrient loadings.

An Integrated Model for the Danubian Lowland - Methodology and Applications	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Danube; environmental impacts; floodplain; Gabcikovo; groundwater; hydropower; integrated modelling; river branch		A unique integrated modelling system has been developed and applied for environmental assessment studies in connection with the Gabcikovo hydropower scheme along the Danube. The modelling system integrates model codes for describing the reservoir (2D flow, eutrophication, sediment transport), the river and river branches (1D flow including effects of hydraulic control structures, water quality, sediment transport), the ground water (3D flow, solute transport, geochemistry), agricultural aspects (crop yield, irrigation, nitrogen leaching) and flood plain conditions (dynamics of inundation pattern, ground water and soil moisture conditions, and water quality). The uniqueness of the established modelling system is the integration between the individual model codes, each of which provides complex descriptions of the various processes. The validation tests have generally been carried out for the individual models, whereas only a few tests on the integrated model were possible. Based on discussion and examples, it is concluded that the results from the integrated model can be assumed less uncertain than outputs from the individual model components. In an example, the impacts of the Gabcikovo scheme on the ecologically unique wetlands created by the river branch system downstream of the new reservoir have been simulated. In this case, the impacts of alternative water management scenarios on ecologically important factors such as flood frequency and duration, depth of flooding, depth to ground water table, capillary rise, flow velocities, sedimentation and water quality in the river system have been explicitly calculated.

The combination of logging, smelting, fires and erosion resulted in an unusual anthropogenic ecosystem of denuded barren land with lifeless lakes, or a micro-desert. Since the 1970s, however, the concerted efforts made to reduce the emissions and rehabilitate parts of the degraded ecosystem have resulted in improvements in water quality, and recoveries in phytoplankton, zooplankton, zoobenthos and fish communities but have had little impact on toxic metal concentrations in many lakes. We show that most of the catchments in the Sudbury basin have become saturated with Cu and Ni, and some with Zn and Pb. It is estimated that mobilization of metals stored in soils and glacial overburden by surface runoff, groundwater drainage and wind re-working of tailings can sustain the high concentrations of Cu and Ni in many lakes for well over 1000 years. Strategies to immobilize the pollutant metals in the watershed rather than further emission controls may be required for dealing with high levels of toxic metals in surface waters of the saturated ecosystems.

Riparian structure and function were considered from a longitudinal perspective in order to identify multiscale couplings with adjacent ecosystems and to identify research needs. 2. We characterized functional zones (with respect to vegetation development in association with various biogeochemical processes) within geomorphological settings using a delineation based upon erosional, transitional and depositional properties. 3. Vegetation dynamics within the riparian corridor are clearly influenced substantially by hydrological disturbance regimes. In turn, we suggest that vegetation productivity and diversity may widely influence riverine biogeochemical processes, especially as related to the consequences of changing redox conditions occurring from upstream to downstream. 4. However, surface and groundwater linkages are the predominant controls of landscape connectivity within riparian systems. 5. The importance of riparian zones as sources and sinks of matter and energy was examined in context of structural and functional attributes, such as sequestering or cycling of nutrients in sediments, retention of water in vegetation, and retention, diffusion or dispersal of biota. 6. The consequences of interactions between different communities (e.g. animals and plants, micro-organisms and plants) on biogeochemical processes are notably in need of research, especially with respect to control of landscape features. Multiscale approaches, coupling regional and local factors in all three spatial dimensions, are needed in order to understand more synthetically and to model biogeochemical and community processes within the river-riparian-upland landscape of catchments.

Based on 1938 and 1968 aerial photos and 1993 Landsat imagery of a 31.7 km(2) watershed, corn (Zea mays L.)/hay rotation, pasture, forest, and impervious/water land uses were digitized In a raster GLS. Monthly runoff volumes resulting from each year's land use were predicted using a variable source area hydrologic model. Historical data on dairy animal populations and the spatial distribution of current soil test phosphorus (STP) levels were used to derive manure loading intensities. Event-mean SP concentration in runoff as a function of manure application intensity and soil test P was derived from field data and published sources. The maximum predicted event-mean SP concentration in runoff was 15.8 mg L-1. Watershed average potential SP loading to perennial streams remained essentially constant st 0.14 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) over the period 1938 to 1993, Herd size and total manure load dropped significantly over the period 1938 to 1993; however, the P content in manure and confinement of animals increased, counteracting the hypothesized trend that SP loading would drop. The analyses indicate that, for 1993, <6% of the agricultural (and accounted for 50% of the agricultural SP Lend) suggesting that with improved manure handling practices over a relatively small area, it may be feasible to reduce SP loads to streams.

The water balance and concerning components were analyzed using a complex tank model consisted of paddy tank and drainage tank. The unknown return flow parameters such as outflow terms from paddy fields and from drainage canal were able to be predicted using the tank model. The existence of the return flow in the system improves the efficiency of water use, but may have severe impacts on water quality in creek network. Therefore, the water quality is also necessary to be examined. The status of water quality was clarified by evaluating both the net substance concentration and the net effluent load in the paddy irrigation system. The paddy fields showed the function of purification for total nitrogen (TN) except at periods of fertilizer application. Furthermore, the paddy fields had a tendency to follow the load form for electric conductivity (EC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The formulas for predicting the net effluent loads in the area were also proposed in this paper.

J	Keiner, LE; Yan, XH				Keiner, LE; Yan, XH			A neural network model for estimating sea surface chlorophyll and sediments from thematic mapper imagery	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							COASTAL-PLAIN ESTUARY; DELAWARE ESTUARY; SUSPENDED SEDIMENTS; WATER-QUALITY; PHYTOPLANKTON PRODUCTION; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; LIGHT-LIMITATION; INLAND WATERS; TEMPERATURE; CALIBRATION	Two important parameters used for monitoring coastal water quality are the concentrations of chlorophyll and suspended sediment in surface waters. Ocean color remote sensing provides a convenient method of determining these concentrations from upwelling radiances. In the open ocean, it is not difficult to derive empirical algorithms relating the received radiances to surface concentrations of chlorophyll. In tur-bid coastal waters, however, this is much more difficult due to the presence of high concentrations of suspended sediments and dissolved organic material, which overwhelm the spectral signal of chlorophyll. Neural networks have been proven successful in modeling a variety of geophysical transfer functions. Here, a neural network is employed to model the transfer function between the chlorophyll and sediment concentrations and the satellite-received radiances. It was found that a neural network with two hidden nodes, using the three visible Landsat Thematic Mapper bands as inputs, was able to model the transfer function to a much higher accuracy than,multiple regression analysis. The RMS errors for the neural network were <10%, while the errors for regression analysis were >25%. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

Assuming a worst-case scenario for data availability, uniform distributions for all appropriate AGNPS inputs can be assumed. Output distributions can be produced using a Monte Carlo simulation method at increments of input variation, ranging from 0 to 50% variation at 5% increments. Decision risk calculations are based on the non-parametric Bootstrap resampling technique. This methodology was applied to the Hazelton Drain subwatershed (400 ha) of the Sycamore Creed watershed (27410 ha) in southcentral Michigan. Eight AGNPS input file scenarios were created with the Hydrologic Unit/Water Quality Tool. For each AGNPS scenario, the Monte Carlo method produced 1000 AGNPS simulations for each input variation level. This created 1000 AGNPS output files, from which were extracted the values for sediment yield, sediment nitrogen, sediment phosphorus, soluble nitrogen, soluble phosphorus, soluble COD, and runoff volume at the subwatershed outlet. Output distributions were created for each AGNPS scenario, at each input variation and for each output variable. Analysis of the output distributions and decision risk values revealed several findings. Decisions made using water-based outputs are calculated using fewer equations than sediment-based outputs. Decision risk will usually increase when the input variation increases and when the two output distributions being compared are closer or have more overlap. A precise value for input variation is not needed for most decisions based on these AGNPS outputs.

J	Modica, E; Burton, HT; Plummer, LN				Modica, E; Burton, HT; Plummer, LN			Evaluating the source and residence times of groundwater seepage to streams, New Jersey Coastal Plain	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							TILE-DRAINED FIELDS	A conceptual model of the patterns and residence times of groundwater seepage to gaining streams indicates that groundwater. seepage originates from sources that are both near and far from the stream. Consequently, the age of groundwater seepage across a stream-channel transect increases from its banks to its center and becomes progressively older with distance downstream. A groundwater flow model and particle-tracking analysis of the Cohansey River Basin in the New Jersey Coastal Plain supports this conceptual model and demonstrates that the orientation of the stream channels with respect to the regional groundwater flow direction, and the heterogeneities of the aquifer and stream-channel patterns, can shift source area locations and distributions of groundwater residence time from those expected. Groundwater samples collected from stream transects were analyzed for nitrogen, representative of widespread agricultural land use in the basin in recent decades, and for chlorofluorocarbons, used to estimate groundwater ages. The patterns of nitrogen concentration and the age of groundwater entering the stream channel corroborate model inferences. The conceptual model of groundwater seepage to streams presented herein is relevant to unconfined aquifer systems with gaining streams and demonstrates how nonpoint-source contaminants are transported to streams by groundwater. Results are useful for the design of programs needed to monitor stream-water quality.

Fundamental changes in the diatom-to-zooplankton-to-higher trophic level food web should occur when this ratio falls below 1:1. and the proportion of diatoms in the phytoplankton community is reduced. We quantitatively substantiate these predictions by using a variety of data from the Mississippi River continental shelf, a system in which the SI:DIN loading ratio has declined from around 3:1 to 1:1 during this century because of land-use practices in the watershed, We suggest that, on this shelf, when the Si:DIN ratio in the river decreases to less than 1:1, then (i) copepod abundance changes from >75% to <30% of the total mesozooplankton, (ii) zooplankton fecal pellets become a minor component of the in situ primary production consumed, and (iii) bottom-water oxygen consumption rates become less dependent on relatively fast-sinking (diatom-rich) organic matter packaged mostly as zooplankton fecal pellets. This coastal ecosystem appears to be a pelagic food web dynamically poised to be either a food web composed of diatoms and copepods or one with potentially disruptive harmful algal blooms. The system is directed between these two ecosystem states by Mississippi River water quality, which is determined by land-use practices far inland.

CONTINUOUS CORN; SOIL; NITROGEN; ROTATION; RECOVERY; YIELDS; RZWQM; TERM; N-15	Tillage influences N fate and transport by changing soil structure, aeration, macropore continuity, plant-residue placement, and organic-matter mineralization rates. Our objective was to use 15-year N budgets to compare four primary tillage treatments for continuous corn (Zea mays L.) production on tile-drained Aquic Hapludolls (FAO: Haplic Phaeozems) in northeastern Iowa, USA. A carbon-based N budget used annual grain yield, grain-N concentrations measured in 1992, changes in surface-soil C content between 1977 and 1988 or 1992, surface-soil C : N ratios, and measurements of NO3-N lost in tile-drainage water. It accounted for 98, 104, 99, and 99% of the fertilizer N applied to moldboard-, chisel-, ridge-, and no-tillage-treatments, respectively. Averaged for 1977 through 1992, increased soil organic matter, harvested grain, and tile drainage accounted for approximate to 42, 45, and 13% of the N budget, respectively. Simulated N budgets were computed using version 3.25 of the root-zone water quality model (RZWQM). The best grain-yield predictions for 13 of the 15 years were 9% higher than the measured values, and if extreme outliers were eliminated, the predicted values were correlated (r(2) = 0.75) with the average measured yield for the four tillage treatments. Simulations for 1988 and 1989 failed completely because RZWQM could not accurately describe hydrology associated with low rainfall seasons. Predicted total N accumulation was much higher than measured in 1990, 1991, or 1992. Estimates of profile NO3-N, mineralization, seepage loss, and denitrification were not satisfactory, presumably because the model failed to simulate an accurate hydrology for the different tillage practices. We conclude that the simulation results were not suitable for predicting the fate of fertilizer N. However, both approaches for computing N budgets suggested that adopting ridge tillage, without changing N rates and other management practices related to N application technology and crop sequencing, will not reduce the potential for off-site water quality degradation.

These rivers are charged with sediments depending on the types of land use in the watersheds. Land use/cover change and hydrology was studied in a watershed in the Sikkim Himalaya. The land use change from forest and agroforestry to open agriculture has increased by 11% from 1988 to 1992. During the same period substantial areas of dense mixed forests have been converted to open mixed and degraded forests as a result of high pressure on natural resources. Stream flow was highest in the rainy season and lowest in summer season in all the streams and all the three years (1994-1997) of the study. The water quality of streams from different microwatersheds varied significantly between seasons and streams. Sediment and nutrient loss was estimated in microwatersheds and soil loss from the total watershed ranged from 4.18 to 8.82 t ha(-1) yr(-1) during the three-year period of study. The annual total nitrogen loss estimated at the watershed outlet was at a rate of 33 kg ha(-1), organic carbon 267 kg ha(-1) and total phosphorus 5 kg ha(-1). This study suggests that the upland microwatersheds can be hydroecologically sustainable only if good forest cover and dense forests with large cardamom-based agroforestry are maintained.

The study area for this research is Tipton, an agriculturally intensive area in southwest Oklahoma. We used Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC), a field-scale hydrologic/water quality model, to analyze alternative agricultural management practices. The model was first validated using observed data from a cotton demonstration experiment conducted in the Tipton area. Following that, EPIC was used to simulate fertilizer response curves for cotton and wheat crops under irrigated and dryland conditions. From the fertilizer response functions (N-uptake and N-leaching), we established an optimum fertilizer application rate for each crop. Individual crop performances were then simulated at optimum fertilizer application rates and crop rotations for the Tipton area, which were selected based on three criteria: (a) minimum amount of NO3--N leached, (b) minimum concentration of NO3--N leached, and (c) maximum utilization of NO3--N. Further we illustrate that by considering residual N from alfalfa as a credit to the following crop and crediting NO3--N present in the irrigation water, it is possible to reduce further NO3--N loss without affecting crop yield.

J	Chen, XH; Ayers, JF; Gosselin, DC				Chen, XH; Ayers, JF; Gosselin, DC			Analysis of nitrate-nitrogen movement near high-capacity irrigation wells	GROUND WATER MONITORING AND REMEDIATION			English	Article							AQUIFERS; FLOW	A Galerkin finite-element model coupled with a particle tracking routine was developed to analyze the flow and transport dynamics near a high-capacity irrigation well. The model was used to compute the head distribution around the pumping well, to determine the area of influence, and to define ground water flowlines during short-term pumping periods typical of those used to collect water quality samples from high-capacity wells. in addition to hypothetical example results, the model was used to qualitatively analyze data obtained from pump-and-sample experiments conducted in an unconfined alluvial aquifer within the Platte River valley of south-central Nebraska where nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) contamination is prevalent. Simulation results of both the hypothetical and field cases suggest that short-term pumping events impact a limited volume of aquifer. The area of influence and flowlines are affected by aquifer anisotropy, pumping rate, and well construction characteristics. Ground water above or below the screened intervals does not enter a partially penetrating well in anisotropic aquifers. In aquifers where NO3-N concentration varies vertically and horizontally, wafer quality samples from an irrigation, or other high-capacity, well provide only limited information about ground water contamination. A numerical model is thus recommended for calculating the area of influence and determining flowlines around high-capacity wells so that information derived from water quality samples collected at the wellhead can be better interpreted.

J	Taguchi, K; Nakata, K				Taguchi, K; Nakata, K			Analysis of water quality in Lake Hamana using a coupled physical and biochemical model	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	28th International Liege Colloquium on Ocean Hydrodynamics	MAY 06-10, 1996	LIEGE, BELGIUM				PHYTOPLANKTON	The mechanism of water pollution in Lake Hamana, one of the typical highly eutrophicated semi-enclosed estuaries in Japan, has been studied using a numerical 3D physical-biochemical coupling model. In this study, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) was adopted as an index of the lake water quality, and the spatial pattern of the average COD concentration during the summer from 1988 to 1991 was simulated by the model. It was suggested from the numerical result that the water quality in Lake Hamana was essentially influenced by the phytoplankton production, although the dissolved organic matter accounted for the major fraction of COD constituent in the lake. The evaluation of the biological processes over the whole lake region showed that the autochthonous COD flux associated with the primary production may be almost 10 times larger than the external loading flux. Because the phosphate turned out the most limiting nutrient to the phytoplankton production and most of the phosphorus pool in the water column appeared to be supplied from the sediment, it was considered that the benthic phosphorus flux would be the most critical factor to the autochthonous COD in the lake.

J	Gross, A; Boyd, CE				Gross, A; Boyd, CE			A digestion procedure for the simultaneous determination of total nitrogen and total phosphorus in pond water	JOURNAL OF THE WORLD AQUACULTURE SOCIETY			English	Article								Total phosphorus and total nitrogen often are measured in studies of pond water quality. A laboratory study was conducted to test a digestion procedure for the simultaneous determination of total nitrogen and total phosphorus in pond water. Seventy water samples were collected from channel catfish ponds. Samples were digested in two ways. One digestion followed the standard protocol of persulfate digestion in an acidic environment for total phosphorus analysis, and total phosphorus was then measured with the ascorbic acid procedure. The second digestion was done by the procedure used for determining total nitrogen which involves persulfate digestion in an alkaline environment. The total nitrogen digestion procedure followed by phosphorus determination provided results similar to those obtained in the standard persulfate digestion for phosphorus. The slope of the regression line did not differ from 1.0 (P < 0.05) and the Y intercept did not differ from 0 (P < 0.05). Spike recovery averaged 99.1% (range 85-112%) in the total nitrogen digestion procedure; it averaged 98.4% (range 88-113%) in the standard total phosphorus digestion. The results of this investigation indicated that a single digestion can be used to obtain a digest suitable for measurements of total nitrogen and total phosphorus.

These properties are the scattering function as well as the angular distribution of a ratio of scattering matrix elements, which in practice equals the degree of linear polarization of the scattered light if the incident light is unpolarized. Laser light with a wavelength of 633 nm was used, and a scattering angle range from 20 degrees to 60 degrees was covered. The results can be used in the context of water-quality studies and to test results of theoretical models. The measured scattering functions are all strongly peaked in forward directions, but not equally so. For the covered angles, they vary significantly as a function of scattering angle. The measured angular distributions of the degree of linear polarization are mostly bell shaped, showing a maximum near 90 degrees, whose magnitude is clearly different for the phytoplankton compared to the silt particles. We find that the morphology and structural features of the particles studied play an important and complex role in their light-scattering behavior. In particular, internal cell structures such as gas vacuoles alter the scattering patterns of the phytoplankton species considerably. The external shape of the cells appears to have a much smaller influence. The experimental results are compared with results of Mie calculations and with the "standard scattering function" of San Diego Harbor water. In most cases, Mie calculations cannot provide an adequate approximation of the measured scattering behavior, which indicates that more sophisticated models are required. Only 3 of the 17 measured scattering functions resemble the San Diego Harbor standard scattering function. One of these pertains to small silt particles, showing that this function is representative for water dominated by these particles.

Buffer strips were included in the study to determine if they could reduce nutrient export. Hillslope plots receiving granular inorganic fertilizer, liquid cattle slurry and solid cattle manure (FYM) were compared using rainfall simulation for 4 storms on consecutive days at 22 mm h(-1) and 35 minutes duration. The plots were hydrologically isolated in a randomized block layout of 4 treatments x 3 replicates and measured 30 x 5 m; the upper 20 m received either fertilizer, slurry or FYM, while the lower 10 m acted as an unfertilized grass buffer strip. Nitrogen and P export in surface runoff from grassland receiving inorganic fertilizer exceeded that from FYM or slurry treatments; concentrations up to 46 mg N l(-1) and 15 mg P l(-1) were recorded. Sixty eight % and 62% of the N from FYM and slurry respectively was exported in organic form. Seventy four % (FYM) and 39% (slurry) of the P was in particulate or dissolved organic form. The buffer strip reduced N export in surface runoff by 94% and P export by 98% from inorganic fertilizer plots. A 75% reduction in N export was recorded from the buffer zone below slurry plots but only a 10% reduction in P, with most P remaining in the particulate or dissolved organic fraction. There was no significant difference in N export from the buffer zone between the inorganic fertilizer treatment and the untreated control.

J	Lim, TT; Edwards, DR; Workman, SR; Larson, BT; Dunn, L				Lim, TT; Edwards, DR; Workman, SR; Larson, BT; Dunn, L			Vegetated filter strip removal of cattle manure constituents in runoff	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						filter strips; runoff; water quality; cattle manure; fecal coliforms	BACTERIOLOGICAL QUALITY; FECAL-COLIFORM; WATER-QUALITY; RAINFALL; LOSSES; FESCUE; RANGE	Pasture runoff can contribute to elevated concentrations of nutrients, solids, and bacteria in downstream waters. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of vegetative filter strip (VFS) length on concentrations and transport of nitrogen, phosphorus, solids and fecal coliform in runoff from plots treated with cattle manure. Three plots with dimensions of 2.4 x 30.5 m were used. The upper 12.2 m of each plot,vas treated with cattle manure, while the lower 18.3 m acted as a VFS. Runoff produced by rainfall simulators was sampled at VFS lengths of 0, 6.1, 12.2, and 28.3 m and analyzed for total Kjeldahl nitrogen (N), ammonia N, nitrate N, total phosphorus (P), ortho-P, fecal coliforms, total suspended solids and other parameters. The VFS significantly reduced concentrations and mass transport of incoming solids, fecal coliform, and most nutrient forms, particularly P. The relationships among VFS length, concentration and mass transport were well-represented by first-order exponential decay functions. Approximately 75% of incoming total Kjedahl N, total P, ortho-P, and total suspended solids was removed within the first 6.1 m of the filter strips. Runoff concentrations of fecal coliform concentrations entering the filter strips were as high as 2 x 10(7) FC/100 mL; after a filter length of 6.1 m, however the runoff exhibited no measurable concentration of fecal coliforms. This experiment suggests that even relatively short filter strips cam markedly improve qualify of runoff from grassed areas receiving cattle manure.

J	Cinar, O; Daigger, GT; Graef, SP				Cinar, O; Daigger, GT; Graef, SP			Evaluation of IAWQ Activated Sludge Model No. 2 using steady-state data from four full-scale wastewater treatment plants	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						Activated Sludge Model No. 2; biological phosphorus removal; modeling; wastewater treatment; simulation; plant upgrade	SYSTEMS	Several new tools, including the Activated Sludge Model No. 2 (ASM No. 2) developed by the International Association on Water Quality, are becoming available to analyze the nutrient removal capability of existing wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The ASM No. 2 is a potentially inexpensive and effective tool, but its use needs to be evaluated. To solve the differential equations in the model, the computer program Activated Sludge Simulation Program (ASIM 3.0) was used. The model was calibrated using data from the Mauldin Road WWTP, which is a nutrient removal plant. Only 6 of 71 stoichiometric and kinetic parameter values were changed from suggested default values. The stoichiometric and kinetic parameters determined for the Mauldin Road WWTP were then used to develop models for the Lower Reedy, Gilder Creek, and Durbin Creek WWTPs. The calibrated model was subsequently confirmed using separate data sets for each WWTP. The model was successfully calibrated and confirmed at the Lower Reedy WWTP. This plant uses high-speed mechanical surface aerators, and it achieves significant phosphorus removal. It was modeled by specifically considering the flow pattern likely to be created by these aerators. Several options to improve the phosphorus removal capability of the Lower Reedy WWTP were evaluated. The simulation results suggested that phosphorus removal performance could be improved by repositioning the mechanical surface aerators to produce a defined anaerobic zone and by providing dissolved oxygen control. The performance of the Durbin Creek and Gilder Creek WWTPs, which use oxidation ditch processes, could not be fully simulated using the model. Potential reasons for this failure are discussed.

They were filled simultaneously with water; 3 were fertilized with urea and 3 with sodium nitrate to give equivalent nitrogen concentrations. Neither chlorophyll a concentration nor phytoplankton cell counts differed between treatments. Phytoplankton species diversity was low with only 2 phytoplankton species present, the diatom Nitzschia sp. and the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum. Adjacent ponds had similar trends in cell numbers irrespective of nitrogen source. Initially Nitzschia sp. grew more rapidly, outcompeting P. minimum in all ponds. There were differences in the growth of Nitzschia sp. that appeared to be related to the position of the pond along the inlet channel. Urea and nitrate uptake was rapid, with concentrations decreasing from 34 mu M nitrogen to below 1 mu M within 3 d. Nitzschia sp. numbers decreased in 2 ponds after this time but in the other 4 continued to increase until Days 6 and 7. P. minimum numbers remained low for the first 4 to 5 d then increased in 5 of the 6 ponds. There were no significant differences in water temperature, oxygen, phosphate and ammonia concentrations between the 2 treatments. pH was significantly higher in the nitrate treatment than in the urea treatment, probably due to the dissolution products of these compounds in seawater. The results suggest that the differential response of phytoplankton species to nutrients, and interactions between species, may be more important than the form of nitrogen available in determining phytoplankton species composition and succession.

J	Trabada-Crende, F; Vinten, AJA				Trabada-Crende, F; Vinten, AJA			Assessing the effects of land management and catchment hydrology on well water quality in a designated nitrate vulnerable zone	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article								The area around the Balmalcolm borehole in Fife, Scotland, has been designated a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) under European Community (EC) legislation. This paper estimates the nitrate leaching to groundwater in the designated NVZ under current management using nitrogen cycle simulation models calibrated for local conditions. We then investigate the effects of changing the current management on nitrate leaching either by decreasing cropping intensity or by application of organic waste with a high CIN ratio to promote immobilisation or denitrification of excess N. The validity of the designated NVZ is explored using the finite-difference groundwater flow model FLOWPATH. The steady state nitrate-N concentration in water from Balmalcolm borehole was estimated as 19.7-29.6 mg nitrate-N litre(-1) under current management depending on which hydrological assumptions are used. The application of 40 t ha(-1) year(-1) of paper mill sludge with an effective C/N ratio of 90 decreased the simulated nitrate-N concentration by about 25%. A similar result could be obtained by restriction of the more intensive vegetable rotations, but this would have much more serious economic effects. To achieve a nitrate-N concentration which complies with the EC legislation it is necessary to remove all intensive rotations from the catchment and grow only cereals and grass.

Problems related to water quality may be particularly severe in arid regions of the southwestern United States, where water quality and quantity are contentious issues. Over 40,000 Lesser Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) and Ross' Geese (Chen rossii) winter annually at Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico. Daily feeding bouts by geese move large quantities of nutrients from farm fields where they feed to managed wetlands where they roost. Using energy and mass balance models, population estimates, daily and seasonal migration patterns, and feeding behaviors, we estimated the mass and ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus of nutrients loaded by geese into the wetlands of the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge. Loading rates peaked in late November 1995 at more than 300 kg nitrogen per day and over 30 kg phosphorus per day. As feeding behaviors changed through the winter and bird densities declined, loading rates fell. Our estimates suggest that in the winter of 1995-1996, bird-borne nutrients supplied nearly 40% of the nitrogen and 75% of the phosphorus entering the primary wetland used for geese roosting. High loading rates by geese are a consequence of their colonial roosting behavior; over 90% of the geese roost on 10% of the wetland area. The effects of nutrient loading could be reduced by increasing flushing rates or dispersal of roosting waterfowl. The loss of natural wetlands, however, limits options for expanding wetland area available to waterfowl, and it may be difficult to increase flushing rates in this arid region. Thus, management of waterfowl and the nutrients they move will continue to be an important issue for wetlands of wildlife refuges.

J	Pozdnyakov, DV; Kondratyev, KY; Bukata, RP; Jerome, JH				Pozdnyakov, DV; Kondratyev, KY; Bukata, RP; Jerome, JH			Numerical modelling of natural water colour: implications for remote sensing and limnological studies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article								Based on suggested earlier optical models of Lakes Ontario and Ladoga, numerical modelling experiments have been carried out to the effect of revealing the responsiveness of chromaticity coordinates (x, y, z), dominant wavelength (lambda(dom)) and associated spectral purity (p) to the abundance in water of optically active components (OAC), i.e., phytoplankton (chl), suspended minerals (sm) and dissolved organic carbon (doc). It has been shown that highly turbid waters (i.e., waters with high chi and sm concentrations) with low content of doc display colour varying from green to brownish. High turbidity or large doc concentration invariably is characteristic of waters with brown colour. With growing OAC content in water, the chromaticity coordinates and, consequently, the dominant wavelength lambda(dom) tend asymptotically to respective limit-values that seem to be intrinsically characteristic of natural waters. It is also shown that the colour purity p asymptotically tends to values of about 35-45 per cent (with the only exception for waters containing exclusively chl and this in small quantities (less than or equal to 0.5 mu g l(-1))) when concentrations of one or more OAC are over 10 (in respective concentration units). These findings clearly indicate that neither panchromatic nor two-channel ratio images could be meaningful for an unambiguous inference of water quality parameters. Furthermore, the correspondence between water colour physical characteristics (i.e., x, y, z, lambda(dom) and p) and water colour scales traditionally used in limnology is established.

J	Cho, CY; Bureau, DP				Cho, CY; Bureau, DP			Development of bioenergetic models and the Fish-PrFEQ software to estimate production, feeding ration and waste output in aquaculture	AQUATIC LIVING RESOURCES			English	Article						bioenergetics; growth model; feeding; solid waste; phosphorus; nitrogen; oxygen; salmonid aquaculture	RAINBOW-TROUT; ENERGY; SALMONIDS; REQUIREMENTS	Feeding guides for salmonid fishes have been available from various sources for many years. These feeding guides have originated in one way or another from earlier feeding charts of the 1950-60s when meal-meat mixture diets were widely used. Few of the feeding guides available today are based on actual bioenergetics data at different water temperatures and are adapted to high energy diets. New feeding standards have been developed based on principles of nutritional energetics in which the digestible energy content of diet, digestible protein and energy ratio and the amount of digestible energy required per unit of live weight gain are taken into account. The gain expressed as retained energy in carcass and maintenance energy at different water temperatures is the main criteria for energy and feed allocations. Series of bioenergetic models were developed based on these principles and a stand-alone multimedia program was written to facilitate computation of the models. This program predicts growth and energy, nitrogen and phosphorus retention, requirements and excretions to determine feeding standards, waste outputs and effluent water quality based on a biological method. The models require initial and final body weights, water temperature, growth coefficient, carcass energy content and waste coefficients to estimate input and output. Accurate determinations of the thermal-unit growth coefficient, apparent digestibility coefficients and retention efficiencies are essential and these coefficients are determined by biological experiments in the laboratory and field. Oxygen requirement is included to aid environmental control in fish culture system. The Fish-PrFEQ program also contains modules for production records, performance calculations and data base management for input and output data which may be exported for further data and graphic manipulations.

Given the diversification of fish farming activities around the world and the ever increasing concern for water quality management, it becomes essential to verify whether an approach developed for salmonids is applicable to other species. Given this general background, an attempt is made here to check the theoretical assumptions and technical considerations behind the bioenergetic principles developed for rainbow trout with other freshwater or marine species. From a conceptual point of view, recent literature data do indicate that as far as nitrogen or energy balance is concerned, the general scheme is as valid for marine species as it is for salmonids, even in quantitative terms. Given the methodological tools available today, it should not be difficult to reduce feed and nutrient losses and to estimate the potential environmental loadings using the same principles for non-salmonids.

J	Costa-Pierce, BA				Costa-Pierce, BA			Preliminary investigation of an integrated aquaculture-wetland ecosystem using tertiary-treated municipal wastewater in Los Angeles County, California	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						integrated aquaculture wetland ecosystem; inorganic nitrogen removal; tertiary-treated wastewater; Eichhornia crassipes; solar energy aeration system	TILAPIA-AUREA	The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of using a designed integrated aquaculture-wetland ecosystem (AWE) for experimental food production and inorganic nitrogen removal from tertiary-treated wastewater. The AWE connected polyculture aquaculture ponds with in-pond aquatic plant systems (water hyacinths, Eichhornia crassipes, and Chinese water spinach, Ipomea aquatica), a solar energy aeration system, and an artificial wetland. Ponds were stocked with hybrid tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus x O. urolepis hornorum), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), and red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii), and were flushed weekly with new wastewater at 20%. Fish were fed a 32% protein floating ration at 1% fish body weight per day, and wheat bran was added at 1 mg l(-1) when water conductivities exceeded 900 mu umhos cm(-1). Plants were allowed to grow until they reached approximately 50% of the pond surface area, then maintained at this area by manual harvesting. Pond water quality (temperature, conductivity, pH, oxygen) was monitored twice daily, and weekly water samples were taken for analyses of inorganic nitrogen (ammonia and nitrate-N) in the ponds, wetland, and wetland discharge waters (n = 30). Tilapia harvest from three ponds was 1134.5 kg. Fish standing crop biomass increased from 0.16 to 0.21 at stocking to 1.50-2.00 kg m(-3) at harvest. Tilapia grew from an average stocking weight of 21 to 362-404 g at harvest but had poor survival (48-64%) due to heavy bird predation. Total food conversion ratios ranged 0.9-1.2. Approximately 70% of the tilapia were marketed live at $2.20 kg(-1). An estimated standing crop of 1.4 tons wet weight of Ipomea aquatica grew luxuriantly in one 200-m(2) polyculture pond which could be harvested sustainably at 20 kg week(-1). Water hyacinths removed approximately 90% of the ammonia and nitrate-N in wastewater, and the wetland removed an additional 7% (total removal was 97% of wastewater input concentrations). Overflow water exiting the wetland had less than 0.4 mg ammonia-nitrogen l(-1) and no detectable nitrate-nitrogen. The experimental AWE accomplished aquatic food production and almost complete removal of inorganic nitrogen from wastewater, functioning as a 'quartenary' wastewater treatment/food production ecosystem. However, more rigorous experimentation is required to optimize fish- and plant-carrying capacities, nutrient cycles, and testing for bioaccumulation of metals in order for the AWE to be socially and economically relevant. The concept of using tertiary-treated wastewater for aquatic food production may be attractive in the peri-urban areas of many meagcities like Los Angeles, both for fish markets and to stem the growing discharges of wastewaters that are causing coastal pollution.

The common factor in all of the experiments is the experimentally controlled change in N input over a period of 4-5 years. Results indicate that the status and dynamics of the forest floor are key components in determining the response of forests to altered N inputs. An empirical relationship between the carbon-nitrogen (CIN) ratio of the forest floor and retention of incoming N provides a simply measured tool through which the likely timing and consequences of changes in atmospheric N deposition for fresh waters may be predicted. In the terrestrial ecosystem, a 50% increase in tree growth is observed following the experimental reduction of N and sulfur inputs in a highly N-saturated site, illustrating the damaging effects of acidifying pollutants to tree health in some locations. Few biotic responses to the experimental treatments were observed in other NITREX sites, but the rapid response of water quality to changes in N deposition, and the link to acidification in sensitive areas, highlight the need for N-emission controls, irrespective of the long-term effects on tree health. The observed changes in ecosystem function in response to the experimental treatments have been considered within the framework of the current critical-load approach and thus contribute to the formulation of environmental policy.

However, it is unknown whether soil testing will improve groundwater quality sufficiently to decrease the demand for direct regulation of agricultural practices. Focusing on an irrigated agricultural region in eastern Oregon, the economic and environmental aspects of soil testing are assessed using a spatially distributed, dynamic simulation model which links economic behavior with the physical processes that determine groundwater quality. Results indicate that soil testing of all fields increases farm profits and reduces groundwater nitrate concentration. However, the benefits are small in terms of potential improvements in groundwater quality.

J	Marcus, JA; Miller, WW; Blank, RR				Marcus, JA; Miller, WW; Blank, RR			Inorganic and suspended/dissolved-organic nitrogen in Sierra Nevada soil core leachates	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							LAKE TAHOE; PREFERENTIAL FLOW; CALIFORNIA-NEVADA; WATERSHED SOIL; COLLOIDS; RUNOFF; CHEMISTRY; NITRATE; BASIN; SIMULATION	Watershed disturbance has been suggested as a possible mechanism for accelerated nutrient input into Lake Tahoe, California/Nevada, However, little is known regarding how nutrient discharge is coupled to physiochemical watershed processes. Recent investigations in the Lake Tahoe Basin have suggested that suspended/dissolved-organic nutrient transport may play an important role in lake and tributary water quality. The mobility of inorganic and suspended/dissolved-organic N in soils of a Lake Tahoe watershed was assessed using constant head permeameter leaching experiments with intact soil cores. We evaluated the interaction of plot condition (riparian, nonforested, and forested) and soil depth (0-15 and 15-30 cm) on magnitude and form of N discharge. Incremental leachate discharge was analyzed for concentrations of inorganic (NH4-N and NO3-N) and suspended/dissolved-organic N, Leachate from the riparian soil cores had significantly higher (P < 0.05) concentrations and total discharge NO3-N than that from the nonforested or forested areas. Loading of NH4-N was more consistent among vegetative cover types, but the riparian leachate again contributed a significantly (P < 0.05) greater amount. Suspended/dissolved-organic N was mobile and the most dominant form of N for nonforested and forested soil cores with discharge loading ratios (suspended/dissolved-organic:inorganic) of 17:1 and 7:1, respectively. Although the loading ratio was approximately 1:1 for the riparian soil cores, the amount of suspended/dissolved-organic N discharged was greatest. The mobility and presence of significant amounts of suspended/dissolved-organic N indicate that this once unrecognized nutrient form is an important component in at least one Sierra Ne, ada watershed, and should be more fully investigated elsewhere.

J	Thierfelder, T				Thierfelder, T			The morphology of landscape elements as predictors of water quality in glacial/boreal lakes	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						watershed-lake water quality interaction; statistical modeling		In a statistical approach to the study of watershed-lake water quality interaction, information about geology, land cover and soils was digitized in the drainage area of 87 chemically monitored lakes. With standard 1:50000 scale maps as the source of information, 33 classes of landscape elements were identified. Using geographical information systems (GIS) facilitated the determination of morphological element characteristics such as basic area and dispersal measures. The variables thus derived are used to test whether or not the dispersal characteristics affect lake water quality. It is concluded that they significantly enhance the performance of regression models in explaining inter-lake variances of the characterizing chemical constituents, namely, hardness, colour, total phosphorus, pH, alkalinity, conductivity and Secchi depth. General conclusions regarding annual chemical variability and probability density functions of morphology variables are also made. As a result, landscape elements can be ranked according to their general influence on lake water quality. With variable ranges being quite broad, the results should be valid in many glacial/boreal lakes throughout the world. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Nitrate concentrations decreased exponentially with the distance from the inlet point of irrigation. The half-value distance was about 24 m during summer conditions at a water depth of ca. 10 cm and a flow rate of ca. 1 mm s(-1). Based on findings, it was estimated that only 5% of the total area of paddy fields is needed to remove half of the nitrogen loadings from small streams to the water catchment area of Atsumi Bay, the inner part of Mikawa Bay.

But now they are faced with eutrophication problems. For purifying raw water for tap water treatment, a physico-ecological engineering (PEEN) experiment has been carried out in a hypertrophic bay of Taihu Lake, China since June 1994. Ten channels with widths of 5 m and lengths of 40 m (total area of 2000 m(2)) were constructed using bamboo stakes, water-isolated materials and filters. Water was pumped from one end of the PEEN to simulate the dynamics of different retention times. Six main principles for design and management were introduced in practice and dealt with in the paper. Some species of floating, leave-floating, and submerged plants, as well as attached algae, and malacozoan were inventoried and some physical and integrated measurements of management were tested. Water quality indices of turbidity, ammonia-nitrogen, nitrite, and color were especially improved during the study. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Stevenson, RJ				Stevenson, RJ			Diatom indicators of stream and wetland stressors in a risk management framework	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd Symposium on the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program	APR 08-11, 1997	ALBANY, NEW YORK	US EPA			COLUMBIA CANADA LAKES; BIOTIC INTEGRITY; BIOLOGICAL INTEGRITY; INDEX; ASSEMBLAGES; QUALITY; ACIDIFICATION; RESOURCES; SALINITY; REGION	Ecological risk assessment and risk management call for "state-of-the-science" methods and sound scientific assessments of ecosystem health and stressor effects. In this paper recent developments of periphyton indicators of biotic integrity and ecosystem stressors of streams and wetlands are related in a framework of ecological metrics that can be used to quantify risk assessment and risk management options. Many periphyton metrics have been employed in past assessments of water quality and a periphyton indices of bionic integrity has been applied by the state of Kentucky. In addition, the sensitivity of species composition of periphytic diatom assemblages has been shown to respond predictably to ecological stressors so that specific pH, conductivity, and total phosphorus in wetlands and streams can be inferred with weighted average indices. Inference of nutrient conditions by diatom indicators of total phosphorus is shown to have: sufficient precision to be a valuable complement to one-time measurement of highly variable total phosphorus in streams. Quantitative indices of sustainability and restorability of ecosystem integrity are proposed, respectively, as the changes in ecological conditions that can occur without significant change in ecological integrity or changes that are necessary to restore ecological integrity.

J	Spencer, CN; Ellis, BK				Spencer, CN; Ellis, BK			Role of nutrients and zooplankton in regulation of phytoplankton in Flathead Lake (Montana, USA), a large oligotrophic lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article							CONTRASTING TROPHIC STATUS; WATER-QUALITY; PREDATION; ALGAE; BIOMANIPULATION; PHOSPHORUS; ENRICHMENT; BACTERIA; MICHIGAN; FISH	1. Increased primary production in Flathead Lake during the 1980s has been variously attributed to increased nutrient loadings and/or deceases in zooplankton abundance resulting from the introduction of Mysis relicta. In order to assess the importance of these two factors in regulating the phytoplankton community in Flathead Lake, we manipulated zooplankton abundance and nutrient availability in a series of 5-day enclosure experiments. 2. Chlorophyll a levels were stimulated by simultaneous addition of nitrogen and phosphorus. At ambient nutrient levels, alteration of zooplankton density had no effect on chlorophyll a levels. Top-down control through zooplankton grazing could only be demonstrated in treatments supplemented with nutrients. Under these conditions, there was a significant negative correlation between zooplankton abundance and final chlorophyll a levels. 3. These results suggest that the phytoplankton community in Flathead Lake is regulated primarily by bottom-up controls. Consequently, future management activities aimed at preventing further increases in algal growth in the lake should focus on nutrient abatement. Alteration of the upper trophic levels does not appear to have significantly affected phytoplankton abundance in the lake. Should nutrient levels increase in the future, then top-down controls may become more important. 4. A conceptual model is presented illustrating the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up controls across a trophic gradient.

As a large amount of the data is reported as below the D-L, appropriate statistical methods are needed for data analysis. Thus, an attempt was made to identify an appropriate method to estimate the mean and variance of the data. In particular a method to separate the statistics for the below D-L portion from the estimated population statistics is proposed. The estimated statistics of the censored data are compared with the statistics of the uncensored data available from the recent years' laboratory records. It was found that the one-step restricted maximum likelihood method is the most accurate for the wet TP data, and that the proposed method to combine the estimated statistics for TP < D-L portion and the sample statistics for TP > D-L portion improves estimates compared to the conventional maximum likelihood estimates.

J	Jian, XD; Yu, YS				Jian, XD; Yu, YS			A comparative study of linear and nonlinear time series models for water quality	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						river water quality; phosphorus; time series; nonlinear modeling; forecasting; Kalman filter	RANDOM VIBRATIONS	Surface water quality data are routinely collected in river basins by state or federal agencies. The observed quality of river water generally reflects the overall quality of the ecosystem of the river basin. Advanced statistical methods are often needed to extract valuable information from the vast amount of data for developing management strategies. Among the measured water quality constituents, total phosphorus is most often the limiting nutrient in freshwater aquatic systems. Relatively low concentrations of phosphorus in surface waters may create eutrophication problems. Phosphorus is a non-conservative constituent. Its time series generally exhibits nonlinear behavior. Linear models are shown to be inadequate. This paper presents a nonlinear state-dependent model for the phosphorous data collected at DeSoto, Kansas. The nonlinear model gives significant reductions in error variance and forecasting error as compared to the best linear autoregressive model identified.

J	Nicholis, KH				Nicholis, KH			El Nino, ice cover, and Great Lakes phosphorus: Implications for climate warming	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							SAGINAW BAY; WINTER; HURON; LOADINGS; WEATHER	Phosphorus concentrations in a 19-year record of the Lake Huron outflow (Laurentian Great Lakes of North America) were negatively correlated with the extent of Great Lakes winter ice cover. The highest phosphorus concentrations (2-3 times higher than normal) occurred during 1983, 1987, and 1992 in response to strong El Nino-related moderation of winter air temperatures. The 1983 winter air temperature anomaly of +2.5 degrees C (the mildest winter in the record) is well within the output of predicted temperature increases by general circulation models for the Great Lakes basin under a 2X CO2 climate warming scenario. Lake data from strong El Nino years, when contrasted with other years having near-normal winter temperatures and ice cover, can thus serve to identify some previously unanticipated impacts of global warming on lake water quality. I suggest that global warming may have important implications for eutrophication control in the Great Lakes.

Soil physical properties and contaminant runoff	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						treading; cattle; water runoff; water quality; sediment; grazing management; hill land	PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; PASTURES; MINERALIZATION; COUNTRY; RELEASE; SULFUR	A simulated rainfall study carried out as part of a larger grazing experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of a 2-3 day cattle-treading event in winter on soil physical properties and contaminant (sediment and nutrient) runoff in topographically variable hill land. Measurements were made on two land zones: easy contoured ridges and gullies (15-24 degrees slope) and steep inter-track land (28-39 degrees slope). Simulated rainfall was applied to 16 plots (0.5 m(2)) with a range of treading damage for each land zone within 14 days of the treading event. Simulated rainfall was repeated on the same plots in the following summer and winter to assess the recovery of soil from treading damage. Treading damage reduced water infiltration rate, particularly in the steep zone. It also caused a significant increase in the transport of suspended solids (SS), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and total phosphorus (TP) from the plots during simulated runoff. On the steep inter-track zone, damaged areas had a 46% lower infiltration rate, and runoff from these areas contained on average 87% more sediment, and 89% more N and 94% more P compared with undamaged areas. These effects had disappeared six months later. The rainfall simulation and soil physical studies show that a 2-3 day winter treading event may increase soil bulk density, reduce soil macroporosity and total porosity, and lead to a decrease in the water infiltration rate and an increase in contaminant runoff.

Using data derived from plot scale experimental studies, and modelling approaches developed to simulate system behaviour under differing management scenarios, a fuller understanding of the processes controlling P export and transformations along non-paint transport pathways can be achieved. One modelling approach which has been successfully applied to large UK catchments (50-350 km(2) in area) is applied here to a small, 1.5 km(2) experimental catchment. The importance of scaling is discussed in the context of how such approaches can extrapolate the results from plot-scale experimental studies to full catchment scale. However, the scope of such models is limited, since they do not at pre:lent directly simulate the processes controlling P transport and transformation dynamics. its such, they can only simulate total P export on an annual basis, and are not capable of prediction over shorter time scales. The need for development of process-based models to help answer these questions, and for more comprehensive UK experimental studies is highlighted as a pre-requisite for the development of suitable and sustainable management strategies to reduce nonpoint P loading on water bodies in agricultural catchments.

J	Jordan-Meille, L; Dorioz, JM; Mathieu, N				Jordan-Meille, L; Dorioz, JM; Mathieu, N			An artificial flood to determine the hydrological network's contribution to phosphorus exports in a small rural watershed	WATER RESEARCH			French	Article						non point source pollution; sediments; phosphorus; artificial flood; kinematic wave	LOWLAND RIVER SYSTEM; MOUNTAIN STREAM; TRANSPORT; RETENTION; DYNAMICS; NITROGEN; SEDIMENTS; RUNOFF; BASIN	Most of the phosphorus moved from watersheds to surface waterbodies is particulate and its transfer is in-stream processes dependant (Newbold et al., 1983). Phosphorus retention in the hydrological network can be due to settlement, biological consumption, chemical precipitation (Pilleboue and Dorioz, 1986), adsorption (Green et al., 1978) and storage in the interstitial water (Garban er al., 1995). This retention is proportional to phosphorus concentration and is also dependent on hydrology (Dorioz er al., 1989; Svendsen et al., 1995). Inversely, most of the phosphorus is emitted during floods when soil erosion, resuspension of non consolidated stream bed sediments and stream bed erosion occur. The general objective of the work is to study the role of the hydrological network on phosphorus transfer in a small rural watershed during a minor flood. A mass balance between phosphorus input and output in the river (Dorioz et al., 1989) is difficult to establish during rainy periods because of the great number of phosphorus sources and their diffuse emissions. That is why an artificial flood (Casey and Farr, 1982) was experimented, using the addition of water at one location in a small river. The chosen river is located on a small rural watershed (310 ha) in the east of France, near Lake Geneva (Figs 1 and 2). The experimental reach is 300 m long and mostly covered with fine, non consolidated sediments (Fig. 3). There is no point source pollution entering the stream. The dryness of the experimental period allowed an easy increase in the how from 5 to 20 l/s. The peak flow reached corresponds to summer high flows. Due to a high SO,, concentration, the injected water could be traced (Table 1). The strength of injected water (a strong jet of drinking water expelled out of a pipe over 2 h) made turbidity increase at the input point. In the reach (Fig. 3), water was sampled at the extremities (A and D) and at two intermediate places (B and C). Suspended sediments were measured at the four locations so that zones of resuspension and settlement could be detected. Total phosphorus, soluble phosphorus (<0.7 mu m), conductivity and anions (Cl, SO4) were measured at the entry and the exit of the reach. The main results presented in this paper are: In spite of the increase of flow during the flood, the reach could be considered as a sink for particles and phosphorus (Table 2) entering at point A, even if the third part of the reach (from C to D) acted as a source (Fig 5). The different shapes of the stream bed are responsible for such an opposing pattern. The hydrochemical measurements at the outlet (point D) show that during the first 120 min following the artificial injection, the water quality has not changed although the flow has increased. Only after that delay, the increase in SO4 concentration indicates the arrival of the injected water. The injected water left the reach 300 min after the artificial injection was stopped. According to Verhoff(1979), this way of water renewal is due to the kinematic wave induced by the increase of discharge. This succession of water led to the existence of two peaks of suspended matter (Fig. 6). The first was due to the increase of flow resulting in resuspension in the third part of the reach. The second, smaller, is associated with the injected water. Phosphorus emission follows the same pattern (Fig. 6). An early and short peak of phosphorus (mainly particulate) is followed, an hour later, by a second increase, of mostly soluble phosphorus. A detailed mass balance of phosphorus, comprising settlement, resuspension and direct transfer is summarized in Table 3. It shows that most of the phosphorus exiting the experimental reach (70% for particulate phosphorus) comes from resuspension. However, the levels of phosphorus released during the experimental flood were low compared to what could be expected in polluted streams, or streams containing an important biological component. A mass balance of soluble phosphorus between A and D revealed that half of its mass was retained in the stream. During low flow periods, such a retention is not very significant. This retention during a small flood may be explained by a sorption reaction on particles. The same patterns described during the artificial Rood occurred during a real summer high Row. Two peaks of suspended matter and phosphorus (Fig. 7) were induced by (1) the increase of flow and (2) the arrival of runoff water (Fig. 8). The proportion of resuspended matter could be estimated (Table 4). This study shows that the establishment of a detailed phosphorus mass balance in streams requires frequent sampling at the beginning of storm Row events. It also shows that the most bioavailable phosphorus form (soluble phosphorus) can be stored even during a small storm flow. This leads to a net gain towards the surface waterbodies, since P quality is modified as long as the storage goes on, and the bioavailability decreased.

Small (0.5 to 1 ha), single-practice, gaged watersheds comprised of sandstone- and shale-derived residual soils are used to evaluate the interaction of management, climate, and soils. In a 28-year, nine-watershed study, 92% of the erosion occurred during the corn (Zea mays L.) years of a 4-year corn/wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/meadow/meadow rotation. These watersheds were moldboard plowed prior to planting corn and cultivation was used for weed control. By tilling and planting on the contour and increasing fertility levels, soil loss was reduced more than 3-fold, but still averaged 4.7 Mg ha(-1) during corn years. Thus, annual production of row crops on a sustainable basis was not without risk. A 6-year, six-watershed study indicated that by using reduced tillage (no-till, chisel, or paraplow) and herbicides, corn and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] can be grown in rotation with an average soil loss of 0.5 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), well below the stipulated soil loss tolerance of 7.8 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), if a winter cover crop of rye (Secale cereale L.) followed soybean. Under these conditions, however, concentrations of surface-applied herbicides and nitrate in runoff frequently exceeded drinking water standards, particularly in the first few runoff events after application, and may be a concern. A reduced-input management practice for corn and soybean production with light disking and cultivation for weed control and manure and a legume (red clover, Trifolium pratense L.) to supply some of the nitrogen was implemented to determine if a balance between losses of soil and purchased chemical inputs could be obtained. In a B-year comparison, soil losses were similar to those under conservation tillage, but the risk of yield loss increased due to inability to cultivate in a timely manner due to weather conditions. Regardless of tillage practice, infrequent, severe storms during years when row crops were grown caused most of the soil loss from the watersheds. Erosion prediction models must account for the contribution of such events and management practices must limit erosion caused by these storms if long-term sustainability is to be maintained.

Stacking densities ranged from 1 to 30 shrimp m(-2). The nitrogen budget was determined, taking into account the different forms of nitrogen in the water (particulate, dissolved inorganic, dissolved organic), in the sediment, in the feed pellets, and in shrimps. Relationships were established between growout, stocking density, quantities of waste generated in ponds, characteristics of outflow and of sediment. Shrimp reared at different stocking densities showed different growth performances. At the end of the rearing cycle, shrimp reared at I m-2 and at 30 m-2 weighed 39.2 +/- 4.3 g and 16.8 +/- 2.4 g respectively. The quantity of wastes generated was proportional to the stocking density. Rearing one kg shrimp generated 60.8 and 157.2 g waste-N (dissolved + solid), at 1 m(-2) and 30 m(-2) respectively. The accumulation of waste-N in the sediment increased with stocking density. At the lowest stacking density, the sediment acted as a 'supplier' and not as an accumulator of nitrogen. The nitrogen budget shows that up to 38.4% of the nitrogen entering the ponds in the inflow and in feed pellets, may accumulate in the sediment. The calculated outputs due to diffusion to the atmosphere and to denitrification account for 9.7 to 32.4% of the total. An increase in the level of the pond floors during the rearing period, by from 0.50 +/- 0.28 to 4.54 +/- 0.73 cm, appears to have been related neither to input and sedimentation of solids (seston or feed pellets), nor to hydraulic erosion of the pond banks, but to an erosion produced by the swimming activity of the shrimps.

After developing a 21-year loading data set, we used a P mass balance model expressed as a difference equation with an annual time step indexed from mid-April. We defined and estimated a loss parameter lambda as the proportion of the lake's April P concentration lost through sedimentation and outflow during the following year. Using the distribution of annual lambda's and input loadings, we predicted the steady-state distribution of April P concentrations that would result from scenarios of altered inputs due to changes in management practices. These results were then linked to the probability of summer blue-green algal blooms. For no load reduction, the probability of a bloom (>2 mg algae . L-1) on any summer day is about 60%. This probability decreases to 20% with a load reduction of 50%. Our approach illustrates how managers can consider reducing the frequency of extreme events like algal blooms, which may correspond more to the public's perception of lake water quality than average conditions.

Twelve 50-m(2) in situ experimental enclosures were installed in degraded Cootes Paradise Marsh during the carp spawning period in 1995. Enclosures were stocked with two or three carp of similar size, ranging from 13 to 59 cm and in total biomass from 23 to 2100 kg/ha. Turbidity, total phosphorus, and total ammonia concentrations increased predictably with total carp biomass in the enclosures. Although carp had no direct effect on zooplankton community structure, increased turbidity and nutrient load associated with carp activity resulted in reduced total zooplankton biomass. We developed a relationship between species richness and water turbidity for 19 wetlands in the Great Lakes basin which indicated that above an apparent threshold of 20 NTU, there were less than five species of submergent plants, while a more diverse community existed in less turbid systems. We predict that water turbidity in Cootes Paradise Marsh may not be reduced below this threshold value of 20 NTU following carp exclusion. We emphasize the need to consider other factors that may contribute to increases in water turbidity and nutrient concentrations, including wind resuspension and substrate characteristics.

A meta-analytical technique is used to combine trends results from 44 Long-Term Monitoring (LTM) lakes in the Northeast for the period 1982-1994, with the goal of producing estimates of overall trends in the region. The lakes are subdivided into subpopulations (High ANC, Intermediate Till Drainage, Thin Till Drainage and Perched Seepage lakes) on the basis of their expected response to changes in acidic deposition, and they appear to represent the most acid-sensitive of these lake classes well. While the overall tendencies in the trends are as expected (e.g., most of the recovery is observed in the most sensitive subpopulations), there is significant trend heterogeneity among the lakes within most of the subpopulations; this heterogeneity prohibits the summarizing of trends at the regional level (i.e., for all of the Northeast). This heterogeneity is explained by differences in the responses of lakes in two subregions (Adirondacks vs. New England), and we present trends results separately for each subpopulation within these two subregions. All subpopulations in both subregions showed decreasing trends in sulfate concentrations, probably a reflection of decreasing trends in sulfur deposition in the region. Few trends in nitrate concentrations were observed. Recovery (as evidenced by increasing trends in acid-neutralizing capacity) was evident in Thin Till and Intermediate Till Drainage lakes in New England, but not in the Adirondacks. Most groups of lakes exhibited downward trends in base cations (Sigma[Ca2+ + Mg2+ + Na+ + K+]); the magnitudes of these trends were always greater in Adirondack lakes than in similar New England lakes. This suggests that the depletion of soil cation pools in the Adirondacks may be responsible for some of the differences in recovery between Adirondack and New England lakes. While export of base cations may be the key difference producing different trends results in the two subregions, the site-specific nature of the trends, and their possible lack of regional representation, should be considered in interpreting the overall results.

The present and future distribution of pollution loads were evaluated in terms of nitrogen, phosphorus, biochemical oxygen demand, and pesticides. A methodology for the estimation of pollution loads was presented; most of which were based on "unit loads." Presently domestic End industrial point sources dominate over diffuse sources including fertilizers and pesticides from agricultural use, nutrient loads from forests and meadows, urban runoff, and leachates from unregulated dumps of solid wastes. For the future, the aim of the control action is to maintain the sustainability of the water quality of the lake, at least at the second class of European Community standards. Within this framework; urgent/short-term and medium/long-term control actions will be exercised. In the urgent/short-term stage, simpler and natural ways of treatment will be employed. In the medium/long-term stage an integrated collection and treatment system will be put on operation. After completion of a proposed collection system and treatment plants to handle point sources, the control of diffuse sources will be more significant. Control of diffuse sources for the abatement of further deterioration of water quality then becomes the key issue to be emphasized in the Lake Sapanca catchment area. Diffuse sources control will be achieved by dividing the catchment area into three major protection zones. Use of pesticides and fertilizers on agricultural land and all other activities within these protection zones will be accomplished according to control plans, which will be supervised by an institution established to be responsible of ail the activities within the basin.

Several parameters of RZWQM were calibrated to provide satisfactory subsurface drain flow, nitrate in drainage water and nitrate in soil profile for the growing season of 1993, The calibrated parameters were then used to simulate subsurface drain flows, its NO3-N concentrations, and residual NO3-N content in the soil profile as affected by manure application for the gr-owing season of 1995. Simulated subsurface drain flows, NO3-N concentrations, and total residual NO3-N contents were compared with the measured values. Predicted daily subsurface drain flows by the RZWQM were close to the observed flows, Annual fetal subsurface drain flows predicted by the model were also close to the observed values (difference over two years was -3.9%). The predicted NO3-N concentrations in subsurface drainage water followed the observed trends well for years 1993 and 1995 for all three plots. The annual average NO3-N concentrations predicted by the RZWQM were also in close agreement with the measured values for 1993 and 1995 (within a difference of -3.0%). Linear regression (zero interception) between the predicted values for the pooled darn (average of three plots for two years) and the measured data gave an R-2 value of 0.88 with a slope of 0.96. The predicted soil NO3-N contents in 0-1.2 m soil profile were also ill close agreement with the measured values in the field.

Solms) was constructed. The model included II state variables. They are NH4+-N, NO3--N, PO43--P, nitrogen and phosphorus in detritus, phosphorus in the pore water, exchangeable phosphorus and nitrogen in the sediment layer, density, nitrogen and phosphorus in phytoplankton, and nitrogen and phosphorus in water hyacinths. The external forcing functions were solar radiation, water temperature, concentrations of nutrients, phytoplankton and detritus in inflow water and the retention time of the water in physico-biological engineering. The results of the model simulating the growth of phytoplankton and water hyacinths, and the cycling of nitrogen and phosphorus inside physico-biological engineering were coincident with the results observed. In order to decide which process would affect the water quality in the experiment, to which parameter the water quality indexes such as phytoplankton, NH4+-N, NO3--N PO43--P are sensitive has been analyzed by the use of the model. It has been discussed how to culture and harvest the water hyacinths. The filtering effect has also been estimated. The model could be used as a tool to guide physico-biological engineering design and its management. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The three N treatments, superimposed over a split basal dose applied before and at planting, were: a single broadcast application of 150 kg N/ha as urea (100% amidic form), a single fertigation application of the same N as UAN (50% amidic, 25% ammonium and 25% nitrate) with the first irrigation, and multiple UAN fertigations with three irrigations. Certain variety-specific maize crop parameters in the model were obtained by fitting these parameters to field data from the single fertigation treatment. The model was then evaluated on water and N results for the treatments. The model adequately simulated the water and nitrate transport for the season, with the seasonal averages of measured and predicted values differing by less than 5%. The most significant differences between measured and simulated water and nitrate occurred near the soil surface (15 cm depth), mostly during the days when the soil was extremely wet following irrigations. With the soil hydraulic properties estimated by simple means, the model tends to overestimate downward water fluxes and related nitrate transport through a compacted layer; however, it is found to be a useful tool to study the relative impacts of alternate nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation practices on root zone water quality.

This methodology allows for TN analyses to be performed at three times the rate of previous techniques. The method is shown to be sensitive for a wide range of TN concentrations that may be found in various aquatic environments. The detection limits of this methodology are 2.0 mu M (freshwater) and 2.3 mu M (seawater). TN and TW analysis of surface water samples from 300 sites inshore and offshore of south Florida, USA revealed predictable gradients in nitrogen concentrations. TN ranged from 7.56 mu M offshore to 108.87 mu M inshore. Organic forms of nitrogen constituted approximately 90% of the total nitrogen pool. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Ma, LW; Scott, HD; Shaffer, MJ; Ahuja, LR				Ma, LW; Scott, HD; Shaffer, MJ; Ahuja, LR			RZWQM simulations of water and nitrate movement in a manured tall fescue field	SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article						modeling; waste management; broiler litter; nitrogen transport; groundwater quality	POULTRY LITTER APPLICATION; BROMIDE BEHAVIOR; LAND APPLICATION; WASTE-DISPOSAL; NITROGEN; PHOSPHORUS; QUALITY; RUNOFF; MODEL; SOIL	Disposal of animal waste on agricultural lands has been a widely used practice. The mechanisms and processes controlling the fate of manure in agricultural systems have not been fully understood, however. In this study, the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) was used to simulate water and nitrate movement in a tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea L.) field after broiler litter applications. The simulations were evaluated against experimental results from a well established tall fescue field in Fayetteville, Arkansas, which had not received any fertilizer or manure for several years before the experiment. Broiler litter was applied at 8.96 Mg/ha twice a year in the Spring and Fall. Tall fescue yield, soil nitrate-N, soil temperature, soil water content, and soil water pressure head were measured during the 2-year period. Generally, the model provided adequate predictions of soil temperature, soil water content, and soil water pressure head at various soil depths. It also predicted adequately the responses of soil profile (90 cm) nitrate-N to broiler litter applications, However, the model overpredicted nitrate concentration in water samples collected at 200-cm soil depth with suction lysimeters. This trend could be attributed to the effects of a fragipan at 80 to 114-cm soil depth on preferential transport of water and nitrate that was not considered in the model, It is also plausible that water samples from suction lysimeters did not represent preferential transport of nitrate in the field.

These two catchments have contrasting hydrogeology, land use and climatic regimes and provide an interesting test of the INCA model. The model is calibrated and validated against hydrological and chemical data for the rivers and a sensitivity analysis used to investigate parametric uncertainty. The annual loads estimated by the model are also compared with experimental data taken from nitrogen experiments around the world. Finally, scenario analysis is used to investigate impacts of changes in nitrogen deposition patterns and land use change in upland and lowland river systems. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The pollution sources include urban activities, agriculture, industrial activities, handicrafts and traffic. The concentration levels and the geochemical behaviour of nutrients, trace metals and organic pollutants were studied during the period 1991-1992, in a project supported by the Municipality of Trikala. The simultaneous existence of several polluting sources leads to significant variations in the concentrations and distributions of main pollutants, which are elevated in the neighbourhood of polluting activities in various parts of the river (NO3- above the city, NH3, NO2- and detergents near central rainwater collector, into the city, PO4 below the city, near the waste water treatment plant, PAHs and metals in another river branch in the 'industrial' zone of the city). The appearance of concentration maxima of various pollutants in various parts of the river indicates environmental problems in the whole length of the river. The water quality is significantly influenced and in most cases is unsuitable for human consumption. The mean values of the main pollutants in Litheos (NO3- 4.0 mg N/l, NH3 0.23 mg N/l, NO2- 0.10 mg N/l, P 0.37 mg P/l, Cu 7.1 mu g/l, Pb 4.8 mu g/l, Zn 3.9 mu g/l, Ni 12.8 mu g/l, Cr 3.5 mu g/l) characterize Litheos as a moderately polluted river, but the observation of eutrophication phenomena and the appearance of some high concentrations of heavy metals and/or organic pollutants in certain parts of the river reveal that a serious effort must be made in order to avoid further deterioration of Litheos water quality.

SWIM is based on two previously developed tools-SWAT and MATSALU. The model integrates hydrology, vegetation, erosion and nitrogen dynamics at the watershed scale. SWIM has three-level disaggregation scheme and is coupled to the Geographic Information System GRASS. A robust approach is suggested for the nitrogen modelling in mesoscale watersheds. Model test and validation were performed sequentially for hydrology, crop growth, nitrogen and erosion in a number of mesoscale watersheds in the German part of the Elbe drainage basin. Firstly, the hydrological module was tested in five watersheds of different size with different topography, soil and spatial resolution of input data. After that the test was performed for the crop module in the state of Brandenburg, for the nitrogen module in the rural basin of Stepenitz, and for the erosion module in the mountainous Mulde basin. A comprehensive scheme of spatial disaggregation into subbasins and hydrotopes combined with reasonable restriction on the subbasin size allows the assessment of water resources and water quality to be performed with modest data requirements at the regional scale. The direct connection to land use and climate data provides a possibility to use the model for analysis of climate change and land use change impacts on hydrology and water quality.

J	Skop, E; Sorensen, PB				Skop, E; Sorensen, PB			GIS-based modelling of solute fluxes at the catchment scale: a case study of the agricultural contribution to the riverine nitrogen loading in the Vejle Fjord catchment, Denmark	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						environmental modelling; nitrate loading; GIS; agriculture; source apportionment	DYNAMICS; LOSSES; SYSTEM; FLOW	A model that predicts nitrogen loading is developed and applied on an agricultural catchment draining to a Danish Fjord. Increases in nitrogen loadings of the Danish coastal waters have been recorded and the transformation in the Danish agricultural sector is established to be the main cause. The development in Danish agriculture in the last 40 years has resulted in significant changes in the agricultural production structure which are of major significance to the water quality. Therefore, there is a need for methods which can relate the consequences of changes in the agricultural production structure to the nitrogen loadings of coastal waters. In this study riverine nitrogen loads are modelled by combining spatially distributed data for: (1) non-point source nitrogen leaching; (2) point source nitrogen emissions; (3) soils; and (4) elevation data of the terrain and of the ground water head, with a nitrate decay process. The decay process is expressed as a first-order decay with respect to distance, having two different decay constants according to different flow velocities. N-leaching was partitioned into a component with high velocity (mainly tile drainage) and a component with low velocity (mainly baseflow) based on soil type/flow-path correlations. The nitrogen loading model was implemented into GIS to calculate nitrogen loads for sub-catchments in the Vejle Fjord catchment, Denmark. The two nitrate decay-coefficients were estimated by a trial and error method. Discrepancies between model calculated and measured N-loads vary from -16 to 17%. A source apportionment of the agricultural contribution to the riverine nitrogen loading revealed that livestock production is responsible for about 60% of the total non-point source loading while part lime farming contributes with approximately 23% of the total non-point source load. The remainder of the N-loadings originates from plant production and background sources. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Human activity, hydrology, and physicochemical and biological processes that store, transform, and transport P, define P export patterns over time and space. We suggest that an ecosystem paradigm is useful to holistically view P dynamics within complex watersheds. An ecosystem model of a dairy agricultural system was created within a hierarchical compartment-flux structure of a conceptual watershed ecosystem. Mass balance calculations with our Agriculture Ecosystem model (AEP model) describe P dynamics for the farm system, which are driven by the amount of P stored in agricultural soils and system management practices. Longterm P dynamics respond predominately to human interventions in watersheds and define conditions for future generations, Model simulations suggest that long-term environmental protection programs should incorporate the notions of P sustainability into management decisions. Dynamic simulation modeling is a valuable paradigm for understanding how complex watersheds process P and for developing management perspectives and public policy to achieve goals of environmental quality as well as economic and resource sustainability.

To study the control of nitrate fluxes by these areas, investigations were carried out on a detailed study site - the Coet Dan catchment (1200 ha) in Brittany, France - involving various disciplines: pedology, soil physics, hydrology, geochemistry and agronomy. An attempt of functional modelling at different hierarchical levels from the horizon level (i-1) to the region level (i + 3) of soil distribution, extension of saturated areas, horizons physical characteristics, water transfer in a multilayer soil profile and nitrate fluxes was carried out. The soil system, which can be described as a spatial arrangement of a limited number of horizon types with genetic relationships, is tightly controlled by topography. Predictive models of hydromorphic soil distribution using different topographic indexes and DEM were established. Regarding to their hydrodynamic properties, horizons of the soil system have been classified into "building blocks", which allows to define physically based parameters for a two-dimensional multilayer water transfer model. A four compartment model of flood genesis based on chemical data obtained from different parts of the catena and from the river was coherent with the multilayer hydrodynamic model. The mean nitrate concentrations in several subcatchments were negatively correlated with the percentage of hydromorphic soils. These studies reveal that the hydromorphic zones had an effect on the nitrogen transfer in the catchment, but this effect is limited by the importance of water pathways by-passing the buffer zones. The conclusions of this programme have direct outcomes for designing new landscape management options.

Following the mass removal of coarse fish the biomass of cyanobacteria collapsed from 1.4 g/m(-3) to below 0.4 g/m(-3), while total phosphorus concentration declined from 45 mu g/L to 30 mu g/L. No relevant changes in zooplankton communities were observed. The results suggest that the success of food web manipulation as a tool for lake restoration is not necessarily dependent on the grazing rate of zooplankton. The effects of reduced fish-mediated internal loading and recycling of nutrients are in many cases stronger than those of reduced planktivory. Alternative stable states of water quality may also exist in lakes not covered by macrophytes, owing to the changes in the behavior of fish stocks. Year-to-year variation in the littoral zone may cause large oscillations in lake ecosystems-for example, through the recruitment of fish. In addition, the nutrients translocated by fish from the littoral zone may affect the nutrient dynamics of the pelagial plankton community. In terms of phytoplankton species composition and the ratio of phosphorus to chlorophyll a, the water quality in Lake Vesijarvi has improved in a stepwise fashion within the last 10 years. This is probably due to the fact that the five-year mass removal of fish in Enonselka fulfilled the requirement of sustained management of fish stocks in order to maintain nonequilibrial conditions between alternate stable states. The prediction of the water quality development is obscured, however, by spatial and temporal within-lake variation, which sets high requirements for sampling programs.

Current research indicates that reductions in nonpoint source loading of nitrogen to a basin should be considered in management decisions if significant nitrogen export reduction is to be achieved. Managers need to know the percent reduction in nitrogen loading necessary to achieve a desired reduction in the export. What makes this task difficult to achieve is that watersheds respond non-linearly because of the nature of hydrogeochemical processes that operate in a spatially variable land use, soils, geology and vegetation environment. The non-linear response of a watershed to nitrogen loading has been addressed through field monitoring and mathematical modelling. This study included the monitoring of a small, multiland use watershed for two years, the development of a mathematical model that can simulate the movement of nitrogen and the evaluation of the non-linear response of the watershed to nitrogen loadings. The site was the Muddy Brook watershed located in north-central Connecticut, U.S.A. The drainage area is 360 ha. The watershed land use consists of 54% unmanaged forest, 23% residential areas, 12% grass and hay lands and IB maize fields. The Nutrient Transport and Transformation (NTT) model was used to assess the fate and transport of nitrogen in the watershed. The model is a distributed code that can simulate both the hydrology and chemistry of watersheds. Two management scenarios were simulated to assess the non-linear response of the Muddy Brook watershed. The first scenario simulated the possibility of reducing the nitrogen loading generated from a residential area by eliminating the septic tank input. The results indicated that there is going to be a 25% reduction in nitrogen export from the watershed if that scenario was followed. This dramatic reduction in export primarily results from the residential development being very close to the stream and then is a preferential flow that short-circuits the groundwater to the stream. On the other hand, an 100% reduction in fertilizer and manure input to the agricultural land will only result in less than 1.5% reduction in nitrogen export after a three year of simulation period. These simulations illustrate the non-linear nature of the Muddy Brook watershed response to nitrogen loadings and can be used to guide managers in selecting appropriate best management practices to improve the water quality of the stream.

We present a framework for combining ecological and economic information to compare management scenarios for nonpoint pollution. Eutrophication of lakes caused by nonpoint phosphorus pollution, a common environmental problem, is the focus of our approach. Economic advantages of mitigating nonpoint pollution increase as the uncertainty of ecological predictions decreases. Uncertainty is measured by the prediction variance of nonpoint pollution models. A major source of variance in nonpoint pollution predictions is the effect of land use change on phosphorus transport. This variance is often large because calibration data sets do not have sufficiently wide ranges of land use variables. Ecological predictions and the resulting economic assessments could be improved by comparative studies of watersheds with contrasting land uses, and by viewing nonpoint pollution management as a large-scale experiment.

The state of Florida has adopted a plan for addressing Everglades eutrophication problems by reducing anthropogenic phosphorus loads through the implementation of Best Management Practices (BMPs) in agricultural watersheds and the construction of stormwater treatment areas (STAs). Optimizing the effectiveness of these STAs for reducing phosphorus concentrations from agricultural runoff is a critical component of the District's comprehensive Everglades protection effort. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a simple tool that can be used to estimate STAs' performance and evaluate management alternatives considered in the Everglades restoration efforts. The model was tested at two south Florida wetland sites and then was used to simulate several management alternatives and predict ecosystem responses to reduced external phosphorus (P) loadings. Good agreement between model predictions at the two wetland sites and actual observations indicated that the model can be used as a management tool to predict wetlands' response to reductions in external phosphorus load and long-term P levels in aquatic ecosystems. Model results showed that lowering P content of the Everglades Protection Area (EPA) depends on reducing P loads originating from EAA discharges, not from rainfall. Assuming no action is taken (e.g., no BMPs or STAs implemented), the steady state model predicted that the average concentration within the modeled area of the marsh would reach 20 mu g L(-1) within five years. With an 85 percent reduction in P loading, the steady-state model predicted that Water Conservation Area 2A (WCA-2A)P concentration will equilibrate at approximately 10 mu g L(-1), while elimination of all loadings is projected to further reduce marsh P to values less than 10 mu g L(-1).

There is a need to design and manage drainage and related water table control systems to satisfy both crop production and water quality objectives. The model DRAINMOD-N was used to study long-term effects of drainage system design and management on crop production, profitability, and nitrogen losses in two poorly drained soils typical of eastern North Carolina (NC), USA. Simulations were conducted for a 20-yr period (1971-1990) of continuous corn production at Plymouth, NC. The design scenarios evaluated consisted of three drain depths (0.75, 1.0, and 1.25 m), ten drain spacings (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, and 100 m), and two surface conditions (0.5 and 2.5 cm depressional storage). The management treatments included conventional drainage, controlled drainage during the summer season and controlled drainage during both the summer and winter seasons. Maximum profits for both soils were predicted for a 1.25 m drain depth and poor surface drainage (2.5 cm depressional storage). The optimum spacings were 40 and 20 m for the Portsmouth and Tomotley soils, respectively. These systems however would not be optimum from the water quality perspective. If the water quality objective is of equal importance to the productivity objective, the drainage systems need to be designed and managed to reduce NO3-N losses while still providing an acceptable profit from the crop. Simulated results showed NO3-N losses can be substantially reduced by decreasing drain depth, improving surface drainage, and using controlled drainage. Within this context, NO3-N losses can be reduced by providing only the minimum subsurface drainage intensity required for production, by designing drainage systems to fit soil properties, and by using controlled drainage during periods when maximum drainage is not needed for production. The simulation results have demonstrated the applicability of DRAIN-MOD-N for quantifying effects of drainage design and management combinations on profits from agricultural crops and on losses of NO3-N to the environment for specific crop, soil and climatic conditions. Thus, the model can be used to guide design and management decisions for satisfying both productivity and environmental objectives and assessing the costs and benefits of alternative choices to each set of objectives.

This paper briefly reviews the reactions of these materials in soil, and the processes involved in their transport by water over and through soils in the field. The natural heterogeneity of soils, and fluctuations in the source strength of pesticides and nutrients due to biophysical factors and environmental conditions, have a profound effect on measurements. Preferred techniques are discussed for measuring losses from drained systems (sampled as point sources, which provide an integration of spatial and temporal variability in the areas drained) and undrained systems (sampled as diffuse sources, where the reliability of areal averaging depends on the efficiency of the sampling strategy). Pathways of nitrogen, phosphorus and pesticide movement from soil into receiving waters (surface and groundwater) are identified, and examples given of the quantities lost in solution and solid phases under various land uses. The importance of recognising the likelihood of 3-dimensional flow of water and entrained solutes in the landscape is emphasised. Techniques to obtain representative samples are discussed and sampling protocols for good quality assurance-quality control are identified. The concepts of precision, accuracy, completeness and comparability are defined. Sampling equipment is reviewed and procedures for preventing contamination in the field and laboratory, and the preservation of samples, are recommended. The application of techniques is illustrated by case histories for pesticide monitoring. The role of models for integrating the various processes that determine the fate of nutrients and pesticides under a specific management practice is discussed. The scope and current limitations for extrapolating the results of site-specific measurements to larger areas, such as whole catchments, through simulation modelling are briefly discussed.

A simulation was made, and evaluated by comparing the simulated values for nitrogen and phosphorus in the drainage water from the agricultural land with observed data. It was concluded from the evaluation that the simulation could predict a reduction in the nutrient load entering the lake. The circular irrigation system could contribute to a reduction of the pollutant load by 44.2% for total phosphorus and 26.9% of for total nitrogen compared with the conventional irrigation system by operating the circulation pumps for 7 hours a day during the irrigation period.

ARC/INFO grid coverages (1-ha cell size) of land uses and soils are overlaid to locate every unique soil/land use combination in the watershed. WAM can predict either detailed daily (WAM-D) or average annual (WAM-A) loads and flows. Because WAM-D simulates water depth and flow throughout the stream network, it requires much more data and runs more slowly. WAM-A is the preferred mode unless the basin assessment requires detailed time series of loads and flows. The surface and ground water flow and sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus loads from all cells are simulated using a land-use-specific cell model. The GLEAMS model is used for most land uses while wetland and urban areas are handled using other models. The individual cell discharges are then routed through the watershed based on the information in the GIS topography and hydrography coverages. WAM contains a separate indexing model for the spatial assessment of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), toxin, and coliform bacteria sources. It also assesses the wetlands within a watershed for water quality value (assimilative capacity) and wildlife habitat value. A menu driven interface allows the user to easily view the input and output data. Graphical editing tools allow the user to modify land uses or management within a land use to allow comparisons with existing conditions. Best Management Practices (BMPs) can be assigned to existing land uses to assess pollution abatement strategies. Dual-screen graphical displays and ranked table outputs provide both visual and quantitative comparisons of scenarios.

EAAMOD contains a water quality model which simulates the effects of management practices. It was designed to simulate the high water table conditions and management practices such as those found within the Everglades Agricultural Area in South Central Florida. EAAMOD predicts water table movements, surface and subsurface water flow, soluble phosphorus transport, and sediment phosphorus transport. EAAMOD was designed both for ease of use and flexibility. Like many water quality models, it requires many inputs. The user can quickly and easily set up a simulation for their soil, crop, and water management practices. EAAMOD creates a calendar of management practices based on these inputs. The user has the option of further customizing the simulation by modifying the calendar of management practices. The simulation results are presented in both graphical and tabular form. The user can then implement various BMPs by modifying the management practices. Simulation results can be compared to determine the most appropriate set of practices for their field. EAAMOD runs under Windows 95 or Windows NT. The system has been thoroughly tested (Bottcher et al., 1998) and is available either on diskette or by downloading from the Soil and Water Engineering Technology, Inc., web site (www.SWET.com).

In recent years, the model was extended with water quality components. Versions of the model were developed to simulate the effects of drainage and water management practices on nitrogen loss (DRAINMOD-N) and soil salinity (DRAINMOD-S). This paper describes the development of a modeling system which integrates the hydrology, nitrogen and salinity versions of DRAINMOD. A graphical user interface was developed to facilitate the preparation and validation of model inputs, run the models and display model results. The system is a user-oriented software package designed to assist in DRAINMOD simulations for drainage design, wetland analysis, evaluation of various water management practices on fate and transport of nitrogen and soil salinity.

Water quality at the outlet of a tile-drained watershed is not adequately addressed by either classical surface runoff or subsurface transport models. Models which do address tile drainage typically are designed for field-scale applications. The purpose of this paper is to discuss approaches for predicting water quality for watersheds in regions where hydrologic response is influenced by subsurface tile drain systems. Prediction of nitrate-nitrogen concentration is explored using three approaches: mass balance; time series analysis; and application of existing, physically-based models. An ongoing water quality monitoring project for the Little Vermilion River Watershed in Champaign and Vermilion Counties, IL,, provides data for demonstrating the approaches described in this paper. The mass balance approach was useful for estimating long-term average nitrate concentration. Time series analysis was useful for investigating seasonal variation of the parameter. Extrapolation from a one-dimensional, field-scale model was successful in predicting watershed outlet flow, but was less successful in predicting nitrate concentration.

The research project is studying the use of flashboard riser structures to increase the denitrification rates in riparian buffers bordered by animal-waste land application fields. Ground water hydrology and nitrate transport responses to stream water level control in a 2-km stream section are being studied. Instrumentation for stream discharge and water duality measurements along with collection of shallow ground water hydrology and water quality data are being used to test a water quality model. The water quality model, WATRCOM-N, is being developed to simulate the water quality impact of riparian buffers on off-site surface water quality. This paper presents a progress report on the field project and the development of the WATRCOM-N model.

To assess the effect of different agriculture practices on the P losses from fields in the EAA a computer simulation model was developed for the unique characteristics of the EAA area. The area has an organic top soil (Histosols) overlying a marl layer, with the layers frequently separated by an impeding zone. This paper describes the development, validation, and usage of the field-scale model called EAAMOD-FIELD. The model predicts the water table levels, discharge, soluble P, and particulate P in response to management by taking account of the weather, land use, and soil parameters. With the addition of a user-friendly interface that includes a wide range of predefined management scenarios, the model audience and usability has increased significantly.

The networks of backpropagation type were trained on 7 years of weekly data for eight variables, and their ability to provide a 4-week forecast was evaluated for a 28-week period. They were relatively successful in providing a good forecast of both the incidence and magnitude of a growth peak of the cyanobacteria within the limits required for water quality monitoring. The use of lagged versus unlagged inputs was evaluated in the implementation and performance of the networks. Lagged inputs proved far superior in providing a fit to the actual data. Sensitivity analysis of input variables was performed to evaluate their relative significance in determining the forecast values. The analysis indicated that for this data set for the River Murray, flow and temperature were the predominant variables in determining the onset and duration of cyanobacterial growth. Water colour was the next most important variable in determining the magnitude of the population growth peak. Plant nutrients nitrogen, phosphorus and iron, and turbidity were less important for this time period. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The location is an island called Turtle Island, which is an enlargement of the existing Serangan Island. Extensive dredging operations of surrounding sea bed are needed for land reclamation, resulting in a general change in current pattern and water exchange for the Benoa Bay and the strait between the coast and Turtle Island. Prediction of the water quality before and after construction was accomplished in order to find the preferable of three layouts from an environmental point of view. The existing Serangan Island is relatively small, with no tourism and inhabited by a small number of local people. The shallow waters around the island are covered by benthic vegetation. A coral reef to the east of Serangan Island forms a border to the ocean. The water quality in terms of benthic vegetation, concentrations of phytoplankton, nutrients, dissolved oxygen and water turbidity was modelled using the MIKE 21 eutrophication model. The water quality was predicted to improve in the strait between the coast and the island due to increased flushing of the dredged channels. On the other hand, the improved flushing resulted in a larger spreading of the nutrients and deterioration of the water quality north and south of the proposed construction site. Lagoons proposed for leisure crafts also showed a deterioration of the water quality. For a lagoon close to a conservation area of the reef a large decrease in submerged vegetation was predicted. One layout was finally recommended as the optimal combining the various modelling results and results of other related studies.

In the model, transport of nutrients is based on calculated wind and river flow-induced currents. Water quality data from two points off the Finnish coast were used for the model calibration. Nitrogen is the limiting nutrient in most parts of the Gulf of Finland, but in the eastern Gulf phosphorus plays a more important role. According to the model results, load reductions are needed everywhere along the coast in order to counteract eutrophication. Nitrogen reduction is more important for the whole Gulf of Finland, while phosphorus reduction is most effective in coastal regions, particularly in the Neva estuary. A sensitivity analysis was made to the water quality model to study the effects of parameters and nutrient loads on calculated phytoplankton biomass. The influence of some parameters was found to be widely varying in different areas of the Gulf depending on the limiting nutrient. Also the dynamics of the phytoplankton growth-e.g. timing of the spring bloom peak-was strongly dependent on model parameter values. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

By integrating several models and synthesizing field data, we produce a detailed characterization of the circulation and water quality dynamics within the Bay. The models integrated in this study included a hydrodynamic model (Sheng, 1989; Sheng and Yassuda, 1995), a nitrogen cycle model (Chen and Sheng, 1995), a dissolved oxygen model (Yassuda, 1996), and a seagrass model (Fong and Harwell, 1994; Sheng at al., 1995). In this paper, the results of the water quality simulations are presented in terms of the dissolved oxygen dynamics and nutrient budget in the summer of 1991. Model simulations successfully reproduced the measured water surface elevation, currents, and salinity dynamics. In addition, the water quality model successfully simulated the development of hypoxia conditions and subsequent recovery during the summer of 1991.

Ground water ages within the aquifer could not be accurately determined from the measured distribution of H-3 and as a result, chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and H-3/He-3 dating techniques were applied. Beneath a 25 m thick unsaturated zone, ground water ages based on CFC-11 concentrations were greater than H-3/He-3 ground water ages by 6 to 10 years, due to the time lag associated with the diffusion of CFCs through the unsaturated zone, Using the corrected CFC-11 and H-3/He-3 ground water ages and the estimated travel time of 3H within the unsaturated zone, the approximate position of ground water recharged since the mid-1960s was determined, Nitrate concentrations within post mid-1960s recharge were generally elevated and near or above the drinking water limit of 10 mg-N/L. In comparison, pre mid-1960s recharge had nitrate concentrations <2.5 mg-N/L. The elevated NO3- concentrations in post mid-1960s recharge are attributed mainly to increasing fertilizer application rates between 1970 and the mid-to late 1980s. Anaerobic conditions suitable for denitrification are present within pre mid-1960s recharge indicating that removal of DO is a slow process taking tens of years, Over the next 10 to 20 years, nitrate concentrations at municipal well fields that are currently capturing aerobic ground water recharged near the mid-1960s are expected to increase because of the higher fertilizer application rates beginning in the 1970s and 1980s.

J	Cataldo, D; Boltovskoy, D				Cataldo, D; Boltovskoy, D			Population dynamics of Corbicula fluminea (Bivalvia) in the Parana River Delta (Argentina)	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Corbicula fluminea; population dynamics; reproduction; molluscs; growth	NATURAL-POPULATION; PHYTOPLANKTON; GROWTH; CLAM	Benthic individuals and drifting planktonic juveniles of Corbicula fluminea were sampled in the Lower Delta of the Parana River (Argentina) at monthly intervals between October 1995 and October 1996. Densities of settled darns above 1 mm, around 300-1000 ind. m(-2), varied little throughout the year. Below I mm benthic juveniles, on the other hand, showed a single conspicuous abundance peak in October-November (up to 1722 ind. m(-2)), and were practically absent during the rest of the year (overall annual mean: 1070 +/- 797 ind. m(-2)). Drifting juveniles showed one major peak in December 1995 (160 ind. m(-3)), and a minor one at the end of March (24 ind. (-3)). Length-frequency analyses of the monthly field data clearly indicate a highly structured population with a single well defined reproduction period centered on October-November, Population parameters derived from the seasonally oscillating version of von Bertalanffy's growth formula were as follows: maximum shell length: 32 mm (maximum observed shell length. 33 mm); growth constant: 0.65; growth seasonality (i.e.. span of summer-to-winter growth-rate difference): 0.7; winter point (i.e., time of the year when growth is minimum): 0.5 (June-July); estimated size range for one year-old individuals: 15.3-22.4 mm; for two years: 23.5-27 mm, and three years: 27.5-29.3 mm. Comparison with previous data confirm the influence of water temperature on the clam's reproduction and growth and furnish additional evidence suggesting that food availability may be as important fur recruitment as thermic regimes. Contrasts between traits of the population analyzed herein with those described previously from a nearby (ca. 10 km) site more influenced by industrial pollution point at the influence of water quality on Corbicula's recruitment and growth.

We propose a methodology for implementing such a model, based on the coupling of a biogeochemical model of a lake and the use of long term time series of meteorological data. This methodology is applied to lake Bourget (Savoie, France). It allows to obtain both mean and standard deviation (first and second order moments) of the state variables of the model on a 1 y period. The sensitivity of the model to the various forcing variables, as well as to the initial conditions is analyzed as well as the linear or non-linear behavior of the model. Finally, the propagation of the uncertainties (standard deviations) in time and space, for both water temperature and dissolved oxygen are assessed.

Inputs of its two tributaries, budgets and retention within the lake for particulate matter (PM), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were compared during the inflow period (Oct-May), by an input-output study, in two hydrologically contrasted years, 1993-94 with high inflow (292 10(6) m(3)), and 1995-96 with low inflow (76 10(6) m(3)). Globally the loads per ha were similar for the two tributaries for the same year, with higher values at the beginning of the flows, and total inputs markedly higher in 1993-94. During this year, average loads for the main tributary were 154 kg ha(-1) PM, 40 kg ha(-1) total N and 1.35 kg ha(-1) total P. In the two tributaries, NO3 represented 80% of total N for the two years, and PO4, 65% and 44% of total P. Total inputs, total outputs and storages are highly related to annual inflow, with large differences between elements. The highest change of inputs occur for NO2, PO4 and PM, and the lowest for NH4. Storage and outputs of the lake were also much higher in 1993-94, the most important annual differences concerning P storage, and outputs of PM and all forms of nitrogen except NH4. However, only the retention rate of total P doubled with the high outflow of 1993-94 (40% against 18%), while these of PO4 and NH4 were equivalent (79-72% and 72-66% respectively). In contrast the retention rate of all the other elements was lower with the large flow of 1993-94: 61 against 86% for NO3, 85-90% for NO2, 32-60% for total N, and 14-20% for PM. Globally, this wetland received important discharge of inorganic nitrogen from its catchment area, trapping or converting most of it (62-85%) into organic matter, while it exported a large amount of dissolved and particulate organic nitrogen (16 g m(-2) y(-1) in 1993-94 and 4.5 in 1995-96), 2.6 and 1.9 times more than it received. The exportation of organic N per m(2) and retention of total N (9.9-14.5 g m(-2) y(-1)) represent record values. This seems mainly due to the importance of water flow, juxtaposition of habitats with different degree of closure, plant biomass and resuspended endogenous, organic sediments in exportation. The lake is not able to counterbalance the dramatic increase of agricultural and sewage inputs, that induce its eutrophication and silting up.

Lake Pyhajarvi was weakly mesotrophic in 1980-1996, Lake Koylionjarvi was highly eutrophic in 1991-1996, and Lake Littoistenjarvi was mesotrophic in 1993-1996 and eutrophic in 1992. In Lake Pyhajarvi, natural year-class fluctuations of vendace and smelt (range of combined biomass 5-28 kg ha(-1)) caused significant variation in planktivory. The very dense fish stocks of Lake Koylionjarvi (mainly roach, bream and smelt) were decimated from > 175 kg ha(-1) in 1991 to about 50 kg ha(-1) in 1996 by removal fishing. The roach stock of Lake Littoistenjarvi declined from about 71 kg ha(-1) to about 28 kg ha(-1) during 1993-1996. In Lake Pyhajarvi, strong stocks of planktivorous fish were accompanied with depressed crustacean zooplankton biomass, reduced role of calanoids and cladocerans, a low proportion of larger cladocerans (length > 0.5 mm), and a high chlorophyll level. In the lakes Littoistenjarvi and Koylionjarvi, zooplankton was dependent on both fish and phytoplankton: in spite of dense fish stocks, a high crustacean biomass developed in a phytoplankton peak year, but it was dominated by very small cladocerans. In Lake Pyhajarvi, late summer chlorophyll concentration was predictable from total phosphorus in water and cladoceran biomass (r(2) = 0.68), both factors explaining roughly similar fraction of total variation. In combined data from all three lakes, chlorophyll was almost solely dependent on total phosphorus, while the cladocerans were regulated both from below by productivity and from above by fish. Our data from Pyhajarvi lend support to consumer regulation of late summer phytoplankton; low chlorophyll values prevailed when planktivorous fish biomass was below 15 kg ha-(1) In large eutrophic lakes it may be difficult to reduce fish stocks to such a low level: in Lake Koylionjarvi, after six years of removal fishing, fish biomass still remained higher, and changes in plankton were accordingly small. Unexpectedly, in 1993-1996, phytoplankton biomass in Littoistenjarvi remained low in spite of low crustacean zooplankton biomass; submerged macrophytes probably regulated the water quality.

The model is a linkage between ARCInfo GIS, the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) and Water Analysis Simulation Program (WASP) supported by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The model is a tool for managing non-point and point source pollution by providing a framework in which pollution sources can be removed and the impact on the harbour assessed. The GIS component of the model utilized input data on land use, soils and areas to generate an input file for SWMM. Streamflow and water quality constituents were simulated by SWMM for the 300 square mile watershed. Flows and pollutants were routed to the harbour for input to the WASP model in which the hydrodynamics, ammonia, nitrate+nitrite, organic nitrogen, orthophosphate, organic phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chlorophyll-a in the harbour were simulated. There was a paucity of concurrent data for model calibration but the simulation demonstrated that the model can be successfully used as a management tool for developing pollution reduction goals for the harbour.

In all enclosures, tilapia were also stocked at 25 g m(-3). Zooplankton abundance (p = 0.021) and net-phytoplankton biomass (p = 0.015) were significantly reduced at higher silver carp biomass. Microcystis abundance also declined significantly in the presence of silver carp (p = 0.093), irrespective of stocking rate. While results suggest that there is no way to control nuisance algae using silver carp without simultaneously suppressing zooplankton biomass, this is of little relevance in Paranoa Reservoir because the dominant cyanobacteria are outside the grazing spectrum of rotifers, the dominant zooplankters.

In accordance with the original plan the aim was that before entering the lake, nutrients - primarily phosphorus (P) - will be removed by macrophytes. Contrary to plans, the Upper Reservoir became an open lake dominated by algae that has retained its phosphorus load with a reasonable efficiency until 1991. After introducing P precipitation at Zalaegerszeg, P retention of the reservoir has significantly decreased. This fact can be explained by the increasing role of the internal load. To analyze the phosphorus removal mechanisms and to understand the behavior of the sediment, different water quality models were applied. P retention is characterized by different processes acting differently spatially. Essentially, abiotic processes like settling of inorganic particulate P and the adsorption of dissolved inorganic P are responsible for the P retention in the reservoir, mostly in the neck of the Upper Reservoir. Models calibrated are felt suitable to analyze future performances of both reservoir elements.

The model is based on 3D calculations of water currents and water quality. The simulation results are compared with the measurements and the effects of Vuotos on the present situation are assessed. The assessments on increased nutrient inputs are based on the earlier experiences of an existing similar reservoir at Porttipahta. Many scenarios were made to obtain as versatile assessment as possible. According to the model simulations, the average concentrations of algal biomass will increase by 20 - 60 %, while the maximum concentrations will double during the first years of the reservoir Vuotos.

In the eastern parts of the lake the effects will be smaller, because it is not on the through flow route of Kemijoki.

Modeling of complex ecological systems such as reservoir limnology is very difficult since the ecological interactions within a reservoir are difficult to define mathematically and are usually system specific. To illustrate the potential use of Neural Networks in ecological modeling, a software was developed to train the data from Keban Dam Reservoir by backpropogation algorithm. Although the available data was insufficient and irregular, the system was trained successfully to estimate the chlorophyll-a concentration given the time, total suspended solids, total phosphorus, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and secchi depth. The model was quite successful in estimating the output with an average error of 0.01268 to 8.11612x10(-8) percent for the 5 sampling stations.

Reservoir models were further completed with calculations of river sections, lake, coastal area and the sea downstream of a planned reservoir, Vuotos, in Finnish Lapland. As the main effects of Vuotos, phosphorus load is expected to increase with 150 kg/day during the first years after impoundment. Dispite of that, waters remain usable for existing water utilizations. Phosphorus load to the Bothnian Bay grows with about 1 %. Within 5 - 10 years the effects of Vuotos will decay below those of the present reservoirs in 1990's when they are 20 - 30 years old. Oxygen deficiency is restricted to the new reservoir itself and even there to the first few years.

Cyanobacterial blooms present a serious health concern when they occur in water bodies that supply potable water. Lake Kinneret, the major water source in Israel, was characterized for many years by relatively stable phytoplankton populations which fluctuated with the seasons in a quite predictable manner. An exceptional bloom of the filamentous cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon ovalisporum, which produces hepatotoxin, was observed for the first time in Lake Kinneret during the fall of 1994. Cylindrospermopsin, a toxin produced by A. ovalisporum, was purified and chemically characterized. The potential implications of cylindrospermopsin-producing A. ovalisporum bloom in Lake Kinneret on water quality is discussed, together with a general description of cyanobacterial toxins and their occurrence in natural waters.

JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY			English	Article						cyanobacteria; diatoms; eutrophication; green algae; monitoring; phytoplankton; rivers; water management; The Netherlands	PHYTOPLANKTON; RHINE; MODEL; COMMUNITIES; SUCCESSION; ECOSYSTEMS; PLANKTON; LOWLAND; SYSTEM; MEUSE	Observations on phytoplankton in the lower reaches of the rivers Rhine and Meuse were carried out in the framework of the national monitoring programme of the main water systems in The Netherlands. Seasonal changes in density and species composition were analysed to detect the major variables and to discuss whether this monitoring meets its goals. Phytoplankton reached peak densities of 140 and 65 mu g L-1 Chi alpha in the Rhine and Meuse, respectively. Overall density was correlated with seasonal variation in water discharge rather than with nutrient concentrations, that are high in both rivers. The position of sampling sites in relation to the downstream development of the plankton was very important, especially in the regulated Meuse. Despite hydrographic and chemical differences between the two rivers, many species, predominantly diatoms and green algae, were shared. The occurrence of the diatom Skeletonema subsalsum in the Rhine and the green algae Neodesmus danubialis, Micractinium pusillum and Pseudotetrastrum punctatum in the Meuse (1992, but not 1996) was interpreted as a feature related, respectively, to the high salinity of the Rhine and specific riverine conditions of the Meuse. In general the potamoplankton was characterised as an opportunistic assemblage exploiting the high nutrient contents and disturbed hydrography of both rivers. Nevertheless, the phytoplankton contributed to the characterisation of the present river communities, ones that differ rather strongly in historic records. Although year to year variation in phytoplankton density is mainly related to variation in water discharge, phytoplankton biomass did increase as a result of eutrophication over a period of decades. The widespread nature of many of today's potamoplankton species in the two rivers render these organisms less useful for indicating short-term changes in water quality.

Population dynamics from the two contrasting arid ecosystems show varied degrees of changes in water chemistry and algal flora. Recovery of algal blooms after a few flashflood events can be described as a model of temporal succession in the semi-permanent/desiccated water body. Morphometric properties and mesotrophic planktonic biota were restored within 2-3 weeks of rainfall (5-10 cm water deposited). The dominant and the first to emerge was the bloom-forming green alga Carteria multifilis followed by Micratinium pusillum. A gradient seasonal succession from relatively mesotrophic to hypertrophic was recorded. Subsequently, the blue-green algae Oscillatoria limnetica and Microcystis aeruginosa succeeded resulting in bluish-green to drab olive colourization to the water. Altogether, 32 species are reported, c. 30% of which are newly recorded to the Saudi Arabian algal flora. Emergence and survival of consistent flora was positively correlated with water quality and seasonal succession. (C) 1998 Academic Press Limited.

J	Van der Molen, DT; Breeuwsma, A; Boers, PCM				Van der Molen, DT; Breeuwsma, A; Boers, PCM			Agricultural nutrient losses to surface water in the Netherlands: Impact, strategies, and perspectives	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							CYANOBACTERIAL TOXINS; AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT; PHOSPHORUS	Nutrient emissions from agricultural activities have become the dominant source of nutrient loads to freshwater in the Netherlands, This paper focuses on nutrient emissions from agriculture, emphasizing nutrient loads to surface waters, and strategies and perspectives to reduce these emissions, Although adverse environmental effects of intensive agriculture have been known for several Sears, it was not until 1987 that stabilization of animal manure production and application began, Since 1991 manure application rates have been reduced, Recently, application standards hs re been replaced by agriculturally inevitable nutrient losses and environmentally acceptable nutrient losses and these losses are reduced to an equilibrium fertilization in 2010, defined as the supply of manure and fertilizers that meets crop uptake and compensates for inevitable losses. In the 1980s, the most important tool to manage nutrient losses was a manure bookkeeping; recently a mineral bookkeeping has been introduced, Agricultural nutrient emissions to and their impact upon surface waters have been estimated from field experiments and model calculations, which indicate that the proposed legislation will not significantly improve water quality, Increasing areas will be saturated with P, especially where intensive livestock farming is located on sandy soils, Tailor-made regional programs are necessary to achieve ecological restoration of surface waters, with priority for catchment areas with vulnerable receiving waters, These programs may consist of a further reduction of nutrient application rates, hydrological measures, selection of crops that extract P from the soils or measures to increase the P adsorption capacity of the soil, and buffer strips.

The objective of this study was to evaluate metal runoff from plots fertilized with varying rates of alum-treated and untreated (normal) poultry litter. Alum-treated (10% alum by weight) and untreated litter was broadcast applied to small plots in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb,), Litter application rates were 0, 2.24, 4.49, 6.73, and 8.98 Mg ha(-1) (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 tons acre(-1)). Rainfall simulators were used to produce two runoff events, immediately after litter application and 7 d later. Both concentrations and loads of water-soluble metals increased linearly with litter application rates, regardless of litter type. Alum treatment reduced concentrations of As, Cu, Fe, and Zn, relative to untreated litter, whereas it increased Ca and Mg, Copper concentrations in runoff water from untreated litter mere extremely high (up to 1 mg Cu L-1), indicating a potential water quality problem. Soluble Al, K, and Na concentrations were not significantly affected by the type of litter. Reductions in trace metal runoff due to alum appeared to be related to the concentration of soluble organic C (SOC), as well as the affinity of SOC for trace metals. Metal runoff from alum-treated litter is less likely to cause environmental problems than untreated litter, since threats to the aquatic environment by Ca and Mg are far less than those posed by As, Cu, and Zn.

J	Tufford, DL; McKellar, HN; Hussey, JR				Tufford, DL; McKellar, HN; Hussey, JR			In-stream nonpoint source nutrient prediction with land-use proximity and seasonality	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							WATER-QUALITY; RIPARIAN FORESTS; POLLUTION	This research developed multiple regression models relating land use to in-stream concentrations of total nitrogen (TOTN) and total phosphorus (TOTP) in eight, low-order watersheds on the coastal plain of South Carolina, The study area (4860 km(2)) included dominant land-use categories of agriculture, forest, urban, and wetland comprising the lower portion of the Lake Marion drainage. Land-use data were obtained from a pre-existing GIS database derived by classification of satellite images. The models partitioned land-use categories according to distance from stream channels using a series of buffer zones around each stream, Effects of point source contributions were removed from observed in-stream concentrations so that nonpoint source effects could be more clearly delineated. All models except two were significant at P < 0.05, The models for TOTN (r(2) from 0.25-0.63) explained more variability of stream nutrient concentrations than those for TOTE (r(2) from 0.16-0.39), Greater predictive strength for TOTN than TOTP likely reflects differing pathways from terrestrial to aquatic systems, Land close to the stream channel (<150 m) was a better predictor of nutrient concentrations than land away from the channel (>150 m), Land-use change scenarios (converting forest and wetland to agriculture) support the conclusion that management of stream water quality will be most effective with emphasis on riparian and adjacent lands. Seasonal models were generally significant (P < 0.05) and demonstrate that the seasonal profile of stream nutrient concentrations is dependent on the mosaic of land uses in a specific subbasin.

J	Effler, SW; Siegfried, C				Effler, SW; Siegfried, C			Tributary water quality feedback from the spread of zebra mussels: Oswego River, New York	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						zebra mussels; water quality; nutrients; turbidity; chlorophyll; river; tributary	WESTERN LAKE ERIE; DREISSENA-POLYMORPHA; SENECA RIVER; HATCHERY BAY; SAGINAW BAY; GREAT-LAKES; IMPACT; ESTABLISHMENT; CHLOROPHYLL; MODEL	Dramatic changes in the water quality of the Oswego River system, including Oswego Harbor, since the early 1990s brought about by zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) infestation are documented. The analysis is based on summertime (June to September) water quality monitoring of the Oswego Harbor (1981 and 1993), the mouth of the Oswego River (1983 to 1993), and three upstream sites in the Oswego River system (1990, 1991, and 1994), and two benthic surveys conducted along a 70 km reach of the system to the mouth of the Oswego River in 1994. It is estimated that water in the Oswego River was filtered more than entice over this length by the mussels in 1994 (at median flow) before it reached Oswego Harbor. The zebra mussel infestation converted the Oswego River and the harbor from a turbid (low clarity), phytoplankton-rich, nutrient-depleted system, to a system with distinctly greater clarity, reduced phytoplankton concentrations, enriched in soluble reactive phosphorus. Most of this impact was attributable to dense zebra mussel populations (e.g., similar to 30,000 indiv/m(2)) in a 5 km river section, located > 60 km upstream of Oswego Harbor. These changes in tributary water quality represent a form of feedback associated with the spread of the zebra mussel from the Laurentain Great Lakes. Increased attached algae growth in the Great Lakes proximate to the inflow of infested tributaries is a reasonable expectation in response to the more available form of the phosphorous load.

J	Makarewicz, JC; Bertram, P; Lewis, TW				Makarewicz, JC; Bertram, P; Lewis, TW			Changes in phytoplankton size-class abundance and species composition coinciding with changes in water chemistry and zooplankton community structure of Lake Michigan, 1983 to 1992	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						Lake Michigan; phytoplankton; trophic interactions; food web; zooplankton	DYNAMICS; PREDATION; DIAPTOMUS; BYTHOTREPHES; INVASION; INSHORE	Phytoplankton and zooplankton were collected at offshore sites of Lake Michigan during 37 cruises in the spring and summer from 1983 to 1992. For the period, 39 common phytoplankton species accounted for 96.0% of the total abundance and 85.6% of the biomass. Over the 10-year study, the lake-wide average spring and summer phytoplankton biomass in the pelagic waters ranged from 0.27 to 1.2 g/m(3) (mean. +/- S.E. = 0.54 +/- 0.03 g/m3) and phytoplankton abundance ranged from 5,132 to 39,780 cells/mL (mean +/- S.E. = 18,291 +/- 822 cells/mL). Mesotrophic diatoms accounted for 47.2% of the total phytoplankton biomass. The lack of a trend in the ratio of mesotrophic to eutrophic diatom indicator species suggested that no change in trophic status of the pelagic region occurred during the 1983 to 92 period; that is, the water quality of the offshore of Lake Michigan did not change. A year-to-year shift in dominance from one mesotrophic diatom species to another was evident. Over the 10-year period, flagellates accounted for 52.2% of the summer phytoplankton biomass. The data support the concept of a shift in summer species composition away from blue-green algae dominance to flagellates prior to 1982. However after 1987 the relative importance of the > 70 mu m size class increased to over 21% of the phytoplankton abundance in the spring and over 55% in the summer. In particular, the colonial blue-greens, Anacystis and Aphanothece, became substantially more prevalent during the summer, while the flagellates, Chromulina and Ochromonas, decreased in abundance. The changes in the relative abundance of phytoplankton size classes and species composition were examined to determine if they correlated with either the top-down mediated changes in the zooplankton community during the 1980s and 1990s or with any bottom-up variability in nutrient chemistry. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) suggested a significant portion of the variability of the spring and summer phytoplankton size classes from 1983-1992 (88.0% and 99.2%, respectively) was explained by environmental axis I. Primary determinants of relative abundance of phytoplankton size class included nutrients (silica, total phosphorus, and N:P ratio) and abundance of some species of zooplankton. Specifically, Diaptomus minutus, D. ashlandi, D. sicilis, and Daphnia galeata mendotae were inversely correlated with the 0 to 10 mu m size class, which we interpret as a grazing effect on phytoplankton size structure, and positively correlated with an increase in abundance of the > 70 mu m size class of phytoplankton. CCA suggested that top-down and bottom-up effects were affecting phytoplankton size composition and abundance simultaneously.

J	Cioffi, F; Gallerano, F				Cioffi, F; Gallerano, F			Design and management of hyperintensive aquaculture tanks	JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC RESEARCH			English	Article							FISH CULTURE ZONE; DISSOLVED-OXYGEN; PONDS; ISRAEL	In order to identify the optimum design and management criteria for hyperintensive aquaculture rectangular tanks, a hydrodynamic model and a water quality model have been developed. The models allow the simulation of the velocity fields in the tanks and of the concentration evolution, in space and time, of the significant species: dissolved oxygen, phytoplankton and nitrogen compounds. These models can be used to identify both the critical conditions for the survival of the reared aquatic organisms and the pollutant load discharged in the environment from the tanks. The hydrodynamic fields are obtained by solving numerically, on a symmetric vertical plane of the tank, the two-dimensional turbulent motion equations expressed in terms of vorticity and stream function; the eddy viscosity which appears in the motion equations is obtained by solving a standard k-epsilon model. The concentration fields of each chemical and biological species are obtained by solving their mass balance equations, in which the physical, chemical and biological phenomena are represented. The models have been validated by means of laboratory and field measurements taken in hyperintensive aquaculture units in use. A number of simulations, reproducing possible critical conditions, have allowed the identification of the optimum design criteria and have functioned as a guide for the management of the hyperintensive aquaculture tanks.

A runoff study was conducted to evaluate grass filter effectiveness in reducing transport of the estrogen hormone 17 beta-estradiol in runoff from pasture-applied poultry litter. The study objectives were ia determine the effects of source (litter-treated) length and grass filter length on runoff concentration and losses of 17 beta-estradiol from poultry litter applied to tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreber) plots. Litter was applied at 5 Mg/ha (2.2 ton/ac) to the upslope 6.1, 12.2, and 18.3 m (20, 40, and 60 ft) of 24.4-m (80-ft) long grass strips. The corresponding grass filter lengths were 18.3, 12.2, and 6.1 m (60, 40, and 20 ft), respectively, with the downslope edge of source areas evaluated as a 0-m long filter. Simulated rain was applied at 50 mm/h (2 in/h) to produce runoff samples for 17 beta-estradiol analysis. Runoff concentrations and mass losses were not significantly affected by source length and averaged 3.5 mu g/L (ppb) and 1413 mg/ha (0.02 oz/ac), respectively. Runoff concentrations were reduced by 58, 81, and 34% and mass losses by 79, 90, and 98% by filter lengths of 6.1, 12.2, and 18.3 m (20, 40, and 60 ft), respectively.

Same of these studies reported that NO3--N leaching is a factor that can contribute to these high well water NO3--N concentrations. Computer models are technology transfer tools that can assess impacts of best irrigation and nutrient management practices Sequential computer simulations of the effects of winter cover crop planting date on residual soil NO3--N concentrations have not been previously conducted. The new version 1.2 of the Nitrate Leaching and Economic Analysis Package (NLEAP) model was used to conduct an assessment of the effect of winter cover crop planting date on conservation of water quality The NLEAP model simulated a lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) - winter cover wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and lye (Secale cereale L.) (early- or late-planted) potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) rotation, grown on a center-pivot irrigated Kerber loamy sand. Winter cover crops increased the system N use efficiency (NUE) (P<0.05). The effect of early-planted winter cover craps on conservation of water quality extended into the potato growing season, increasing NUE and reducing NO3--N leaching (P<0.05).

Version 1.2 is capable of conducting simulations on a baseline similar for different crops, varieties, management scenarios, and soil types, The development of these regional parameters and the calibration/validation of the model permits the evaluation of the effects of best management practices on residual soil NO3-N and transport of NO3-N in the soil profile for small grains and vegetable rotations. NLEAP 1.2 computer simulations suggested that the net process of NO3-N leaching can be reversed for coarse-textured soils and that there is potential for NO3-N mining when best management practices are implemented. These are important NLEAP facts that can potentially contribute to protect and improve water quality.

J	McEwan, J; Gabric, AJ; Bell, PRF				McEwan, J; Gabric, AJ; Bell, PRF			Water quality and phytoplankton dynamics in Moreton Bay, south-eastern Queensland. II. Mathematical modelling	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH			English	Article							NUTRIENT; ECOSYSTEMS; SEDIMENTS; FLORIDA; ESTUARY; OXYGEN; GROWTH	A coupled hydrodynamic water-quality model of Moreton Bay was developed to enable better management of nutrient loads and to predict eutrophication-related problems. The hydrodynamic submodel was calibrated to available tidal data, and the transport submodel was calibrated to a salinity dataset, A 15-month time-series of field data was used together with historical data to calibrate and validate the water-quality submodel, Model simulations suggest that denitrification removes over half the external N inputs with about one-third exported to the open ocean. Approximately 8% of N and 20% of the P loading accumulates in the sediments. Short-term variations due to hydrodynamic effects tend to mask the seasonal cycle in phytoplankton biomass except at inshore localities. The model predictions confirm the field data that indicate that water quality in the western bay is severely affected while the better flushed eastern region remains relatively unaffected. Future increases in nutrient loading due to population pressure are predicted to extend the severely affected region eastwards. Over most of the bay, algal productivity is N-limited except for the western margins where nutrients are saturating and light availability regulates growth. Model hindcasts suggest that system-wide mean algal production has increased by a factor of ten since European settlement.

Similarly, the increasing impairment of coastal water quality resulting from the discharge of domestic, agricultural and industrial wastes into coastal waters has affected the aquaculture profitability in certain areas. The cumulative impact of the main anthropogenic sources of nutrients in the Mexican coastal states was estimated in 190 088 ton N yr(-1) and 51 831 ton P yr(-1). The input from shrimp aquaculture is only 1.5% and 0.9% of the main sources of nitrogen and phosphorus. This last input, though small, is related to focal and adverse effects on coastal ecosystems. The introduction of management measures to mitigate the adverse environmental impacts of shrimp aquaculture development has now become necessary and urgent. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Selection of plants for the wetlands is important to enhance water loss through evapotranspiration and decrease nitrogen, phosphorus, fecal coliforms and BOD content of effluents. Glasshouse experiments were conducted in fall '96 and spring '97 to evaluate the effectiveness of Canna lilies, Louisiana Iris and two species of cattails in improving quality of effluent from septic tanks. Plants were grown in 20-L containers filled with washed gravel and watered every two days with septic effluent to simulate a two-day retention time in constructed wetlands. Biological oxygen demand of the septic effluent decreased 89-97% when plants were grown, while the gravel-only treatment reduced BOD by 88%. Both species of Typha consistently helped in reducing BOD during fall and summer seasons. Ammonium-N in septic effluent decreased 95-98% when plants were grown in comparison to 63-76% reduction when plants were not grown. Phosphorus concentrations were decreased significantly by all plants in fall '96, but Canna lilies did not do as well in summer '97. The two species of cattails resulted in 200% more water loss through evapotranspiration than the other plant types and the control. All plants decreased turbidity but plant types did not affect total and fecal coliform populations. The two-day retention in the system decreased coliform populations but the dt:crease was significantly higher in gravel-only treatment. In general, plants improved water quality of the septic effluent. The conclusion from our investigations is that plant selection for constructed wetlands is potentially important in enhancing water quality from sub-surface wetlands.

It has been traditionally assumed that nitrate is highly mobile in groundwater systems and is reduced mostly through dilution. However, a review of recent studies indicated that natural denitrification in groundwater is not uncommon, and has the potential to significantly reduce groundwater nitrate concentrations under certain conditions. Groundwater denitrification rates of 0.009 to 4.8 mu g NO3-N/(gram sediment).(day) were reported in the recent literature for shallow water table aquifers in various locations in the U.S. The potential for natural denitrification as related to onsite wastewater treatment system (OWTS) impacts to groundwater quality was investigated in this study. Significant concentrations of nitrogen were documented in groundwater below and immediately downgradient of several residential OWTS in Florida. However, groundwater quality was at background concentrations within 20 to 30 meters downgradient. Aquifer and bromide tracer testing results indicated that dilution was not solely responsible for the reduction in nitrogen concentrations, and natural denitrification in groundwater was hypothesized as the responsible mechanism. To test this hypothesis, the results of previous studies of natural denitrification were analyzed. Denitrification rates reported in the literature were correlated with other factors controlling denitrification reactions such as dissolved oxygen concentration, temperature, pH, and soil organic content. A strong correlation between denitrification rate and soil organic content was developed for studies in the literature similar to those investigated in Florida. Based on a linear regression with r = 0.91, a natural denitrification rate for the Florida OWTS sites of 0.24 to 0.68 mu g NO3-N/g.d was predicted. Application of this denitrification rate to a mass balance of nitrogen at the study site led to the conclusion that natural denitrification in groundwater downgradient of the site was the mechanism primarily responsible for the reduction in nitrogen concentrations measured in the field. This result is significant when considering the impacts to water quality from OWTS.

Cesspools and other substandard septic systems comprise approximately sixty percent of the estimated 145,000 septic systems in the State. Water quality has declined in coastal zone areas due to non-point sources of nitrogen and pathogenic organisms derived, in part, from conventional septic systems. A State-funded on-site wastewater demonstration project began in July 1996 to replace 12 failed septic systems in the Narragansett Bay Watershed in Rhode Island with innovative on-site wastewater treatment systems. The overall goal of this project is to encourage the use of innovative and alternative on-site wastewater treatment systems to protect sole source aquifers and coastal water quality. This paper will focus on: (a) the site conditions and constraints encountered (b) the types of systems installed to remediate the existing system failures and to reach targeted water quality protection goals, (c) construction cost estimates for the selected systems, (d) strategies for educating participating homeowners, communities, designers, installers, university students, and regulatory agencies involved with this project, and (e) startup performance evaluation results from the secondary treatment components of these systems.

To protect the waters of the Florida Keys from further degradation, the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) was established by the federal government in 1990. In 1993 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) identified domestic wastewater as a major source of nutrient loading to FKNMS waters. Many dwellings and commercial establishments in the Keys use onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS), so the Florida Keys Onsite Wastewater Nutrient Reduction Systems (OWNRS) Demonstration Project was initiated in 1995 to demonstrate the use of OWTS which could significantly improve treatment and reduce the concentrations of nutrients discharged to the near-shore environment of the Keys. To meet this objective, a unique test facility was designed and constructed to evaluate various OWNRS processes simultaneously, under controlled conditions, using a common wastewater source. Five principle wastewater treatment process streams were operated concurrently at the test facility, with several unit processes in each stream. Unit processes evaluated included attached growth and suspended growth biological processes (both aerobic and anaerobic), physical/chemical processes (adsorption, precipitation, ion exchange) and natural systems utilizing drip irrigation for plant uptake and evapo-transpiration Influent and effluent quality were monitored monthly with 24-hour flow-composite samples. Results after the first year of operation indicate that OWNRS effluent concentrations of 5 mg/L CBOD5, 5 mg/L TSS, 10 mg/L total nitrogen, and 1 mg/L total phosphorus are achievable without chemical addition using combinations of the processes tested. Although excellent treatment was achieved with OWNRS, significant additional construction, operation, and maintenance was required for these systems in comparison with conventional OWTS.

(1989) and Sheng (1993). Sheng (1993) analyzed field data of suspended sediment and phosphorus concentrations collected in 1988 and 1989 and suggested the possible role of sediment resuspension on phosphorus resuspension. Sheng (1993) estimated the rate of phosphorus resuspension from the rate of sediment resuspension and measured phosphorus concentration, and found the resuspension flux of phosphorus to be much greater than that of sediments. This paper presents results of a more recent field and modeling study aimed to quantify the roles of hydrodynamic vs. non-hydrodynamic factors on phosphorus and phytoplankton dynamics during an episodic event on February 2-4, 1993 in Lake Okeechobee. Continuous data of hydrodyamics, suspended sediment concentration, DO, pH, and phosphorus and chlorophyll-a concentrations were collected from 1-3 vertical levels at a fixed platform in the lake. Results indicated that during the first day of the event, strong wave-induced turbulence caused significant resuspension of bottom sediments, which led to elevated bottom concentrations of phosphorus and chlorophyll-a. During the second day, although the lake was relatively calm with little or no resuspension of sediments, there were significant temporal fluctuations in phosphorus concentrations. Using the data and a comprehensive one-dimensional modeling system of hydrodynamics, sediment transport, and water quality dynamics, we found that the observed temporal fluctuations in phosphorus were significantly influenced by temporal variations in DO and pH. Peaks in phosphorus concentrations on the second day were caused by the delayed desorption of SRP (Soluble Reactive Phosphorus) from suspended sediments due to lowered DO and higher pH. Fluctuations in phosphorus did not coincide with fluctuations in TSS (Total Suspended Solids), thus confirming that desorption and adsorption are not in equilibrium during episodic events.

Forests in industrialized regions are especially vulnerable to these changes, which include soil acidification and base cation depletion, mobilization of aluminum and other toxic metal ions from the soil solid phase into soil solution, damage to plant roots by aluminum toxicity, and damage to groundwater or runoff through acidification or enhanced nitrate levels. Chronic exposure to acid deposition can threaten the health of trees, the stability of forest ecosystems and the regional ground water quality. Management decisions to bring about sustainable use of a forest must take into account the long term history, current effects and future prognosis of acid deposition on the forest. Sulfate deposition across much of Europe has been greatly reduced in the last decade, whereas nitrate and ammonium deposition continue to increase. In Asia, sulfate deposition is expected to at least double within the next 15 years due to greatly increased industrialization. The resulting damage will undoubtedly augment other stresses put on forest ecosystems in Asia by the rapidly-growing population. Limiting this damage will only be possible with a thorough knowledge of the potential effects of acid deposition on different forest ecosystems. Reversing the damage caused by acid deposition through decreasing sulfur or nitrogen deposition may not be rapid or simple. Depending on the soil type, the duration of the acid input, the stand management history and other factors, the recovery of acidified soils and waters may be delayed by years or decades by the remobilization of accumulated sulfate from the soil, and by a decreased supply of calcium and magnesium due to reduced emission of particulates. Due to differing retention mechanisms, the response of forest ecosystems to decreased sulfate deposition is in general slower than the response to decreased nitrate deposition or decreased ammonium deposition. Over the long term, to reach the goal of sustainable forestry in industrialized countries, the emission of acidifying substances and of nitrogen compounds needs to be adjusted to the carrying capacity of different soils and ecosystems. The "critical load" concept, which estimates the highest tolerable deposition load for different soils and ecosystems, is a useful approach to quantify target emission rates. The emission of acidifying substances today far exceeds the critical load in many areas of Europe. Over the short term, the effects of acidification can be temporarily mitigated by liming, an (albeit expensive) option now undertaken on a large scale over many areas of Europe.

At some locations, nitrate concentrations have exceeded the maximum contaminant level of 10 milligrams per liter for nitrate as nitrogen in drinking water. A water-quality assessment was conducted between 1992 and 1995 to define the areal concentration of nitrate in the aquifer, identify the principal sources of the nitrate, and estimate the nitrate loads from major sources identified. The study was concentrated on an area of about 33 square kilometers which constitutes the part of the upper aquifer with drainage to the Laguna Tortuguero. The study indicated that nitrate concentrations within the Laguna Tortuguero ground-water drainage basin were close to or above 10 milligrams per liter. The investigation confirmed that the sources of nitrate are derived primarily from fertilizer used in the cultivation of pineapples and from septic tank effluent at rural communities. The nitrate concentrations down-gradient the pineapple fields and un-sewered rural communities are between 6.8 and 10.0 milligrams per liter. The potential nitrate load from these land uses to the sub-surface was estimated at 760 kilograms of nitrogen per hectare per year from pineapple fields and 200 kilograms of nitrogen per hectare per year from unsewered rural communities. Mass balance calculations indicate that all the estimated nitrogen load from septic tank effluent may reach the upper aquifer, whereas the load from fertilized fields may be only 45 kilograms of nitrogen per hectare per year.

Five sub-basins, each with distinct land use characteristics, were instrumented to obtain discharge and samples during storm-runoff events. The total phosphorus and total nitrogen loads entering Lago de Cidra for the 1-year period were calculated at 6,530 and 18,700 kilograms, respectively. Of the total load, about 5,700 kilograms of total phosphorus and 10,200 kilograms of total nitrogen were retained in the reservoir by bottom sediments, aquatic plants, or within the reservoir water column. The total phosphorus export coefficients, in kilograms per hectare, for five monitored sub-basins having distinct land-use characteristics were estimated to be 0.37 for a watershed consisting: primarily of secondary-growth forest and fallow 1.49 and 1.98 for two rural agricultural watersheds: 2.55 for an urban sewered community; and 7.06 for an urban unsewered community. The export coefficients for total nitrogen, in kilograms per hectare for the same areas were estimated to be 2.72; 6.91 and 8.59; 6.62; and 17.1, respectively.

The tools should have the character of managing instruments and be innovative with respect to the conventional modeling of nitrogen transport in groundwater. The methodology, proposed in this paper, is based on a mathematical model describing both water now and nitrogen migration in saturated and unsaturated part of an underground domain. The mathematical model is governed by two equations describing the two-dimensional water flow through a porous matrix in a vertical plane and the transport and dispersion phenomena in the unsaturated and saturated zones. The equations are solved numerically using a finite difference approach. The model is applied to a study area, which comprises a part of the Po river basin, south of Modena, bounded by the Secchia and Panaro rivers, both tributaries of Po. This area is intensively used for civil, industrial and agricultural purposes and intensive cattle and pig breeding takes place on the south section of the study area. The influence of the agriculture is focused on the groundwater quality resulting in high nitrate concentrations that reach unacceptable values.

Accurate estimation of the internal load is difficult because of its spatial and temporal variation. A procedure using a dynamic spatial modeling approach is proposed to improve the estimation. A case study of Posan off-stream reservoir is described to demonstrate the implementation of the procedure for data collection and model preparation, field sampling planning and investigation, laboratory analysis for phosphorus releasing rates, model integration of AGNPS and WASP, calibration and verification of the integrated model, and the internal load estimation. The procedure is expected to provide appropriate temporal and spatial phosphorus internal load estimation for an off-stream reservoir. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The method is illustrated by application to the Corpus Christi Bay system in South Texas. A mesh of 100m digital elevation model cells is laid over the drainage area and cell to cell connectivity established to link each land surface cell with a corresponding water body segment. Nonpoint source constituent loads are determined for each cell as the product of runoff and expected mean concentration, and accumulated down to the bay system. Point source and atmospheric loads are added, water quality computed in each bay system, and compared to observed data. A strong South to North runoff gradient is observed in the study area, The majority of the pollutant loading comes from nonpoint sources, except for oil and grease, which arise mainly from point sources. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the bay system are reproduced reasonably well provided a decay rate of 0.01-0.02 day(-1) used. Oil and Grease are reproduced well as conservative constituents. The computed metals concentrations are low and suggest a significant source in sediment or elsewhere that is presently not accounted for.

Three new state variables are computed: shoots (above-ground biomass), roots (below-ground biomass), and epiphytes (attached algae). The addition of SAV also required the addition of inorganic suspended solids (ISS). Light attenuation was made a function of the concentrations of phytoplankton and suspended solids, both organic (detritus) and inorganic. In addition to water column light attenuation, self-shading by SAV, shading to epiphytes by SAV, shading to SAV by epiphytes, and epiphyte self-shading are included. Suspended solids are transported and settle at rates that are dependent on SAV density. SAV is linked to both water column and benthic nutrient dynamics. Three different SAV groups are being simulated in Chesapeake Bay in three salinity regions.

Lake Decatur provides the public water supply for the City of Decatur, Illinois. Nitrate concentrations in the lake have exceeded the maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 10 milligrams per liter (mg/l) fourteen of the last eighteen years. The Lake Decatur watershed comprises 925 square miles and is primarily farmland used for the production of corn and soybeans. Two different mathematical models were used in the evaluation: an EPIC (Erosion/Productivity Impact Calculator) based model; and an AGNPS (Agricultural Nonpoint Source Pollution Model) based model. Both models were calibrated to observed nitrate concentrations in Lake Decatur. Results from the two models were used together to generate a "best estimate" of projected peak nitrate concentrations and severity of nitrate excursions above the MCL for future conditions and a range of application rates. Individually the models provided insight into the response of Lake Decatur nitrate levels to reduced fertilizer application rates, yet neither model was perfectly suited to exactly simulating the response. However, the relative merits of the two models complemented one another so that a reasonable estimate of future nitrate excursions was obtained by combining model results. The combined results indicate that a reduction in average fertilizer nitrogen application rates from current levels to recommended levels would reduce the magnitude of MCL exceedances by approximately 73 percent for critical conditions observed in 1989. Due to uncertainty in the model applications, this percent reduction may range from 62 percent to 85 percent.

On the basis of the two other papers and a comparison between the best known state of the art river model, QUAL2E, and the IAWQ Activated Sludge Model (ASM) No. 1, the Task Group proposes to develop improved conversion models for inclusion in a river water quality model. The model should describe the cycling of oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus in both water and sediment, and should be compatible with the ASM to support the development of integrated emission reduction strategies. The model should be particularly well suited to handle problems characterized by significant temporal and spatial influences (e.g. CSOs and NPSs). It should serve for research, education, improved communication, knowledge transfer, regulatory applications such as catchment planning, and improved data collection. Anticipated results of the Task Group effort include: (i) standardized conversion sub-models; (ii) a decision support tool to guide model construction and usage; and (iii) case study applications. The model development, which is not intended to result in a software product, is intended to be an open-ended and flexible process to encourage the participation of interested professionals.

For the Chesapeake Bay watershed model, and for Limit of Technology (LOT) controls, a 16% and 45% reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively, is calculated. For the Bay, it is concluded that removal of phosphorus only is less effective than nitrogen in improving bottom water DO because of differential transport of nitrogen downstream. For the Delaware estuary, a significant decline in phytoplankton chlorophyll has been observed in the absence of any nutrient controls but in the presence of improved DO. A simple model is offered that hypothesized an increase iii benthic bivalve filtration of overlying water as a result of improvement in DO. (C) 1998 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

It was established for the protection of Lake Balaton against high nutrient loads. In accordance with the original plan prepared at the end of 70s the aim was that before entering the lake, nutrients - primarily phosphorus - will be removed by macrophytes. The Upper Reservoir started to operate in 1985. In contrast to the predictions, it became an open lake dominated by algae. Until 1991 about 50% of the external phosphorus load has been removed yearly. However, the retention efficiency has decreased considerably after reduction of the external load upon phosphorus removal at the wastewater treatment plant of the largest town of the Zala catchment. This observation can be explained by the increased contribution of the internal loading. To analyze the phosphorus removal mechanisms and to understand the behavior of the sediment, different water quality models were applied. The results show that the P retention is characterized by different processes acting spatially differently. Essentially, abiotic processes like settling of inorganic particulate P and the adsorption of dissolved inorganic P are responsible for the P:retention in the reservoir, mostly in the neck of the Upper Reservoir. Simple models indicated that the internal loading increased after the external load reduction. In fact, it was not that the internal loading increased, but the adsorption decreased. (C) 1998 IAWQ.

J	Janse, JH				Janse, JH			A model of ditch vegetation in relation to eutrophication	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Eutrophication Research : State of the Art - Inputs, Processes, Effects, Modelling, Management	AUG 28-29, 1997	WAGENINGEN, NETHERLANDS			ditch; duckweed; eutrophication; macrophytes; model; phosphorus; nitrogen; nutrients		A functional model of a ditch ecosystem has been developed, aimed at describing the relation between nutrient input and water quality and dominant vegetation in drainage ditches. Its aim is the derivation of the 'critical nutrient loading' for a shift from submerged vegetation to duckweed dominance. The model, called PCDitch, describes the competition between several functional groups of macrophytes, as well as algae. The macrophyte groups were defined according to the layer(s) in which they grow: submerged, floating or emergent, rooted or non-rooted. The model also includes the cycling of nutrients within the water, the sediment top layer and the vegetation. The model has been applied to the data of 8 experimental ditches located at Renkum (The Netherlands), which received different levels of nutrient loading during 4 years. The controls and the low-and medium-loaded ditches remained dominated by submerged plants, while in the high-loaded ones a dense cover of duckweed developed. In the sand ditches, submerged biomasses were lower than in the respective clay ditches. An optimization study has been performed for a number of sensitive parameters, minimizing the total sum of squared differences between simulated and measured values for all ditches, resulting in a set of parameter values that gives the best overall fit. The parameters included the maximum growth rates, the minimum phosphorus contents and the overwintering fraction of the plant groups. The model simulations by PCDitch were grossly comparable to the field observations, with duckweed in the high-loaded ditches and submerged plants in the other ones, The fit for algae and charophytes remained poor. Further calibration as well as testing the model in field situations are recommended to improve the model's predictive value. (C) 1998 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Additional difficulties emerge when these tools are used to tackle complex decision making problems, of which eutrophication may be only one element. The Kis-Balaton Reservoir (in Hungary) is characterized by both features. The system, consisting of an Upper and Lower Reservoir was designed to reduce the phosphorus load bf agricultural nonpoint source origin to control the eutrophication of Lake Balaton. The original assumption in the late seventies was that macrophytes would play the decisive role in nutrient removal. Operational experiences and the ongoing unique monitoring program demonstrated that this assumption was not met: the Upper Reservoir quickly developed into a hypertrophic phytoplankton system. The P retention of the inundated reed area of the Lower Reservoir is not satisfactory and the large, intact reed stand of high nature conservation value started to die off due to the water level increase and algal-rich inflow. Thus, the need for revision of the original design (more than half of which was implemented) became evident. The paper summarizes the approach adopted, the project alternatives and criteria of evaluation used, details of phosphorus cycle models applied for the Upper Reservoir, and their transfer to the lower one to derive estimates for the future P retention. We also discuss dilemmas related to the estimation of the sorption isotherm of the soil/sediment system which appear in the models and which are crucial to 'extrapolate the future'. Finally, we outline the multi-criteria evaluation, the recommendations prepared for modifying the original design of the Lower Reservoir and the outcome of decision making. (C) 1998 IAWQ.

These major climate variables directly influence water quality in lakes by altering changes in flow and water temperature balance. High concentration of nutrient enrichment and expected variability of climate can lead to periodic phytoplankton blooms and an alteration of the neutral trophic balance. As a result, dissolved oxygen levels, with low concentrations, can fluctuate widely and algal productivity may reach critical levels. In this work, we will present: 1) recent results of GCMs climate scenarios downscaling project that was held at the University of Derby, UK.; 2) current/future comparative results of a new mathematical lake eutrophication model (LEM) in which output of phytoplankton growth rate and dissolved oxygen will be presented for Suwa lake in Japan as a case study. The model parameters were calibrated for the period of 1973-1983 and validated for the period of 1983-1993. Meteorologic, hydrologic, and lake water quality data of 1990 were selected for the assessment analysis. Statistical relationships between seven daily meteorological time series and three airflow indices were used as a means for downscaling daily outputs of Hadley Centre Climate Model (HadCM2SUL) to the station sub-grid scale.

The rapid (< 2 min), nonchemical, non-destructive analytical technique of near-infrared (700 - 2500 nm) spectroscopy combines applied spectroscopy and complex statistics. It has been used for the experimental analysis of various constituents and functions of soils since the 1960s, and applications for the analysis of sediments are currently being explored. For application of NIPS, sediment samples require little preparation, other than drying, and the samples are not subject to the manipulations of conventional analytical techniques. The spectral information recorded in a 2 min scan can be used to predict numerous constituents and parameters on the samples once appropriate calibration equations have been prepared from sets of samples analyzed by both NIRS and conventional analytical techniques. Constituents and properties of soil and/or sediment analyzed by NIPS technology include moisture, organic matter content, organic C, CO3=, N, P, S, K, Ca, Mg, clay content, humic acids, lignin, cellulose, metal oxides, heavy metals, aggregate size, and inferred past pH of lakes. Several areas are identified where further research is needed to prepare for the application of NIRS to the routine analysis of sediments. (C) 1998 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The eutrophication of the reservoir has been warned of since the 1980s; In this study, we discuss the relationship between hydraulic retention time and increase of phytoplankton, and the influence of wind-driven currents on the spatial distribution of phytoplankton based on the observations and numerical simulations. Observations were carried out from 1993 to 1995. The numerical simulation of hydraulics in the reservoir was carried out by applying an orthogonal curvilinear finite difference method. Judging from phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations, the water quality of the Asahi River Dam reservoir is usually eutrophic. However, high concentrations of chlorophyll-a are not always observed. The observed dependence of chlorophyll-a concentration on hydraulic retention time is reproduced fairly well by a simple relationship derived from the balance of phytoplankton based on the assumption of complete mixing. The hydraulic retention time is a limiting factor of an increase in phytoplankton in the Asahi River Dam reservoir. It takes a retention time of 2 weeks for the sufficient increase of phytoplankton. The results obtained by the simulations show that the wind-driven currents play an important role in the spatial distribution of phytoplankton. (C) 1998 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

With the use of this reservoir the WML is shifting towards the use of surface water (River Meuse) as primary source instead of ground water. This in view of the general Dutch policy pertaining to desiccation abatement and ground water pollution control. Because the River Meuse is known to be polluted with various numbers of constituents, predominantly nutrients, and on occasion with heavy metals and pesticides, the reservoir water quality model BEKWAAM has been constructed to be able to predict the water quality of this reservoir. The model simulates processes like heating, decay, sedimentation and eutrophication. The model was calibrated using data of two existing reservoirs in the Netherlands. The first simulation results of BEKWAAM indicate that significant high temperature differences are expected between river water and reservoir water, a point to be dealt with in the design of the inlet construction, to prevent stratification. Furthermore is was concluded that, providing thorough mixing takes place, the average depth of 20 m of this new reservoir induces sufficient light limitation. Finally the expected ammonium-nitrogen concentrations will not exceed a value of 0.05 mg NH4-N/l, despite the fact that average River Meuse concentration ranges from 0.1-1.7 mg NH4-N/l. This is caused by processes like nitrification and uptake by algae. (C) 1998 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The process of phosphorus removal involves the biochemical conversion from the dissolved to the particulate form (mainly phytoplankton) and the sedimentation of this particulate matter. The input variables are light, orthophosphate concentration, temperature of the inflowing water and discharge. The phytoplankton activity plays the most important role among the various processes. The maximization of orthophosphate elimination depends on adequate design, construction and operation of pre-reservoirs. A simple calculation procedure for the removal rates of orthophosphate-P has been developed. The efficiency of pre-reservoirs is limited, because the light intensity and the temperature during the winter period are low; on the other hand, discharge is often high in March and April (snowmelt). Although pre-reservoirs are an important tool for reservoir water-quality management, but they cannot substitute remedial action in the catchment area. (C) 1998 IAWQ.

In general, studies in controlling the dynamics of wastewater treatment processes have been poorly served in their access to such data. The Environmental Process Control Laboratory has been developed in order to rectify this limitation. The Laboratory is a mobile facility housing instrumentation for on-line respirometry and sensors for real-time monitoring of sludge blanket level and the concentrations of dissolved oxygen, suspended solids, ammonium-N, nitrite-N, total oxidised nitrogen. total organic carbon and orthophosphate-P concentrations. The Laboratory has been designed for deployment in a variety of contexts, but principally in the study of municipal and industrial wastewater treatment, protection of surface water quality, aquaculture, and groundwater contamination. Its purpose is to support the development of process models and. where appropriate, procedures of decision support and automatic control for these systems. Preliminary results from commissioning trials with the Laboratory at the Athens, Georgia, Water Pollution Control Facility Number 2 are reported. These expose some critical issues of signal pre-processing and the need to re-think a strategy for developing models in order to interpret the very large volumes of data generated by the Laboratory.

J	Azevedo, AS; Singh, P; Kanwar, RS; Ahuja, LR				Azevedo, AS; Singh, P; Kanwar, RS; Ahuja, LR			Simulating nitrogen management effects on subsurface drainage water quality	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article							MODEL	Increased level of NO3-N in the drinking water supplies is a major health concern these days. The long-term effects of actual nitrogen (N) fertilizer management practices are not well understood. The use of computer models allows the simulation of different N management practices on a long-term basis and their related effects on water quality. The RZWQM (Root Zone Water Quality Model, Version 3.0) was used to simulate the long-term (1978-1992) impacts of N management practices (single N applications at 50, 100, 150, and 200 kg per ha, and single and split N applications at 150 and 200 kg per ha) on NO3-N lasses with subsurface drain pools and crop yields under two tillage systems (moldboard plow (MB) and no till (NT)). Simulations conducted in this study were based an input parameters calibrated by Singh et al. (J. Environ. Qual., in press) for NO3-N transport to subsurface drains. However, calibration of some additional parameters was required in this study for long-term simulations. The long-term climatic data and soil properties data for these simulations were obtained from a water quality research site at Nashua, Iowa. The results of this study showed that increasing tares of N applications (50, 100, 150, and 200 kg per ha) resulted in increased NO3-N losses with subsurface drain flows and increased crop yields, However, increasing rates of NO3-N losses and crop yields were not linearly proportional with increasing rates of N applications. These trends were similar for both MB and NT treatments. Also, NO3-N losses and crop yields were not significantly different under single and split N applications at both 150 and 200 kg per ha levels of application. The single N application of 150 kg per ha was considered the best N application practice as the simulated NO3-N losses under this practice were reduced considerably (40.3% less in MB and 52.4% less in NT) when compared with the single N application of 200 kg per ha. At the same time, the reduction in crop yields at 150 kg per ha single N application was very small (5.9% reduction under MB and about 6.1% under NT) when compared with the crop yields at 200 kg per ha single N application. This study also shows that RZWQM can be used successfully in evaluating similar N management schemes for other geographic regions of the world by utilizing site-specific data on soils, geological features, crops, and climatic parameters such as rainfall and evaporation.

Light availability, water temperature, water velocity, and phosphorus, nitrogen and dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations are the environmental factors most often modelled to influence plant photosynthesis, respiration, washout and decay. The algorithms used to describe these relationships are reviewed, with emphasis placed on aquatic plants in freshwater ecosystems. The factors influencing photosynthesis in aquatic plants have been well-described with mechanistic or theoretical equations. However, research is needed to better describe mathematically the mechanisms involved in plant respiration, washout and decay. Due to the complexity of the interaction of environmental factors influencing plant growth, empirical relationships are unavoidable in productivity models and they can provide useful insight into ecosystem dynamics. However, the robustness of macrophyte simulation models is largely dependent on the rigour with which they are calibrated and verified against natural data representing a broad range of environmental conditions.

J	Olila, OG; Reddy, KR; Stites, DL				Olila, OG; Reddy, KR; Stites, DL			Influence of draining on soil phosphorus forms and distribution in a constructed wetland	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						phosphorus flux; water quality; eutrophication; soil drying	MICROBIAL BIOMASS; PHOSPHATE; SEDIMENTS; FLORIDA	Seasonal water-table fluctuations in wetlands can result in flooded and drained conditions in the surface soil. In constructed wetlands water level drawdown and soil drainage are used in management to consolidate detrital materials, accelerate soil build up, and provide easy access for other management operations. A greenhouse study was conducted using intact peat soil cores to evaluate the changes in bioavailable P and other fractions following draining and reflooding. Measurements of floodwater dissolved reactive P (DRP) indicated that draining and soil exposure could result in large P flux to the overlying water column. Phosphorus flux in soils drained for 6 weeks was 10-fold:higher (334 mg P m(-2) day(-1)) than in soils drained for 3 weeks (33 mg P m(-2) day(-1)). Soil exposure also resulted in an increase in bioavailable inorganic P (estimated by KCl extraction) at the expense of labile organic P pool. The KCl-P pool, which was initially less than 2% of total P (TP), increased to 3% and 13% of TP after 3 and 6 weeks draining, respectively. Results suggest that various soil P fractions, particularly those in newly accreted materials, were highly unstable and could be released in a more available form when newly accreted. soils undergo drying. Water level drawdown and reflooding could result in significant P release, a possible stimulation of algal blooms and other water quality problems. Therefore, soil characteristics and chemistry and their impact on water quality should be a major consideration when one adopts the flood-drain technique in wetland management.

J	Grayson, RB; Gippel, CJ; Finlayson, BL; Hart, BT				Grayson, RB; Gippel, CJ; Finlayson, BL; Hart, BT			Catchment-wide impacts on water quality: the use of 'snapshot' sampling during stable flow	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article							PHOSPHORUS; RIVER; LOADS	Water quality is usually monitored on a regular basis at only a small number of locations in a catchment, generally focused at the catchment outlet. This integrates the effect of all the point and non-point source processes occurring throughout the catchment. However, effective catchment management requires data which identify major sources and processes. As part of a wider study aimed at providing technical information for the development of integrated catchment management plans for a 5000 km(2) catchment in south eastern Australia, a 'snapshot' of water quality was undertaken during stable summer flow conditions. These low flow conditions exist for long periods so water quality at these flow levels is an important constraint on the health of in-stream biological communities. Over a 4 day period, a study of the low flow water quality characteristics throughout the Latrobe River catchment was undertaken. Sixty-four sites were chosen to enable a longitudinal profile of water quality to be established. All tributary junctions and sites along major tributaries, as well as all major industrial inputs were included. Samples were analysed for a range of parameters including total suspended solids concentration, pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, turbidity, Bow rate and water temperature. Filtered and unfiltered samples were taken from 27 sites along the main stream and tributary confluences for analysis of total N, NH4, oxidised N, total P and dissolved reactive P concentrations. The data are used to illustrate the utility of this sampling methodology for establishing specific sources and estimating non-point source loads of phosphorous, total suspended solids and total dissolved solids. The methodology enabled several new insights into system behaviour including quantification of unknown point discharges, identification of key in-stream sources of suspended material and the extent to which biological activity (phytoplankton growth) affects water quality. The costs and benefits of the sampling exercise are reviewed.

J	Liu, ZJ; Hallberg, GR; Malanson, GP				Liu, ZJ; Hallberg, GR; Malanson, GP			Structural equation modeling of dynamics of nitrate contamination in ground water	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						structural equation modeling; nitrate dynamics; ground water; non-point source pollution; agriculture	NITROGEN	Most research on the temporal aspect of nitrate pollution in water resources has focused on surface water. Comprehensive studies on the dynamics of nitrate in ground water are lacking, especially on a drainage basin scale and for relatively long periods of time. In this study, structural equation modeling is applied in investigating the influences of climate, hydrology, and nitrogen management in agricultural production on nitrate concentration in the Big Spring Basin, Iowa, over a 10-year period. The study shows that for given hydrogeological settings, nitrogen management practices and climate are the two most important factors that affect nitrate dynamics. The long-term trend of nitrate is closely related to the nitrogen input primarily determined by management practices. The potential effects of nitrogen management, however, are contingent on the variations of climate. The improvements in water quality (reduced nitrate concentration and loads) in relation to improved nitrogen management are often overshadowed by the impact of climate, especially in extremely dry or wet years. The variations of climate and hydrology have much greater impacts on the nitrate dynamics than the changes in nitrogen input. This study reveals significant seasonal variation in the relations between nitrate concentration and influencing factors, which is also closely related to the seasonal variation in climate. Assessment of management practices and resultant water quality should consider the impact of short- and long-term climate dynamics.

J	Smith, RA; Schwarz, GE; Alexander, RB				Smith, RA; Schwarz, GE; Alexander, RB			Regional interpretation of water-quality monitoring data	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							CONSTITUENT LOADS; MODEL	We describe a method for using spatially referenced regressions of contaminant transport on watershed attributes (SPARROW) in regional water-quality assessment. The method is designed to reduce the problems of data interpretation caused by sparse sampling, network bias, and basin heterogeneity. The regression equation relates measured transport rates in streams to spatially referenced descriptors of pollution sources and land-surface and stream-channel characteristics. Regression models of total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) transport are constructed for a region defined as the nontidal conterminous United States. Observed TN and TP transport rates are derived from water-quality records for 414 stations in the National Stream Quality Accounting Network. Nutrient sources identified in the equations include point sources, applied fertilizer, livestock waste, nonagricultural land, and atmospheric deposition (TN only). Surface characteristics found to be significant Predictors of land-water delivery include soil permeability, stream density, and temperature (TN only). Estimated instream decay coefficients for the two contaminants decrease monotonically with increasing stream size. TP transport is found to be significantly reduced by reservoir retention. Spatial referencing bf basin attributes in relation to the stream channel network greatly increases their statistical significance and model accuracy. The method is used to estimate the proportion of watersheds in the conterminous United States (i.e., hydrologic cataloging units) with outflow TP concentrations less than the criterion of 0.1 mg/L, and to classify cataloging units according to local TN yield (kg/km(2)/yr).

Treatments simulated direct spraying of ponds and bracketed amounts of drift judged able to reach the pond at 1/10 and 1/100 direct rates. The study was conducted in 12, 500-1 outdoor pool mesocosms. Pond water was pumped from an adjacent fingerling rearing pond. Water quality measurements were made prior to application and at 24 and 48 h after application. Commercial compounds tested and full rates (kg active ha(-1)) were fomasefen, aciflourfen and glyphosate (0.43); bentazon (0.57); imazaquin (0.14); fluazifop (0.10); clethodim (0.07); chlorimuron (0.0045); and propanil (0.45 kg). Ten of 1152 soybean herbicide means significantly differed and without pattern, Thus, these herbicides were judged not to affect pond plankton or associated water quality. Propanil at the full rate reduced primary productivity and morning oxygen to critical levels for 3 days. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

A severalfold increase of nutrient inputs and primary production since the beginning of the century has increased the area of anoxic bottoms, decreased the transparency of the water by 2.5-3 m, favored filamentous annual algae at the expense of coarse, perennial ones-like the important bladderwrack (Fucus vesiculosus)-changed the fish community from cod, salmon, pike and perch toward herring, sprat, bream, and roach. Because they are a major source of external nitrogen, a shift in current agricultural practices has to be made including: tree curtains to increase patchiness, biodiversity and natural pest control; catch crops along rivers; matching animal density and crop types to achieve optimal recycling of nutrients. So far, integrated land use, based on operative ecological-socioeconomic models, is the most powerful policy instrument for a sustainable agriculture.

J	Lee, JHW; Wong, PPS				Lee, JHW; Wong, PPS			Water quality model for mariculture management	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article							FISH CULTURE ZONE; DISSOLVED-OXYGEN	In marine fish farms located in subtropical eutrophic coastal waters, the dissolved oxygen (DO) level is often intimately related to algal growth dynamics. For effective mariculture management, a simple, tractable model that can elucidate the dependence of water quality on the important hydrographic, meteorological, and ecological parameters is required. A quasisteady water quality model is formulated herein to predict the long-term (seasonal) average concentrations of phytoplankton, organic nitrogen, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, and potential dissolved oxygen drop (PDOD) for fish farms located in weakly flushed tidal embayments. The fish culture zone is treated as a completely mixed nitrogen-limited system in which algal carbon is decomposed and nutrients regenerated continuously. The model assumes Monod-growth type relations for algal growth and nutrient uptake and incorporates algal settling and respiration, and tidal flushing. Using realistic estimates of light and temperature limiting factors and kinetic rate coefficients, model predictions of seasonally averaged water quality and qualitative features are well supported by field data.

J	Dillon, PJ; Molot, LA				Dillon, PJ; Molot, LA			Effect of landscape form on export of dissolved organic carbon, iron, and phosphorus from forested stream catchments	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							CENTRAL ONTARIO LAKES; HUMIC SUBSTANCES; ACIDIFIED LAKES; MASS-BALANCE; BOG LAKE; MATTER; WATERSHEDS; NITROGEN; RETENTION; TRANSPORT	Predicting the effects of climate change and atmospheric deposition on water quality requires predicting the effects of landscape form on export of substances downstream. In this paper, we present dissolved organic carbon (DOG), total phosphorus (TP), and iron (Fe) export data (1980-1992) for 20 relatively undisturbed, forested catchments draining into seven lakes in central Ontario and develop regression models of chemical export as functions of landscape composition. The extent of wetlands was correlated with export of DOC and TP; the proportion of the catchment covered by peatlands accounted for 78% of the variance in a regression model of long-term average DOC export and 76% of the variance in a model of color ''export.'' Peatland coverage and Fe export together explained 76% of the variance in a long-term average TP export model, which is consistent with published experimental evidence that Fe facilitates P complexation with DOC in surface waters. The long-term average Fe export model was not significant when all 20 catchments were included. However, Fe export from the 14 catchments with thin tills was a function only of peatland coverage (R-2 = 0.71), suggesting that Fe export is dependent to a large extent upon either the export of organic material or the reducing conditions. The long-term export models worked well When export of a substance was dominated by peatlands but was not very sensitive to the influence of mineral soils. The long-term average TP/DOC ratio was remarkably constant among most whole-lake catchments, ranging from 1.4 to 2.0 mg P/g C, the exception being the catchment of anthropogenically acidified Plastic Lake with a ratio of 0.8. Fe export to Plastic lake was also enriched relative to TP export compared with the other lakes. Therefore TP export to Plastic Lake may be limited by some mechanism related to acidification.

Ulva biomass density and nitrogen concentration in Ulva tissue have been added to the set of state variables previously considered, that is to phytoplankton and zooplankton densities, concentrations of nutrients in water, detritus and dissolved oxygen. The model shows that Ulva succeeds in the competition with the phytoplanktonic community in the shallower areas, where water temperature and irradiance levels reaching the bottom are sufficient to sustain growth. Long term evolutions of Ulva colonies, under different scenarios of forcing functions, show that adverse meteoclimatic conditions can be more effective in reducing Ulva biomass than a consistent decrease in the loads of Nitrogen.

J	Flindt, MR; Kamp-Nielsen, L				Flindt, MR; Kamp-Nielsen, L			Modelling of an estuarine eutrophication gradient	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article								Roskilde Fjord represents an estuarine eutrophication gradient with annual average salinities varying from 11 to 18 degrees C and average summer chlorophyll concentrations ranging from 3 to 25 mg m(-3). A PC based one-layer and one-dimensional hydrodynamic model and a transport/dispersion model served as the basis for a eutrophication process model with 12 state variables. Water levels and salinities were well predicted. Objective function yielded values of 0.13 for dissolved oxygen, 3.63 for chlorophyll, 8.44 for inorganic nitrogen and 3.68 for phosphate for the water quality model during a design period covering the spring 1985. Comparisons with mass balances calculated by means of a simple box model indicated the necessity of including a resuspension and sediment transport description. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Dahlgren, RA; Singer, MJ; Huang, X				Dahlgren, RA; Singer, MJ; Huang, X			Oak tree and grazing impacts on soil properties and nutrients in a California oak woodland	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						grazing; nutrient cycling; oak woodlands; organic matter; soil properties; rangeland	NITROGEN MINERALIZATION; SAVANNA TREES; ENVIRONMENTS; AVAILABILITY; DYNAMICS; PLANT; PRODUCTIVITY; REGENERATION; VARIABILITY; ECOSYSTEMS	There is great interest in understanding how rangeland management practices affect the long-term sustainability of California oak woodland ecosystems through their influence on nutrient cycling. This study examines the effects of oak trees and low to moderate intensity grazing on soil properties and nutrient pools in a blue oak (Quercus douglasii H.&A.) woodland in the Sierra Nevada foothills of northern California. Four combinations of vegetation and management were investigated: oak with grazing, oak without grazing, open grasslands with grazing, and open grasslands without grazing. Results indicate that oak trees create islands of enhanced fertility through organic matter incorporation and nutrient cycling. Compared to adjacent grasslands, soils beneath the oak canopy have a lower bulk density, higher pH, and greater concentrations of organic carbon, nitrogen, total and available P, and exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K, especially in the upper soil horizons (0-35 cm). In contrast, the light grazing utilized at this site had minimal effects on soil properties which included an increase in the bulk density of the surface horizon and an increase in available P throughout the entire soil profile. While low to moderate intensity grazing has little effect at this study site, there could be much larger impacts under the more intensive grazing practices utilized on many rangelands. The lack of oak regeneration and oak tree removal to enhance forage production may eventually lead to large losses of nutrients and soil fertility from these ecosystems. Results of this study have important implications for predicting how management practices may potentially affect oak regeneration, water quality, and ecosystem sustainability.

J	D'Arcy, P; Carignan, R				D'Arcy, P; Carignan, R			Influence of catchment topography on water chemistry in southeastern Quebec Shield lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article							NORTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES; DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; HUMIC SUBSTANCES; FOREST SOILS; NEW-YORK; PHOSPHORUS; EXPORT; ADIRONDACK; TRANSPORT; GEOLOGY	For 30 Canadian Shield lakes of southeastern Quebec, catchment slope and lake morphometry account for 50-70% of the variability of chlorophyll a (Chi a), dissolved organic carbon (DOG), total phosphorus (TP), NO3-, and NH4+. Dissolved organic carbon, TP, Chi a, Ca, and Mg are negatively related to catchment slope, whereas NO3- and NH4+ increase with increasing slope. Concentrations of more conservative constituents (SO42-, Na, K) increase with decreasing elevation as a result of higher evapotranspiration and lower precipitation at low elevations. Catchment variables (slope, drainage area, percent wetlands) are as good predictors of Chi a (r(2)= 0.7) as are water chemistry variables (TP, Ca, Mg, and pH). Dominant vegetation (deciduous vs. coniferous) has little or no influence on lake water chemistry. Hydrogeological data for the Canadian Shield suggest that, during periods of high runoff, the development of waterlogged areas and the importance of overland flow on saturated soils are inversely proportional to catchment slope. We propose that the strong influence of catchment slope on water quality is due to slope-dependent seasonal waterlogging, which determines the fate (retention or export to surface waters) of dissolved substances produced within and moving through the forest floor.

J	Boggess, WG; Johns, G; Meline, C				Boggess, WG; Johns, G; Meline, C			Economic impacts of water quality programs in the Lake Okeechobee Watershed of Florida	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						waste management; economic impact; phosphorus; dairy runoff		For the past 20 yr, Florida has attempted to control phosphorus runoff from dairy manure into Lake Okeechobee. The elevated phosphorus levels in runoff water entering the lake has resulted in eutrophic conditions that threaten lake uses, including recreational and municipal water supplies. The lake watershed is also an important milkshed for southeastern Florida. In the 1980s, three water quality programs were implemented by Florida state agencies in the bake Okeechobee basin in order to reduce phosphorus loads into the lake. This paper presents estimates of the economic impacts of the three water quality programs on the economy of Okeechobee County and the regional area during the period 1987 to 1993. Direct impacts of the water quality program include a 26% reduction in dairy cows and a 17% reduction in milk production in the affected area. Dairies that remained in production spent an average $1.14/cwt (net of approximately 30% cost share) on both mandatory and optional components. This additional private cost was more than offset by the 13% mean increase in milk production that was experienced as a result of the investments. The total economic impacts of the water quality programs included a 4% ($18 million) decline in income and a 4% (492 full-time equivalents) decline in jobs.

J	Herath, G				Herath, G			Freshwater algal blooms and their control: Comparison of the European and Australian experience	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						algal blooms; phosphorus; tradeable permits; sewage plants	LAKE; CYANOBACTERIA; INJURY; WATER; MODEL	Freshwater algal blooms have become an important water quality problem in Europe and Australia. Countries such as Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Italy and The Netherlands have experienced severe algal blooms (Anabaena, Microcystis etc.). These have caused considerable losses in recreation opportunities, expenses to provide alternative water supplies and deaths among livestock. Most of the phosphorus in European waters derives from point sources such as sewage plants, livestock industries and detergents. In Australia non-point sources from agriculture and other sources are more important. The emphasis in controlling algal blooms in Europe as well as in Australia is on phosphorus removal in wastewater by upgrading sewage plants and installing new sewage processing facilities. In Europe control of detergent phosphorus has also received emphasis but in Australia detergent problems are largely ignored. The attention to the use of economic measures to control phosphorus is inadequate in both Europe and Australia, but Europe is still ahead of Australia. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.

J	Tappin, AD; Burton, JD; Millward, GE; Statham, PJ				Tappin, AD; Burton, JD; Millward, GE; Statham, PJ			A numerical transport model for predicting the distributions of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn in the southern North Sea: the sensitivity of model results to the uncertainties in the magnitudes of metal inputs	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						models; transport; water quality; trace metals; North Sea	TRACE-METALS; PARTICULATE METALS; ESTUARINE WATERS; MARINE; FLUXES; ORGANOCHLORINES; PHYTOPLANKTON; DEPOSITION; PARTICLES; BEHAVIOR	A new transport model for metals (named NOSTRADAMUS) has been developed to predict concentrations and distributions of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn in the southern North Sea. NOSTRADAMUS is comprised of components for water, inorganic and organic suspended particulate matter transport; a primary production module contributes to the latter component. Metal exchange between dissolved (water) and total suspended particulate matter (inorganic + organic) phases is driven by distribution coefficients. Transport is based on an existent 2-D vertically integrated model, incorporating a 35 X 35 km grid. NOSTRADAMUS is largely driven by data obtained during the Natural Environment Research Council North Sea Project (NERC NSP). The sensitivity of model predictions to uncertainties in the magnitudes of metal inputs has been tested. Results are reported far a winter period (January 1989) when plankton production was low. Simulated ranges in concentrations in regions influenced by the largest inflows, i.e. the NE English coast and the Southern Eight, are similar to the ranges in the errors of the concentrations estimated at the northern and southern open sea boundaries of the model. Inclusion of uncertainties with respect to atmospheric (up to +/- 54%) and riverine (+/- 30%) inputs makes little difference to the calculated concentrations of both dissolved and particulate fractions within the southern North Sea. When all the errors associated with the inputs are included there is good agreement between computed and observed concentrations, and that for dissolved and particulate Cd, Cu and Zn, and dissolved Ni and Pb, many of the observations fall within, or are close to, the range of values generated by the model. For particulate Pb, model simulations predict concentrations of the right order, but do not reproduce the large scatter in actual concentrations, with simulated concentrations showing a bias towards lower values compared to those observed. A factor which could have contributed to observed concentrations, and which is not included in the model, is considered to be a substantial benthic input of dissolved lead during this winter period, coupled to a rapid and extensive scavenging of the dissolved lead to particles. Significant reductions in riverine and aeolian inputs of total Cd and Cu of 70% and 50%, respectively, consistent with aims of North Sea Conferences, are predicted to lead to minor decreases (similar to 10%) in water column concentrations of dissolved and particulate Cd and Cu, except near river sources, where maximum reductions of similar to 30-40% may occur.

The contribution of subsurface drainage water, surface runoff and stream bank and bed erosion to catchment SS and PP losses was estimated using three different strategies: 1) Simultaneous and comparative monitoring of subsurface water. 2) A mass-balance and budget approach dividing the Gelbaek catchment into two subcatchments. 3) Application of the fingerprinting technique to single storm events. Subsurface drainage water proved to be a significant SS and PP source. Subsurface drainage water from half of the catchment area accounted for 9.8-15% of the total annual SS loss from the Gelbaek catchment and 9.6-18.2% of the annual PP loss. The mass-balance and budget approach showed stream bank and bed erosion to be the major source of SS and PP in this channelized and highly managed lowland stream. These findings were consistent with the fact that the annual loss of SS and PP from an upper culverted stream sub-catchment was significantly lower than that estimated from a mass-balance for a lower sub-catchment with an open stream channel. Comparison of the tracer content (e.g. Cs-137) of SS collected during four storm events with that of topsoil and subsoil using a simple mixing model revealed subsoil to be a major source of SS.

Though the direct measurement of sedimentation also presents some methodological and logistic difficulties, such as resuspension of material from the bottom, grazing, etc., this does not justify the very scarce attention paid to this kind of determination. This paper reports the sedimentation fluxes of 39 lakes, in different parts of the world, having different limnological and trophic characteristics (0.4 < TP < 369 mu g L-1; 0.5 < chlorophyll a <50 mg m(-3)). The fluxes of PM, C, N and P show a log-log relationship (r approximate to 0.6, p less than or equal to 0.05) with the common trophic variables (Secchi disk, total phosphorus, chlorophyll and primary production), independently of the morphometric characteristic of lakes. Hence sedimentation seems not to be an intrinsic property of the environment but is related to the trophic state of the system. The results achieved tend to confirm that the nature of sedimenting seston is generally autochthonous, even though the poor correlation between PM and the same trophic variables suggests that PM is more influenced by allochthonous material.

As part of the modeling initiative, the WASPS program was modified to simulate attached algae. Simulation results showed that a 48% reduction of total phosphorus (TP) load would be required to achieve the existing in-stream TP annual average standard of 0.10 mg-P/L. While this reduction decreased the predicted areal extent of water quality degradation, stream reaches immediately downstream of agricultural loading still experienced high a]gal populations and large concomitant diel dissolved oxygen fluctuations due to the fact that phosphorus is not rate limiting for algae growth at concentrations near 0.10 mg-P/L. A simulated 97% reduction of TP load was required to decrease significantly the population of attached algae, while only a 70% reduction of total non-point-source loading (both nitrogen and phosphorus) achieved similar results.

This field study assesses the input of fertilizer N, applied to sugarcane fields, to forested wetlands. The potential use of natural abundance variations in N-15/N-14 ratios for identification and tracing surface water N sources (NH4+- and NO3--N) was evaluated. Runoff and surface water samples were collected from sugarcane fields and bordering forested wetlands (6 stations) over a 16 month period and analyzed for NH4+-N, NO3--N, and associated NH4+-delta(15)N and NO3--delta(15)N ratios. Fertilizer N draining into adjacent forested wetland was estimated to be only a small fraction of the amount applied. Concentrations of NH4+- and NO3--N in the collected water samples were low and ranged from 0.02 to 1.79 mg L-1. Isotopic analysis revealed NH4+-delta(15)N and NO3--delta(15)N means were distinctive and may have the potential to be used as tracers of N contamination. The mean NH4+-delta(15)N value was +18.6 +/- 7.1 parts per thousand and the NO3--delta(15)N mean was +8.3 +/- 3.1 parts per thousand. Anomalously high NO3--delta(15)N values (> 30 parts per thousand) were attributed to denitrification.

J	Nolan, BT; Ruddy, BC; Hitt, KJ; Helsel, DR				Nolan, BT; Ruddy, BC; Hitt, KJ; Helsel, DR			Risk of nitrate in groundwaters of the United States - A national perspective	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							COASTAL-PLAIN; LONG-ISLAND	Nitrate contamination of groundwater occurs in predictable patterns, based on findings of the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program. The NAWQA Program was begun in 1991 to describe the quality of the Nation's water resources, using nationally consistent methods. Variables affecting nitrate concentration in groundwater were grouped as ''input'' factors (population density and the amount of nitrogen contributed by fertilizer, manure, and atmospheric sources) and ''aquifer vulnerability'' factors (soil drainage characteristic and the ratio of woodland acres to cropland acres in agricultural areas) and compiled in a national map that shows patterns of risk for nitrate contamination of groundwater. Areas with high nitrogen input, well-drained soils, and low woodland to cropland ratio have the highest potential for contamination of shallow groundwater by nitrate. Groundwater nitrate data collected through 1992 from wells less than 100 ft deep generally verified the risk patterns shown on the national map. Median nitrate concentration was 0.2 mg/L in wells representing the low-risk group, and the maximum contaminant level (MCL) was exceeded in 3% of the wells. In contrast, median nitrate concentration was 4.8 mg/L in wells representing the high-risk group, and the MCL was exceeded in 25% of the wells.

J	Kohn, RA; Dou, Z; Ferguson, JD; Boston, RC				Kohn, RA; Dou, Z; Ferguson, JD; Boston, RC			A sensitivity analysis of nitrogen losses from dairy farms	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						nitrogen pollution; water quality; sustainable agriculture; mathematical modelling	NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT; CORN; AGRICULTURE; SYSTEMS; IMPACT; YIELD	International attention has focused on agricultural production systems as non-point sources of pollution affecting the quality of streams, estuaries and ground water resources. The objective of the current study was to develop a model of nitrogen management on the dairy farm, and to perform sensitivity analyses in order to determine the relative importance of manipulating herd nutrition, manure management and crop selection in reducing nitrogen (N) losses from the farm. The importance of the method of N input to the farm (purchased feed, legume fixation, inorganic fertilizer, imported manure) was investigated, and the potential to reduce N losses from dairy farms was evaluated. Nitrogen balance equations were derived, and related efficiency coefficients were set to reference values representing common management practices. Total farm N efficiency (animal product N per N input), and N losses per product N were determined for different situations by solving the set of simultaneous equations. Improvements in animal diet and management that increase the conversion of feed N to animal product by 50% would increase total farm N efficiency by 48% and reduce N losses per product by 36 to 40%. In contrast, reducing losses from manure collection, storage and application to improve the percentage of manure N that becomes available in soil by 100% would only improve total farm N efficiency by 13% and reduce total N losses by 14%. Selecting crops and management that can use soil nutrients 50% more efficiently would improve total farm efficiency by up to 59% and reduce N losses by up to 41% depending on the predominant nitrogen sources to the farm. Legume production would reduce N losses per product compared with non-legumes. There was more than a five fold difference in N losses per animal product N between the most extreme scenarios suggesting considerable opportunity to reduce N losses from dairy farms.

J	Qian, SS				Qian, SS			An illustration of model structure identification	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						everglades; Kalman filter; maximum likelihood estimator; modeling/statistics; phosphorus; uncertainty analysis; water quality; wetlands	PHOSPHORUS; EVERGLADES; BEHAVIOR; WETLANDS; SYSTEMS	The purpose of this article is to discuss the importance of uncertainty analysis in water quality modeling, with an emphasis on the identification of the correct model specification. A wetland phosphorus retention model is used as an example to illustrate the procedure of using a filtering technique for model structure identification. Model structure identification is typically done through model parameter estimation. However, due to many sources of error in both model parameterization and observed variables and data, error-in-variable is often a problem. Therefore, it is not appropriate to use the least squares method for parameter estimation. Two alternative methods for parameter estimation are presented. The first method is the maximum likelihood estimator, which assumes independence of the observed response variable values. In anticipating the possible violation of the independence assumption, a second method, which coupled a maximum likelihood estimator and Kalman filter model, was presented. Furthermore, a Monte Carlo simulation algorithm is presented as a preliminary method for judging whether the model structure is appropriate or not.

Most of the lakes are deep (similar to 20 to >200 m), with small surface area to volume ratios and have small watersheds with no surface outflow. Basin walls are steep and comprised of unconsolidated glacial sediments that are sparsely vegetated and highly erodible. The lakes are typically oligotrophic from phosphorus limitation but have a relatively high dissolved inorganic nitrogen content (similar to 100-1000 mu g N/l). Regulatory concerns that included drinking water degradation and long term eutrophication resulted in a stipulation agreement between the aquaculture company and the state. A part of this agreement required the company to terminate aquaculture and demonstrate the ability of TCS to recover from the effects of aquaculture to four target restoration goals within 2.5 years. With the availability of an extensive data base from several years of field work during aquaculture, this provided an opportunity to utilize two commercially available water quality models for predicting changes in surface and whole-lake phosphorus during a restoration in which the entire phosphorus waste load was essentially eliminated. BATHTUB, an empirical eutrophication model. was used to predict the mean growing season surface total phosphorus, a target restoration parameter. PHOSMOD, a mechanistic phosphorus budget model, was used to predict total phosphorus in the water column. Both models encountered application problems in TCS. The most important factors affecting the application of these models involved the waste load characteristics, DO depletion, sediment P release and a high basin sedimentation rate. Future mine pit lake modeling efforts should consider these factors before applying any water quality model for similar purposes. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Mac Nally, R; Hart, BT				Mac Nally, R; Hart, BT			Use of CUSUM methods for water-quality monitoring in storages	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							CONTROL CHARTS; DISTRIBUTIONS; SCHEMES	There is a variety of methods used for monitoring environmental variables for the detection of 'unacceptable' levels, such as for compliance conditions. In this paper, we consider the utility of a statistical technique used for many years in industrial process control-cumulative sum or CUSUM-in monitoring water-quality trends within large storages such as reservoirs. By using simulations and realistic values for total phosphorus concentrations, we show the sensitivity of CUSUM schemes to six kinds of trends in quality through time. The six trends are as follows: (a) on target; (b) off target; (c) midpoint (halfway between a and b); (d) ramping change (increasing from a to b over 5 years); (e) weakly autocorrelated series; and (f) strongly autocorrelated series. We study the performance of the CUSUM method in relation to 'average run lengths' (ARLs) before a warning is triggered and the probabilities of spurious warnings (type-I statistical errors) or failing to detect changes in water quality that are deemed to be unsatisfactory. We conclude that in reasonably buffered systems, such as large storages, the CUSUM technique may be a potentially important way of monitoring water quality that also permits rapid response to serious increases in nutrient concentrations.

J	Kao, JJ; Tsai, CH				Kao, JJ; Tsai, CH			Multiobjective zone TP reduction analyses for an off-stream reservoir	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE			English	Article							MANAGEMENT; POLLUTION	Multiobjective linear programming (MOLP) models are developed to evaluate total phosphorus (TP) load reduction strategies for an off-stream reservoir. Cost, water quality, and equity are the three major objectives considered. Watershed-based, subwatershed-based, and equal-transport-path-length-based strategies are the three zone control strategies analyzed and compared. The agricultural nonpoint-source pollution (AGNSP) model is used to simulate the non-point-source pollution loads on the reservoir, A twostep modeling procedure is applied to verify sediment mass balance and water quality of storm runoff. MOLP models are established based on the simulation results for the three control strategies and are solved using the ADBASE package to generate the noninferior solution sets of the models. The subwatershed-based control strategy is observed to be the most cost-effective one based on results obtained for TP concentration between 13 and 20 ppb, With respect to equity, however, the watershed-based control strategy is superior to the others. The proposed multiobjective analyses are intended to improve the comparison and evaluation of nonpoint source pollution control strategies.

Three tillage practices, no till (NT), reduced tillage (RT), and conventional tillage (CT), with residue (R) and without residue (NR), were studied. In Experiment 1, 30 min, 23.6 mm simulated rainfalls were applied at 0, 4, 60, 140 and 180 h. Before the 4 h simulated rainfall, granular calcium ammonium nitrate fertilizer was applied to the soil surface at a rate of 180 kg-N/ha. In Experiment II, using the same columns ten months later 30 min, 32.3 mm of simulated rainfall were applied at 6, 170, 312 and 412 h, after an initial soaking of the soil (0 h). Fertilizer was applied after 125 h, at the same rate as ii Experiment I, but in I L (14.4 mm) of solution. NO3--N leaching and moisture content were measured at 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 m depths. Drainage water flow only occurred in Experiment II. In Experiment I, higher nitrate nitrogen concentrations ([NO3--N]), occurred initially at 0.1 and 0.2 m depths in RT and CT, but less leached to lower soil depths. In the end, more NO3--N leached to 0.6 m depth in the NT treatment. In Experiment II, NO3--N leached to deeper layers (below 0.4 m) in RD and CT treatments. Conventional tillage exhibited the lowest drainage rates. Tillage and residue effects were statistically significant at the early stages of Experiment I (at 4 h and earlier), and at the later stages in Experiment II, at the 0.1 m depth (P < 0.05). Maximum soil MO3--N concentration occurred at 0.4 m depth in all treatments.

Results of sensitivity analyses are presented and model predictions are compared with results from VS2DNT a more complex, two-dimensional model. The nitrogen transport component is based on an explicit solution to the advective-dispersive-reactive (ADR) equation. Nitrate-nitrogen is the main N pool considered. Functional relationships are used to quantify rainfall deposition, fertilizer dissolution, net mineralization, denitrification, plant uptake, and surface runoff and subsurface drainage losses. A sensitivity analysis showed DRAINMOD-N predictions are most sensitive to the standard rate coefficients for denitrification and mineralization and nitrogen content in rainfall. Simulated daily water table depths were within 0.121 m, cumulative subsurface drainage rates were within 0.016 m, and cumulative surface runoff rates were within 0.003 m, of those predicted by VS2DNT for a 250-day period. DRAINMOD-N predictions for NO3-N losses in subsurface drainage water only differed from VS2DNT predictions by less than 2.6 kg ha(-1). DRAINMOD-N predictions for denitrification were within 8%, for plant uptake were within 15%, and for net mineralization were within 26%, of those simulated by VS2DNT.

The site consisted of six plots drained by subsurface drain tubes 1.25 m deep and 23 m apart. Each plot was instrumented to measure water table depth, subsurface drainage, surface runoff and subirrigation rates. There were two replications of three water management treatments: conventional drainage, controlled drainage and subirrigation. Crops were winter wheat followed by soybean. Results showed the model did a good job in describing the hydrology of the site. On average the predicted daily water table depths were within 0.13 m of observed during the 14-month study period. Differences between predicted and observed cumulative subsurface drainage and surface runoff volumes were less than 0.10 and 0.09 m, respectively, for all treatments. Predictions for the movement and fate of nitrogen were also in good agreement with measured results. Simulated nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) losses in subsurface drainage water were within 1.5 kg/ha of the observed values for the 14-month period. Differences between simulated and observed total NO3-N losses (subsurface drainage plus surface runoff) were within 3.0 kg/ha. Results of this study indicated DRAINMOD-N could be used to simulate nitrogen losses in poorly drained soils with artificial drainage. The model, however needs to be tested for longer periods of time and under different climatic conditions and soil types, before it can be recommended for general use.

Much of the region has a humid, warm temperate climate with little seasonality in precipitation but strong seasonality in runoff owing to high rates of summer evapotranspiration. The climate of southern Florida and eastern Mexico is subtropical with a distinct summer wet season and winter dry season. Regional climate models suggest that climate change resulting from a doubling of the pre-industrial levels of atmospheric CO2 may increase annual air temperatures by 3-4 degrees C. Changes in precipitation are highly uncertain, but the most probable scenario shows higher levels over all but the northern, interior portions of the region, with increases primarily occurring in summer and occurring as more intense or clustered storms. Despite the increases in precipitation, runoff is likely to decline over much of the region owing to increases in evapotranspiration exceeding increases in precipitation. Only in Florida and the Gulf Coast areas of the US and Mexico are precipitation increases likely to exceed evapotranspiration increases, producing an increase in runoff. However, increases in storm intensity and clustering are likely to result in more extreme hydrographs, with larger peaks in flow but lower baseflows and longer periods of drought. The ecological effects of climate change on freshwaters of the region include: (1) a general increase in rates of primary production, organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling as a result of higher temperatures and longer growing seasons: (2) reduction in habitat for cool water species, particularly fish and macroinvertebrates in Appalachian streams; (3) reduction in water quality and in suitable habitat in summer owing to lower baseflows and intensification of the temperature-dissolved oxygen squeeze in many rivers and reservoirs; (4) reduction in organic matter storage and loss of organisms during more intense flushing events in some streams and wetlands; (5) shorter periods of inundation of riparian wetlands and greater drying of wetland soils, particularly in northern and inland areas; (6) expansion of subtropical species northwards, including several non-native nuisance species currently confined to southern Florida; (7) expansion of wetlands in Florida and coastal Mexico, but increase in eutrophication of Florida lakes as a result of greater runoff from urban and agricultural areas; and (8) changes in the flushing rate of estuaries that would alter their salinity regimes, stratification and water quality as well as influence productivity in the Gulf of Mexico. Many of the expected climate change effects will exacerbate current anthropogenic stresses on the region's freshwater systems, including increasing demands for water, increasing waste heat loadings and land use changes that alter the quantity and quality of runoff to streams and reservoirs. Research is needed especially in several critical areas: long-term monitoring of key hydrological, chemical and biological properties (particularly water balances in small, forested catchments and temperature-sensitive species); experimental studies of the effects of warming on organisms and ecosystem processes under realistic conditions (e.g. in situ heating experiments): studies of the effects of natural hydrological variation on biological communities; and assessment of the effects of water management activities on organisms and ecosystem processes, including development and testing of management and restoration strategies designed to counteract changes in climate.

Juvenile and adult brook trout were introduced following the first chemical treatment and were stocked annually thereafter from 1985 to 1989. In response to the combined chemical and biological manipulation, phytoplankton abundance increased whereas production per unit of biomass decreased. We attribute the increase in phytoplankton abundance and the reduction in biomass turnover rates to a decrease in zooplankton grazing. Zooplankton densities and estimated community grazing rates were lower during the posttreatment period despite a shift from small-bodied taxa (Diaptomus minutus, Bosmina longirostris) to a more diverse assemblage that included four species of daphnids. We attribute reductions in zooplankton abundance to planktivory of introduced brook trout. The changes we observed in phytoplankton and zooplankton species composition were consistent with trends observed during whole-lake acidification experiments, but functional responses in our experiment (decreased zooplankton abundance, increased phytoplankton abundance) were not.

J	George, DG				George, DG			The airborne remote sensing of phytoplankton chlorophyll in the lakes and tarns of the English Lake District	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							SUSPENDED SEDIMENT; THEMATIC MAPPER; WATER-QUALITY	The results of two Daedalus Airborne Thematic Mapper surveys of phytoplankton chlorophyll in six large lakes and ten small tarns are described. The water bodies surveyed covered a range of trophic states, but were all 'Case 1' waters whose optical properties were primarily determined by the concentration of phytoplankton in suspension. The surveys were supported by in situ measurements of phytoplankton chlorophyll and radiometric measurements of the upwelling radiance at selected sites. Statistical analyses showed that radiance measurements in ATM Band 3 (520-600 nm) provided the best estimates of phytoplankton chlorophyll in the more productive waters (correlation coefficient r = 0.97). In waters where the measured concentration of chlorophyll was less than 10 mu g l(-1), the most effective pigment retrieval algorithm (r = 0.91) was that based on the ratio of the radiances in ATM Band 3 and ATM Band 2 (450-520 nm). The two algorithms were then used to estimate the average concentration of phytoplankton in each water body and to produce maps of the spatial distribution of chlorophyll in the larger lakes. Chlorophyll concentrations could be predicted with an overall accuracy of +/-3 mu g l(-1) (r = 0.98), and spatial distribution maps produced with contour intervals of 2-10 mu g l(-1).

J	Aelion, CM; Shaw, JN; Wahl, M				Aelion, CM; Shaw, JN; Wahl, M			Impact of suburbanization on ground water quality and denitrification in coastal aquifer sediments	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						denitrification; nitrate contamination; coastal development; ground water quality; microbial degradation	SALT-MARSH ECOSYSTEM; MARINE SEDIMENT; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; ACETYLENE INHIBITION; NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT; FRESH-WATER; INPUTS; BIODEGRADATION; NITRATE; SOIL	The South Carolina coastal plain is currently facing rapid population growth and suburbanization. Suburbanization brings the potential for surface- and ground water contamination from the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers, which can render water toxic to humans and fish, and lead to eutrophication. Additionally, nitrate is highly mobile in sediments and poses the potential for contamination of receiving waters, downstream areas, and ground water. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the differences in ground water quality and sediment denitrification rates at two sites, an undeveloped forested area (Oyster Creek, North Inlet, SC) and an area which has been developed for residential and commercial use (Dog Creek, Murrells Inlet, SC). Ground water monitoring wells were installed at the two sites at several sampling depths ranging from 0.6 m to 5 m. Ground water samples were collected every 4-8 weeks for 16 months, and analyzed in the field for pH, conductivity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen (DO), and in the laboratory for nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, phosphate and total organic carbon (TOC). Additionally, sediment samples were collected from two locations in both creek bottoms from approximately 1.0 m depth, and microbial denitrification was estimated using the acetylene block technique by measuring the accumulation of nitrous oxide (N2O). Ground water at both sites was microaerophilic, ranging from 0.4 to 1 mg O-2/l. Ammonia and TOC concentrations were significantly higher at the forested site due to higher inputs of organic matter in the form of leafy vegetation, whereas nitrate concentrations were significantly higher at the suburban site. Sediments from both sites were able to rapidly convert NO3 to N2O with progressive depletion of NO3 in extracted sediments. Both the rate of N2O production and the conversion efficiencies were found to increase with increasing nitrate concentrations from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/g. The smallest nitrate concentration had the lowest N2O production and NO3 conversion efficiency. However, for the intermediate treatment (0.25 mg/g) conversion efficiencies were variable. In addition to potential increased NO3 inputs, increased drainage for development present at suburban sites may cause aeration of near channel soils and favor the oxidized, more mobile form of nitrogen. Because the suburban site has steeper hydraulic gradients, and nitrate is highly mobile, there is potential for both nitrate transport to the estuary and accumulation in the shallow water-table aquifer at the suburban site. However, it appears that the microbial communities from both sites were well adapted to denitrifying inputs of nitrate in the concentration ranges tested. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

Basin total nitrogen and phosphorus input estimates were calculated for atmospheric deposition (which averaged 27 percent of total nitrogen inputs and 22 percent of total phosphorus inputs); crop fertilizer (27 and 25 percent); animal-waste (22 and 50 percent, respectively); point sources (3 percent each of total nitrogen and total phosphorus inputs); and biological nitrogen fixation (21 percent of total nitrogen inputs). Highest in-stream nitrogen and phosphorus loads were measured in predominantly agricultural drainage areas. Intermediate loads were observed in mixed agricultural/urban drainage areas; the lowest loads were measured in mixed agricultural/forested drainage areas. The difference between the sum of the nutrient input categories and the sum of the in-stream nutrient loads and crop-harvest nutrient removal was assigned to a residual category for the basin. The residual category averaged 51 percent of total nitrogen inputs and 54 percent of total phosphorus inputs.

Flow-weighted mean concentrations of total N, nitrate, and dissolved silicate in watershed discharges were correlated with the proportion of cropland in the watershed. In contrast, concentrations of P species did not correlate with cropland. Organic P and C correlated with the concentration of suspended particles, which differed among watersheds. Thus, the ratio of N:P:Si in discharges differed greatly among watersheds, potentially affecting N, P or Si limitation of phytoplankton growth in the receiving waters. Simple regression models of N discharge versus the percentage of cropland suggest that croplands discharge 29-42 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and other lands discharge 1.2-5.8 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). We estimated net anthropogenic input of N to croplands and other lands using county level data on agriculture and N deposition from the atmosphere. For most of the study watersheds, N discharge amounted to less than half of the net anthropogenic N.

However, a search of the literature reveals no deterministic mass-balance eutrophication models that explicitly include resuspension. We modified the Lake Okeechobee water quality model - which uses the Water Analysis Simulation Package (WASP) to simulate algal dynamics and phosphorus, nitrogen, and oxygen cycles - to include inorganic suspended solids and algorithms that: (1) define changes in depth with changes in volume; (2) compute sediment resuspension based on bottom sheer stress; (3) compute partition coefficients for ammonia and ortho-phosphorus to solids; and (4) relate light attenuation to solids concentrations. The model calibration and validation were successful with the exception of dissolved inorganic nitrogen species which did not correspond well to observed data in the validation phase. This could be attributed to an inaccurate formulation of algal nitrogen preference and/or the absence of nitrogen fixation in the model. The model correctly predicted that the lake is light-limited from resuspended solids, and algae are primarily nitrogen limited. The model simulation suggested that biological fluxes greatly exceed external loads of dissolved nutrients; and sediment-water interactions of organic nitrogen and phosphorus far exceed external loads. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that parameters affecting resuspension, settling sediment nutrient and solids concentrations, mineralization, algal productivity, and algal stoichiometry are factors requiring further study to improve our understanding of the Lake Okeechobee ecosystem.

As part of the study, infiltration experiments were conducted on silt-loam soil with no-tillage (NT) and disk tillage (DT) practices. Liquid swine manure was applied on test plots, and the rainfall was applied by the portable rainfall simulator. The infiltration data was analyzed for the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-6) and runoff volume determinations. The surface runoff water was analyzed for total N, total P, ammonia, and nitrate concentration determinations. The study indicated that the tillage had significant effects on K-6, and quantity and quality of runoff water. The K-6 values of the NT plots were found to vary from 0.693 to 1.734 mm/min, with a mean of 1.494 mm/min, while they varied from 1.056 to 2.543 mm/min, with a mean of 2.231 mm/min in the DT plots. The total N, total P, ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen concentrations were lower in runoff generated from DT plots, compared to that from the NT plots. The chemical concentration levels were significantly different in runoff waters collected one-day after manure application than in those collected 40-days after the manure application. Study suggested that the DT practice must be preferred over the NT practice if liquid swine manure is used as the fertilizer. The study is further continued to assess the long-term impacts of swine manure application and tillage on the quantity and quality of surface runoff water.

J	Boyd, CE; Munsiri, P				Boyd, CE; Munsiri, P			Water quality in laboratory soil-water microcosms with soils from different areas of Thailand	JOURNAL OF THE WORLD AQUACULTURE SOCIETY			English	Article								Forty-five soil samples were collected from aquaculture areas in 23 provinces of Thailand to include six soil orders and wide variation in physical and chemical properties. Soil-water microcosms were prepared containing 5 g of soil and 150 mt of distilled water. Microcosms were held on an oscillating table shaker (150 rpm) for 1 wk at 25 C in the dark. Water pH and concentrations of dissolved nutrients, total alkalinity, and total hardness were measured. Differences in properties within soil orders caused wide variation in composition of solutions and differences in concentrations of dissolved substances and pH were not related to soil order. Regression analyses revealed significant correlations between concentrations of soil nutrients extractable in dilute acid (0.05 N HCl plus 0.025 N H2SO4) or in neutral, 1 N ammonium acetate and aqueous concentrations. Regression coefficients usually were higher for dilute-acid extractable nutrients than for ammonium acetate extractable ones. Regression coefficients based on dilute-acid extractable nutrients follow: soluble reactive phosphorus (r = 0.816); calcium (r = 0.685); magnesium (r = 0.470); potassium (r = 0.959); sodium (r = 0.977); manganese (r = 0.462); boron (r = 0.399). The correlation between soil and solution iron was not significant and aqueous concentrations of copper and zinc were below detection limit, Hardness was correlated with soil carbon (r = 0.710) and soil pH was a good predictor of alkalinity (r = 0.877). Soil pH and aqueous pH were highly correlated (r = 0.939). Findings suggest that soil characteristics can be used to predict pH and concentrations of several dissolved substances in soil-water systems under aerobic conditions.

During recent years it has shown serious deterioration of water quality, especially during the summer season. Destruction of the thermocline has been prohibited in order to maintain desirable temperature downstream of the reservoir for paddy field irrigation, thus, most of the existing control devices cannot be applied to the reservoir. As one of the means of reducing algal blooming in the reservoir, two vertical curtains, having sufficient depth to cover the epilimnion thickness, were installed across the reservoir in order to curtail the nutrient supply from nutrient-rich inflow to the downstream epilimnion of the reservoir. Withdrawal level was also regulated to keep the downstream epilimnion off the nutrient supply. The physical and biological process in the reservoir ecosystem were modelled, by assuming a stratified layered structure at each zone of the reservoir, to predict the water quality and algal species composition in the reservoir. The state variables, temperature, four types of phytoplankton as chlorophyll-a, soluble phosphorus, nitrate, ammonium, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, internal nitrogen, internal phosphorus, and when diatoms are modelled explicitly silica, are considered in the model. The model is calibrated with the measurements taken in the field. The effects of different curtain depths on the algal concentration at downstream zones were also studied.

Management of the activities of microorganisms in food webs and nutrient cycling in ponds is necessary for optimising production, but the objectives will differ with the type of aquaculture, the species cultivated and the economics. Unlike the pastoralists who fertilise and seed pastures with selected species, fish farmers only fertilise ponds and hope that useful species of algae, bacteria and other microorganisms will develop. Factors controlling the composition and development of blooms of both desired and undesirable species of algae and bacteria need to be investigated. Analysis of the complex food webs in ponds, combined with measurements of primary productivity, C cycling through bacteria, zooplankton and meiofaunal biomass changes and nitrogen cycling will provide the basic data for generating a model to describe and predict fish productivity in ponds. Algae and bacteria have often been regarded as single groups of organisms by aquatic biologists, but there is a great diversity of species of each, with different roles and interactions in their ecosystems. This fact, together with the many environmental variables, makes it difficult to develop a single comprehensive, predictive model as a tool for managing food webs and water quality in ponds, but small models specific to given pond systems or stages of grow-out are likely to be successful.

Increased macrophyte growth in the water body and the present levels of urban development within the catchment are reflected in declining water quality and aesthetic deterioation. A study of the water quality of the lake was undertaken to quantify the variation of phosphorus nitrogen, and chlorophyll-a concentrations during ice-free seasons from 1992 to 1994. Its total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a concentrations indicate a meso-eutrophic status. The total phosphorus budget of Mogan Lake was measured for a period of 22 months The estimation of nutrient loading using Dillon-Rigler nutrient budget shows that an artificial load caused too high phosphorus inputs. The management implications of phosphorus loading and budget are discussed.

The WBLMER nitrogen loading model first estimates inputs by atmospheric deposition, fertilizer use, and wastewater to surfaces of the major types of land use (natural vegetation, turf, agricultural land, residential areas, and impervious surfaces) within the landscape. Then, the model estimates losses of nitrogen in the various compartments of the watershed ecosystem. For atmospheric and fertilizer nitrogen, the model allows losses in vegetation and soils, in the vadose zone, and in tile aquifer. For wastewater nitrogen, the model allows losses in septic systems and effluent plumes, and it adds further losses that occur during diffuse transport within aquifers. The calculation of losses is done separately for each major type of land cover, because the processes and loss rates involved differ for different tesserae of the land cover mosaic. if groundwater flows into a freshwater body, the model adds a loss of nitrogen for traversing the freshwater body and then subjects the surviving nitrogen to losses in the aquifer. The WBLMER model is developed for Waquoit Bay, bur with inputs for local conditions it is applicable to other rural to suburban watersheds underlain by unconsolidated sandy sediments, Model calculations suggest that the atmosphere contributes 56%, fertilizer 14%, and wastewater 27% of the nitrogen delivered to the surface of the watershed of Waquoit Bay, Losses within the watershed amount to 89% of atmospheric nitrogen, 79% of fertilizer nitrogen, and 65% of wastewater nitrogen. The net result of inputs to the watershed surface and losses within the watershed is that wastewater becomes the largest source (48%) of nitrogen loads to receiving estuaries, followed by atmospheric deposition (30%) and fertilizer use (15%). The nitrogen load to estuaries of Waquoit Bay is transported primarily through land parcels covered by residential areas (39%, mainly via wastewater), natural vegetation (21%, by atmospheric deposition), and turf(16%, by atmospheric deposition and fertilizers). Other land covers were involved in lesser throughputs of nitrogen. The model results have implications for management of coastal landscapes and water quality. Most attention should be given to wastewater disposal within the watershed, particularly within 200 m of the shore. Rules regarding setbacks of septic system location relative to shore and nitrogen retention ability of septic systems, will be useful in control of wastewater nitrogen loading, Installation of multiple conventional leaching fields or septic systems in high-flow parcels could be one way to increase nitrogen retention. Control of fertilizer use can help to a modest degree, particularly for optional uses such as lawns situated near shore. Conservation of parcels of accreting natural vegetation should be given high priority, because these environments effectively intercept atmospheric deposition, Areas upgradient from freshwater bodies should be given low priority in plans to control nitrogen loading, because ponds intercept much of the nitrogen transported from upgradient.

Cover crop incorporation influences transient soil microbial dynamics and nutrient availability at an early growth stage of subsequent crops. Short-term (less than or equal to 35 d) effects of cover crop incorporation on soil C pools and N availability were evaluated using sandy loam soils from organically and conventionally managed fields. Field and incubation experimeuts were designed to investigate whether cover crop incorporation had differential effects on C pools and how they were related to N mineralization. Labile C pools (soil carbohydrates and soil microbial biomass C [SMBC]) and coarse organic debris (GOD) increased two- to threefold, whereas total organic C increased by only 20% by Day 7 after incorporation, The COD decreased faster than other C pools and best predicted SMBC (P < 0.0001), A rapid decrease in SMBC after Day 21 was accompanied by an increase in available N. Discriminant analyses revealed that organic soils were distinct from conventional soils by their higher total C, N, and SMBC, and lower available N, but cover crop incorporation obscured the distinction in the first 14 d. Residue decomposition was Slightly faster in organic soils than in conventional soils at the early stage (3-4,vk), but >30% of N in cover crop residues was mineralized in both soils by Day 35 after incorporation, suggesting that manipulations of soil microbial dynamics and N mineralization in the short term can be of particular significance in synchronizing N release with the need of subsequent crops.

The soil was a fine sandy loam underlain by a compact glacial till. The influence of soil parameters was assessed by comparing results using EPIC default versus measured soil parameter values. This article addresses the comparisons for maize yield and N uptake under five rates of N fertilization across three different growing seasons. Statistical analyses showed that the EPIC model in general under-estimated both maize yield and N uptake. The accuracy of predicted values for both yield and N uptake were affected by both growing season precipitation and N application rate. Possible reasons for the influence of these factors on EPIC predictions are given.

At the present time, different sections of the reservoir have different trophic status and the upper portion of the reservoir, in particular, is eutrophic. In this regard, there is a need for the assessment of alternative strategies to be implemented for phosphorus and thus eutrophication control in this segment of the reservoir. In this study, mathematical modeling techniques are used to compare various alternatives in terms of their relative effectiveness for phosphorus control. With this intention, a two dimensional depth-averaged hydrodynamic model and a three-dimensional compartmental water quality model are coupled to represent the complex water body dynamics prevailing in the reservoir, After calibration and verification, the coupled model was used to simulate dissolved oxygen and euphotic chlorophyll-a concentrations under different scenario conditions corresponding to various strategies proposed for phosphorus control. The modelling effort has yielded valuable information that can be used by decision makers for the evaluation of different management alternatives including reduction of the phosphorus load coming from point as well as diffuse sources within the catchment area, use of baffles and construction of pre-dam structures.

J	Chokmani, K; Gallichand, J				Chokmani, K; Gallichand, J			Use of indexes for evaluating potential of nonpoint source pollution in two agriculture watersheds	CANADIAN AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING			French	Article								Water pollution from agriculture is becoming an acute problem. One of the solutions is to tackle the problem at the watershed scale. However, this can not be done without management tools to evaluate the effect of agricultural practices on water quality. The objective of this study was to assess a distributed indicator method for predicting the potential for sur-face water pollution. Water quality at the outlet of two watersheds, where animal production is dominant, was monitored on a continuous basis between March 1994 and February 1995. A geographical information system was used to compile spatial data needed by the indicator method and to perform elementary taks. Observed water quality was related to land use, particularly the intense animal production. Ammonium, total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen and fecal colimorms were parameters most affecting surface water quality. Differences were noticed between observed water quality and that predicted by the method of agricultural nonpoint source potential pollution indicators. These differences might be due to neglecting some nutrient and sediment transport processes. However, the method allowed the identification of zones, within each watershed, that could contribute more to water pollution.

Currently, most of the water in Izmit bay has a TSS concentration in excess of the legal maximum of 30 mg/L TSS. Modelling and simulation shows that the majority of the TSS does not originate from the known land based sources but probably represents phytoplankton. Since excessive quantities of N and P are discharged into the bay, sometimes the growth of phytoplankton is limited by the natural silicate content of the water. However, it is found that most of the phosphorus discharged from land based sources is in fact utilized by the phytoplankton. Hence, reduction of the TSS concentration to the legal limit can be achieved by decreasing phosphorus sources. If the majority of total organic carbon emanating from land based sources were removed, this would imply a considerable decrease in phosphorus inflow. It is suggested that waste waters from residential communities and the remaining industry should be treated and released to the layer below the halocline using one outfall in the eastern part and one or several outfalls in the central part of the bay.

As part of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) study, environmental data were collected during two summer dry seasons and simulations were conducted with the WASP5 model to assess the effect of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), ammonia, and nutrient loads on DO in the Black River. DO levels were below the State water quality regulatory criterion of 8.0 mg/L in almost all locations during the study. The slow middle reach of the river showed stratified conditions, with anoxia in some of the deepest pools. Based on model simulations, DO was found to still fall below the 8.0 mg/L criterion in the entire mainstem under ''natural'' conditions, and eutrophication was identified as a potential problem in the middle reach. A TMDL was proposed for BOD and ammonia that would prevent significant degradation of DO in the Black River. To prevent eutrophic conditions in the Black River, a TMDL for total phosphorus was proposed that establishes a protective criterion of 0.05 mg/L for the middle river during the dry low-flow season.

An analysis was conducted on Lake Garda (Italy), where sub-basins showing different water quality conditions can be delineated. For this purpose, two Landsat-TM images, taken in April and August 1985, at specific seasonal situations of the limnological cycle were used. Image processing provided radiance-derived quantities, such as reflectance and chromaticity, in the form of digital transects drawn from the margin of the lake to cross the pelagic environment. In order to make the multi-temporal analysis possible, a method for compensating the differential haze effect between the two images, based on the darkest object technique was adopted.

The model was originally developed for the Windrush catchment where the highly reactive Jurassic limestone aquifer underlying the catchment is well connected to the surface drainage network, allowing the system to be modelled using uniform export coefficients for each nutrient source in the catchment, regardless of proximity to the surface drainage network, In the Slapton catchment, the hydrological pathways are dominated by surface and lateral shallow subsurface flow, requiring modification of the export coefficient model to incorporate a distance-decay component in the export coefficients. The modified model was calibrated against observed total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads delivered to Slapton Ley from inflowing streams in its catchment. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to isolate the key controls on nutrient export in the modified model. The model was validated against long-term records of water quality, and was found to be accurate in its predictions and sensitive to both temporal and spatial changes in agricultural practice in the catchment. The model was then used to forecast the potential reduction in nutrient loading on Slapton Ley associated with a range of catchment management strategies. The best practicable environmental option (BPEO) was found to be spatial redistribution of high nutrient export risk sources to areas of the catchment with the greatest intrinsic nutrient retention capacity.

J	Hamilton, DP; Schladow, SG				Hamilton, DP; Schladow, SG			Prediction of water quality in lakes and reservoirs .1. Model description	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Review						lake and reservoir model; DYRESM Water Quality; ecological parameters; vertical density stratification	PHYTOPLANKTON PHOTOSYNTHESIS; EUTROPHICATION MODEL; SEDIMENT; CHLOROPHYLL; PARTICLES; LIGHT; SIMULATION; TURBULENCE; NITROGEN; DYNAMICS	A one-dimensional water quality model (DYRESM Water Quality) is described which combines a process based hydrodynamic model (DYRESM) with numerical descriptions of phytoplankton production, nutrient cycling, the oxygen budget and particle dynamics. The hydrodynamic component is free from calibration, which ensures that it is readily transferable to other lakes and reservoirs. This improves water quality predictions derived for different hydrodynamic forcing events. It also allows for identification of the specific hydrodynamic processes that influence water quality, The water quality component consists of 13 state variables which may include up to three algal groups, BOD, dissolved oxygen and four components of the dissolved oxygen budget (inflows, biochemical processes, surface aeration and oxygen present in the reservoir at the start of a simulation), nutrients (PO4-P, NO3-N, NH4-N, TP and TN) and inorganic particles. The particle model simulates settling and flocculation/deflocculation of up to seven different size classes of particles. The hydrodynamic, water quality and particle models interact on a sub-daily time step. Forcing data for the model are entered as daily-averaged values. The ecological component requires calibration for each new application through adjustment of several different biological and chemical parameters. Literature ranges for these parameters are wide, but provided the process description is correct, many of the parameters can be validated with measured data. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Schladow, SG; Hamilton, DP				Schladow, SG; Hamilton, DP			Prediction of water quality in lakes and reservoirs .2. Model calibration, sensitivity analysis and application	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						coupled hydrodynamic ecological model; Prospect Reservoir; validation; DYRESM Water Quality model	EUTROPHICATION	A range was assigned to each of the parameters used in the ecological component of the DYRESM Water Quality model based on values found in the literature. The sensitivity of the model to changes in these parameters was determined by individually adjusting parameters to the maximum or minimum of their assigned ranges whilst keeping all other parameters at their assigned means. The effects of these changes were quantified through the mean, the vertical distribution and the temporal variation in chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen concentrations over a 200 day period, using data for Prospect Reservoir. Parameters that influenced uptake kinetics of phosphorus by phytoplankton, the minimum internal concentration, the half saturation constant and the maximum uptake rate, were amongst the most important determinants of all three measures of chlorophyll a. These parameters were also important determinants of the mean concentration and the vertical distribution of dissolved oxygen, through effects on photosynthetic oxygen production. Sediment oxygen demand had a significant effect on the mean concentration and vertical distribution of dissolved oxygen, phytoplankton density altered the vertical distribution of chlorophyll a, and rates of phytoplankton growth, respiration and mortality influenced the mean concentration of chlorophyll a. The model parameters were calibrated for the 200 day period and the model was validated over an additional 306 days. The mean errors between simulated and measured temperatures, and dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a concentrations, as percentages of the measured values, were 5.2, 9.9 and 24.1% respectively. Simulated nutrient concentrations (PO4-P, NO3-N, NH4-N, total phosphorus and total nitrogen) all reflected the general temporal and spatial trends observed in the measured data from Prospect Reservoir.

J	Qian, SS				Qian, SS			Estimating the area affected by phosphorus runoff in an Everglades wetland: A comparison of universal kriging and Bayesian kriging	ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS			English	Article						geostatistics; nutrients; soils; water quality	PREDICTION; INTERPOLATION; MODEL	Phosphorus-enriched agriculture runoff is believed to be the leading cause of ecosystem changes of Everglades wetlands. To study this effect, it is necessary to estimate the area of the affected region. In this study, Bayesian kriging and universal kriging were used to estimate the area by analysing the data collected by Reddy et al. (1991). The background level of the soil's total phosphorus concentration is used to determine whether the region is affected by the agriculture runoff, through an indicator function. The area of the affected region was represented by the integration of the indicator function over the entire wetland. The expected value of the affected area was calculated using the results derived from Bayesian and universal kriging. The outcome indicates that universal kriging is sensitive to specification of the covariance model. It was observed that universal kriging and Bayesian kriging yield comparable results, if the specified covariance structures are of similar nature.

A 3-mo greenhouse experiment with ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) was conducted to determine plant availability of N and P from aquaculture wastes and compare results with previous laboratory incubations. Treatments included: (i) wastes taken from sediments under cages in a 3-yr-old fish farm (EA) applied at 40 and 80 Mg ha(-1); (ii) wastes taken from sediments under cages in an 8-yr-old farm (LM), applied at 10 and 20 Mg ha(-1); (iii) the lowest waste rates amended with 50 kg ha(-1) synthetic N; (iv) four synthetic fertilizer treatments including a single N rate of 80 kg N ha(-1) and four P levels of 30, 40, 60, and 80 kg P ha(-1), and (v) a no-fertilizer control. Although total N and P were higher in LM than in EA, and N mineralization rates in lab incubations were similar (13%), ryegrass yields and N uptake were much higher in EA than in LM. When mineralized N was estimated as the difference between added N and total N uptake, values were 50 to 63% for EA and 5 to 14% for LM. Ryegrass yields were approximately as follows: EA > FI > LM > Control. Synthetic fertilizer treatments showed the lowest values of P utilization efficiency, residual Olsen-P in soil and plant P uptake in biomass, and the highest P retention in soils. The lowest waste rates with addition of N produced comparable ryegrass yields with the highest rates. Results emphasize: (i) the need to include living plants in mineralization potential evaluations to avoid significant errors in nutrient cycling models, and (ii) the importance of organic amendments in ameliorating plant P availability in high P-fixing volcanic soils.

J	Kelly, JR; Doering, PH				Kelly, JR; Doering, PH			Monitoring and modeling primary production in coastal waters: Studies in Massachusetts Bay 1992-1994	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						primary production; monitoring; modeling; Massachusetts Bay; Boston Harbor	ESTIMATING PHYTOPLANKTON PRODUCTIVITY; MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; PHOTOSYNTHETIC PARAMETERS; LIGHT; METABOLISM; MESOCOSMS; ESTUARINE; EXCHANGE; SYSTEM; C-14	During 1992-1994, we made shipboard incubations suitable for determining rates of primary production in water from Boston Harbor, Massachusetts Bay, and Cape Cod Bay (Massachusetts, USA). These measurements were part of an extensive baseline monitoring program to characterize water quality prior to diversion of effluent from Boston Harbor directly into Massachusetts Bay via a submarine outfall diffuser; Production (P) was measured using whole-water samples exposed to irradiance (I) levels from similar to 5 to 2000 mu E m(-2) s(-1). P-I incubations were performed on 6 surveys a year, spaced to capture principal features of the annual production cycle. The number of stations and depths examined varied between years. There were 10 stations and 2 depths sampled in 1992-1993. In 1994, we performed in-depth studies at 2 stations (Boston Harbor's edge and western Massachusetts Bay) by sampling 4 depths. Using depth-intensive 1994 data a simple empirical regression model, using information on chlorophyll biomass, incident daily light, and the depth of the photic zone, predicted integrated primary production rates derived from P-I incubations. The regression model was virtually the same as described for other coastal waters, giving confidence in general use of the model as an extrapolation tool. Using the 1994-based empirical model, we obtained favorable comparisons with production rates modeled from 1992-1993 P-I incubations. Combining the regression model with data on chlorophyll, Light, and the photic zone collected on frequent hydrographic surveys (up to 16 yr(-1)), annual primary production was estimated for 1992-1994. Primary production in an intensively studied region of western Massachusetts Bay (21 hydrographic profile stations in an area similar to 100 km(2)) ranged from 386 to 468 g C m(-2) yr(-1). For a station at the edge of Boston Harbor near Deer Island extrapolations suggested production rates of 263 to 546 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Based on 2 stations in central Cape Cod Bay (1992-1993 only), model extrapolations suggested an annual production of 527 to 613 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Analyses using incubation and modeling results suggested that production variability was strongly related to fluctuations in incident irradiance, especially at daily to seasonal time scales. Chlorophyll variability secondarily influenced production, especially at seasonal to annual time scales. Finally, we provide a case where equivalent production was achieved in environments with contrasting water quality (nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations) because of variations in the depth of the photic zone (controlled by both chlorophyll and non-chlorophyll turbidity). Comparative analyses showed that our study estimates of primary production were consistent with the literature on nutrient-rich shelf environments. In conclusion, our study validated an empirical modeling approach to determining primary production in coastal marine waters.

Literature data and conclusions drawn from previous work with isoproturon and diflufenican were confirmed in a range of soil and cropping conditions: grassed buffer strips are effective in restricting pollutant transfer in runoff; those with widths of 6, 12 and 18 m reduced runoff volume by 43 to 99.9%, suspended solids by 87 to 100%, lindane losses by 72 to 100% and loss of atrazine and its metabolites by 44 to 100%. More than 99% of isoproturon and 97% of diflufenican residues in runoff were removed by buffer strips. Nitrate and soluble phosphorus in runoff were reduced by 47 to 100% and by 22 to 89%, respectively. At La Jailliere, a rainfall simulator was used in 1995 to verify that buffer strips are still effective in conditions of intense runoff. Investigation of the influence of sowing direction during the 1994-95 cropping period at Bignan showed that sowing perpendicular to the slope seemed to be beneficial in reducing pesticide content in runoff.

Scotland are currently being assessed. The importance of headwater regions for supplying a large proportion of catchment runoff with water of a high quality is clearly demonstrated. However, the quality of this water is threatened by the impact of acid deposition in a number of sub-catchments. In some of the more agriculturally developed lowland sub-catchments, there are increasing levels of nitrogen runoff. The catchment attributes, together with hydrochemical data, are being considered in terms of an ongoing research programme established to predict the impact of future environmental and land-use change scenarios.

Although much information is available from controlled field experiments concerning N concentration and its spatial variability, quantitative estimates of nitrate fluxes under normal farming conditions and when the field is directly managed by farmers are rare. This is particularly true for gardening crops in the Mediterranean zone, where high evapotranspiration rates lead to intensive irrigation and may be responsible for N leaching. A field experiment was conducted in the Departement du Gard under agricultural conditions. Salads (Cichorium endivia, Lactuca sativa) were planted in three consecutive periods. The field was irrigated with sprinklers. Local measurements with a neutron probe were made at two sites (row, inter-row), and an experimental plot (95 m x 25 m) was surveyed at 36 points located on a 10 m x 10 m equilateral grid to analyze the spatial variability of water and NO3--N balances. To analyze the basic statistical properties of our sampling scheme, random fields of soil concentration were simulated with the turning-bands method. Sampling strategy simulations indicated that when a spatial structure exists, sampling according to a regular grid was more efficient than a purely random sampling strategy. Global trends indicated high spatial variability for nitrate leaching with differences between periods of different irrigation intensity (97 kg h(-1) NO3--N leaching during the spring and summer, and 199 kg ha(-1) NO3--N leaching during autumn and winter). Leaching caused temporal variations in the spatial distributions of NO3--N. The origin of the spatial variability of N leaching was explained by first, the variability in NO3--N concentration in the soil profile, and second, by spatial variability in irrigation. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of the NO3--N concentration was time dependent, and NO3--N spatial distributions became independent after approximately 2 or 3 months under our conditions. Our results show that better management of irrigation and fertilizer in spring and summer may reduce N leaching and, thus, improve ground water quality.

The changes in the water chemistry during the transfer from the river to the aquifer have important implications for the quality of the produced water. In this paper, we first describe certain features of the evolution of the water chemistry during bank-filtration in the case of an experimental site, part of a large well field (Seine river, France). Here, bank-filtration leads to highly reducing conditions in the aquifer. A conceptual and numerical macroscopic model of this evolution, focusing on nitrogen compounds, is then presented. The model is designed to simulate organic matter mineralization and redox reactions catalyzed by bacteria in the river bed sediments where water infiltrates. Growth and decay of bacteria are explicitly accounted for and a numerical solution is found with an operator splitting technique. The model is able to reproduce column experiments by von Gunten and Zobrist (1993) designed to simulate infiltration of organically polluted river water into an aquifer. A model application to the characteristics of the experimental site is also presented. Results of a sensitivity analysis highlight the importance of: (1) the flow rate of water infiltrating river bed sediments; and (2) the organic carbon content of these sediments, for the evolution of the water quality during transfer from the river to the aquifer.

J	Basu, BK; Pick, FR				Basu, BK; Pick, FR			Phytoplankton and zooplankton development in a lowland, temperate river	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH			English	Article							MUSSELS DREISSENA-POLYMORPHA; WATER-QUALITY MANAGEMENT; WESTERN LAKE ERIE; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; FILTERING IMPACTS; FILTRATION-RATE; FRESH-WATER; COMMUNITY; ABUNDANCE; ONTARIO	The longitudinal and seasonal patterns of plankton development were examined over 2 years in a lowland, temperate river: the Rideau River (Ontario, Canada). Following an initial decrease in phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass as water flowed from the headwaters into the Rideau River proper, there was an increase in chlorophyll a (chi a) and zooplankton biomass with downstream travel. At approximately river km 60, both phytoplankton and zooplankton reached their maximum biomass of 27 mu g l(-1) (chi a) and 470 mu g l(-1) (dry mass), respectively. Downstream of river km 60, the biomass of both planktonic communities declined significantly despite increasing nutrient concentrations and favorable light conditions. These downstream declines may be due to the feeding activity of the exotic zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) which was at high density in downstream reaches (>1000 individuals m(-2)). There was no evidence for longitudinal phasing of phytoplankton and zooplankton, as increases and decreases in chi a and zooplankton biomass appeared to coincide. Overall, chi a was best predicted by total phosphorus (R(2) = 0.43), whereas zooplankton biomass was best predicted by chi a (R(2) = 0.20). There was no evidence for significant grazing effects of zooplankton on phytoplankton biomass.

Approximately 56 percent of the total phosphorus in water discharged from the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) is in particulate form. Currently, farm-level best management practices are being implemented in the effort to reduce total phosphorus and sediment in off-farm discharges. The objective of this work was to develop and calibrate a model describing water movement in primary EAA canals as a first step to development of a water quality (i.e., nutrient, sediment) model. The Netherlands-developed mechanistic flow and water quality model (DUFLOW) was adapted for the EAA. Flow, stage, geometry, canal network, and meteorological data, October 13, 1993, to February 13, 1994, were used to adapt and calibrate the DUFLOW model for EAA water level and flow in primary canals. Direct runoff discharge into the primary canals from farm-pump stations was used as runoff input for the model. The model results are comparable to an independently-calculated water balance for the EAA. The calibrated flow model will be the basis for the calibration of sediment and chemical transport in the future.

To identify these longitudinal gradients, a two-year investigation (May 1991 to October 1992) was conducted to measure primary productivity, nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass at three locations in the 705-ha water supply reservoir. Emphasis was placed on the measurement of primary production using the carbon-14 artificial incubator (photosynthetron) technique. The average annual production in 1992 was 247.3 g m(-2) 245 d(-1) ranging from 52 to 2677 mg C m(-2). Mean alpha(B) (assimilation efficiency), P(B)m (assimilation number), and I-k (saturation irradiance) were 4.40 mg C mgChl(-1) E-1 m(-2), 3.82 mg C mgChl(-1) h(-1), and 236.5 mu E m(2) s(-1), respectively. Neither seasonal nor spatial variability of these photosynethetic parameters were observed. Except for Secchi depth, distinct longitudinal zones from river inflow to dam were not statistically demonstrated in the Tomhannock Reservoir. Mean extinction coefficient, chlorophyll a and total phosphorus concentrations decreased; Secchi transparency and phytoplankton biomass increased; while primary productivity and dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration remained the same from headwater to dam. These baseline data will be used to assess the future effectiveness of best management practices (BMPs) recently instituted on selected watershed farmland in an attempt to reduce the detrimental impact of agricultural activities on drinking water quality.

J	Schleich, J; White, D				Schleich, J; White, D			Cost minimization of nutrient reduction in watershed management using linear programming	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						watershed management; cost minimization; water quality; economics; pollution modeling; nutrient trading; water policy; non-point pollution; linear programming	NONPOINT	Linear programming is applied to identify the least cost strategy for reaching politically specified phosphorus and total suspended solids reduction targets for the Fox-Wolf river basin in Northeast Wisconsin. The programming model uses data collected on annualized unit reduction costs associated with five categories of sources of phosphorus and total suspended solids discharge in each of the 41 subwatersheds in the basin to determine the least cost management strategy. Results indicate that: (1) cost-effective nutrient reduction requires careful selection of geographic areas and source categories to address throughout the watershed; (2) agricultural sources are the most cost-effective to address in the basin; and (3) care should be exercised in setting nutrient reduction targets, given that there are likely to be significantly increasing marginal costs of nutrient reduction; the model predicts that lowering the most restrictive target by 33 percent would cut reduction expenditures by about 75 percent. Policy implications of the model include support for the investigation and potential development of institutional arrangements that enable cost-effective nutrient reduction activities to occur, such as the creation of an agency with authority over a given watershed, coordinated watershed management activities, or nutrient trading programs.

J	Pocernich, M; Litke, DW				Pocernich, M; Litke, DW			Nutrient concentrations in wastewater treatment plant effluents, South Platte River Basin	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						wastewater treatment; nitrogen; phosphorus; nutrient estimates; water management		Accurate data about nutrient concentrations in wastewater treatment plant effluents are needed for river basin water-quality studies. As part of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment Program in the South Platte River Basin, nutrient data were requested from 31 wastewater-treatment plants located in the basin. This article describes the types of nutrient data available from the plants, examines the variability of effluent nutrient concentrations, and discusses methods for estimation of nutrient concentrations where data are lacking. Ammonia was monitored at 88 percent of the plants, nitrite plus nitrate was monitored at 40 percent of the plants, and organic nitrogen and phosphorus were monitored at less than 25 percent of the plants. Median total nitrogen concentrations and median total phosphorus concentrations were small compared to typical literature estimates for wastewater-treatment plants with secondary treatment. Nutrient concentrations in effluent from wastewater-treatment plants varied widely between and within plants. For example, ammonia concentrations varied as much as 5 mg/L during a day, as much as 10 mg/L from day to day, and as much as 30 mg/L from summer to winter within a plant. In the South Platte River Basin, estimates of median annual ammonia and nitrite plus nitrate concentrations can be improved based on plant processes; and nitrite plus nitrate and organic nitrogen concentrations can be estimated based on ammonia concentrations. However, to avoid large estimation errors, more complete nutrient data from wastewater-treatment plants are needed for integration into river basin water quality studies. The paucity of data hinders attempts to evaluate the relative importance of point source and nonpoint source nutrient loadings to rivers.

The model is site specific and takes into account that variability of six environmental parameters (light, temperature, turbidity, dissolved silicon concentration, dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations), which are known to have a major effect on algal growth in the Vaal River. Using data relative to the Stilfontein site, the model was double-validated and a set of 14 algal categories were designed to represent the total algal community. The major genera constituting seven of the 14 categories have been identified. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Solidoro, C; Pecenik, G; Pastres, R; Franco, D; Dejak, C				Solidoro, C; Pecenik, G; Pastres, R; Franco, D; Dejak, C			Modelling macroalgae (Ulva rigida) in the Venice lagoon: Model structure identification and first parameters estimation	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article							GRACILARIA-FOLIIFERA RHODOPHYCEAE; ECOLOGICAL GROWTH STRATEGIES; MARINE FISHPOND EFFLUENTS; AMMONIUM UPTAKE; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; LACTUCA BIOFILTERS; SP CHLOROPHYCEAE; TISSUE NITROGEN; N-P; SEAWEEDS	The paper describes the definition and a first parametrization of a dynamic model of macroalgae (Ulva rigida) population. Based on specific literature, a two-step kinetic scheme is selected for modelling growth and uptake of nitrogen and, therefore, the intratissual concentration of nitrogen has been considered as a state variable of the model. Accordingly, Ulva r. growth rate depends on the concentration of phosphorus in the external medium and on the intratissual nitrogen concentration, which influences, in turn, the uptake rates of reduced and oxidized nitrogen. The influences of temperature and light intensity on Ulva r. photosynthetic activity are also discussed. The dynamics of dissolved oxygen has also been modelled and a specific mortality rate, depending on dissoved oxygen, has been adopted. The model has proved to be qualitatively consistent with the available literature, while a first parametrization yields results in quantitative agreement with short term laboratoy experiments, regarding samples collected in the lagoon of Venice. The model has been applied to data sets collected in the lagoon of Venice and is capable of reproducing the main features of the seasonal dynamic of Ulva r. These results prompted its inclusion in a comprehensive 3D transport-water quality model of the Venice lagoon ecosystem. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

The investigations based on stamping two close cross-sections to know their spatial distributions in a heterogeneous bed substrate showed a heterogeneous pattern of colonization mainly influenced by hydrological variables as the current velocity, the size of the substrata (gravel-pebble-boulder). For the drifting algae, mainly composed with benthic species temporarily unhooked to the substrata, the heterogeneity of the distribution was reduced in fast flow which induced a mixing of the whole mass of water. For the periphyton, some results indicated that the greatest diversity and the highest chlorophyll concentration were found on pebble substratum where the current velocity was moderate. These results have also shown that the classical methods used to day for investigations were inadequate for most Mediterranean rivers.

J	Valente, JPS; Padilha, PM; da Silva, AMM				Valente, JPS; Padilha, PM; da Silva, AMM			Contribution of Botucatu-SP with nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen) to the eutrophication of the Barra Bonita dam	ECLETICA QUIMICA			Portuguese	Article						phosphorus; nitrogen; eutrophication; Lavapes brook; Barra Bonita nutrient load		It was compared the level content of nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen) at the Lavapes brook with level content at source and cross-town (domestic sewage discharge) and also with the level/ content at source and mouth the Capivara river. The head-waters of the Capivara river, as well as those of the Lavapes brook, are on the highlands (at the top of the sierra/mountain-range) and its waters flow into the Barra Bonita dam on the Tiete river (Figure 1). One of its sources is near a Lavapes source and their mouths are close to each other at the Barra Bonita dam. Along the banks of both streams the use of land and the ti pes of soil are alike, which implies in a similar rural pollution; so, what makes the difference in water quality between them is the urban pollution affecting the Lavapes brook in Botucatu. Therefore it was evaluated the contribution of nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen) to the Bana Bonita dam of the Capivara river and the Lavapes brook. Taking into account the domestic sewage carried into the Lavapes brook in Botucatu, it was estimated the nutrient load of its silt (kept in its silt) and the one discharged into the Barra Bonita dam. The study was conducted during drought, without overflows, which made it possible to measure the near-mouth-flow and to evaluate the nutrient load daily discharged into the dam. It was also evaluated the dissolved oxygen, the chemical oxygen demand and the electrical conductivity. Although the results are estimated and variable in time we can conclude that pollution of the Lavapes brook waters with domestic sewage in Botucatu, besides making the use of its waters not viable and causing other (environmental) damage (financial losses), contributes to aggravating the eutrophication at the Barra Bonita dam.

J	BenCharrada, R; Moussa, M				BenCharrada, R; Moussa, M			Hydrodynamical and ecological modelling of Tunis bay	HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU			French	Article								A study of water quality in connection with circulation patterns in the bay of Tunis is presented. The hydrodynamics aspects were analysed using two numerical models in order to identify the internal circulation patterns. The first ID model, was designed for the lagoon of Tunis and the bay, and the second 2D, was applied to the gulf. The simulations showed that the water residence time in the bay varies from few days to 67 days in relation of the wind. The wind tends to produce relatively strong coastal currents. Tidal currents are rather weak and remain concentrated offshore. Then, an ecological model, describing the phyto-plankton feedback in relation with the availability of the nutrients (inorganic Phosphate and Nitrogen), is proposed. Some results of ecological simulations of the littoral are presented. They showed on enrichment of the sediments with nutriments as a result sedimentation of dead plankton organisms.

J	Lichtenberg, E; Shapiro, LK				Lichtenberg, E; Shapiro, LK			Agriculture and nitrate concentrations in Maryland community water system wells	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							GROUNDWATER QUALITY; LAND-USE; NITROGEN; CHLORIDE; IMPACT; SOIL	The presence of NO3-N in well water is a cause of growing concern throughout the USA. Previous studies indicate that agriculture is a major contributor to this problem. This study uses data on NO3-N concentrations in drinking water wells, on hydrological characteristics of those wells, and on measures of agriculture activity and of the extent of residential land use to construct statistical relationships between land use and well water quality in Maryland community water system wells. Tobit regression was used to correct for truncation bias arising from the fact that NO3-N was not reported at concentrations below 0.1 mg/L. Exponential and linear specifications were estimated; non-nested hypothesis tests indicated that the exponential specification fit the data better than the linear one. Deeper wells appear less vulnerable to NO3-N contamination, wells in unconfined aquifers and especially limestone formations, more so. Broiler and corn (Zea mays L.) production were associated with higher NO3-N concentrations in drinking water in both specifications, indicating that agriculture-oriented efforts aimed at preserving groundwater quality should be concentrated on corn and broiler production. Septic systems for waste disposal also appear to have a substantial impact on NO3-N concentrations in drinking water, suggesting that land use planning measures such as minimum lot size zoning may be needed to prevent conversion of crop and livestock production to residential units relying on septic systems from exacerbating groundwater quality problems.

The hydrodynamic model was calibrated and verified with two sets of observed data. Model predictions were also compared with the results from a previous study wherein a one-dimensional (1-D) finite difference approach was used. The 2-D model predictions of water surface elevations and velocities at specified locations in the bay were generally superior. The results of simulation of WQ constituents (temperature, nitrate-nitrogen, algae, and dissolved oxygen) using the 2-D WQ model compared well with the results from the I-D WQ model, both in the general trend as well as the specific distribution of constituent concentrations. Investigations were also carried out to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of sediments and a hypothetical sediment-borne toxicant in the bay. Results were found to be in general agreement with conclusions drawn from the hydrodynamic study.

The field was cultivated with three years of conventional tillage (CVT) followed by three years of conservation tillage (CsT) of cotton. GLEAMS and EPIC underpredicted NO3-N losses in runoff for both tillage systems. EPIC simulated tillage effects on soluble-P losses better than GLEAMS. However, EPIC poorly predicted annual organic-N and P losses in sediment, mainly due to overpredicted sediment losses. The GLEAMS prediction of annual organic-N and P losses in sediment was more acceptable than that of EPIC. WEPP predicted sediment losses close to observed data for both tillage systems. However, EPIC simulation of sediment loss was not as accurate, because its limited definition of watershed profile prevented the model accounting for sediment deposition on the watershed depressional area.

CPA considered were phytoplankton (chl), suspended minerals (sm), and dissolved organic carbon (doc). Waters that contain simultaneously low concentrations of chl, sm, and doc are shown to appear blue to turquoise in color (472-500 nm). Highly turbid waters (i.e., waters containing high concentrations of chl and/or sm) with low concentrations of doc are shown to display colours ranging from green to brown (> 500 nm). Waters with large concentrations of doc, irrespective of turbidity, are shown to be invariable brownish (560-570 nm). With increasing CPA content, X, Y, and Z (and, consequently, lambda(dom)) asymptotically approach constant limit values. An ''end-point'' dominant wavelength at about 572 nm appears to be intrinsically characteristic of all natural waters. It is shown that when one or more CPA exceeds a critical concentration, the spectral purity p asymptotically approaches values in the range 0.35 to 0.45 for all waters (exceptive of those containing solely chl in the restricted concentration range less than or equal to 0.5 mu g/L. Optical distinctiveness, particularly with respect to indigenous doc, of natural waters, while impacting the spectral purity of the ''end-point'' radiometric color, does not produce comparable impact on rite ''end-point'' color itself. This work reinforces the restrictive application of chromaticity analyses to the remote sensing of binary aquatic systems comprised of water plus one CPA. It also illustrates that neither panchromatic nor two-channel ratio images can provide unambiguous inference of water quality parameters. Correspondence between radiomimetic water color descriptors (X, Y, Z, lambda(dom') and p) and water color scales traditionally used in limnology is established, illustrating that the platinum-cobalt scale would be most appropriate for assessing waters that were radiometrically yellow, provided thar the yellow hue were not invariably attributed to doc.

J	Robertson, DM				Robertson, DM			Regionalized loads of sediment and phosphorus to Lakes Michigan and Superior - High flow and long-term average	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						suspended sediment; phosphorus; water quality; sediment load; yield	CONSTITUENT	Daily loads of suspended sediment total phosphorus for the 10-year; 1-day design high flow and average of the 16 year period (1975 to 1990) were computed for 18 well-monitored tributaries to Lake Michigan and Lake Superior by us of constituent-transport models. The loads from these 18 reference tributaries were used to estimate the loads from all the United States tributaries (with drainage basins greater than 325 km(2)) to Lake Michigan and Lake Superior by selection of a reference tributary with the most similar physical characteristics and use of a unit-area yield. Statistical comparisons between computed yields and environmental factors were used to determine the physical characteristics that were most influential in selecting a reference tributary. Suspended sediment yields were affected primarily by river gradient and secondarily by the texture of superficial deposits and secondarily by river gradient . Average total phosphorus loads were greatest in rivers entering the middle to southern part of Lake Michigan, especially those draining clayey superficial deposits in agricultural areas. During high flow, loads of phosphorus and suspended sediment from tributaries entering the southwestern part of Lake Superior dominate the total input of these constituents because of the steep gradients of the rivers and the clayey surficial deposits that they drain. These loads were used to compute regional loads and to rank the tributaries on the basis of their respective loads during a specified high flow and over extended periods.

Average nitrogen runoff per acre in the 110 counties ranges from 0.11 to 11.76 kg/ha (0.1 to 10.5 pounds/acre), with an average of 4.71/kg/ha (4.2 pounds/acre). Average nitrogen leaching per acre ranges from 0 to 12.10 kg/ha (0 to 10.8 pounds/acre), with an average of 3.14 kg/ha (2.8 pounds/acre). Counties with great nitrogen losses tend to be those that are heavily furrow irrigated and/or have large acreage of corn. The results are compared with those provided by two previous national assessments of groundwater contamination potential Because this study takes into account the differences in cropping systems and physical characteristics across counties, differences in groundwater contamination potential are more fully revealed.

J	Harding, LW; Perry, ES				Harding, LW; Perry, ES			Long-term increase of phytoplankton biomass in Chesapeake Bay, 1950-1994	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						phytoplankton biomass; historical trends; eutrophication; estuaries; Chesapeake Bay	SAN-FRANCISCO BAY; DELAWARE ESTUARY; CHLOROPHYLL CONCENTRATIONS; COASTAL EUTROPHICATION; NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT; ANNUAL CYCLE; RIVER; DYNAMICS; PRODUCTIVITY; LIGHT	An analysis of historical and recent data on chlorophyll a for Chesapeake Bay reveals that a significant increase of phytoplankton biomass has occurred during the last 40 to 50 yr. Concentrations of chlorophyll a in the surface mixing layer have increased 5- to 10-fold in the seaward regions of the estuary and 1.5- to 2-fold elsewhere, paralleling published estimates of increased loading of N and P to the estuary since World War II. The characteristic high variability of freshwater flow that occurs on seasonal to interannual time scales, however, drives fluctuations of chlorophyll a that are superimposed on this apparent upward trend, potentially obscuring the effects of overenrichment on chlorophyll a concentrations in nutrient-limited regions of the Bay. To resolve a time trend of chlorophyll from this variability, we developed regional models of mean, monthly chlorophyll a using autoregressive moving average (ARMA) procedures. The models were developed with water quality data from monitoring cruises of the Chesapeake Bay Program spanning 1984 to 1992. The approach was to: (1) determine the relationship of prominent variables, including freshwater flow, salinity, temperature, region, and time of year, to chlorophyll a for the 'modern' Bay; (2) predict chlorophyll a for the 'historical' Bay based on these models and actual, observed variables for periods from 1950 to 1984 for which chlorophyll a data were available; (3) compare chlorophyll a predicted from modern relationships, to those observed in the past, using the residuals to identify deviations below or above expected concentrations that would suggest an effect on chlorophyll a unrelated to flow variability. The results show that: (1) observed and predicted chlorophyll a concentrations matched reasonably well for the years that were used to develop the models, with some exceptions when the models failed to capture extremely high concentrations of chlorophyll a during blooms; (2) chlorophyll a concentrations in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s were predominantly lower than predicted by the models, particularly in the mesohaline and polyhaline regions of the estuary that are most susceptible to nutrient limitation; (3) chlorophyll a concentrations were lower in the 1960s than in the 1970s, probably as the result of low flow and a concomitant reduction of nutrient loading in the 'dry' 1960s as compared to the 'wet' 1970s; (4) interannual variability was high for both observed and predicted chlorophyll a concentrations in the 1970s, and this variability was most strongly expressed in the mesohaline to polyhaline Bay, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of phytoplankton that prevailed in that period. These findings support the hypothesis that a significant increase of chlorophyll a has occurred in the lower Bay that cannot be accounted for by variability of freshwater flow and attendant properties.

The samples were taken at six different depths of the oligotrophic Lake Lustsee (Germany). Simultaneously the water quality of the lake was characterized by determination of physical and chemical parameters. 153 taxa (147 species) of diatoms were found. The comparison of the diatom associations by similarity index showed three different zones. The analysis of depth distribution of the 13 main species and some other important species confirmed the division into these three zones.

J	Groffman, PM; Hanson, GC				Groffman, PM; Hanson, GC			Wetland denitrification: Influence of site quality and relationships with wetland delineation protocols	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL			English	Article							RIPARIAN WETLANDS; NITROGEN MINERALIZATION; TEMPORAL PATTERNS; WATER-QUALITY; ECOSYSTEMS; FOREST; SOILS; RATES	Denitrification, the microbial conversion of NO3- to N gases, is important to wetland biogeochemistry and water quality maintenance functions. We measured denitrification along toposequences from forested upland-wetland transition zones to red maple wetlands in Rhode Island. The sites were located on different soil parent materials derived from different geomorphic features including glacial outwash, granitic glacial till, basaltic glacial till, and alluvium. Each toposequence contained four or five different natural soil drainage classes. We assessed spatial and temporal variation in denitrification relative to site quality (parent material), water table dynamics, hydric soil and hydrophytic vegetation status, and a ''growing season'' defined as soil temperature >5 degrees C. Denitrification rate was measured by intensive sampling during a 2-yr period using an acetylene-based intact soil tore method. Annual estimates of denitrification were produced by extrapolating measured rates over the intervals between sample dates. Soils that were very poorly drained or that had developed on nutrient-rich parent materials had higher denitrification than more well-drained and/or less fertile soils. Nitrogen inputs from adjacent ecosystems also appeared to be a key regulator of denitrification rates. Annual denitrification ranged from 1 to >130 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and was lower in Year 2 than in Year 1 in all soils. There were poor relationships between spatial and temporal patterns of denitrification and patterns of hydric soils and hydrophytic vegetation within the wetlands. Wetland delineation and classification protocols based on soils, vegetation, or hydrology do not appear to encompass the capacity of a wetland to support denitrification.

J	Mason, IG				Mason, IG			Performance of a facultative waste stabilization pond treating dairy shed wastewater	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						dairy shed facultative; nitrogen; oxygen demand phosphorus; waste stabilization pond; wastewater		A facultative waste stabilization pond treating anaerobically pre-treated dairy shed (milking parlor) wastewater was studied in order to investigate the oxygen demand transformation ability of the pond, the oxygen demand distribution between total and soluble components and to assess nutrient removal performance. Total BOD5 levels entering the pond averaged 159 g/m(3) and effluent soluble BOD5 levels averaged 18 g/m(3), representing an 89% removal of the total incoming BOD5. On a soluble BOD5 only basis the removal through the pond averaged 81%. These data represent a reasonably good level of oxygen demand transformation performance for a facultative pond system. The proportions of soluble BOD5 to total BOD5 averaged 0.61 for influent to the pond and 0.25 for effluent from the pond. Total COD concentrations entering and leaving the pond were relatively high, averaging 884 g/m(3) and 618 g/m(3) respectively, yielding COD:BOD5 ratios of 5.6:1 and 8.5:1. Suspended solids were associated with 41% and 75% of the total effluent COD and BOD5, respectively. Ratios of insoluble BOD5:SS averaged 0.20 and 0.27 for influent and effluent, respectively, whilst biodegradable fractions were estimated at 0.21 g-BSS/g-SS and 0.28 g-BSS/g-SS. Nitrogen removals were relatively low, at 25% for total kjeldhal nitrogen, giving an average effluent concentration of 129 g/m(3), while for ammonia the figures were 30% and 100 g/m(3), respectively. Nitrogenous oxygen demand was not typically exerted in the pond. A low degree of total and dissolved reactive phosphorus removal occurred, with effluent concentrations averaging 23.9 g/m(3) and 12.7 g/m(3), respectively. At an estimated applied total organic loading rate of 30 kg-BODu/ha-d the pond was well underloaded in relation to both conventional design practice and maximum theoretical algal oxygen production. Tertiary treatments able to remove suspended solids offer the potential for substantial reduction in effluent BOD concentrations. In order to meet proposed water quality criteria in New Zealand, effluent dilutions of up to 1850:1 were indicated from this study, with dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) identified as the key parameters. Future research into the reduction of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and dissolved reactive phosphorus in dairy shed wastewaters is recommended.

Comparison of observed and calculated values showed that (i) seasonal variations in the biomass of Microcystis spp, were well-predicted with respect to the timing and magnitude of algal bloom, and (ii) the concentration of chlorophyll a, as an indicator of the total biomass of phytoplankton, was well predicted in general. The resultant correlations for the other species, however, showed that model learning was insufficient to effectively predict species biomass; thereby indicating that some unknown factors which are not represented by the set of water quality parameters used as model input data affect phytoplankton growth. A sensitivity analysis performed on input parameters showed that chlorophyll a concentration was mainly affected by PO4-P concentration, while cyanobacteria and diatom species were affected by NO3-N and NH4-N concentrations, respectively. These results indicate that the ''algal bloom'' ANN model achieved reasonable effectiveness with respect to learning the relationship between the selected water quality parameters and algal bloom.

During the years 1982 to 1989 research was done on several sewer systems, all of them equiped with a single overflow weir. Pollutant emissions were calculated from the measurements, whereby each storm was considered as a single event. Extreme emissions have a detrimental, sometimes even desastrous effect on water quality. Such extreme emissions are the result of heavy storms, giving it a low frequency of occurrence. From the measurements a statistical model was developed enabling the user to forecast extreme waste emissions with a certain return period in a range of 2 to 10 years. Five pollutants are put in the model: BOD, GOD, Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphate and suspended solids. The model operates with standardized emission values in kg per ha of impervious area. When the model is used in practice the runoff area to the specific overflow under consideration has to be known. (C) 1997 IAWQ. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The purpose of this paper is to present a brief review of key processes regulating pollutant removal and identify potential indicators that can be measured to evaluate treatment efficiency. Carbon and toxic organic compound removal efficiency can be determined by measuring soil or water oxygen demand, microbial biomass, soil Eh and pH. Similarly, nitrate removal can be predicted by dissolved organic C and microbial biomass. Phosphorus retention can be described by the availability of reactive Fe and Al in acid soils and Ca and Mg in alkaline soils.

A computer model has been developed to simulate the fate and transport of copper introduced to a wetland ecosystem. Modeled water quality variables include phytoplankton biomass and productivity; macrophyte (Nelumbo lutea) biomass; total phosphorus in the water column; dissolved copper in the water column and sediments; particulate copper in the water column and sediments; and suspended solids. The model was calibrated using total phosphorus and chlorophyll a data from the Old Woman Creek wetland in Ohio. Verification of the model was achieved using data on the copper content of the macrophyte Nelumbo lutea.

The model also showed that managing pond water levels to maintain a minimum 7.5-cm water storage potential reduced average discharge of nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic matter in pond overflow by about 70% compared with ponds not managed to maintain storage potential. The model further showed that harvesting fish without draining ponds between fish crops could reduce average annual nutrient and organic matter discharge by over 60% relative to annually drained ponds. Maintaining water storage potential and not draining ponds between fish crops therefore appear to be simple and effective methods of reducing waste discharge from aquaculture ponds and have the added benefit of substantially reducing the need for pumped water to maintain pond water levels.

These very long-term N treatments have increased total soil N content, relative to the plot never receiving fertilizer N (N-0), due to the greater return of organic N to the soil in roots, root exudates, stubble, etc (the straw is not incorporated). The application of 144 kg N/ha for 135 years has increased total soil N content by 21%, or 570 kg/ha (0-23 cm). Other plots given smaller applications of N for the same time show smaller increases; these differences were established within 30 years. Increases in total soil N content have been detected after 20 years in the plot given 192 kg N/ha since 1968 (N-4). There was a proportionally greater increase in N mineralization. Crop uptake of mineralized N was typically 12-30 kg N/ha greater from the N-3 and N-4 treatments than the uptake of c. 30 kg N/ha from the N-0 treatment. Results from laboratory incubations show the importance of recently added residues (roots, stubble, etc) on N mineralization. In short-term (2-3 week) incubations, with soil sampled at harvest, N mineralization was up to 60% greater from the N-3 treatment than from N-0. In long-term incubations, or in soil without recently added residues, differences between long-term fertilizer treatments were much less marked. Inputs of organic N to the soil from weeds (principally Equisetum arvense L.) to the N-0-N-2 plots over the last few years may have partially obscured any underlying differences in mineralization. The long-term fertilizer treatments appeared to have had no effect on soil microbial biomass N or carbon (C) content, but have increased the specific mineralization rate of the biomass (defined as N mineralized per unit of biomass). Greater N mineralization will also increase losses of N from the system, via leaching and gaseous emissions. In December 1988 the N-3 and N-4 plots contained respectively 14 and 23 kg/ha more inorganic N in the profile (0-100 cm) than the N-0 plot, due to greater N mineralization. These small differences are important as it only requires 23 kg N/ha to be leached from Broadbalk to increase the nitrate concentration of percolating water above the 1980 EC Drinking Water Quality Directive limit of 11.3 mg N/I. The use of fertilizer N has increased N mineralization due to the build-up of soil organic N. In addition, much of the organic N in Broadbalk topsoil is now derived from fertilizer N. A computer model of N mineralization on Broadbalk estimated that after applying 144 kg N/ha for 140 years, up to half of the N mineralized each year was originally derived from fertilizer N. In the short-term, the amount of fertilizer N applied usually has little direct effect on losses of N over winter. In most years little fertilizer-derived N remains in Broadbalk soil in inorganic form at harvest from applications of up to 192 kg N/ha. However, in two very dry years (1989 and 1990) large inorganic N residues remained at harvest where 144 and 192 kg N/ha had been applied, even though the crop continued to respond to fertilizer N, up to at least 240 kg N/ha.

J	Wu, JS; Holman, RE; Dorney, JR				Wu, JS; Holman, RE; Dorney, JR			Systematic evaluation of pollutant removal by urban wet detention ponds	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article								Three urban wet detention ponds in the Piedmont of North Carolina were monitored to investigate long-term pollutant removal as a function of surface to area ratios. Eleven storm events were monitored over a sampling period of 13 months. Urban runoff originating from the study area was characterized by event-mean concentrations for total suspended solids (135 mg/L), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (0.88 mg/L), total iron (6.11 mg/L), and total zinc (66 ug/L). Concentrations of copper and lead were consistently below the detection limits of 30 ug/L and 100 ug/L, respectively. The observed event-mean concentrations were generally lower than the national values reported by the Nationwide Urban Runoff Program. Particle sizes of sediment discharged in runoff were much finer than the national averages due to the predominant clayey soils in the region. This study demonstrates that surface to area ratio can be a useful predictor of wet pond performance. Utilizing 1-2% of the watershed area for the development of wet detention ponds at strategic locations could reduce pollutant loadings to meet targeted requirements of water quality improvement.

J	Mattikalli, NM; Richards, KS				Mattikalli, NM; Richards, KS			Estimation of surface water quality changes in response to land use change: Application of the export coefficient model using remote sensing and geographical information system	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						nitrogen concentration; land use change; fertilizer usage; export coefficient model; remote sensing; geographical information system (GIS)	UNITED-KINGDOM; CLASSIFICATION; INTEGRATION; BRITAIN	A trend of increasing solute (i.e. nitrogen and phosphorus) concentrations in surface water has been observed in the recent past. Solute concentrations have often exceeded the World Health Organization directives on the quality of drinking water. In predominantly rural watersheds of developed countries, increasing solute concentrations have been attributed to agricultural intensification (i.e. land use change) and increased fertilizer usage. This paper presents an approach based on remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) to estimate and hindcast water quality changes using historical land use data for a watershed in eastern England. The water quality, as indexed by the nitrogen loading, was estimated using the export coefficient model. The model calculates solute loading at the outlet of a watershed using land use data, fertilizer application rates and export coefficients. Historical land use data were derived from a variety of sources including maps, aerial photographs and remotely-sensed Landsat and SPOT satellite images. Export coefficients indicate the proportion of the total nutrient lost to the surface water, and determine the amount of nutrient loading from various land use types. Export coefficients for various land use classes were compiled from literature. A GIS was necessary to store, manipulate and analyse large volumes of land use data, and to carry out land use change analysis. A number of special GIS routines were developed to carryout the model computations automatically. Results demonstrated that the model estimates nitrogen loading with an acceptable degree of accuracy. Analysis showed an overall increase of nitrogen loading from 1931-1984, after which it remained steady. Experiments were carried out to identify the separate effects of land use and fertilizer application on the nitrogen loading. The export coefficient model operating in a GIS has significant potential for the rapid estimation of surface water quality using land use data derived from remotely sensed satellite images.

J	Sharpley, A; Smith, SJ; Zollweg, JA; Coleman, GA				Sharpley, A; Smith, SJ; Zollweg, JA; Coleman, GA			Gully treatment and water quality in the Southern Plains	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article							AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF; BIOAVAILABLE PHOSPHORUS; PREDICTION; TRANSPORT; PAPER; SOILS	Erosion of agricultural land and transport of associated fertilizer chemicals nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in runoff, can be detrimental to both soil productivity and water quality. In the Southern Plains, gully erosion is of concern due to periodically intense rainfall and a large acreage of erodible soils. As little information is available, we studied the loss of sediment, N, and P in runoff over 13 yr (1980-1992) from two adjacent extensively gullied native grass watersheds (3.8 and 5.7 ha of 5% slope and class 4 erosion) in the Little Washita River Basin, OK. In 1983, the gullies on one of the watersheds were treated by land shaping, Midland Bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers] establishment, and construction of a runoff detention pond. Prior to gully treatment, greater (p > 0.05) amounts of sediment, N, and P were lost from the subsequently treated than untreated watershed. Following gully treatment, 27,500 kg sediment, 7.1 kg N, and 4.1 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) were lost from the gullied watershed, while only 4,900 kg sediment, 3.1 kg N, and 1.6 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) were lost from the treated watershed. While gully treatment had no effect on nitrate-N and ammonium-N loss, dissolved P and bioavailable P lasses were increased six- and three-fold, respectively. This was attributed to the application of fertilizer N and P to the treated watershed only. The loss of N and P in runoff from gullied and treated watersheds was accurately predicted using kinetic and enrichment ratio approaches with soil properties reflecting the main zone of runoff and soil interaction. Subsoil (5-20 nn) properties accurately predicted N and P release and transport in runoff from the gullied watershed, whereas accurate predictions for kilt treated watershed were obtained with surface soil (0-5 cm) properties. The cost of gully treatment was $1,098 ha(-1), with a reduced loss of 210 kg sediment, 5 g N, and 3 g P in the ensuing 10 years for every dollar spent on treatment.

J	Wall, GJ; Bos, AW; Marshall, AH				Wall, GJ; Bos, AW; Marshall, AH			The relationship between phosphorus and suspended sediment loads in Ontario watersheds	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article								The loss of sediments and nutrients from land surfaces to surface water supplies continues to be an important source of nonpoint source pollution. The close relationship between loadings of suspended solids and total phosphorus has been reported in many studies. This study was initiated to develop an empirical relationship between phosphorus and suspended solid loadings in the Canadian Great Lakes basin. Annual loadings of suspended solid and total phosphorus were collected from agricultural surface water quality studies carried out in Ontario. Various study factors such as plot, field and watershed sizes, as well as method, loadings, and references, were documented and annual loading values were plotted as the ratio of annual phosphorus/suspended solids loading versus the unit area suspended solid loaning. sued on this plot, the following regression equation was developed: y = 18.83x(0.329) where x = unit area suspended solids load (kg/Ha/yr); y = ratio of phosphorus to suspended solids loading(kg/ton). The resulting r(2) value was 0.62. This equation shows an exponential enrichment relationship of the phosphorus to suspended solid ratio with the unit area suspended solids loading, regardless of drainage area size. Variation between the plotted data points and the generated line of best fit may be a result of watershed activities or varying methodologies used to develop parameter loadings. The equation enables a reasonable prediction of phosphorus loads for known sediment loadings.
