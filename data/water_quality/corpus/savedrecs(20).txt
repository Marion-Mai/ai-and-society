An intensive water quality study of the lower Mert stream, located in Samsun, in the mid-Black Sea coast of Turkey, was performed examining dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, total phosphate - phosphorus, nitrogen derivatives, stream hydrology, and major inputs. In this study, the Enhanced Stream Water Quality Model "QUAL2E" was applied to evaluate the present and future water pollution loads in the Mert stream. The QUAL2E was calibrated and validated using data collected between seasonally averaged values in 2002. The success of the model can also be judged by the ability of the model to represent the system under different conditions. Following the calibration, the model was run by applying the existing condition and different scenarios. For the existing conditions, pollution load transported from the Mert river to the Black Sea was calculated. In addition, simulations were made for different scenarios, including the best and worst case management conditions. Thus, this study also analyzed the impact of remediation and improvement in the water quality of the Mert Stream.

The plants were grown in six NH4+-N concentrations (0.05, 0.50, 1.00, 3.50, 5.00 and 10.00 mg/L) for six days. NH4+-N levels in excess of 0.50 mg/L inhibited the plant growth. The relationships between external NH4+-N availability and total nitrogen (TN), protein-N, free amino acid-N (FAA-N) and NH4+-N in plant tissues, respectively, conformed to a logarithmic model suggesting that a feedback inhibition mechanism may exist for ammonium uptake. The response of starch to NH4+-N was fitted with a negative, logarithmic curve. Detailed analysis revealed that the influx NH4+-N had been efficiently incorporated into organic-N and eventually stored as protein at the expense of starch accumulation. These data suggest that this species may be able to tolerate high levels of ammonium when dissolved oxygen is sufficient.

Phytoplankton nutrient limitation in a polymictic eutrophic lake: community versus species-specific responses	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY			English	Article						cyanobacteria; Anabaena; Microcystis; chlorophytes; diatoms; light	SHALLOW SUBTROPICAL LAKE; VOLCANIC PLATEAU LAKES; NEW-ZEALAND; MICROCYSTIS-AERUGINOSA; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; GROWTH; CYANOBACTERIA; AVAILABILITY; ROTORUA	Phytoplankton nutrient limitation was examined in polymictic, eutrophic Lake Rotorua, New Zealand using three in situ incubation experiments of 4 to 6 days' duration in summer 2004. Two of the incubations were conducted during stratification, and one immediately after breakdown of stratification. Samples were enriched with ammonium (1 mg NH4-N L-1), phosphate (0.1 mg PO4-P L-1) or with both nutrients. A control containing no added nutrients was used for comparison. Phytoplankton responses to nutrient additions were determined at a species level from cell counts and at a community level from changes in chlorophyll-a concentration. Phytopiankton biomass generally responded to N plus P additions to a greater extent than with single nutrient additions, though results were often not statistically significant. Increase in community biomass was greater for P than N, and nutrient demand decreased after breakdown of stratification. Individual species responded differently to N and P additions, suggesting co-limitation within the phytoplankton species assemblage. A simple, dynamic phytoplankton growth limitation model, with time-varying responses to hourly inputs of temperature, nutrients and light, was applied to consider the interacting effects of phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N) and light. Model results indicate that light plays a major role in regulating phytoplankton biomass, although there were periods of P limitation. For the management of water quality in Lake Rotorua it is suggested that simultaneous reductions in external inputs of both N and P is mostly likely to reduce phytoplankton biomass, including cyanobacterial populations.			david.burger@wldelft.nl	Hamilton, David/ABI-6870-2020; Hamilton, David P/F-5039-2012; Hamilton, David/AAI-9851-2020	Hamilton, David/0000-0002-9341-8777; Hamilton, David P/0000-0002-9341-8777; 			ALDRIDGE FJ, 1993, ARCH HYDROBIOL, V127, P21; ARAR EJ, 1992, INVITRO DETERMINATIO; Baker P.

Long-term limnological research and monitoring at Crater Lake, Oregon	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Crater Lake; limnology; lake monitoring; water quality; secchi disk	PRODUCTIVITY; TRANSPARENCY; TAHOE	Crater Lake is located in the caldera of Mount Mazama in Crater Lake National Park, Oregon. The lake has a surface area of about 53 km(2) at an elevation of 1882 m and a maximum depth of 594 m. Limited studies of this ultraoligotrophic lake conducted between 1896 and 1981, lead to a 10-year limnological study to evaluate any potential degradation of water quality. No long-term variations in water quality were observed that could be attributed to anthropogenic activity. Building on the success of this study, a permanent limnological program has been established with a long-term monitoring program to insure a reliable data base for use in the future. Of equal importance, this program serves as a research platform to develop and communicate to the public a better understanding of the coupled biological, physical, and geochemical processes in the lake and its surrounding environment.

Assessing the hydrological suitability of floodplains for species-rich meadow restoration: a case study of the Thames floodplain, UK	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	General Assembly of the European-Geosciences-Union	APR 02-07, 2006	Vienna, AUSTRIA	European Geosci Union		floodplain meadow; restoration; conservation target; flooding regime; hydrology; Thames	ARABLE CLAY SOIL; WATER-QUALITY; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; LOWLAND GRASSLAND; RIVER THAMES; RE-CREATION; ESTABLISHMENT; SITE; CONSERVATION; LAND	The physical and chemical environment of a floodplain needs to be assessed to define conservation targets for restoring it to species-rich meadows from agricultural land. A straightforward technique, widely applicable by site managers for assessing the suitability of the hydrological and hydro-chemical regime of a floodplain for wet grassland restoration, has been tested by examining the feasibility of restoring plants characteristic of NVC MG4 and MG8 communities to the Castle Meadows, Wallingford (Oxfordshire, UK). Hydro-chemical suitability has been assessed by comparing phosphorus concentrations with species-rich meadows nearby. The flooding regime was estimated based on a rating curve and a digital elevation model and groundwater levels were measured monthly in dipwells and piezometers. The hydrological regime was then compared with published reference guidelines for communities of conservation interest. For the Castle Meadows, the maximum duration of flood events in autumn and winter exceeded MG4 and MG8 species requirements across half of the site, while the depth of the groundwater table in summer exceeded species requirements in the other half. It was shown that, depending on topography, MG5 or MG13 may be more realistic vegetation targets.

Eutrophication control in river-systems: an application of INCA-P to the River Lugg	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article						water quality; model; INCA-P; nutrient; phosphorus; catchment; Lugg; Wye	STREAM PHOSPHORUS; EPIPHYTE DYNAMICS; MODEL STRUCTURE; WATER-QUALITY; CATCHMENT; MACROPHYTE; TRANSPORT; FRAMEWORK	The Integrated Catchments model of Phosphorus dynamics (INCA-P) was applied to the River Lugg to determine the key factors controlling delivery of phosphorus to the main channel and to quantify the relative contribution of diffuse and point sources to the in-stream phosphorus (P) load under varying hydrological conditions. The model is able to simulate the seasonal variations and inter-annual variations in the in-stream total-phosphorus concentrations. However, difficulties in simulating diffuse inputs arise due to equifinality in the model structure and parameters. The River Lugg is split into upper and lower reaches. The upper reaches are dominated by grassland and woodland, so the patterns in the stream-water total-phosphorus concentrations are typical of diffuse source inputs; application of the model leads to estimates of the relative contribution to the in-stream P load from diffuse and point sources as 9:1. In the lower reaches, which are more intensively cultivated and urbanised, the stream-water total-phosphorus concentration dynamics are influenced more by point-sources; the simulated relative diffuse/point contribution to the in-stream P load is 1: 1. The model set-up and simulations are used to identify the key source-areas of P in the catchment, the P contribution of the Lugg to the River Wye during years with contrasting precipitation inputs, and the uptake and release of P from within-reach sediment. In addition, model scenarios are run to identify the impacts of likely P reductions at sewage treatment works on the in-stream soluble-reactive P concentrations and the suitability of this as a management option is assessed for reducing eutrophication.

The model simulates nitrogen and phosphorus processes in soils, groundwaters and river systems and can be applied in a semi-distributed manner at a range of scales. In this study, the model has been applied at field to sub-catchment to whole catchment scale to evaluate the behaviour of biosolid-derived losses of P in agricultural systems. It is shown that process-based models such as INCA, applied at a wide range of scales, reproduce field and catchment behaviour satisfactorily. The INCA model can also be used to generate generic information for risk assessment. By adjusting three key variables: biosolid application rates, the hydrological connectivity of the catchment and the initial P-status of the soils within the model, a matrix of P loss rates can be generated to evaluate the behaviour of the model and, hence, of the catchment system. The results, which indicate the sensitivity of the catchment to flow paths, to application rates and to initial soil conditions, have been incorporated into a Nutrient Export Risk Matrix (NERM).

Integrated Nitrogen CAtchment model (INCA) applied to a tropical catchment in the Atlantic Forest, Sao Paulo, Brazil	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article						Atlantic Forest; tropics; N-modelling; hydrology; nitrogen dynamics; INCA; atmospheric deposition; Cunha	MULTIPLE SOURCE ASSESSMENT; EQUATIONS; DYNAMICS; ENGLAND; FLUXES; WALES; STATE; SERRA; TIME	Stream-water flows and in-stream nitrate and ammonium concentrations in a small (36.7 ha) Atlantic Forest catchment were simulated using the Integrated Nitrogen in CAtchments (INCA) model version 1.9.4. The catchment, at Cunha, is in the Serra do Mar State Park, SE Brazil and is nearly pristine because the nearest major conurbations, Sao Paulo and Rio, are some 450 km distant. However, intensive farming may increase nitrogen (N) deposition and there are growing pressures for urbanisation. The mean-monthly discharges and NO(3)-N concentration dynamics were simulated adequately for the calibration and validation periods with (simulated) loss rates of 6.55 kg.ha(-1) yr(-1) for NO(3)-N and 3.85 kg.ha(-1) yr(-1) for NH(4)-N. To investigate the effects of elevated levels of N deposition in the future, various scenarios for atmospheric deposition were simulated; the highest value corresponded to that in a highly polluted area of Atlantic Forest in Sao Paulo City. It was found that doubling the atmospheric deposition generated a 25% increase in the N leaching rate, while at levels approaching the highly polluted Sao Paulo deposition rate, five times higher than the current rate, leaching increased by 240%, which would create highly eutrophic conditions, detrimental to downstream water quality. The results indicate that the INCA model can be useful for estimating N concentration and fluxes for different atmospheric deposition rates and hydrological conditions.

Uncertainties in selected river water quality data	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							TRACE-ELEMENT CONCENTRATIONS; SUSPENDED SEDIMENT; SAMPLING STRATEGIES; CHLOROPHYLL; PREDICTION; PRECISION; TRANSPORT; REGIMES; TRENDS; BIAS	Monitoring of surface waters is primarily done to detect the status and trends in water quality and to identify whether observed trends arise from natural or anthropogenic causes. Empirical quality of river water quality data is rarely certain and knowledge of their uncertainties is essential to assess the reliability of water quality models and their predictions. The objective of this paper is to assess the uncertainties in selected river water quality data, i.e. suspended sediment, nitrogen fraction, phosphorus fraction, heavy metals and biological compounds. The methodology used to structure the uncertainty is based on the empirical quality of data and the sources of uncertainty in data (van Loon et at., 2005). A literature review was carried out including additional experimental data of the Elbe river. All data of compounds associated with suspended particulate matter have considerable higher sampling uncertainties than soluble concentrations. This is due to high variability within the cross section of a given river. This variability is positively correlated with total suspended particulate matter concentrations. Sampling location has also considerable effect on the representativeness of a water sample. These sampling uncertainties are highly site specific. The estimation of uncertainty in sampling can only be achieved by taking at least a proportion of samples in duplicates. Compared to sampling uncertainties, measurement and analytical uncertainties are much lower. Instrument quality can be stated well suited for field and laboratory situations for all considered constituents. Analytical errors can contribute considerably to the overall uncertainty of river water quality data. Temporal autocorrelation of river water quality data is present but literature on general behaviour of water quality compounds is rare. For meso scale river catchments (500-3000 km(2)) reasonable yearly dissolved load calculations can be achieved using biweekly sample frequencies. For suspended sediments none of the methods investigated produced very reliable load estimates when weekly concentrations data were used. Uncertainties associated with loads estimates based on infrequent samples will decrease with increasing size of rivers.

Assessing the model performance of an integrated hydrological and biogeochemical model for discharge and nitrate load predictions	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							RIVER-BASIN; SWAT MODEL; LAND-USE; AUTOMATIC CALIBRATION; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; NITROGEN DYNAMICS; SIMULATION-MODEL; WATER-QUALITY; PART I	In this study, we evaluate the performance of the SWAT-N model, a modified version of the widely used SWAT version, for discharge and nitrate predictions at the mesoscale Dill catchment (Germany) for a 5-year period. The underlying question is, whether the model efficiency is sufficient for scenario analysis of land-use changes on both water quantity and quality. The Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE-UA) algorithm is used to calibrate the model for daily discharge at the catchments outlet. Model performance is assessed with a split-sampling as well as a proxy-basin test using recorded hydrographs of four additional gauges located within the catchment. The efficiency regarding nitrate load simulation is assessed without further calibration on a daily, log-daily, weekly, and monthly basis as compared to observations derived from an intensive sampling campaign conducted at the catchments outlet. A new approach is employed to test the spatial consistency of the model, where simulated longitudinal profiles of nitrate concentrations were compared with observed longitudinal profiles. It is concluded that the model efficiency of SWAT-N is sufficient for the assessment of scenarios for daily discharge predictions. SWAT-N can be employed without further calibration for nitrate load simulations on both a weekly and monthly basis with an acceptable degree of accuracy. However, the model efficiency for daily nitrate load is insufficient, which can be attributed to both data uncertainty (i.e. point-source effluents and actual farming practise) as well as structural errors. The simulated longitudinal profiles meet the observations reasonably well, which suggests that the model is spatially consistent.

The chlorophyll-a concentration in coastal waters is generally overestimated from ocean color satellite data with common algorithm. In order to improve the remotely-sensed estimation of chlorophyll-a, many efforts have been made. In this study, six cruises for in situ data collection were conducted in lower reaches of the Pearl River and its estuary, the Lingdingyang, from 2003 to 2006. And the variables such as temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-a, total suspended matters (TSM), nutrients and gelbstoff absorption coefficient (Ag) were collected. The in situ remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) were measured from above waters with an Ocean Optics USB2000 spectrometer, which covers wavelength from 200 to 850 nm with spectral resolution of 0.38 nm. The original in situ Rrs data were processed to EO-1/hyperion bands (at resolution about 10 not), and the derivative spectra with the different spectral resolutions were analyzed. The statistic analysis shows that the relative coefficient between derivative spectrum and chlorophyll-a is higher than that between original spectrum and chlorophyll-a. The band with highest relative coefficient to chlorophyll-a was employed for development of chlorophyll-a retrieval algorithm. A derivative spectrum algorithm was developed, and then applied to EO-1/hyperion data, which were acquired in December 16, 2006. The distribution image maps of chlorophyll-a concentration retrieved from EO-1/hyperion data were obtained. It shows that the derivative spectral method is an alternative approach for detection of water quality in coastal waters.

This paper constructed a Bio-optical model in Taihu Lake based on the optical property of water active constituents, and then the Bio-optical model was used to create reflectance data sets corresponding to the central channel wavelengths of the channels of MODIS instrument in 400nm-700nm, which are often considered in water constituents inversion. Lastly, the datasets which are created by Bio-optical model trained and constructed a NN model for water constituents inversion. The study showed that combination of Bio-optical model and NN technology is a very useful method for water quality monitoring in Taihu Lake.

Especially, internal pollution by nutrient remobilization from sediment plays an important role in shallow water bodies. In this paper results of a water quality simulation framework for shallow lakes of the River Havel are presented. The framework consists of a simulation model combined with a multicriteria optimization procedure. Model state variables are phytoplankton, zooplankton, orthophosphate phosphorus, ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen. External driving forces are photoperiod, solar radiation and water temperature. For water quality management two control strategies are discussed.

There to two approaches for the simulation of the transport of water and the transport and transformation of nitrogen in the stream were tested and compared. Both approaches use the DRAINMOD and the DRAINMOD-N models to simulate the hydrology and the nitrogen balance of the land phase at the scale of a field/field block/sub-catchment. Both models are used to generate the drain outflow and the nitrate concentration of the drainage water of the field unit considered. The contribution of the field units to the nutrient load of the river are calculated by multiplying the simulated flow weighted N concentrations with drain outflows. In a first approach, called the lumped approach, the water discharge and the nutrient load of field blocks are routed through the river using an exponential friodel. In this model the nitrate contribution of an individual field block to the nitrate load in the river outlet is calculated assuming first order nutrient decay/attenuation during the transport of the drainage water from the field outlet to the river outlet. The arrival at the outlet section of the nitrate plumes of the field blocks are phased in time based on the velocity profile in the river. The second approach, herein called the complex approach is using the hydraulic river modeling code MIKE 11. This model is using a complex process ADR (advective-dispersive-reactive) equation to calculate the chemical changes in the river water. The comparative analysis between both routing approaches reveals that the lumped approach is able to predict sufficiently accurate nutrient load at the catchment outlet. The complex approach has the advantage of giving a more accurate estimate of the nutrient load at the catchment outlet, resulting in a more precise modeling of the transport and transformation of the nutrient load in streams.

Also, a new interpolation procedure is developed and used jointly with the advanced bio-optical and standard window-split algorithms to generate from SeaWiFS and AVHRR data the time series of spatial and temporal (seasonal and interannual) variations of chl, sm, doc and water surface temperature (T-S) for the period 1998-2004 in Lake Ladoga, the largest European fresh water body. Obtained for the first time, the spaceborne fields of the above variables have revealed at an unprecedented time and space resolution some intrinsic features and interdependence of thermal and biogeochemical processes in the lake. Rates of thermobar displacement from the littoral zone to the central deep water area are quantified during periods of lake warming and cooling. From spring to mid-summer, the dynamics of phytoplankton biomass spatial distribution are evidenced to follow the retraction of the cold water zone bordered by the thermobar. Importantly, along with the thermobar dynamics, the zones of the most enhanced phytoplankton concentration are concurrently governed by the lake bathymetry, and thus gradually move from south to north along the eastern coast line. Brought with fluvial input, suspended minerals and allochthonous dissolved organics are not only restricted to the zones of major river deltas but also driven northward by coastal cyclonic currents prevailing in Lake Ladoga. The obtained space data allows the interplay of the above factors to be explicitly revealed and explains the observed interannual variations in the surficial expressions of biogeochemical processes inherent in Lake Ladoga.

Water quality gradients across Albemarle-Pamlico estuarine system: Seasonal variations and model applications	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						nutrient; chlorophyll a; dissolved oxygen; Neuse River; Pamlico Sound	NEUSE RIVER ESTUARY; EUTROPHICATION MODEL; NORTH-CAROLINA; DYNAMICS; HYPOXIA; CIRCULATION; WIND	The seasonal variations of water quality parameters as nitrite plus nitrate (NOx-), total phosphate (PO43-), chlorophyll a (ch1 a), and dissolved oxygen (DO) are analyzed across the Croatan-Roanoke-Albemarle-Pamlico-Core Sounds estuarine system (CAPES). Overall, several patterns are observed: The Chowan-Roanoke-Albemarle system is generally phosphorous limiting for phytoplankton growth, whereas both the Tar-Pamlico and the Neuse Rivers are generally nitrogen limiting. The largest PO43- gradients exist in the upstream portion of the Albemarle Sound, and the largest NOx- gradients exist in the lower Neuse and the Tar-Pamlico Rivers. Dissolved oxygen appears to have the strongest seasonal signal among the water quality variables, with highest DO values observed during winter (within the CAPES and in the nearshore area) or spring (in the continental shelf and deeper ocean) and lowest during summer. Chlorophyll a concentrations are highest during spring (within the CAPES) or winter (offshore). In contrast, the NOx- and PO43- concentrations in both the Tar-Pamlico and Neuse River estuaries are usually higher during the second half of the year. The time differences of the peak nutrient and ch1 a concentrations suggest that highest algal growth rate (and hence nutrient uptake rate) occurs during spring, and the consumed nutrients are released to the water column through a nutrient recycling method later in the year. A coupled three-dimensional hydrodynamic water quality model is then applied to the entire system. The general model setup and parameter derivation of the model is presented here. The basic observed water quality characteristics such as the nutrient limiting pattern and the spatial gradients across the system are reproduced in the model. The model results also suggest that nutrient fluxes, generated from the diagenesis of deposited organic matter and released from the sediment bed, could be an important mechanism for nutrient recycling in the region.

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 50, 800 - 804. Gold Coast, Australia, ISSN 0749.0208 In this study, a water quality model was developed to model the ecosystem in the Ariake Sea in Kyushu, Japan. The model simulates the dynamic of phytoplankton, zooplankton, nutrients, organic detritus and dissolved oxygen. Through the observed data and the simulated results, the characteristics of the sea were examined. We found that the concentrations of nutrients and other water quality constituents were high in summers, where as, dissolved oxygen concentration was low during the summer months, then elevated during the winter months. Moreover, high concentrations of nutrients and Chlorophyll-a were found in the inner part of the sea during the summer periods, when high discharge loadings from rivers and high release and resuspension from the bottom mud were predominant. Sensitivity analysis shows that the increase of nutrient loads would significantly result in the increase of phytoplankton biomass, especially during summer to early winter. The effects of loads reductions will be most pronounced in the river mouth areas.	[Hang, N. T. Minh] Saga Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Saga 8408502, Japan; [Araki, H.; Don, N.

Adverse effects caused by pyrites and sterile dump from Central pond area on environmental factors quality - groundwater and surface water	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						biotic and non-biotic components; anthropic influence; aquatic ecosystems; waste dump; groundwater		The paper presents results of the study on the emission sources based on the analyses of environment characteristics (underground and surface water) in emplacement and estimation of the potential effects on the environment. For assessment of the current situation of groundwater and surface water quality was developed a sampling program and some quality indicators (physicochemicals, biological and rnicrobiological) were determined: for underground water - 7 control wells in Central pond neighbourhood and 1 in pyrites dumps (near Central pond); for surface water - 4 sections placed on the Races and Sasar rivers upstream and downstream of pyrite dump near Central pond. For all samplings, the indicator values of sulphate, iron, manganese, cadmium are higher than the intervention threshold, and indicate a significant pollution. The pH values in all wells has acid character. For phytoplankton: the density of phytoplankton on the Sasar river (after confluence with the Racos river) is lower downstream of pyrite waste dump than the downstream the Racos section. Zooplankton is more sensitive to toxic action of heavy metals than phytoplankton, and it is absent in all control sections.

Alan			Relative effects of land use and near-stream chemistry on phosphorus in an urban stream	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							SOIL-PHOSPHORUS; RIVER BASIN; WATER; ZONE; RIPARIAN; SEDIMENTS; DYNAMICS; SORPTION; RELEASE; UPLAND	Elevated levels of P in urban streams can pose significant water quality problems. Sources of P in urban streams, however, are difficult to identify. It is important to recognize both natural and anthropogenic sources of F. We investigated near-stream chemistry and land use factors on stream water P in the urbanizing Johnson Creek watershed in Portland, OR, USA. We sampled stream water and shallow groundwater soluble reactive P (SRP) and total P (TP) and estimated P flux at 13 sites along the main stem of Johnson Creek, with eight sites in urban land use areas and five sites in nonurban land use areas. At each site, we sampled the A and B horizons, measuring soil pH, water-soluble P, acid-soluble F, base-soluble P, total P, Fe, and Al. We found continuous input of P to the stream water via shallow groundwater throughout the Johnson Creek watershed. The shallow groundwater P concentrations were correlated with stream water P within the nonurban area, however, this correlation was not found in the urban area, suggesting that other factors in the urban area masked the relationship between groundwater P and stream water P. Aluminum and Fe concentrations were inversely correlated with shallow groundwater P, suggesting that greater P adsorption to Al and Fe oxides in the nonurban area reduced availability of shallow groundwater F. Using stepwise multiple regression analysis, however, we concluded that while riparian soil chemistry was related to stream water P, land use patterns had a more significant relationship with stream water P concentrations in this urbanizing system..

The objective of this work was to determine the effect of ground cover on N export from pastured riparian areas receiving simulated rainfall. Plots were established on two adjacent sites in the North Carolina Piedmont: one of 10% slope with Appling sandy loam soils and a second of 20% slope with Wedowee sandy loam soils. Both sites had existing mixed tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.)-dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum Poir.) vegetation. Forage stands were modified to represent a range of ground cover levels: 0, 45, 70, and 95% (bare ground, low, medium, and high cover, respectively), and amended with beef steer (Bos taurus) feces and urine (similar to 200 kg N ha(-1)). For all rain events combined, mean nitrate N export was greatest from bare ground and was reduced by 34910 at low cover, which did not differ from high cover. Mean ammonium N export was slightly elevated (similar to 1.37 kg N ha(-1)) in months when manures were applied and negligible (< 0.02 kg N ha(-1)) in all other months. For all rain events combined, mean export of total N was greatest from bare ground and was reduced by at least 85% at all other cover levels. Whereas site did not impact N export, results indicated that cover and time of rainfall following manure deposition are important determinants of the impact of riparian grazing.

Long-term phosphorus immobilization by a drinking water treatment residual	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							COASTAL-PLAIN SOILS; REDUCE PHOSPHORUS; SORPTION CAPACITY; AMENDED SOILS; ALUMINUM; RETENTION; BIOSOLIDS; RUNOFF; SOLUBILITY; IRON	Excessive soluble P in runoff is a common cause of eutrophication in fresh waters. Evidence indicates that drinking water treatment residuals (WTRs) can reduce soluble P concentrations in P-impacted soils in the short term (days to weeks). The long-term (years) stability of WTR-immobilized P has been inferred, but validating field data are scarce. This research was undertaken at two Michigan field sites with a history of heavy manure applications to study the longevity of alum-based WTR (Al-WTR) effects on P solubility over time (7.5 yr). At both sites, amendment with Al-WTR reduced water-soluble P (WSP) concentration by >= 60% as compared to the control plots, and the Al-WTR-immobilized P (WTR-P) remained stable 7.5 yr after Al-WTR application. Rainfall simulation techniques were utilized to investigate P losses in runoff and leachate from surface soils of the field sites at 7.5 yr after Al-WTR application. At both sites, amendment with Al-WTR reduced dissolved P and bioavailable P (BAP) by > 50% as compared to the control plots, showing that WTR-immobilized P remained nonlabile even 7.5 yr after Al-WTR amendment. Thus, WTR-immobilized P would not be expected to dissolve into runoff and leachate to contaminate surface waters or groundwater. Even if WTR-P is lost via erosion to surface waters, the bioavailability of the immobilized P should be minimal and should have negligible effects on water quality. However, if the WTR particles are destroyed by extreme conditions, P loss to water could pose a eutrophication risk.

Rainfall, surface discharge water, and nutrient concentrations ( total nitrogen and total phosphorus) were monitored and used for ANN computation. A comparison study was conducted for two well- known algorithms in ANNs, Modular Neural Network ( MNN) and Generalized Regression Neural Network ( GRNN), to. nd a good modeling tool for the best management of the nutrients. The correlation coefficients ( R) for the resulting predictions from the networks versus measured values were generally in the range of 0.70 to 0.75 in surface discharge forecasting, and 0.49 to 0.77 in nutrient predictions. Overall, MNN showed better simulation results to describe the water and nutrient mass dynamics. This study also discussed the issues of network optimization and computational efficiency. The practical implication in this study showed that the ANN technique performs well in predicting the rainfall- surface discharge process, and has relatively acceptable predictions in water quality forecasting.

In this study, an ecological project was put forward for the excess propagation control of Cyclops by stocking the filter-feeding fishes such as silver carp and bighead carp under the condition of no extraneous nutrient feeding. The results of experiments with different stocking biomass showed that the propagation of Cyclops could be controlled effectively, and the water quality was improved simultaneously by impacting on nutriment level and plankton community structure at proper stocking density of 30 g/m(3) of water. The growth of Cyclops may not be effectually controlled with lower biomass of fish (10 g), and the natural food chain relation may be destroyed for Cyclops dying out in water while the intense stocking of 120 g per cubic meter of water. In addition, the high predator pressure may accelerate supplemental rate of nutrients from bottom sediments to water body to add the content of total nitrogen and phosphorus in water.

J	Pant, HK				Pant, Hari K.			Nonlinear effects of climate change on phosphorus stability in wetlands: Concept and estimation	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						phosphorus; nonlinear behavior; hydro-climatic change; characterization; enzymatic hydrolysis; mineralization; photolysis	SOIL ORGANIC PHOSPHORUS; PHOSPHATASE-ACTIVITY; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS; AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS; NMR-SPECTROSCOPY; HUMIC SUBSTANCES; MARINE SEDIMENT; LEAF LITTER; LAKE ERKEN; DECOMPOSITION	Effects of climate change on ecosystems like freshwater wetlands cannot be understood without focusing research on getting sense of vulnerability and resiliency at the systemic level, involving tipping points, rapid changes in events and states, because of the interdependency of various components that are subject to nonlinear changes even though they may exert significant inertia to short-term hydro-climatic fluctuations. Depending on resilience, threshold and lag times, hydro-climatic changes brought upon by global climate change may cause nonlinear and/or irreversible changes in phosphorus (P) dynamic, and instigate P enrichment in freshwater wetlands. Thus, the studies of the influence of expected global climate change and its direct and indirect effects on bioavailability/stability of organic P in wetlands are in critical need to help manage or increase the resilience of wetland ecosystem against any abrupt or irreversible changes that may adversely affect the ecosystem and its services. Phosphorus dynamic in freshwater wetland system is likely to behave nonlinearly due to expected changes in temperature, and sediment/soil and water acidity and redox status because of global climate change in the decades to come, thereby freshwater wetland, a sensitive ecosystem that plays critical role ranging from water quality management to atmospheric CO2 removal, could face irreversible or hysteretic adverse changes. The overall objectives of this paper are to provide consolidated information on identification and estimation of any nonlinear behaviors in the stability/bioavailability of various P forms, which are present in water columns, detritus and soils/sediments, at different levels of stressors in light of changing global climate. Addressing how stable organic P is, and at what threshold level and lag time would organic P behave nonlinearly and release back into the water column, in turn, exacerbate eutrophic conditions, are crucial. Learning the resilience, threshold level and lag times allows us to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of our technological advances and policies that may help us to cope with nonlinear impacts of global climate change on ecosystems such as wetlands.

A diatom-based water quality model tor Great Lakes coastlines	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						water quality; great lakes environmental indicators; diatoms	ENVIRONMENTAL RELATIONSHIPS; CANADA LAKES; ASSEMBLAGES; ONTARIO; REGRESSION; SALINITY	Diatom-based models to infer nutrient concentrations are proven robust indicators, but evidence suggests that in the future these models will be little improved by using larger training sets. I present a simple means to summarize the water quality (WQ) data from a suite of coastal Great Lakes locations and develop a diatom-based WQ model using standard weighted-averaging methods. A one-dimensional WQ index was derived by summarizing measured environmental data (nutrients, pigments, solids) using dimension-reducing ordination and calculating the primary WQ gradient of interest. Evaluations of weighted-averaging diatom model predictions (WQ index model: r(jackknife)(2) = 0.62, RMSEP = 1.32) indicate that the model has reconstructive power similar to a comparative model for total phosphorus concentrations (TP model: r(jackknife)(2) = 0.65, RMSEP = 0.26 log[mu g/L + 1]), but that predictive bias was lower for the WQ model. Also, inferred WQ index data had a higher correlation to adjacent watershed characteristics than inferred TP data. We attribute this to the ability of an integrated WQ index to better characterize the overall quality of a site than a single nutrient variable such as phosphorus. The diatom-based WQ model may be advantageous for management where it is necessary to provide a summary inference of water quality condition at a coastal locale.

Surface sediment assemblages and environmental variables were collected along the U.S. coastline at 191 sample sites, which were classified by lake and geomorphic type: high-energy (HE), embayment (EB), coastal wetland (CW), riverine wetland (RW), protected wetland (PW), and open water (OP). Diatom inferred (DI) total phosphorus (TP) transfer functions (models) were developed for each lake and geomorphic type. Robust models included: the overall model (RMSEPI-r(jack)(2) = 0.65; RMSEP = 0.005), Lake Superior (r(jack)(2) 0.73; RMSEP = 0.003), Lake Ontario (r(jack)(2) = 0.73; RMSEP = 0.007), PW (r(jack)(2) = 0.64; RMSEP 0.003), and EB (r(jack)(2) = 0.64; RMSEP = 0.007). Weaker models, indicating poorer diatom-TP relationships, included: RW (r(jack)(2) = 0.03; RMSEP = 0.005), OP (r(jack)(2) = 0.15; RMSEP = 0.059), and Lake Michigan (r(jack)(2) = 0.38; RMSEP = 0.006). DI TP data were regressed against landscape characteristics to quantify the relationships to adjacent watershed stressors. RW data were further scrutinized as a case study to investigate the suitability of diatom-based approaches in systems with poor diatom-TP relationships. Despite poor performance of the RW model, DI phosphorus data for riverine wetlands, derived from the overall model, were strongly related to watershed characteristics (r(2) = 0.61), indicating the overall model's ability to integrate stressors from the surrounding watershed in areas where measured phosphorus did not adequately characterize prevailing conditions. This study confirms that physical properties (e.g., lake or habitat type) can influence indicator models; however, weaknesses may be overcome by robust calibration techniques.

J	Croft, MV; Chow-Fraser, P				Croft, Melanie V.; Chow-Fraser, Patricia			Use and development of the wetland macrophyte index to detect water quality impairment in fish habitat of great lakes coastal marshes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						coastal wetlands; environmental index; water quality; macrophyte; Great Lakes; wetland macrophyte index	COOTES PARADISE MARSH; MYRIOPHYLLUM-SPICATUM L; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; LAND-USE; ONTARIO; PHOSPHORUS; INTEGRITY; METRICS; GROWTH; LEVEL	Indices have been developed with invertebrates, fish, and water quality parameters to detect the impact of human disturbance on coastal wetlands, but a macrophyte index of fish habitat for the Great Lakes does not currently exist. Because wetland macrophytes are directly influenced by water quality, any impairment in wetland quality should be reflected by taxonomic composition of the aquatic plant community. We developed a wetland macrophyte index (WMI) with plant presence/absence data for 12 7 coastal wetlands (154 wetland-years) from all five Great Lakes, using results of a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to ordinate plant species along a water quality gradient (CCA axis 1). We validated the WMI with data collected before and after the implementation of remedial actions plans (RAPs) in Sturgeon Bay (Severn Sound) and Cootes Paradise Marsh. Consistent with predictions, WMI scores for Sturgeon Bay were significantly higher after the implementation of the RAP. Historical data from Cootes Paradise Marsh were used to track the declining condition of the plant community from the 1940s to 1990s. Subsequently, when remedial actions had been implemented in 1997, the calculated WMI scores showed improvement, but when the presence of exotic species (WMIadj) was accounted for, improvements in ecological integrity of the aquatic-plant community were no longer evident. We show how WMI scores can be used by environmental agencies to assess the historic, current, and future ecological status of wetland ecosystems in two Canadian national parks, Point Pelee National Park (PPNP) and Fathom Five National Marine Park (FFNMP).

Uncertainties in annual riverine phosphorus load estimation: Impact of load estimation methodology, sampling frequency, baseflow index and catchment population density	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						uncertainty; load estimation; phosphorus; model calibration; nutrient budgets	WATER-QUALITY; LOWLAND STREAMS; COASTAL WATERS; NUTRIENT; SEDIMENT; LOIS; EQUIFINALITY; TRANSPORT; DISCHARGE; NITROGEN	Models developed to identify the rates and origins of nutrient export from land to stream require an accurate assessment of the nutrient load present in the water body in order to calibrate model parameters and structure. These data are rarely available at a representative scale and in an appropriate chemical form except in research catchments. Observational errors associated with nutrient load estimates based on these data lead to a high degree of uncertainty in modelling and nutrient budgeting studies. Here, daily paired instantaneous P and flow data for 17 UK research catchments covering a total of 39 water years (WY) have been used to explore the nature and extent of the observational error associated with nutrient flux estimates based on partial fractions and infrequent sampling. The daily records were artificially decimated to create 7 stratified sampling records, 7 weekly records, and 30 monthly records from each WY and catchment. These were used to evaluate the impact of sampling frequency on load estimate uncertainty. The analysis underlines the high uncertainty of load estimates based on monthly data and individual P fractions rather than total P. Catchments with a high baseflow index and/or low population density were found to return a lower RMSE on load estimates when sampled infrequently than those with a tow baseflow index and high population density. Catchment size was not shown to be important, though a limitation of this study is that daily records may fail to capture the full range of P export behaviour in smaller catchments with flashy hydrographs, leading to an underestimate of uncertainty in Load estimates for such catchments. Further analysis of sub-daily records is needed to investigate this fully. Here, recommendations are given on load estimation methodologies for different catchment types sampled at different frequencies, and the ways in which this analysis can be used to identify observational error and uncertainty for model calibration and nutrient budgeting studies.

Application of a validated primary production model (BLOOM) as a screening tool for marine, coastal and transitional waters	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Advances in Marine Ecosystem Modelling Research	JUN 27-29, 2005	Plymouth, ENGLAND			phytoplankton modelling; nutrient reduction; coastal waters; water framework directive; chlorophyll-a	PHAEOCYSTIS-POUCHETII; ECOSYSTEM-MODEL; GROWTH; LIGHT; EUTROPHICATION; PHYTOPLANKTON; TEMPERATURE; ZONES	In order to manage aquatic systems, it is necessary to apply methods relating the environmental variables and system-state parameters with external factors that affect the system. External factors can be natural (i.e. the movement of water) or partly-anthropogenic (i.e. nutrient loads). In addition to the national authorities, who have been implementing environmental policies for several decades, the EU is presently implementing the Water Framework Directive (WED) aimed at establishing a new set of standards for the ecological and water quality of water systems. Among these are the phytoplankton biomass and composition. Phytoplankton affects turbidity, oxygen depletion, total productivity of the system and the occurrence of (harmful) algal blooms. A range of methods is available to relate phytoplankton to the controlling environmental conditions. Among these are statistical relations for instance of the Vollenweider type as well as deterministic simulation models. At the end of the 1970s, a generic deterministic phytoplankton module called BLOOM was developed, which has since been applied to a wide range of fresh water and marine systems. Here we test the applicability of this model as a screening tool for coastal waters. We conclude that the 66 model is able to reproduce observed chlorophyll levels adequately under a wide range of conditions. Subsequently the model is applied to demonstrate the potential impacts of reductions in nitrogen, phosphorus or both nutrients simultaneously. Depending on which factors are initially controlling, the impacts of these reductions vary considerably both between locations and during the season. While this type of application lacks explicit relations between nutrient concentrations and external loadings, it does consider a number of relevant conditions in a consistent way and requires remarkably little data and effort. It is therefore a valuable screening tool. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Infrared spectroscopy - enabling an evidence-based diagnostic surveillance approach to agricultural and environmental management in developing countries	JOURNAL OF NEAR INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY			English	Review						agriculture; developing countries; diagnostic surveillance; environment; infrared spectroscopy; near infrared spectroscopy; mid-infrared spectroscopy; livestock; plant; quality; soil; water	DIFFUSE-REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY; SOIL FERTILITY; TROPICAL AGROECOSYSTEMS; ORGANIC-MATTER; LAKE-SEDIMENTS; PLANT; QUALITY; NIR; PHOSPHORUS; PREDICTION	Science-based approaches to agricultural and environmental management are needed to accelerate development progress in the world's poorest countries. We present a diagnostic surveillance framework modelled on medical diagnostic approaches for evidence-based management of agriculture and environment in developing countries. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy can play a pivotal role in making the surveillance framework operational, by providing a rapid, low cost and highly reproducible diagnostic screening tool. We review the wide applicability of IR spectroscopy for setting up measurement systems for the management of soils, crops, agricultural inputs, livestock health, agricultural products and water quality. IR spectroscopy is already being used in the design of soil surveillance systems, but the principles are generally applicable. A new evidence-based interpretation approach to plant analysis, combining plant and soil IR spectroscopy measurements, is proposed. Finally, an idealised design is proposed for making IR spectroscopy-based diagnostic surveillance operational in developing countries over the next ten years. Large area surveillance frameworks for agricultural and environmental problems will deploy integrated spectral indicators of soil, crop and livestock health and water quality. Spectral indicators will help to quantify risk factors associated with problems and assess intervention impacts. Smallholder farmers will have access to IR spectroscopy-based analysis of soils, crops and inputs through a network of hand-held or mobile IR spectroscopy units. Agricultural processing industries will make extensive use of IR spectroscopy on the factory floor to add value to agricultural produce and improve food safety. Regional centres of scientific and technological excellence will be required to support (i) high quality laboratory reference analyses, (ii) development of IR spectroscopy calibration databases and interpretation systems and (iii) up-grading of scientific and technical skills through training and education. Key challenges for adoption of this design include (i) building human capacity in science- and technology-based approaches, (ii) development of rugged low cost IR spectroscopy instrumentation and (iii) development of decision support systems to interpret IR spectroscopy data into management recommendations.

The cost of cleaner water: Assessing agricultural pollution reduction at the watershed scale	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						best management practices; economic costs; nonpoint source pollution; SWAT; water quality	HYDROLOGICALLY SENSITIVE AREAS; PRECISION CONSERVATION; ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS; STRATEGIES	Nonpoint source, pollution in intensively managed agricultural landscapes is of great concern to the general population, farmers and policymakers, as it impacts local water quality and can have large downstream effects, as in the case of hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. In this study, we outline a methodology to simultaneously assess economic costs and water quality benefits associated with the hypothetical placement of a broad set of conservation practices. The study, performed for the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, assesses thirteen major subbasins in Iowa by interfacing economic models with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool model. The conservation practices analyzed include land set-aside, terraces, grassed waterways, contouring, conservation tillage, and a simple nutrient reduction strategy. Annual costs range from $300 to $597 million. Predicted sediment, total phosphorus (P), and nitrate decreases range from six to 65 percent, 28 to 59 percent, and Six to 20 percent, respectively, relative to the baseline.

Change in filter strip performance over ten years	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						buffer; nonpoint source pollution; soil quality; vegetation type; water quality	VEGETATED BUFFER STRIPS; RIPARIAN BUFFER; SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; SOIL; GRASS; RUNOFF; INFILTRATION; QUALITY; PHOSPHORUS; POLLUTION	Effectiveness of fitter strips may change over a period of years because key soil and vegetation conditions change after conversion of cultivated farmland to permanent vegetation. The main objectives of this study were to: 1) determine if effectiveness of a filter strip changes over years since establishment, and 2) determine if temporal change depends on vegetation type. Four vegetation treatments were replicated five times in 3 x 7.5 M (10 X 25 ft) Plots. Plots containing all-grass (New Grass) and grass with trees and shrubs (New Forest) were established in spring Of 1995 among otherwise similar plots that contained either grass since ca. 1970 (Old Grass) or were re-cultivated and re-ptanted annually with grain sorghum (Crop). Once each summer, in 1995, 1996, 1997, 2003, and 2004, identically prepared solutions containing sediment, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizer, and bromide tracer were applied to the upper end of each plot during a simulated rainfall event Of 2.5 cm (1 in) in 30 minutes, and the load and concentration of runoff components were measured in outflow from the plots. Retention of solution components and reduction of their concentrations by the New Grass and New Forest plots improved from effectiveness similar or less than the Crop plots to effectiveness similar to the Old Grass plots within three growing seasons. Improvement coincided with the development of denser vegetative ground cover and a slower rate of runoff flow through the plots. Change in infiltration accounted for most of the improvement in overall effectiveness. There was no evidence of divergence in the performance of New Grass and New Forest plots. We conclude that filter strip performance improves over a period of years since establishment. Most of the change occurs within three growing seasons after establishment.

Phosphorus contributions from pastured dairy cattle to streams of the Cannonsville Watershed, New York	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						Cannonsville Watershed; cattle behavior; Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program; fecal deposits; pastures; phosphorus	MANAGEMENT; LIVESTOCK; QUALITY	Accelerated eutrophication of surface waters due to phosphorus loadings from livestock agriculture is a widespread water quality problem and is of particular concern in the Cannonsvilie Watershed located in southeastern New York. This study sought to quantify fecal phosphorus contributions to streams from pastured dairy cattle in the Cannonsville Watershed by extrapolating field observations of cattle behavior on four farms. Pastured dairy herds with stream access were observed over four intervals during the spring and summer of 2003;. Cattle behavior, including in- and near-stream deposition of feces, were recorded and manure samples collected from each herd for nutrient analysis. Patterns of fecal deposition within a pasture were related to the number of cattle and amount of time cattle spent in particular areas. The rate of in-stream fecal deposition was significantly higher than in other areas of the pasture. Fecal phosphorus deposition in other pastures of the Cannonsville Watershed was modeled as a function of number of cattle, time in pasture, and type of dairy cow (heifers vs. milk cows). Spatial databases of streams, pasture boundaries, and livestock characteristics were used to predict phosphorus deposition in pastures with stream access on approximately go percent of the dairy farms found in the Cannonsville Watershed. We estimate that the 11,000 dairy cattle in the Cannonsville Watershed deposit approximately 2,800 kg (6,200 lbs) of phosphorus directly into pasture streams and 5,600 kg (12,300 lbs) of phosphorus within 10 m (33 ft) of a pasture stream. At this magnitude, phosphorus loadings represent a significant environmental concern, with in-stream deposits by pastured cattle equivalent to approximately 10 percent of watershedlevel phosphorus loadings attributed to agriculture. Recent efforts to exclude pastured cattle from streams as part of the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) were estimated to have already reduced in-stream deposition of fecal phosphorus by 32 percent. Results highlight the importance of excluding pastured cattle from streams in controlling nonpoint source phosphorus pollution.

Potential impacts of implementation of the phosphorus loss assessment tool (PLAT) on the poultry industry in North Carolina: Case studies	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						phosphorus loss assessment; poultry industry; North Carolina	EXTRACTABLE PHOSPHORUS; WATER-QUALITY; CLAY CONTENT; RUNOFF; SOILS; INDEX	Potential impacts of the North Carolina phosphorus (P) index tool (phosphorus loss assessment toot or PLAT) on management of land-application of poultry manure were evaluated using case studies of poultry operations in three major production areas (Union, Wayne and Wilkes Counties) of the state. The toot predicts relative risk of P loss from fields receiving animal waste or fertilizer. White some litter-receiving fields in Union County occur on slopes as steep as 15 to 20 percent and have very high soil test P (STP) levels (200 to 300 soil P indices), PLAT ratings were mostly in the "medium" range at which producers can apply litter on an N basis. This low P-loss rating was associated primarily with use of conservation tillage and a large area of crop land available for litter application. The litter-receiving fields in Wayne County received "low" to "medium" PLAT ratings as a result of low particulate P loss associated with low soil erosion, but deep sandy soils with high P leaching potential that are common in this area were not evaluated. High soil test P, occurrence of waste-receiving fields on steep slopes, high rates of litter application on limited land areas and production of silage corn using conventional tillage contribute to "high" predicted risk of P toss from litter-receiving fields in Wilkes County. These results indicate that implementation of the PLAT index as a part of the NRCS 590 Nutrient Management Standard will have serious impacts on how poultry producers in Wilkes County manage titter and other forms of manure generated by their operations. The impact is likely to be less severe in Union and Wayne Counties. The following concerns were expressed by personnel responsible for implementation of PLAT and by producers; 1) exemption of poultry operations below a certain size could make PLAT predictions less effective in decreasing P pollution of surface water; 2) PLAT implementation could exacerbate existing economic problems.

Residual soil nitrogen in soil landscapes of Canada as affected by land use practices and agricultural policy scenarios	LAND USE POLICY			English	Article						residual soil nitrogen; census of agriculture; agricultural policy scenarios; nitrogen modeling; scaling up; soil landscapes of Canada	SLURRY APPLICATIONS; SYSTEMS; WATER; MODEL; FIELD; SIMULATION; SOFTWARE; DYNAMICS; SCALE	Agri-environmental indicators are being developed in Canada to assess and report on the environmental sustainability of agricultural production activities. Concerns about water quality have led to the development of an indicator called residual soil nitrogen (RSN), which reflects annual nitrogen left in the soil profile after crops are harvested. The Canadian agricultural nitrogen budget (CANB) is used to integrate this indicator with the economic Canadian regional agriculture model (CRAM) to assess the implications of national and regional agricultural policy scenarios. CANB has built-in scaling-up and scenario-analysis capabilities, so that its outputs can be generated and mapped at the soil landscapes of Canada (scale 1: 1 million) level, as well at provincial and national scales. Using census of agriculture data for 1981 and 1996, the CANB model predicted RSN levels across Canada for 2008. The impacts of CRAM policy scenarios in the year 2008, which include changes in crop areas, animal numbers, fertilization and animal feeding practices, each with a low, medium and high level of adoption, are evaluated in terms of changes in RSN compared to a 2008 'business as usual' scenario. National average RSN values are projected to increase from 21.8 kg N/ha in 1981 to 36.5 kg N/ha in the 2008 'business as usual' scenario. Between 1996 and 2008, the proportion of farmland containing greater than 40 kg of excess N/ha increased from 18% to 34% in response to increased fertilizer use, increased manure application and increases in the area of legume crops. Changes in land use practices, such as decreasing the summerfallow area or switching some annual cropland to perennial forages and forestry, appear to have a minimal effect on RSN levels as compared to the 'business as usual' scenario. However, policy scenarios that improve nitrogen fertilization and animal feeding practices were found to significantly decrease RSN levels and thereby reduce the risk of nitrate contamination of the environment.

Spatial and temporal patterns of near-surface chlorophyll a in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH			English	Article						monitoring; phytoplankton	COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; COASTAL WATERS; CORAL-REEFS; PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS; NUTRIENT INPUTS; EUTROPHICATION; AUSTRALIA; DYNAMICS; SEA; BAY	Surface chlorophyll a concentrations in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon were monitored at individual stations for periods of 6 to 12 years. The monitoring program was established to detect spatial and temporal changes in water quality resulting from increased loads of nutrients exported from the catchments adjoining the GBR. Sampling occurred monthly at up to 86 sites that were located in transects across the width of the continental shelf. In the central and southern GBR (16 - 21 degrees S), there was a persistent cross-shelf chlorophyll a gradient, with higher concentrations near the coast. No cross-shelf gradient was observed in the far northern GBR (12 - 15 degrees S). Mean chlorophyll a concentrations in the far northern GBR (0.23 mu g L-1) were less than half those in the south and central GBR (0.54 mu gL(-1)). Chlorophyll a varied seasonally within regions, with mean summer-wet season (December - April) concentrations similar to 50% greater than those in the winter-dry season (May - November). Sub-annual, inter-annual and event-related variations in chlorophyll a concentrations were observed in several zones. Multi-year patterns in concentrations suggest that relatively short (5 - 8 years) time series may give spurious estimates of secular trends. Higher chlorophyll a concentrations in inshore waters south of 16 degrees S were most likely related to the levels of river nutrient delivery associated with agricultural development on adjacent catchments.

Relating microalgal spatial patterns to flow, mouth and nutrient status in the temporarily open/closed Mngazi estuary, South Africa	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH			English	Article						carbohydrates; chlorophyll a; flocculation; mineralisation	WATER-QUALITY; RIVER-ESTUARY; PHYTOPLANKTON; MICROPHYTOBENTHOS; TURBIDITY; SEDIMENT; DYNAMICS; NITROGEN; EUTROPHICATION; ENRICHMENT	The Mngazi estuary, a near pristine and wave-dominated estuary located on the subtropical east coast of South Africa, requires careful management to ensure that land use does not alter its ecological function. The present study investigated the quality and quantity of water in the estuary and related these to the microalgae. There was no evidence of a persistent elevated phytoplankton biomass in the region of the estuary where river water mixed with brackish estuarine water, even during periods when the estuary mouth was open. Nutrients that determined the microalgal distribution were likely to have come from the mineralisation of organic material, which had been deposited in the estuary following pulses in river water. Results indicate that microalgae were P-limited when the mouth was semi-closed and N-limited during the closed mouth phase. Average benthic chlorophyll a, which ranged from 0.3 to 56.8 mu g g(-1), was highest in the intertidal middle reaches of the estuary. Organic matter and the proportion of fine sediments (< 125 mu m) was highest in these sediments. A conceptual model was developed to predict the response of the estuary if further changes in the quality and quantity of river water entering the estuary were to occur.

(2006) proposed that temporal and spatial mismatches between eastern oyster filtration and phytoplankton abundance will preclude restored stocks of eastern oysters from reducing the severity of hypoxia in the deep channel of central Chesapeake Bay. We refute this contention by presenting arguments, data, and model results, overlooked by these authors. Our analysis indicates that oyster populations living on extensive reefs along the flanks of the mainstem Bay could substantially reduce summer phytoplankton growth and particulate organic carbon deposition to deep waters of the central channel. Because hypoxia in these deep waters is maintained through microbial decomposition of organic carbon generated by summer phytoplankton production, we conclude that reduced carbon fluxes to the deep channel associated with greatly increased oyster grazing could reduce the severity of hypoxia.

Some recently proposed strategies to reverse this trend have included the restoration of bivalve suspension feeders as an ecological tool for reducing phytoplankton biomass. The ecological benefits accruing from such bivalve restoration will be dependent on the characteristics of the estuary, as well as how restoration is implemented. We developed a filtration model to estimate the effect of bivalve restoration on the rate of phytoplankton removal over a range of spatial and temporal scales and used it to compare alternate restoration strategies for the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica in Chesapeake Bay, USA. Model results suggested that currently accepted restoration goals for oysters in the bay are unlikely to result in significant bay-wide reductions in phytoplankton biomass. This is partially due to low current biomass targets for oyster restoration, but also important are several spatial and temporal mismatches between oyster and phytoplankton biomass that may limit the ecological benefit of oyster restoration. Our model did predict important increases in phytoplankton removal by oysters at the tributary scale, and this effect was dependent on where oyster restoration was achieved and whether restoration and management plans affected the size distribution of oysters. Our findings suggest that the ecological benefit of restoring bivalve populations are variable, and a comparative model analysis of restoration plans in particular systems can be highly beneficial to maximizing the benefit-to-cost ratio of restoration efforts intended to reduce the negative effects of cultural eutrophication.

Variations in water clarity and salinity combined with information on geographical location of sampling areas were found to explain almost 80% of the large-scale variation in algal cover between areas. As water clarity was largely regulated by concentrations of total-nitrogen (TN), and TN-concentrations by TN-input from land, total algal cover at given water depths was partly related to TN-input from land. The fraction of opportunistic algae responded predominantly to differences in salinity, the highest fractions being found in the most brackish areas. Temporal variability in algal cover and fraction of opportunists over the 14-year investigation period was much smaller than the variability between areas and could not be predicted from variations in environmental variables. In order for macroalgal cover to become a more sensitive indicator of water quality it would be necessary to either increase the sensitivity of the method or identify and include supplementary regulating factors in the model.

Dynamic Modelling of Coastal Water Quality	MEDCOAST 07: EIGHTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THE MEDITERRANEAN COASTAL ENVIRONMENT, VOLS 1 AND 2			English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on the Mediterranean Coastal Environment	NOV 13-17, 2007	Alexandria, EGYPT					Growth of anthropogenic load on a coastal zone of the sea in the last years in connection with increase in number of tourists and building of coastal structures has led to an aggravation of many environmental problems. The majority of them are connected with the sea water quality control. Possible prospects of their solution are connected with realization of the concept of "sustainable development" - sustainable coexistence of mankind and the nature, and the basic method of that is the water quality modelling. A plenty of parameters is used to provide the fullness and objectivity of the estimation of quality of superficial waters now. The choice of important for application of 10 parameters from 40-45 proves in the presented model. To increase the accuracy and informative of forecasts for the coastal zone conditions the system-dynamic model has been developed, what allows to estimate the quality of the sea water, including that in the semi-enclosed coastal water areas with the limited water exchange. The model of water quality in the coastal zone includes the equations of deposit concentration changes and chemical substances evolution in the studied areas. The model incorporates joint description of cycles of two biogenic elements - nitrogen and phosphorus. The system is completely defined by the biogeochemical reactions. The sizes of such water areas allow the applying the full mixing and zero-dimensional models of water quality. The circulation of water inside the area is taken into account additionally. Water exchange in the semi-enclosed coastal water areas is defined by the discharge through the open parts of area border. The novelty of the offered model is its adaptation to the specific conditions of semi-enclosed coastal water areas. Then the coastal engineering projects which include the effects of partly enclosed by structure areas with limited water exchange and high intensity of pollution concern. At the same time, the model contains details of the biogeochemical processes to complete modelling of the water quality. The developed system dynamics model is realized in the "PowerSim Studio" media.

The data set includes the 100-year-old history of four treatments of one field of the well-known "Static Experiment" as well as more detailed information about crop development and soil moisture dynamics for a 4-year crop rotation from 1999 to 2002 that is identical with the crop rotation of the long-term experiment and a black fallow treatment, intended to provide basic data about soil moisture dynamics and nitrogen leaching without plant impact. Soil physical parameters sampled at four soil profiles, all of the same soil unit give an idea about the heterogeneity of the loess soil at this site. Climate data and especially their transformation to turnover conditions give strong indications for the impact of climate change on soil organic matter (SOM). Nitrogen deposition amounts to 47.3 kg/ha/year as an average value for the crop rotation of sugar beet, spring barley, potatoes and winter wheat. Soil water samples from ceramic suction cups show only very low concentrations of nitrogen below the root zone indicating that there is nearly no loss of the available nitrogen due to leaching.

Modelling Nitrogen Discharge Trading Using Spatial Multi-Agent Simulation	MODSIM 2007: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: LAND, WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM07)	DEC 10-13, 2007	Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND	Lincoln Univ, HEMA Consulting Pty Ltd, Modelling and Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand (MSSANZ), Univ Canterbury, SGI, Lincoln Ventures Ltd, Hoare Res Software Ltd, IMACS, IEMSS, Environm Modelling & Software, IBM		Whole farm risk programming; multi-agent simulation; nutrient discharge trading		Nutrient discharge, e. g. nitrogen (N) leached from intensive farming is a major cause of poor water quality of rivers and lakes in catchments. Regulators have set up many schemes in some countries to manage and reduce the flow of nutrients into water ways. The include promoting the adoption of less intensive farming systems and setting up trading schemes to buy and sell nutrient discharge credits. In New Zealand a regulatory institution, Environment Waikato, has proposed a scheme to restrict N discharge from agricultural activity in the Lake Taupo catchment to improve the water quality of Lake Taupo in the central North Island region of New Zealand. Their proposal includes (a) capping of N produced by farms at current levels of N leached from farms, (b) reducing N flows into the catchment by 20% and (c) allowing the trading of N discharge allowances (NDA) between farmers in the catchment. This study describes the use of the multi-agent simulation framework, CORMAS (Common-pool Resources and Multi-Agents Systems), to model the behaviour of key actors (regulator, auctioneer, NDA sellers and NDA buyers) who are endeavouring to improve water quality in the Lake Taupo catchment. The regulator allocates NDA to farmers and reduces total catchment NDA through purchase of NDA, the auctioneer manages a centralised contract protocol for trading in NDA and the farmer buys or sells NDA based on a farm plan that maximises the farmer's risk adjusted expected income (RAE) A whole farm risk model (WFRM) is formulated for each farmer in the Taupo catchment and used to determine farm plans that maximise RAE for a range of risk tolerance levels, and assuming farmers are risk averse. The model assumes the farmer's utility function for net income is negative exponential and incomes are normally distributed. The farm plan options are selected from a range of pastoral (sheep, beef cattle, deer and dairy cattle) and forestry (exotic forestry, indigenous forest and scrub land) enterprises which have been matched to land use capability classes. N leached is calculated from the optimum farm plans. This is the farmer's preferred NDA. Nitrogen discharge allowance allocated to the farmer by the regulator is determined by solving WFRM with vegetation maintained at current levels. Comparing the farmer's preferred NDA with the NDA allocated by the regulator determines whether the farmer would be a buyer or seller of NDA in the multi-agent simulation model. Land resource data used for WFRM were combined in a GIS environment from the Landcover Database for vegetation cover, New Zealand Land Resource Inventory for land use and versatility and Agribase for farm boundaries. Enterprise gross margins were estimated using FARMAX (sheep, beef cattle and deer management), UDDER (dairy management) packages. Exotic forestry gross margins were based on the Farm Forestry "Calculators" package. N leached from farming enterprises were estimated using the OVERSEER (R) Nutrient Budget package. The WFRM was developed in the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and solved using the Frontline Solver for 100 farms in the Taupo catchment. Farmers' NDA, RAEs and GIS maps of the catchment were loaded into the CORMAS model. Results show the size of the market for trading in NDA, sales to the regulator to achieve their target of reducing N leached in the catchment by 20% and NDA trades through the auctioneer.

Sediment and Nutrient Exports for the Burdekin River Catchment, North Queensland: A Comparison of Monitoring and Modelling Data	MODSIM 2007: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: LAND, WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM07)	DEC 10-13, 2007	Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND	Lincoln Univ, HEMA Consulting Pty Ltd, Modelling and Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand (MSSANZ), Univ Canterbury, SGI, Lincoln Ventures Ltd, Hoare Res Software Ltd, IMACS, IEMSS, Environm Modelling & Software, IBM		Sediment loads; nutrient loads; GBR lagoon; monitoring and modelling comparisons		Several empirical models have been developed to estimate sediment and nutrient inputs into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, although limited monitoring data are available for their validation. The lack of monitoring data for GBR catchments limits the refinement of these models, and particularly their assumptions of tropical landscape processes. Such limitations reduce the confidence of these models for application within the Reef Water Quality Protection Plan process, such as the setting of end-of-river load targets, and scenario load forecasting based on improved catchment condition from the adoption of best management practices. The benefits of a coupled monitoring and modelling approach have been demonstrated in a number of other north Queensland catchments, such as the Tully/Murray Water Quality Improvement Plan (WQIP) (Armour et al., 2007). Improved modelling estimates have been produced for these catchments due to their smaller size, resultant less variability and the use of higher resolution input data. The considerable size of the Burdekin makes similar efforts difficult; however, this is a first attempt at comparing available monitoring data with modelling efforts for this catchment. We present flow weighted sediment and nitrogen loads averaged over three wet seasons of monitoring data (2002/03, 2004/05 and 2005/06) from the major sub-catchments and river mouth of the Burdekin River to compare with recent SedNet and ANNEX model load estimates by CSIRO. CSIRO incorporated a number of refinements to the models based on issues identified during previous modelling runs. These refinements include improvements to the hillslope erosion component through better input data resolution (estimates of actual ground cover and improved spatial resolution of slope) and improved gully and river bank erosion components through the incorporation of field measurements from the Burdekin catchment. In most cases, monitored and modelled comparisons of TSS loads were reasonable, although poorer comparisons occurred for some sites, explainable by limited monitoring data or coarse resolution "blanket" model assumptions, such as riparian vegetation and dam trapping capacity. The dam trapping algorithm applied to the Burdekin Falls Dam (BFD) by the SedNet model appears to be overestimating the suspended sediment and particulate nutrient trapping capacity of this dam. A modified algorithm that accounts for the dry tropical hydrology (i.e. highly episodic flows with shorter residence times than assumed by SedNet) will allow for better load estimates at the mouth of the Burdekin River. Particulate nutrient comparisons were less satisfactory, with the model seemingly overestimating monitored PN exports; the ANNEX model estimates are based on the Australian Soil Resource Information System database of nutrient concentrations in soils. This database may need refinement for these highly weathered, nutrient-poor landscapes. Reasonable comparisons were found between the modelled and monitored loads of dissolved organic nitrogen, however, comparisons were only fair for dissolved inorganic nitrogen. Further investigation of the role of inorganic nitrogen in this tropical system is warranted, and particularly, the contributions from natural sources, such as rainfall or bedrock, compared to those from land uses including fertilisers and cow excreta. Additional monitoring data at different spatial and temporal scales are required to further test the accuracy of these models, particularly for the southern region of the Burdekin catchment, where below-average flow events have occurred within the timeframe of the monitoring project. This will allow further confidence in using modelled outputs to identify catchment point sources and consequent delivery to downstream environments, and for the setting of water quality targets.

The Application of the E2 Water Quality Model for Regional NRM Planning	MODSIM 2007: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: LAND, WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM07)	DEC 10-13, 2007	Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND	Lincoln Univ, HEMA Consulting Pty Ltd, Modelling and Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand (MSSANZ), Univ Canterbury, SGI, Lincoln Ventures Ltd, Hoare Res Software Ltd, IMACS, IEMSS, Environm Modelling & Software, IBM		E2; water quality; Regional NRM Body; on-ground works		The introduction of the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality in Queensland (NAPS WQ) has resulted in greater responsibility for the delivery of Natural Resource Management (NRM) planning being given to the community through State and Federally approved NRM Regional bodies. These Regional Bodies are required to regularly report to the State and Federal governments on progress towards meeting resource condition targets. Quantifying any change in resource condition, such as water quality, as a result of implementing on-ground works is a difficult task for Regional Bodies. Identification of condition and trend may take decades and is costly. Computer simulation (models) may provide an alternative means of assessing the long term impacts of on-ground works on water quality. The NAPSWQ team in collaboration with the Regional NRM Body, Queensland Murray Darling Committee (QMDC) used the E2 catchment modelling software to evaluate the likely changes in sediment and nutrient loads as a result of implementing on-ground works. The area modelled was the Condamine, Balonne and Maranoa Catchments at the headwaters of the Murray Darling Basin in Queensland (80,000 km(2)) [GRAPHICS] Model output showed good agreement with observed data. Modelled runoff was within 10% of observed runoff for the majority of sites at the monthly timestep. Modelled runoff was within 20% of observed runoff events less than a month in duration. The majority of modelled sediment and nutrient loads were within 30% of observed loads. The model was then applied by QMDC to estimate the relative change in sediment and nutrient loads exported from the catchment as a result of implementing 100,000ha of on-ground works. The on-ground works implemented by the landholders and subsidised by the Regional Body were: conversion from conventional to no tillage cropping, addition of contour banks in steep cropping lands, improved grazing management, installation of additional watering points and fencing off riparian areas. Estimated catchment average annual reduction in sediment and nutrient loads in tonnes per annum (t/a) as a result of the funded on-ground works were 3,500 t/a (3%) of Total Suspended Sediment (TSS), 8 t/a (2%) of Total Phosphorus (TP), 3 t/a (2%) of Total Nitrogen (TN). An unexpected benefit of the modelling exercise was that QMDC staff were able to independently run the model and test scenarios. QMDC staff now have a much greater awareness of how such models operate and some of the limitations of water quality modelling. A future application for the model will include prioritisation of on-ground works to determine where the most appropriate areas are for investment. QMDC staff are also collecting further event data to enhance model calibration. This work demonstrates that models can play a beneficial and useful role for Regional NRM Bodies as an assessment and/or prioritisation tool.	[Waters, D.

Using a Simple Hydrologic Model to Link Management to Nutrient Concentrations and Loads in Runoff	MODSIM 2007: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: LAND, WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM07)	DEC 10-13, 2007	Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND	Lincoln Univ, HEMA Consulting Pty Ltd, Modelling and Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand (MSSANZ), Univ Canterbury, SGI, Lincoln Ventures Ltd, Hoare Res Software Ltd, IMACS, IEMSS, Environm Modelling & Software, IBM		Nutrients; phosphorus; water balance; erosion; management	BIOAVAILABLE PHOSPHORUS; AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF; NITROGEN; CROP; DECOMPOSITION; TRANSPORT; AUSTRALIA; BLOOMS	Soil phosphorus (P) poses a threat to aquatic and marine ecosystems. It is important that P concentrations are kept low to avoid eutrophication of waterways, as occurred in the spectacular and costly blue-green algal blooms in the Barwon and Darling River systems in 1990-1991. The management of water quality often requires comprehensive, catchment-wide approaches. Simulation models can play a role in alerting managers to the sources of P pollution, and ideally can help identify means of reducing that pollution. There are many models of sediment and nutrient dynamics in catchments. Yet despite the importance of analysing relationships between nutrient exports and management, few models facilitate this analysis at a biophysical level, where the mechanisms can be explored and understood. To provide a predictive tool, we have added quantitative information about P export to an existing model of water balance and sediment export. Although P has been modelled in this case, other nutrients could be modelled with this approach as long as relevant literature is available for developing the necessary mathematical relationships. The input data include weather, soil, vegetation and land management. Runoff (mm), sediment concentration (g/L) and P export (kg/ha) are calculated on a daily basis. We have used published data concerning P chemistry to estimate sub-classes of total P export, including bio-available particulate P, dissolved P, and bio-available P. Complex relationships sometimes arise from simple inputs and relationships through the effects of parameters such as soil P sorption and variables such as sediment concentration. While the model is at an early stage of development, experts have indicated that it shows skill in reproducing expected relationships between forcing variables and the simulated concentrations and loads. Analysis of land use and site effects at Clifton and Kingaroy in the northern grainbelt of Australia demonstrates the utility of this approach. For example, in scenarios where average annual runoff (mm/year) were similar, large differences were simulated in erosion (t/ha/year) and total P export (kg P/ha/year, Figure 1). Also, there was little correlation between average export of total P and average bio-available P (kg/ha/year) exported. There was, however, a modest correlation between average concentration (mg/L) and average export of bio-available P (kg/ha/year). [GRAPHICS] The input parameters for these types of simulation are now available for many situations. This, combined with the realism of these simulations (compared to simple factorial models), assures the continued use of this type of model.			brett.robinson@nrm.qld.gov.au	Freebairn, David/Q-7494-2019				Albert S, 2005, MAR POLLUT BULL, V51, P428, DOI 10.1016/j.marpolbul.2004.10.016; COLWELL JD, 1963, AUST J EXP AGR ANIM, V3, P100; Davies P.J., 2006, J SPATIAL HYDROLOGY, V6, P82; Davis JR, 2006, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V559, P23, DOI 10.1007/s10750-005-4429-2; Herath G, 1997, J ENVIRON MANAGE, V51, P217, DOI 10.1006/jema.1997.0138; Isbell RF, 2002, AUSTR SOIL CLASSIFIC; LEONARD RA, 1987, T ASAE, V30, P1403; Littleboy M, 1996, AUST J SOIL RES, V34, P91, DOI 10.1071/SR9960091; Mcbeath TM, 2007, AUST J SOIL RES, V45, P448, DOI 10.1071/SR07044; McKee LJ, 2000, BIOGEOCHEMISTRY, V50, P241, DOI 10.1023/A:1006339910533; Nash D, 1997, AUST J SOIL RES, V35, P419, DOI 10.1071/S96039; Nelson PN, 1996, J ENVIRON QUAL, V25, P1221, DOI 10.2134/jeq1996.00472425002500060008x; Rattray D, 2004, 13 INT SOIL CONS ORG; RITCHIE JT, 1972, WATER RESOUR RES, V8, P1204, DOI 10.1029/WR008i005p01204; SCHOMBERG HH, 1994, SOIL SCI SOC AM J, V58, P372, DOI 10.2136/sssaj1994.03615995005800020019x; SHARPLEY AN, 1994, J ENVIRON QUAL, V23, P437, DOI 10.2134/jeq1994.00472425002300030006x; SHARPLEY AN, 1991, J ENVIRON QUAL, V20, P235, DOI 10.2134/jeq1991.00472425002000010037x; SHARPLEY AN, 1992, J ENVIRON QUAL, V21, P30, DOI 10.2134/jeq1992.00472425002100010003x; SHARPLEY AN, 1995, J ENVIRON QUAL, V24, P920, DOI 10.2134/jeq1995.00472425002400050020x; SHARPLEY AN, 1993, AM SOC TEST MATER, V1162, P43, DOI 10.1520/STP23870S; Steiner JL, 1999, SOIL SCI SOC AM J, V63, P1817, DOI 10.2136/sssaj1999.6361817x; Tunney H., 1997, PHOSPHORUS LOSS SOIL; Uusitalo R, 2003, J ENVIRON QUAL, V32, P633, DOI 10.2134/jeq2003.0633; WILLIAMS JR, 1976, J HYDR ENG DIV-ASCE, V102, P1241	24	4	4	0	0	MODELLING & SIMULATION SOC AUSTRALIA & NEW ZEALAND INC	CHRISTCHURCH	MSSANZ, CHRISTCHURCH, 00000, NEW ZEALAND			978-0-9758400-4-7				2007							2116	2123					8	Computer Science, Information Systems; Ecology; Environmental Sciences; Multidisciplinary Sciences	Computer Science; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Science & Technology - Other Topics	BUQ25	WOS:000290030702025					2021-01-11

One of the major strategies in reducing phosphorus contamination is the adoption by farmers of less harmful and more efficient fertilization strategies. The present paper outlines some of the research work and provides some propositions on water quality management in the Glenelg-Hopkins (G-H) catchment region which has as its main objective the development of theoretical and computational models to predict nutrient load and assess its impacts on the health of rivers in this area. The methodology used to achieve this aim relies on the innovative tools of Game Theory. Specifically, we will formulate a general gametheoretic model, based on information regarding farmers' practices and environmental factors, on application of fertilizer which will assist in reducing agricultural pollution, especially those associated with phosphorus contamination, in the G-H catchment. The two main classes of games, i.e. non-cooperative games and cooperative games (Owen, 2001), will be addressed in this work, although the non-cooperative aspect will be given more prominence. The noncooperative approach will result in a set of solutions which are Nash Equilibrium and we will hint at the cooperative approach by considering the value of forming coalitions among groups of farmers as well as identifying the Pareto equilibrium. Among the key research questions addressed in this paper will be the benefit of applying game theory for improving the health of waterways in the G-H catchment area. In this work the game theoretic approach has been employed for modelling the strategies of phosphorus application by farmers of the Hopkins Basin. Game theory may be broadly described as a mathematical theory which was developed to model how rational human beings or organizations make decisions in a competitive environment or conflict situation. It allows researchers to find optimal strategy of behaviour for players involved in the game. In the context of the present work players are farmers (or households) applying fertilisers on their paddocks. The main advantage of a game-theoretic approach in resource management is that it allows one to consider and compare competitive as well as cooperative actions of agents sharing limited resources. Non-cooperative games are games where each player or groups of players are antagonistic to each other. The main objective of non-cooperative games is to find optimal strategies where players can use against each other to optimize one or more utility functions. In cooperative games, players are able to form coalitions and utilities are transferable (shared) between members of these coalitions. The main objective here is to understand how cooperation could lead to better distribution of utilities to all players, in comparison to players engaging in pure competition between themselves. However, the cooperation can be modelled in the non-cooperative games via the cooperative Pareto equilibrium. This approach was utilised in the present work. The paper formulates the model composition of the game when players are about 30 households in the Hopkins catchment. The information on their land use structures were taken form the survey specially implemented within the current project. This survey also provided the information on the phosphorus application policies characterising each of these households. The objective function for each of these players has been define as a sum of their crops revenues, total cost of phosphorus used and environmental penalties associated with the current level of pollution, which was calculated using the wide range of data on economic impacts associated to the water quality deterioration.

An Index-Based Modelling Approach to Evaluate Nutrient Loss Risk at Catchment-Scales	MODSIM 2007: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: LAND, WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM07)	DEC 10-13, 2007	Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND	Lincoln Univ, HEMA Consulting Pty Ltd, Modelling and Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand (MSSANZ), Univ Canterbury, SGI, Lincoln Ventures Ltd, Hoare Res Software Ltd, IMACS, IEMSS, Environm Modelling & Software, IBM		water quality; nitrogen; phosphorus; catchment modelling; index; nutrient export	INTEGRATING PHOSPHORUS; WATERSHED SCALES; MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN; SEDIMENT; EXPORT; LAND	This paper presents an approach to evaluate phosphorus loss risk to waterways using index-based modelling at the large catchment scale. Index-based approaches are used to identify areas of greatest nutrient source strengths, and so called 'critical source areas' of nutrient loss risk. Compared with more sophisticated water quality modelling approaches, index-based approaches are less likely to be constrained by a lack of input data and provide good spatial representation of catchment source strengths, although they do not represent nutrient generation processes explicitly. In this research, soil regolith source and transport risk factors such as soil P concentrations, soil P sorption, soil map information, land use, erodibility, texture, and catchment-scale hydrology are used. The research is designed to help evaluate source strengths and transport risks to assist managers to improve the focus of remediation actions to reduce nutrient delivery to waterways. This paper presents a case study of index-based modelling in the 1810 km(2) Tuross River catchment of coastal southeast Australia. Predominant land uses are conservation and production forests, national parks, cattle grazing, dairy production and urban expansion. Knowledge of potential sediment and nutrient losses in the region is poor and so the index-based approach is a useful one to prioritise sources and resources. Development of the P index in the Tuross River catchment (Figure 1) shows the majority of the catchment (67%) area is considered to have a very low or low risk of P loss. A P index <2.4 is considered low risk, while a P index 2.4-5.4 is considered moderate risk. The proportion of the catchment area of moderate P loss risk was 32.9%, while the high risk area was 0.03%. Management should be directed firstly to areas of high risk to reduce losses, although this should be implemented with knowledge of the costs of managing different areas and source strengths. Nutrient indices such as the type developed and applied here are complementary to other modelling approaches. The index approach generally provides much more detailed spatial resolution than fully-or semi-distributed modelling approaches. Semi-distributed models such as CatchMODS and SedNet/ANNEX can be used to set priorities at a broader catchment scale and they assist in the quantification of pollutant fluxes and simulation of broad management changes. Such changes could include conversion of areas from forestry to intensive land use. Index approaches are however potentially more relevant to the spatial level at which management changes, and particularly changes in farming systems, are applied i.e. the paddock and small subcatchment scale. In this way semi-distributed models can be combined with index approaches to provide a set of powerful tools to influence management outcomes. Semi-distributed models can provide overall direction to set the broad focus of management and index approaches can then be used to refine on-the-ground investigations and investment priorities.

Hydrological Process Investigation Using Water Quality Monitoring Data	MODSIM 2007: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: LAND, WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM07)	DEC 10-13, 2007	Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND	Lincoln Univ, HEMA Consulting Pty Ltd, Modelling and Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand (MSSANZ), Univ Canterbury, SGI, Lincoln Ventures Ltd, Hoare Res Software Ltd, IMACS, IEMSS, Environm Modelling & Software, IBM		Catchment modelling; Water quality; Monitoring data	PHOSPHORUS; CATCHMENTS; LOADS; NITROGEN; STREAMS	Various water quality parameters are measured routinely at sites across many countries, including Australia and New Zealand, largely as a part of institutional monitoring programs. With the current focus in hydrology on understanding processes from point to catchment scales, the potential exists for these data to provide information on dominant hydrological processes, albeit at coarser time and space scales than are often used in hydrological studies supported by specific and intense monitoring and use of specialist tracers. Methodological approaches to understanding hydrological processes across different scales include multi-scale and multi-site comparison, tracer and fingerprinting techniques, intense small scale hydrological studies, studies of seasonal influences, expansion of standard water quality monitoring parameter suites, catchment-based load differencing, and a range of statistical methods. Selection of a method or methods for use in a catchment should be based upon a staged approach, with preliminary investigation of seasonal and/or spatial patterns, followed by more intense (e. g. event sampling) investigation. Data from a long term water quality monitoring station in Victoria, Australia (Nicholson River @ Deptford, #223204; Catchment area 287 km(2)) was analysed to identify any potential relationships between flow and water quality parameters, both across the whole record and in seasonal periods. Seasons were defined by month start date rather than equinoxes and solstices, and the water quality parameters of interest (and number of data points) were dissolved oxygen (DO)(294), electrical conductivity (EC in-situ) (320), pH (328), suspended solids (SS) (156), Turbidity (304), filterable reactive phosphorus (FRP) (155), total phosphorus (TP) (157), nitrates and nitrites (NOx) (159), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) (159) and total nitrogen (TN) (159). None of the variables were found to have strong concentration relationships with flow, although EC tended towards less variable values with increasing flow. This was not found, however, to be related to particular seasons. Similarly, there was no discernible seasonal influences on pH, FRP, TP and TN. All other parameters did, however, exhibit a seasonal influence of some kind. DO showed a generally higher concentration in winter (Jun.-Aug.) than other seasons, and was 40% higher on average in winter (11.6 mg/L) than summer (8.2 mg/L). Turbidity and SS had interesting seasonal responses (Figure 1), with average SS concentration being highest in spring, while turbidity showed a low average value in autumn, compared to other seasons. [GRAPHICS] NOx had more than double the average concentration in winter (0.1 mg/L) than in other seasons (0.04 mg/L), while average summer TKN concentration (0.29 mg/L) was nearly double that of winter (0.16 mg/L). Autumn and spring concentrations fell between these, being 0.215 and 0.22, respectively. These results suggest a potential range of processes affecting the concentration, from those driven by increasing flows (e.g. SS), metabolic activity (e.g. DO) or volatilisation (NOx), although it is also possible that different sources of flow and different pathways of flow may be discernible through more detailed investigation of these data.

Supporting natural resources management in Tasmania through spatially distributed solute modelling with JAMS/J2000-S	MODSIM 2007: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: LAND, WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM07)	DEC 10-13, 2007	Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND	Lincoln Univ, HEMA Consulting Pty Ltd, Modelling and Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand (MSSANZ), Univ Canterbury, SGI, Lincoln Ventures Ltd, Hoare Res Software Ltd, IMACS, IEMSS, Environm Modelling & Software, IBM		Natural Resource Management; water quality; low concentration solute modelling	HYDROLOGICAL RESPONSE UNITS; GERMANY	To support natural resource management in Tasmania it is important to improve understanding of the coupled hydrologic and nutrient cycle. Of special interests are the detection of diffuse sources, their nutrient specific turnover processes, the relative importance of specific pathways and their connectivity under variable climatic conditions. The assessment of these processes are especially demanding as in the Tasmanian environments the nutrients levels for freshwater systems are low, e.g. in comparison to European or North-American conditions. Thus evidence has been given that even low nutrient enrichments substantially influence aquatic health by altering the composition of aquatic communities in some parts of Tasmania. Modelling low nutrient levels for freshwater systems requires deterministic and process-oriented physically-based model components with carefully parameterization as small changes in the modelling output will significantly influence the accuracy of the model results. Therefore an accurate description of the underlain system, input factors and depended variables for water and nutrients turnover is essential. The process-based and fully spatially distributed model JAMS/J2000S, recently developed at the FSU Jena in Germany was applied in a Tasmanian test catchment (Duck) to cope with the above considerations. The modelling therefore had the objective to represent dominant processes and pathways occurring in different landscape partitions by (i) Proofing the applicability of the JAMS/J2000-S model for low nutrient (ii) Locating source areas contributing high inputs of nitrogen to the Duck River taken its contrasting hydrological and land use systems into account. (iii) Developing conceptual knowledge for the Duck catchment on spatio-temporal dominant processes controlling water and nutrient releases to guide decision making in natural resource management. Accuracy indices to quantify the dynamics and percent bias for volume quantification were explored to evaluate model performance. The model was used to estimate the contribution of agriculture inputs to the total load of measured nutrient at the outlet of the Duck basin. It showed good agreement between simulated and measured loads. The application demonstrates the ability to improve the process knowledge of nutrient impacts on freshwater systems at the scale of implementation. Future investigation will focus on how such a process-oriented distributed model can be (i) Enhanced by data driven model development and (ii) Used to develop adaptive land use management strategies for better planning on resource conditions targets.

Revealing Patterns in Coastal Water Quality Data using Statistical Analysis	MODSIM 2007: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: LAND, WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM07)	DEC 10-13, 2007	Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND	Lincoln Univ, HEMA Consulting Pty Ltd, Modelling and Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand (MSSANZ), Univ Canterbury, SGI, Lincoln Ventures Ltd, Hoare Res Software Ltd, IMACS, IEMSS, Environm Modelling & Software, IBM		Harmful algal blooms; data mining; box plots; multivariate statistical analysis; factor analysis; water quality modelling; Hong Kong	ALGAL BLOOMS	A major impact of eutrophication is the stimulation of algal growth and the production of harmful algal blooms (HABs). HABs can have profound negative effects on the environment, which include severe dissolved oxygen depletion, fish kills, discoloration of marine water, beach closures, etc. Owing to the extremely complicated ecological processes, previous research efforts indicate that it is far from accurately unravelling the causality and dynamics of HABs and predicting their occurrence with acceptable accuracy and lead-time. Thus, techniques to better understand the complex interrelated processes in the ecosystem are needed. [GRAPHICS] In this study, visual data mining using box plots and multivariate statistical analysis using factor analysis are employed for a spatio-temporal analysis of coastal water quality data from Tolo Harbour, Hong Kong (Figure 1). To study spatial patterns, data from the seven monitoring stations (shown in Figure 1) are used. To study temporal patterns, two datasets from different periods were used: one when the water quality in Tolo Harbour was at its worst (in the late eighties) and the second dataset being more recent, when the water quality had improved significantly. The results from the analysis of box plots reveal pronounced spatial and temporal patterns and the heterogeneity of the parameters studied. The studies of spatial heterogeneity showed that out of the three monitoring stations in the Harbour Subzone, TM2 is the most susceptible to eutrophication. Its nearly landlocked location leads to higher nutrient concentrations, weaker flushing and consequent higher algal biomass. The factor analysis brings to light the dominant ecological processes in the coastal marine environment. It indicates nutrient processes and the hydro-biological processes to be most dominant and the external environmental factors are indicated to be relatively less dominant. The temporal analysis using box plots confirms the fact that the level of nutrients in Tolo Harbour has shown a significant decline in recent years. But, in spite of this decline, it is revealed in the factor analysis that the nutrient processes play an important role even in the recent years, suggesting adequate supply of nutrients for phytoplankton growth. Since nutrients from external sources like pollutant loadings from point sources have been significantly reduced, it seems that they are being released from nutrients accumulated in the sediments. It is therefore proposed that along with steps to control pollution loadings from external sources, it is necessary to undertake steps to control pollutant loadings from internal sources also. This study demonstrates the use of data mining techniques to exhibit prominent spatial and temporal patterns and to reveal dominant variables governing key ecological processes and thus provide further insight into the HAB dynamics.

Multiple regression analysis showed that, for BOD7, total-N and total-P, the most important predictor was the proportion of urban areas, but landscape metrics also had a significant relationship with water quality. Mean Shape Index and Contagion were the most important predictors for CODKMnO4. The knowledge that land use and landscape configuration impact water quality can be used in establishing and implementing water management plans in Europe.

Nitrogen source apportionment modeling and the effect of land-use class related runoff contributions	NORDIC HYDROLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	24th Nordic Hydrological Conference	AUG 06-09, 2006	Vingsted, DENMARK			Fyrismodel; HBV-N-D model; leaching coefficients; model comparison; River Fyris catchment; source apportionment	EUTROPHICATION; CATCHMENTS; RETENTION; DELIVERY; MARINE; SWEDEN	Models simulating nutrient transport at the catchment scale are frequently used for source apportionment and thereby for finding cost-efficient management strategies for water quality improvements. One typical modelling approach at the catchment scale is the use of leaching coefficients (mass per unit flow of water) to compute the nutrient input based on land-use information. In this study two different such model approaches, the lumped Fyrismodel and the distributed HBV-N-D model, were compared based on simulations for the River Fyris catchment in central Sweden. A major difference between the models were different assumptions of specific runoff variations between different land-use classes. These differences had a considerable effect on the computed source apportionment. The higher specific runoff from agricultural areas in the HBV-N-D model compared to the Fyrismodel resulted in a larger contribution of agricultural areas to the total nitrogen export. These results demonstrate the importance of the assumptions of the spatial variation of specific runoff on source apportionment HBV-N-D model estimations.

The process of AOX formation was examined using model water samples enriched with humic substances and nitrogen compounds. The pollutants were made subject to oxidation with chlorine or chlorine dioxide and chlorine under laboratory conditions. The quantity of the adsorbable chlorinated organic compounds that had formed was related to the content of total organic carbon, ammonia nitrogen and organic nitrogen in the water treated with chlorine or chlorine dioxide and chlorine. The results obtained make it clear that the inclusion of chlorine dioxide oxidation into the treatment train as a prior step to be applied 30 mins before the commencement of the disinfecting chlorination process permits the chlorine dose to be reduced and, more importantly, reduces the quantity of the AOX formed.

In a first phase, the pollution problems were investigated and the most appropriate measures to restore water quality in view of the 2008 Olympic Games were identified. Mainly, the lakes suffer from a diffuse eutrophic state that cannot be handled with the traditional approach of controlling the external nutrient loads. Consequently to control eutrophication, the solution to reduce the internal loads by continuous treatment of waters taken from the lakes with a "pump and treat" technique was selected. But, even in strong eutrophication status, the nutrients concentrations in surface waters are significantly lower than in wastewaters. Therefore two parallel goals are to be pursued; (1) selecting a purification technique able to treat low concentration waters with high removal efficiency; (2) identifying the optimal caption points so as to withdraw waters with the maximum available nutrients concentrations. These objectives will be pursued by compact. chemical assisted RO plants, and a detailed survey based on on - field continue monitoring and numerical models, aimed to select the optimal withdrawal location, timing and conditions, and to estimate the required restoration time.

Fifteen kilometres of pristine water front property needs to be protected in the most environmentally friendly way possible against the erosive forces of fluctuating tide levels and associated wave action to ensure that the islands will be developed in harmony with the Knysna Estuary environment. After thorough site trials and investigations, hexagon-at woven mesh products: Reno mattresses; gabions and Terramesh? were found to be the only alternative in achieving the onerous standards and criteria as set out in the project specifications, i.e. environmental compliance, durability under aggressive marine environments, ease of installation and vegetation establishment, and cost effectiveness. The chosen solution is able to protect each idyllic island against scour arising from inter tidal action and can also ensure the stability of the bank especially under rapid draw down conditions. As a result, the tidal flow around the islands is completely natural with excellent circulation, water quality and minimal silting. A state of the art modelling system developed by The Danish Hydraulic Institute was used to assist with the design and layout of the waterways. Hydraulic and hydrological modelling, which even accounts for climate change, should ensure that the Islands are completely safe from flooding. A bioengineering approach is being taken to the construction. Indigenous salt marsh plants are being used in conjunction with the inert materials in the inter - tidal zone. Small fish and marine life find food and shelter in the plants and natural rock along the edges of the waterways, which in turn, attract a diversity of birds and larger fish resulting in habitat improvement. The rock filled gabions provide surfaces for growth of algal - microbial films, which may contribute to nitrogen and phosphorus uptake from the tidal flow, thus reducing phytoplankton growth potential in the canals. The Deputy Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, Minister Ms. R. T. Mabudahfhasi has commended the developers "for the most responsible manner in which they conducted, supported and financed the environmental research, which probably represents the most comprehensive, professional and detailed Environmental Impact Assessment ever undertaken in South Africa".

The single-factor exponential model was used to evaluate the present water,quality. The rank correlation method was applied to analyzing the trend of change in water pollution, consequently to identifying the many: pollutants and their sources in this sea area. The analysis result indicates that, even in the dry season, the coastal water quality of Beibu Bay in Guangxi is good condition, being Classification II. In dry season, COD, inorganic nitrogen and active phosphate meets the functional requirements. Its primary contra factor is COD. The trend of water quality degradation is not significant over the past 5 years. Therefore, the Beibu Bay area has a high environmental capacity and is not likely to have the large-area pollution. There are spaces in this sea area for the development of industry, fishery and tourism.

Integrated ecological and economic analysis of ranch management systems: An example from south central Florida	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						stocking rate; stocking density; water quality; grazing management; cow-calf operations; economic performance; phosphorus; bioindicators	CATTLE STOCKING RATES; WATER-QUALITY; VEGETATION RESPONSE; SURFACE WATERS; PHOSPHORUS; FORAGE	Developing sustainable ranch management systems requires integrated research that examines interrelations among ecological and economic factors. In south central Florida, where phosphorus (P) loading is an overriding environmental concern, we established an interdisciplinary experiment to address the effects of cattle stocking density and pasture type on P loading and other ecological and economic factors in subtropical Florida ranchlands through a partnership including ecologists, agricultural faculty, agency personnel, and producers. Here we present an overview of all project components detailed in 3 accompanying papers in this issue of Rangeland Ecology & Management. We describe the experimental design, which included 2 replicates of 4 different cattle stocking density treatments (control, low, middle, and high [0, 15, 20, and 35 cow-calf pairs per pasture]) maintained on 8 improved summer pastures (similar to 20 ha each), and 8 seminative winter pastures (similar to 32 ha each) from 1998 to 2003. Stocking densities did not significantly affect P loads and concentrations in surface runoff, soil chemistry, or soil nematode communities, but did affect cattle production and economic performance. Cattle production was greater at the high than at the middle or low stocking density; economic performance declined significantly with decreasing stocking density (break-even was $1.89.kg(-1) for high and $2.66.kg(-1) for low density). Pasture type significantly affected environmental factors; average P runoff from improved summer pastures (1.71 kg P.ha(-1). y(-1)) was much greater than from seminative winter pastures (0.25 kg P . ha(-1) . y(-1)), most likely because of past P fertilizer use in improved pastures. We integrate results from all the papers within the context of a conceptual model and a P budget, and emphasize that management practices targeted at specific environmental factors on beef cattle ranches, such as nutrient loading, must include consideration of economic impacts and broader ecosystem implications.

Tioman Island of Malaysia is regarded as one of ten of the best islands in the world and attracts tourists from all over the world for its clear sea, beautiful seashore and charming scenery. In this paper, on the basis of in situ dataset in the study area, distribution discipline of water quality parameters is analyzed to find that phytoplankton pigment, rather than suspended sediment is the main water quality parameter in the study area; seawater there is clean but not very oligotrophic; seawater spectra contains distinct features. Then water quality hyperspectral retrieval models are developed based on in situ data to calculate the chlorophyll a concentration ([chl-a]), transparency (SD) with satisfactory performance. It's suggested that model precision should be validated further using more in-situ data.

MFP of the river water samples ranged from 1,200 to 22,000 net revertant colonies per liter of sample water. MFP of the effluent was from 5,300 to 22,000 net revertant colonies per liter. This survey showed that the removal percentages of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) at the sewage works were 62.0-79.3%. It also showed that MFP reductions at the same sewage works were 37.5-62.9%. There was no significant correlation observed between MFP and organic matter concentration for the river water samples. However, a weak correlation between ammonia nitrogen and MFP was observed for the same river water samples. These results indicate that MFP cannot be accurately estimated by use of the conventional water quality indices. When the samples contain a high concentration of ammonia nitrogen, it is difficult to control the amount of free chlorine dosages stoichiometrically, possibly resulting in the overdose of chlorine. An overdose of chlorine may cause further formation of mutagens. The isotherm of mutagen precursors adsorption onto the activated carbon (OL 20x50), which was purchased from Calgon Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, was studied using river water in order to explore the means of removing mutagen precursors from raw water used for the water supply. The adsorption isotherm attained fit well into the Freundlich model.

It is very important to estimate the level of pollution and effect these factors have on the quality of water in dug wells as only in such case solutions to decrease pollution level could be taken. The objective of this study is to estimate pollution level in water of dug wells, to determine the effect of pollution stipulating factors on pollution of dug well water, to estimate the realization in rural areas of requirements for water protection from pollution with nitrogen compounds from agricultural sources. It has been found that most wells in rural areas were built without observing safe distances from sources of pollution. Only 18% of all wells examined corresponded to the rules of establishment. That was the reason why in 52% of examined wells in Lithuania the water was found polluted with nitrates, in 63% of wells pollution with organic matters was unacceptably high. In certain regions all wells were polluted. Having carried out a multiple regressive analysis of risk factors effect on nitrite concentration in the water of dug wells, it was found that the distance to the source of spot pollution as well as the depth of the well had the greatest effect on nitrite concentration in dug wells' water. Regional maps were made for Lithuanian dug wells according to their pollution with nitrogen compounds. It has been found that after pollution sources had been eliminated in 1998, pollution level in dug water of a sample object did not decrease until 2004. It demonstrates that the process of purification of dug water takes a lot of time.			ai@lzuu.lt; laima.cesoniene@lzuu.lt; ch@lzuu.lt					ASKINIS S, 1997, VANDENS UKIO INZINER, V3, P118; BAKER DB, 1994, P 4 NAT C PEST; Barber C., 1996, HYDROGEOL J, V4, P6, DOI DOI 10.1007/S100400050078; Chettri M, 1995, HYDROGEOL J, V3, P71; Clawges RM, 1996, WATER RESOUR BULL, V32, P1055; Datta PS, 1999, ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS, V56, P209, DOI 10.1023/A:1005903619718; Fedkiw J, 1991, NITRATE OCCURRENCE U; Fuest S, 1998, J HAZARD MATER, V61, P197, DOI 10.1016/S0304-3894(98)00123-X; GIEDRAITIENE J, 2002, ORO TEMPERATUROS IR; Glanville TD, 1997, T ASAE, V40, P363, DOI 10.13031/2013.21281; Gosselin DC, 1997, GROUND WATER MONIT R, V17, P77; HALLBERG GR, 1987, PESTICIDES GROUNDWAT, P83; HUBBARD RK, 1989, J SOIL WATER CONSERV, V44, P20; KUTRA S, 2002, MOKSLO DARBAI, V20, P28; Mitchell RJ, 2003, J ENVIRON QUAL, V32, P789, DOI 10.2134/jeq2003.0789; Nolan BT, 2000, ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL, V34, P1156, DOI 10.1021/es9907663; ROUX JC, 1995, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V171, P3, DOI 10.1016/0048-9697(95)04695-X; Rowden RD, 2001, HYDROGEOL J, V9, P487, DOI 10.1007/s100400100150; Ulen B, 2003, NUTR CYCL AGROECOSYS, V65, P129, DOI 10.1023/A:1022133031584; WERSIN P, 1997, HYDROGEOL J, V2, P42	20	0	0	0	4	LITHUANIAN UNIV AGRICULTURE	KAUNO RAJ	STUDENTU 11, AKADEMIJA, KAUNO RAJ, LT-53361, LITHUANIA	1822-3230			RURAL DEVELOPMENT			2007							217	222					6	Agricultural Economics & Policy; Ecology; Economics; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies; Management; Regional & Urban Planning	Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Business & Economics; Public Administration	BIB49	WOS:000258167800035					2021-01-11

We study the existence of optimal solutions, derive an optimality system, and determine optimal solutions. In the original spatially homogeneous formulation [ M. Scheffer, Oikos, 62 ( 1991), pp. 271 - 282] the dynamics of plankton were investigated as a function of parameters for nutrient levels and.fish predation rate on zooplankton. In our paper the model is spatially extended and the parameter for. fish predation treated as a multiplicative control variable. The model has implications for the biomanipulation of food- webs in eutrophic lakes to help improve water quality. In order to illustrate the control of irregular spatiotemporal dynamics of plankton in the model we implement a semi- implicit ( in time). finite element method with " mass lumping" and present the results of numerical experiments in two space dimensions.

Impact of harvesting and logging slash on nitrogen and carbon dynamics in soils from upland spruce forests in northeastern Ontario	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						boreal forest; net N mineralization; immobilization; logging slash; microbial biomass; potential aquatic impacts	BOREAL FOREST; WATER-QUALITY; NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; CLEAR-CUT; TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; NORTHWESTERN QUEBEC; CANADIAN FORESTS; N MINERALIZATION; TREMBLING ASPEN	The potential impact of timber harvesting in the boreal forest on aquatic ecosystem water quality and productivity depends in part on the production of nutrients within the soil of the harvested catchment. Nitrogen supplied by organic matter decomposition is of particular interest because of the important role that N plays in biotic processes in surface waters, and in forest nutrition in general. Logging slash quality and input to the forest floor has the potential to influence N availability after harvest on clearcut sites. Net production of organic and inorganic-N and microbial biomass C and N concentrations were determined during a 90-day laboratory incubation at constant temperature and moisture. Incubated soils included F horizon and shallow mineral soil horizons (0-5 cm) from unharvested and full-tree harvested (2 and 12 growing seasons since harvest) boreal forest sites at the Esker Lakes Research Area (ELRA), in northeastern Ontario, Canada. In an ancillary experiment, black spruce foliage was added to unharvested forest floor material after 30 days during a 90-day laboratory incubation to simulate the influence of logging slash from full-tree harvesting on C and N dynamics. Twelve-year old clearcut F horizon material released on average 75 and 5 times more NO3--N and 3 and 2 times as much inorganic-N than soil collected from unharvested and 2-year-old clearcuts, respectively. This increase in NO3- -N accumulation during the incubation was accompanied by decreases in both exchangeable NH4+-N and microbial biomass C and N levels. Net daily changes in microbial biomass N were significantly related to organic and inorganic-N accumulation or loss within the F horizon. Mineral soil release of inorganic-N was lower than release from the forest floor. Nitrate-nitrogen accumulation was lower, and NH4+-N accumulation was higher in mineral soil from unharvested sites when compared to 12-year-old clearcuts. Calculated harvest response ratios indicated that incubated mineral soil from the 12-year-old clearcut sites released significantly greater amounts of NO3 -N than 2-year-old clearcuts. Incorporation of black spruce needles into F horizon material reduced the production of organic and inorganic-N and increased microbial biomass N. Laboratory incubations of F horizon and shallow mineral soil from 12-year-old clearcuts suggested that these boreal soils have the capacity for increased inorganic-N production compared to uncut stands several years after harvesting. This has the potential to increase N availability to growing boreal forest plantations and increase N leaching due to greater NO3- -N levels in the forest soil. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Nutrient fate and transport in surface runoff from poultry litter stock piles	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Agricultural-Engineers	JUL 27-30, 2003	Las Vegas, NV	Amer Soc Agr Engineers		chicken waste; nitrogen; phosphorus; rainfall simulation; water quality	PHOSPHORUS; SOIL; MANURE; WATER; MANAGEMENT; MOVEMENT; NITROGEN; QUALITY; LOSSES; FLOW	The effects of poultry litter stockpiles on nutrient availability and movement were evaluated for two soils from the major poultry-producing region in Maryland. The effect of covering 10.9 Mg stockpiles with tarps was compared to uncovered piles. An upland Coastal Plain soil (Evesboro sandy loam) and a lowland Coastal Plain soil (Othello silt loam) were used. A rainfall simulator was operated at 42 to 48 mm/h until runoff occurred for I h. Surface runoff was captured, and nutrient analysis was done for nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), orthophosphate (PO4-P), and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations. Mass transport for each of these constituents was calculated from flow data. The variable that had the greatest effect on both hydraulic responses and nutrient fate and transport responses was soil type. Average NO3-N concentrations ranged from 2.75 to 9.80 mg/L, and for the sandy loam soil, wet AMC generated higher NO3-N concentrations than did dry AMC. Average NO3-N transported ranged from 6.5 to 1970.3 mg on the sandy loam and from 691 to 2821 mg on the silt loam. Average PO4-P concentration ranged from 0.21 to 10.78 mg/L. A two-way interaction between treatment and soil indicated that covering generated more runoff and higher peakflow rates than the uncovered piles.

According to these reasons it is important to evaluate the pollution load and its economic value to river basin. According to the Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 23 October 2000, establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy it is necessary not only to analyze the specific character of the river basin, impact of human activity, but also to make its economic analysis. These factors could make the main basis in the creation of new programs at protecting and improving water ecosystems. In this article, the pollution load of organic compounds and nutrients (total nitrogen and phosphorus) was estimated in the Lithuanian rivers from point and non point sources.

J	El-Sadek, A				El-Sadek, Alaa			Upscaling field scale hydrology and water quality modelling to catchment scale	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT			English	Article						hydrology; water quality; field scale; catchment scale; rural catchment; nutrient loadings	DRAINMOD-N; AUTOMATED TECHNIQUES; BASE-FLOW; SIZE	The aim of the research presented in this manuscript is to model the outflow discharge and nutrient load at the outlet of small scale, mainly agricultural catchments. There to two approaches for the simulation of the transport of water and the transport and transformation of nitrogen in the stream were tested and compared. Both approaches use the DRAINMOD and the DRAINMOD-N models to simulate the hydrology and the nitrogen balance of the land phase at the scale of a field/field block/sub-catchment. Both models are used to generate the drain outflow and the nitrate concentration of the drainage water of the field unit considered. The contribution of the field units to the nutrient load of the river are calculated by multiplying the simulated flow weighted N concentrations with drain outflows. In a first approach, called the lumped approach, the water discharge and the nutrient load of field blocks are routed through the river using an exponential model. In this model the nitrate contribution of an individual field block to the nitrate load in the river outlet is calculated assuming first order nutrient decay/attenuation during the transport of the drainage water from the field outlet to the river outlet. The arrival at the outlet section of the nitrate plumes of the field blocks are phased in time based on the velocity profile in the river. The second approach, herein called the complex approach is using the hydraulic river modeling code MIKE 11. This model is using a complex process ADR (advective-dispersive-reactive) equation to calculate the chemical changes in the river water. The comparative analysis between both routing approaches reveals that the lumped approach is able to predict sufficiently accurate nutrient load at the catchment outlet. The complex approach has the advantage of giving a more accurate estimate of the nutrient load at the catchment outlet, resulting in a more precise modeling of the transport and transformation of the nutrient load in streams.

An ecosystem modelling approach for deriving water quality criteria	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						calibration; copper; ecological effect assessments; ecological interactions	TOXICITY; METALS; COPPER	Ecological effects of chemicals on ecosystems are the result of direct effects of the chemical, determined in single-species toxicity testing, and indirect effects due to ecological interactions between species. Current experimental methods to account for such interactions are expensive. Hence, mathematical models of ecosystems have been proposed as an alternative. The use of these models often requires extensive calibration, which hampers their use as a general tool in ecological effect assessments. Here we present a novel ecosystem modelling approach which assesses effects of chemicals on ecosystems by integrating single-species toxicity test results and ecological interactions, without the need for calibration on case-specific data. The methodology is validated by comparing predicted ecological effects of copper in a freshwater planktonic ecosystem with an experimental ecosystem data set. Two main effects reflected by this data set (a decrease of cladocerans and an increase of small phytoplankton) which were unpredictable from single-species toxicity test results alone, were predicted accurately by the developed model. Effects on populations which don't interact directly with other populations, were predicted equally well by single-species toxicity test results as by the ecosystem model. The small amount of required data and the high predictive capacity can make this ecosystem modelling approach an efficient tool in water quality criteria derivation for chemicals.

Modeling phosphorus in the upper Etowah River basin: identifying sources under uncertainty	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Etowah River basin; phosphorus; SWAT; total maximum daily load; uniform covering by probabilistic rejection	CALIBRATION	The Uniform Covering by Probabilistic Rejection (UCPR) algorithm was used, in conjunction with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, to identify P loads from point source and nonpoint source polluters in the upper Etowah River basin (UERB) in Georgia. The key findings of the research are as follows. The mean absolute error was preferred over the root mean square error as a search criterion for the UCPR algorithm when water quality observations are scarce. The undocumented P load from point sources in the UERB was consistently estimated as about 43 kg/d by the proposed method; but the method was not able to identify the broiler litter application rate to the poultry/beef operation pastures. Point sources (both documented and undocumented), poultry/beef operation pastures, and forests are the three major contributors of P. During 1992-1996, on average they accounted for 36.4, 31.7, and 17.2% of P load from the UERB, respectively.	[Radcliffe, D. E.] Univ Georgia, Dept Crop & Soil Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Beck, M.

Integrated modelling under uncertainty in watershed-level assessment and management	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						integrated modelling system; modified-BASINS; Monte Carlo simulation; uncertainty analysis; water quality prediction; watershed management	EUTROPHICATION	Uncertainty in water quality model predictions is inevitably high due to natural stochasticity, model uncertainty, and parameter uncertainty. An integrated modelling system (modified-BASINS) under uncertainty is described and demonstrated for use in receiving-water quality prediction and watershed management. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to investigate the effect of various uncertainty types on output prediction. Without pollution control measures in the watershed, the concentrations of total nitrogen (T-N) and total phosphorus (T-P) in the Hwaong Reservoir, considering three uncertainty types, would be less than about 4.4 and 0.23 mg L-1, respectively, in 2012, with 90% confidence. The effects of two watershed management practices, wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and constructed wetlands (WETLAND), were evaluated. The combined scenario (WWTP + WETLAND) was the most effective at improving reservoir water quality, bringing concentrations of T-N and T-P in the Hwaong Reservoir to less than 3.4 and 0.14 mg L-1, 24 and 41% improvements, respectively, with 90% confidence. Overall, the Monte Carlo simulation in the integrated modelling system was practical for estimating uncertainty and reliable in water quality prediction. The approach described here may allow decisions to be made based on the probability and level of risk, and its application is recommended.	[Ham, J.

Riparian wetlands for enhancing the self-purification capacity of streams	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						BMPs; design criteria; diffuse pollution; riparian wetland; Scotland	COMPLIANCE PARAMETERS; BATHING WATERS; URBAN	Best Management Practices (BMPs) are increasingly used to restore river water quality but design guidance is limited. An alternative approach to remediating diffuse pollution loads is to identify the most polluting high flows from pollutographs and hydrographs and spill these flows into riparian treatment wetlands for treatment before drainage back into the watercourse. The approach is demonstrated for two contrasting catchments in Scotland impacted by diffuse pollution. The Caw Burn receives industrial estate drainage with high suspended solids, hydrocarbons, BOD and ammoniacal-nitrogen concentrations. Applying the proposed design criteria demonstrated that the existing retrofit BMP system at the site is undersized (4950 m(2)) compared to the required wetland area (11,800 m(2)), but accommodating the additional area is likely to be expensive. The second case-study is Brighouse Bay where bathing waters are impacted by faecal indicator organisms derived primarily from livestock runoff. In this catchment the riparian wetland area required to retain runoff so that E coli bacteria would die-off to concentrations below bathing water standards was estimated to be 3-6 ha (0.5-1% of catchment area). Further refinement and testing of the design approach is required, including consideration of other factors such as vegetation type, ownership and maintenance, to develop a more holistic approach to river restoration.

Estimation and comparison of nitrogen loads and attenuation in agricultural catchments of Japan and Korea	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						environmental load; GIS; non-point source; pollutant load unit; time lag		To help in clarifying the relationship between the time lag and attenuation of nitrogen (N) loads generated in agricultural catchments, long-term trends in activities that generate N loads and in environmental N loads were estimated in catchments in Japan and Korea dominated by non-point-source emissions. Our approach used statistical data and geographical information system software to analyze pollutant loads. The method was successful in both countries because of the availability of well-developed statistics, geographical information, and weather and water quality monitoring systems, and the accumulation of research data concerning the generation of N loads and the fate of N in soils. Comparison of environmental loads with the loads observed in river water at the outlet of each catchment revealed that: (1) the effect of changes in the environmental load in a catchment appeared almost immediately in the river water quality in Korea, but did not appear clearly even 10 years later in Japan; and (2) the strength of the attenuation appeared to be much lower in Korea than in Japan. These findings suggest that regional characteristics play important roles in the sensitivity of water quality to load-generating activities.

In this paper, a systematic method using an optimal estimation algorithm is presented for simultaneous estimation of diffuse pollution and model parameters in a stream water quality model. It was applied with the QUAL2E model to the South Han River in South Korea for optimal estimation of kinetic constants and diffuse loads along the river. Initial calibration results for kinetic constants selected from a sensitivity analysis reveal that diffuse source inputs for nitrogen and phosphorus are essential to satisfy the system mass balance. Diffuse loads for total nitrogen and total phosphorus were estimated by solving the expanded inverse problem. Comparison of kinetic constants estimated simultaneously with diffuse sources to those estimated without diffuse loads, suggests that diffuse sources must be included in the optimization not only for its own estimation but also for adequate estimation of the model parameters. Application of the optimization method to river water quality modeling is discussed in terms of the sensitivity coefficient matrix structure.

Nitrogen fertilizer impact on the Wilmot watershed aquifer in Prince Edward island, Canada	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						agriculture; fertilizer; groundwater contamination; nitrogen; water quality; watershed	EXCHANGE MEMBRANES; FIELD; SOIL; FORESTS; WINTER; STATE	The objective of this study is to estimate the soil N flux from the vadose zone to the aquifer of the Wilmot watershed (Prince Edward Island, Canada) for a typical three-year cropping rotation (barley-red clover-potato). A conceptual model estimates that 199-221 tons of N were yearly available for leaching at the watershed scale. A significant portion of this N amount was available for leaching at the end of the crop season representing 80-90% of the annual N balance. Drainage water nitrate concentrations were significantly higher after the potato-rotation year than during the crop season. Low nitrate concentrations were measured at spring thaw indicating that most of the nitrate available from the preceding potato crop season was likely leached at the end of fall or during winter. Early spring ionic exchange membrane sampling show a large availability of nitrate in soil possibly throughout winter as well, resulting from soil N mineralization and nitrification over the winter period. These findings are corroborated by the isotope natural abundance analysis of nitrate in groundwater implying that nitrifiers are significantly active during winter, as well as during the crop season, and that leaching of soil nitrates with seasonal signals takes place whenever recharge is occurring.

Long-term monitoring and proposed diffuse pollution control of a tropical reservoir	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th IWA International Conference on Diffuse Pollution	AUG 09-SEP 12, 2005	Johannesburg, SOUTH AFRICA	IWA		diffuse pollution; monitoring; N/P relationship; restoration measures; tropical reservoirs		This paper presents the results of 30 years of water quality monitoring in a tropical water supply reservoir (Vargem das Flores, Brazil). This water body is subjected to eutrophication problems caused by point sources (discharge of untreated sewage) and diffuse pollution (agricultural use in the drainage basin). Emphasis is given here on the estimation of nutrient loads and on the study of the N/P ratio in the water body. In spite of the prevalence of high N/P values, there is a clear trend in the dominance of cyanobacteria in the phytoplankton, which contradicts results from research in temperate aquatic environments. Some restoration measures for Vargem das Flores Reservoir are currently being implemented: construction of wastewater treatment plants, control of recreational activities, erosion control by hydroseeding and use of natural wetlands. Finally some management strategies in order to prevent algae input in the water abstraction system are discussed. Examples of these techniques are the installation of plastic barriers and the construction of an air curtain device.

Discharges and recharges of sub-areas were determined, exchanging loads between surface water and groundwater have been generated. Water quality simulations were performed for critical hydrological situations, wet and dry years, as well as for a high input concentration of sulphate. The retention effect during dry years was found to be twice as high as that in wet years. When excluding the mixing effect with tributaries, in the dry year the sulphate reduction capacity of the wetland amounts to 36%, of which 13% is resulting from extensive running water system, and 23% of the wet areas with organic soils.

Our field surveys were carried out during the 11-month's period from April 2001 to February 2002 and the correlations between nitrogen concentrations and catchment characteristics were studied. The results showed that the vegetation cover was strongly correlated to total nitrogen (TN) and nitrate + nitrite - nitrogen (NOx-N) concentrations. That is, the TN and NOx-N concentrations had positive correlations with mean normalized difference vegetation cover index (NDVI) of each sub-area during dormant seasons (mean NDVI < 0 - 70) and had negative correlations during the growing season (mean NDVI >= 0 - 70). The significance of catchment characteristics to TN and NOx-N concentrations was ranked as vegetation cover > soil > topography > land use, and the best models can account for 55-64% of the variance of TN and NOx-N concentrations.

Integrating wetlands and riparian zones in river basin modelling	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference of the International-Environmental-Modelling-and-Software-Society	JUN 14-17, 2004	Osnabruck, GERMANY	Int Environm Modelling & Software Soc		riparian zones; wetlands; water quality; groundwater dynamics; nutrient retention; integrated river basin modelling	NITRATE REMOVAL; WATER; GROUNDWATER; TRANSPORT; POLLUTION; NITROGEN; CATCHMENTS; EUROPE; PLANTS; FATE	Wetlands, and in particular riparian wetlands, represent an interface between the catchment area and the aquatic environment. They control the exchange of water and related chemical fluxes from the upper catchment area to surface waters like streams and lakes. Their influence on water and nutrient balances has been investigated mainly at the patch scale. In this study an attempt was made (a) to integrate riparian zones and wetlands into eco-hydrological river basin modelling, and (b) to quantify the impacts of riparian wetland processes on water and nutrient fluxes in a meso-scale catchment located in the northeastern German lowland. The investigation was performed by analysing hydro-chemical field data and applying the eco-hydrological model SWIM (Soil and Water Integrated Model), which was extended to reproduce the relevant water and nutrient flows and retention processes at the catchment scale in general, and in riparian zones and wetlands in particular. The main extensions introduced in the model were: (1) implementation of daily groundwater table dynamics at the hydrotope level, (2) implementation of water and nutrient uptake by plants from groundwater in riparian zones and wetlands, and (3) assessment of nutrient retention in groundwater and interflow. The simulation results indicate that wetlands, though they represent relatively small parts of the total catchment area, may have a significant impact on the overall water and nutrient balances of the catchment. The uncertainty of the simulation results is considerably high, with the main sources of uncertainty being the model parameters representing the geo-hydrology and the input data for land use management.

Graeme			Land cover impacts on stream nutrients and fecal coliform in the lower Piedmont of West Georgia	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						nitrogen; phosphorus; fecal coliform; urbanization; Piedmont; impervious surface; land cover	WATER-QUALITY; URBANIZATION; AREA; ATLANTA; RUNOFF	As urbanization infiltrates into rural areas, stream water quality is expected to decline as a result from increased impervious surface and greater sources for pollutants. Consequently, West Georgia's water quality is threatened by extensive development as well as other land uses such as livestock grazing and silvicultural activity. Maintenance of stream water quality, as land development occurs, is critical for the protection of drinking water and biotic integrity. A 2-phase, watershed-scale study was established to develop relationships among land cover and water quality within western Georgia. During phase 1, nutrient and fecal coliform data were collected within 18 mixed land use watersheds, ranging in size from 500 to 2500 ha. Regression models were developed that related land cover to stream water nutrient and fecal coliform concentrations. Nutrient and fecal coliform concentrations within watersheds having > 24% impervious surface (IS) were often higher than those in nonurban watersheds (i.e., < 5% IS) during both base flow (N: 1.64 mg/L versus 0.61 mg/L, and FC: 430 versus 120 MPN/100 ml) and storm flow (N: 1.93 mg/L versus 0.36 mg/L, and FC: 1600 versus 167 MPN/100 ml). Fecal coliform bacteria in urbanized areas consistently exceeded the US EPA's review criterion for recreational waters during both base flow and to a greater extent storm flow. During phase 2, regression models were tested based on data from six newly chosen watersheds with similar land use/cover patterns. Lastly, theoretical watersheds, based on land use percentages, were created to illustrate trends in water quality impairment as land development occurs. The models developed from this research could be used to forecast water quality changes under various land use scenarios in the developing Piedmont region of the US. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The present paper gives a comprehensive description of model development, model structure along with the governing equations, sensitivity and identifiability analyses as well as calibration and validation. The development of BWQM was guided by two major restrictions: it has to account for all relevant processes affecting DO, and it should only be based on readily available data and system knowledge. These restrictions led to a model, calculating nine state variables, including DO, phytoplankton, nutrients, and biochemical oxygen demand. However, due to limited data, the representation of phytoplankton is quite simple. A local sensitivity analysis led to a subset of five parameters, which are much more sensitive than the 22 other parameters. These five parameters are all closely connected with phytoplankton dynamics, highlighting the importance of phytoplankton for the DO budget. On the basis of an a priori identiflability analysis, four out of the five most sensitive parameters were chosen for model calibration. The calibrated model performed well in simulating DO and phytoplankton. Given the data availability and the present state of system knowledge, BWQM comes close to representing the optimal model with respect to predicting DO and phytoplankton.

J	Haag, I				Haag, Ingo			A Basic Water Quality Model for the River Neckar: Part 2 - Model-based analysis of the oxygen budget and scenarios	ACTA HYDROCHIMICA ET HYDROBIOLOGICA			English	Article						phytoplankton; eutrophication; phosphorus limitation; biochemical oxygen demand; ammonium; artificial aeration	EUTROPHICATION	In this paper the Basic Water Quality Model (BWQM) for the central part of River Neckar is used to analyse the oxygen budget and to assess the potentials of various measures to prevent or mitigate critical dissolved oxygen (DO) declines. It is shown that the oxygen budget is mainly governed by phytoplankton dynamics. The excessive growth of algae and the sudden break down of the resulting algal blooms may cause episodic DO depressions. Therefore, to stabilise the oxygen budget in a sustainable way, eutrophication has to be controlled within the central part of River Neckar and the upstream regions. The only feasible way to reach this goal appears to be a further drastic reduction of phosphorus emissions. In addition, it is indispensable to hold the very high standards of biochemical oxygen demand and ammonium retention at the wastewater treatment plants. A worse performance of the treatment plants would dramatically aggravate critical DO declines which may be caused by algae dynamics. As long as the oxygen budget is not completely stabilised, weir and turbine aeration can be used to mitigate DO depressions. It could be shown that the potentials of these measures suffice to keep DO at a tolerable level.

Rainfall-induced release of fecal coliforms and other manure constituents: Comparison and modeling	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article							CATTLE MANURE; RUNOFF; BACTERIA; PHOSPHORUS; TRANSPORT; CRYPTOSPORIDIUM; GIARDIA; WATER	Modeling release of fecal coliforms is an important component of fate and transport simulations related to environmental water quality. Manure constituents other than fecal coliforms may serve as natural tracers of fecal contamination provided that their release from manure to runoff is similar to the fecal coliform release. The objectives of this work were to compare release of fecal coliforms (FC), chloride (Cl-), organic carbon (OC), and water-soluble phosphorus (P) from dissolving manure and to assess the performance of three models in describing the observed release. Bovine manure was applied on 0.5- by 0.3-m bare and vegetated subplots with 20% slope on sandy loam and clay loam soils. Concentrations of Cl-, FC, OC, and P were measured in runoff collected from troughs at the edges of the subplots at 5-min intervals during 1-h rainfall simulations. The one-parametric exponential model and two-parametric Vadas-Kleinman-Sharpley model and Bradford-Schijven model were fitted to the data. The Bradford-Schijven model had uncorrelated parameters, one of which was linearly related to the irrigation rate, and another parameter reflected the presence or the absence of vegetation. Kinetics of the FC release from manure was similar to the release kinetics of P and OC. The Bradford-Schijven model is recommended to simulate the release of manure constituents.

We hypothesize that this is due to the increases in variation that occur with increases in sample size and in the geographic scales of the areas in which the watersheds are distributed. Land cover alone cannot explain all of that variation; more predictors must be considered. Conversely, models with high explicative power would require relatively small sample sizes distributed over small areas. This hypothesis was evaluated sampling 17 watersheds from southern Chile's Lake Region, for which we developed regressive models between land cover/watershed area/precipitation/geomorphology and stream properties (i.e., conductivity, temperature). With a maximum n = 15 watersheds, on a regional scale, a poorly explained variation in hydrologic variables (mean 37-49%) was obtained. The R-2 ncreased slightly, to 45-52%, when precipitation was included as a predictor. In half of the cases analyzed, the models improved when geomorphology was considered as an additional predictor (60-66%), supporting our hypothesis. Furthermore, when our analysis was restricted to a narrower latitudinal span (n = 9), the R-2 was much stronger (68-87%) when only land cover and watershed area were included as predictors. These percentages also increased when more predictors were incorporated. Nevertheless, a portion of unexplained variance remained that would require the consideration of more predictors, such as geology and edaphology. The documented trade-off provides evidence that argues against the spatial generality of land cover/stream property models.

Relationships among nutrients, algae, and land use in urbanized southern California streams	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article							MATRIX CONCEPTUAL-MODEL; MEDITERRANEAN STREAM; WATER-QUALITY; LIGHT LIMITATION; TOTAL NITROGEN; PERIPHYTON; BIOMASS; PHOSPHORUS; RIVER; RETENTION	We surveyed algal cover, algal biomass, and physical and chemical factors at 14 sites representing a range of land use types in the Malibu Creek watershed in southern California, USA. We also conducted nutrient diffuser Substrate experiments to identify the nutrient limiting algal growth. Algal biomass increased with urbanization, reaching very high levels in the most urbanized streams (up to 322.4 mg chlorophyll a center dot m(-2)). Total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and benthic and total chlorophyll concentrations were positively correlated with the proportion of upstream land covered by impervious surfaces. Relationships between land use and algal biomass or nutrient concentrations were evaluated at 100 m, 500 m, and whole subwatershed scales. The closest relationships were found at the 500 m scale, where 56% of the variation in total chlorophyll could be explained by the proportion of land within a 500 m radius upstream covered by impervious surfaces. Floating macroalgae were observed in the summer in pools with high nutrient and light levels, whereas benthic algal biomass was positively related to total phosphorus concentrations and current speed. Other methods of determining nutrient limitation (nutrient diffuser substrate experiment, molar N/P ratios in stream water) produced conflicting results, possibly because algal growth was saturated by high nutrient levels at some of the study sites.

Sediment nutrient flux in a coastal lake impacted by diverted Mississippi River water	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP); total phosphorus (TP); nitrogen; total maximum daily load (TMDL); internal nutrient load; sediment flux	PHOSPHORUS FLUX; DENITRIFICATION; NITROGEN; WETLANDS; FLORIDA	The internal nutrient load from bottom sediment to the water column of a Louisiana Barataria Basin lake (Lake Cataouatche) receiving diverted Mississippi River water was determined. Dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), ammonium (NH4-N) and nitrate (NO3-N) flux from sediment to water column were measured. The DRP flux averaged -0.22 mg m(-2) d(-1) under aerobic water column conditions, as compared with that 3.29 mg m(-2) d(-1) under anaerobic conditions. The average NH4-N released under anaerobic conditions (1.42 mg m(-2) d(-1)) was significantly greater than rates under aerobic conditions (-0.02 mg m(-2) d(-1)), indicating a strong relationship between nutrient flux and oxygen availability in the water column. The average NO3-N flux was 2.13 mg m(-2) d(-1) under aerobic conditions as compared with -0.24 mg m(-2) d(-1) under anaerobic conditions in the sediment water column. When the water column maintained under anaerobic conditions was switched to aerobic conditions, the DRP, NH4-N, and NO3-N concentrations in overlying water decreased rapidly over a short period of time. The mean annual internal DRP and NH4-N load from the sediment to the overlying water was estimated to be 69.26 and 29.9 tonnes (Mg) yr(-1) respectively, which represents a significant portion of the total nutrient load to the Lake. Results demonstrate that the internal flux of nutrients from sediments can contribute a significant portion of the total nutrient load to the water column and should be considered in decisions on impact of nutrient in diverted Mississippi River on water quality of Barataria Basin.

J	Salvetti, R; Azzellino, A; Vismara, R				Salvetti, Roberta; Azzellino, Arianna; Vismara, Renato			Diffuse source apportionment of the Po river eutrophying load to the Adriatic sea: Assessment of Lombardy contribution to Po river nutrient load apportionment by means of an integrated modelling approach	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						source apportionment; point and non-point sources; river quality modelling; SWAT; QUAL2E	ESTUARIES	The source apportionment of the annual nutrient load carried by the Po river to the Adriatic sea has been studied. An integrated modelling approach was applied to the Lombardy plain area, which covers about 34% of the Po river watershed area and accounts for about 50% of the point sources' loads carried by the river. To extract all the information available from direct instrearn measurements, two different modelling tools were alternatively used. The source apportionment was investigated considering both dry and wet weather scenarios. In order to quantify the apportionment in dry-weather conditions, the Lombardy portion of the Po river basin was modelled by using the US-EPA QUAL2E model. Such a simulation allowed to assess a significant contribution (about 50% of the total dry-weather load) of a not rain-driven diffuse pollution component (i.e. groundwater, springs, lake emissaries). Moreover, to estimate the rain-driven surface runoff contribution to the instrearn total load, the Lombardy plain area was also modelled by means of the US-DA SWAT model. SWAT results indicate a runoff contribution to the Po river instream total load of about 10 000 t N yr(-1) and 1300 t P yr(-1) (i.e. approximately the 10-20% of the total annual Lombardy nutrient load). At the event scale (i.e. the single rainstorm event) the runoff contribution may rise up to 30-80% of the total instream load. Finally, the total annual nitrogen load at the Po basin closure was estimated for the period 1985-2001. Out of a total annual load of 140000 t N yr(-1), Lombardy accounts for 43% (point plus diffuse sources). The rain-driven diffuse sources constitute the 20% of the overall total load, the point sources account for 40%, whereas the remaining 40% is mainly constituted by "dry-weather diffuse sources" (i.e. groundwater, springs, lake emissaries).

J	Wang, CH; Ming, JZ				Wang, Chuanhai; Ming, Jingzhong			Diurnal patterns of Vallisneria asiatica on water environment and its effects on phosphorus release from sediment	DYNAMICS OF CONTINUOUS DISCRETE AND IMPULSIVE SYSTEMS-SERIES B-APPLICATIONS & ALGORITHMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Complex Systems and Applications	JUN 16-18, 2006	Huhhot, PEOPLES R CHINA				LAKE ECOSYSTEM; RESTORATION; VEGETATION; PROFILE	The diurnal patterns of macrophyte on water environment and its effects on phosphorus release from sediment is an environmental question of a result affected by several factors, and these factors can also interact each other. The effect of macrophyte on water quality and environment is well studied, but partly because of its complication, few report on its diurnal variation and its potential implication on phosphorus release from sediment. Based on the laboratory simulated experiments, with and without planted Vallisneria asiatica, the diurnal effects of Vallisneria asiatica on water quality and environment are investigated, results show that Vallisneria asiatica can significantly change the water environment, such as pH, dissolved oxygen, conductance, total P, etc. Showing that whatever the weather is, the water with Vallisneria asiatica planted have higher dissolved oxygen, but lower turbidity, conductance and total P. Our results also show that the variation of environmental factors with Vallisneria asiatica have obvious diurnal characteristic, but steady in water without Vallisneria asiatica. The interaction between the Diurnal patterns of vallisneria asiatica on water environment and phosphorus release from sediment is also discussed. Water TP concentration is positively correlative with electrical conductance and DO, but negatively correlative with Eh and pH, while the electrical conductance is decreased, Eh, pH and DO is increased in response to Vallisneria asiatica, therefore, Vallisneria asiatica can enhance phosphorus release rate through affecting electrical conductance, but at the same time, Vallisneria asiatica can decrease phosphorus release rate through affecting Eh, pH and DO, the two effects counteract, as the result, the diurnal phosphorus release rate does not change obviously. The research is helpful to our understanding of effects of Vallisneria asiatica on the environment of water, the possible diurnal variation of phosphorus release from sediment, and the relationship of diurnal variation of environmental factors and phosphorus release from sediment.

Methods for measuring denitrification: Diverse approaches to a difficult problem	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Review						denitrification; greenhouse effect; nitrate; nitric oxide; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; stable isotopes; water quality	MEASURING BENTHIC DENITRIFICATION; ISOTOPE PAIRING TECHNIQUE; NITROUS-OXIDE REDUCTION; TROPICAL NORTH-PACIFIC; ACETYLENE-INHIBITION TECHNIQUE; ANAEROBIC AMMONIUM OXIDATION; LENGTH-POLYMORPHISM ANALYSIS; NITRATE-RESPIRING BACTERIA; SOIL CORE METHOD; IN-GROUND WATER	Denitrification, the reduction of the nitrogen (N) oxides, nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-), to the gases nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O), and dinitrogen (NA is important to primary production, water quality, and the chemistry and physics of the atmosphere at ecosystem, landscape, regional, and global scales. Unfortunately, this process is very difficult to measure, and existing methods are problematic for different reasons in different places at different times. In this paper, we review the major approaches that have been taken to measure denitrification in terrestrial and aquatic environments and discuss the strengths, weaknesses, and future prospects for the different methods. Methodological approaches covered include (1) acetylene-based methods, (2) 15 N tracers, (3) direct N-2 quantification, (4) N-2:Ar ratio quantification, (5) mass balance approaches, (6) stoichiometric approaches, (7) methods based on stable isotopes, (8) in situ gradients with atmospheric environmental tracers, and (9) molecular approaches. Our review makes it clear that the prospects for improved quantification of denitrification vary greatly in different environments and at different scales. While current methodology allows for the production of accurate estimates of denitrification at scales relevant to water and air quality and ecosystem fertility questions in some systems (e.g., aquatic sediments, well-defined aquifers), methodology for other systems, especially upland terrestrial areas, still needs development. Comparison of mass balance and stoichiometric approaches that constrain estimates of denitrification at large scales with point measurements (made using multiple methods), in multiple systems, is likely to propel more improvement in denitrification methods over the next few years.

J	Na, EH; Park, SS				Na, Eun Hye; Park, Seok Soon			A hydrodynamic and water quality modeling study of spatial and temporal patterns of phytoplankton growth in a stratified lake with buoyant incoming flow	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Ecological Models as Decision Tools in the 21st Century	AUG 22-24, 2004	Quebec City, CANADA	Int Soc Ecol Modelling		water quality model; hydrodynamics; stratified lake; phytoplankton growth; limiting nutrient	CHLOROPHYLL; RESERVOIR; EUTROPHICATION	A three-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model was applied to Lake Paldang, a lake in South Korea that is stratified by incoming flows. The spatial and temporal patterns of phytoplankton growth in this lake were determined from the model. The model was calibrated and verified using data measured under different hydrological conditions. The model results were in reasonable agreement with the field measurements, in both the calibration and verification phases. The distributions of water quality and residence time in the lake and phytoplankton response to changes in nutrient loads were examined with the model, and the influence of the hydrodynamics on phytoplankton response was analyzed. The simulation results indicated that Lake Paldang is an essentially phosphorus-limited system, but that phytoplankton growth is limited by low water temperature and short residence time during the winter and the summer monsoon period, respectively The results of sensitivity analyses also suggested that the hydrodynamics within the lake may have an indirect influence on phytoplankton responses to changes in the limiting nutrient loads, and that reducing phosphorus loading from Kyoungan Stream should be a high priority policy for controlling algal blooms during the pre- and post-monsoon periods. From this study, it was concluded that the three-dimensional water quality model incorporating hydrodynamic processes could successfully simulate phytoplankton response to changes in nutrient loads and that it could become a useful tool for identifying the essential factors determining phytoplankton growth and for developing the best management policy for algal blooms in Lake Paldang.

J	Stambuk-Giljanovic, N				Stambuk-Giljanovic, Nives			The pollution load by nitrogen and phosphorus in the Jadro River	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						total nitrogen; ammonia; nitrate; total phosphorus; Jadro River; Croatia	WATER-QUALITY	The objective of the investigations of the Jadro River, located in Croatia, was to estimate the nitrogen and phosphorus loads in the Jadro River spring and its streamflow by calculating the load in kg/day or tons/year and to compare this with the load for the maximum allowed concentrations (MAC) for drinking water (Official Bulletin, No 46/94) expressed in kg/day or tons/year. Daily pollution loads at the Jadro River spring for total N ranged from 0 to 304 kg, for NH(3)-N from 0 to 38 kg, for NO(3)-N from 0-1321 kg and for PO(4)-P from 0-92 kg in the period from September 1993 to September 2003. When compared with MAC loads the results prove that the Jadro River spring is not polluted by nitrogen compounds and phosphorus. The average annual load for total N ranged from 10 to 33 t, for NH(3)-N from 0.25 to 5.15 t, for NO(3)-N from 40 to 190 t, and for PO(4)-P from 0.3 to 11.5 t. The nitrogen compounds and phosphorus loads vary from one year to another without any constant decreasing or increasing trends. The annual average loads compared with the average annual MAC loads (especially for NH(3)-N and PO(4)-P) show that there were no threats of constant pollution of the spring. The loads for total N and PO(4)-P along the Jadro River flow from the spring to the fishpond entrance were monitored over a five year period from September 1999 to September 2004. The results show no regularities. The highest annual total nitrogen load of 45 t was recorded at the entrance to the fishpond during the 2002/2003 period. The highest annual PO(4)-P load of 10 t was measured at the Vidovic Bridge during the 2003/2004 period; however, the concentrations of N and P did not exceed the MAC concentrations which are prescribed for drinking water. According to the investigation results of the daily and average annual loads compared with MAC loads for drinking water, it can be concluded that the Jadro River spring and its streamflow are not polluted by nitrogen and phosphorus.

Effects of Hurricane Ivan on water quality in Pensacola Bay, Florida	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article							STRATIFIED ESTUARY; IMPACTS; PATTERNS	Pensacola Bay, Florida, was in the strong northeast quadrant of Hurricane Ivan when it made landfall on September 16, 2004 as a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. We present data describing the timeline and maximum height of the storm surge, the extent of flooding of coastal land, and the magnitude of the freshwater inflow pulse that followed the storm. We computed the magnitude of tidal flushing associated with the surge using a tidal prism model. We also evaluated hurricane effects on water quality using water quality surveys conducted 20 and 50 d after the storm, which we compared with a survey 14 d before landfall. We evaluated the scale of hurricane effects relative to normal variability using a 5-yr monthly record. Ivan's 3.5 m storm surge inundated 165 km(2) of land, increasing the surface area of Pensacola Bay by 50% and its volume by 230%. The model suggests that 60% of the Bay's volume was flushed, initially increasing the average salinity of Bay waters from 23 to 30 and lowering nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations. Additional computations suggest that wind forcing was sufficient to completely mix the water column during the storm. Freshwater discharge from the largest river increased twentyfold during the subsequent 4 d, stimulating a modest phytoplankton bloom (chlorophyll up to 18 mu g I-1) and maintaining hypoxia for several months. Although the immediate physical perturbation was extreme, the water quality effects that persisted beyond the first several days were within the normal range of variability for this system. In terms of water quality and phytoplankton productivity effects, this ecosystem appears to be quite resilient in the face of a severe hurricane effect.

Predicting need for phosphorus fertilizer by soil testing during seeding of cool season grasses	HORTSCIENCE			English	Article						turf establishment; pasture establishment; Kentucky bluegrass; tall fescue; perennial ryegrass; soil test calibration; soil test critical level; aluminum	TEST CALIBRATION; EXTRACTANT; WATERS	Recent changes in soil testing methodology, the important role of P fertilization in early establishment and soil coverage, and new restrictions on P applications to turf suggest a need for soil test calibration research on Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb), and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Greenhouse and field studies were conducted for 42 days to examine the relationship between soil test P levels and P needs for rapid grass establishment using 23 NJ soils with a Mehlich-3 extractable P ranging from 6 to 1238 mg.kg(-1). Soil tests (Mehlich-1, Mehlich-3, and Bray-1) for extractable P were performed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP). Mehlich-3 extractable P and Al were measured to evaluate the ratio of P to Al as a predictor of need for P fertilizer. Kentucky bluegrass establishment was more sensitive to low soil P availability than tall fescue or perennial ryegrass. Soil test extractants Mehlich-1, Bray-1, or Mehlich-3 were each effective predictors of need for P fertilization. The ratio of P to Al (Mehlich-3 P/Al %) was a better predictor of tall fescue and perennial ryegrass establishment response to P fertilization than soil test P alone. The Mehlich-1, Bray-1, and Mehlich-3 soil test P critical levels for clipping yield response were in the range of 170 to 280 mg.kg(-1), depending on the soil test extractant, for tall fescue and perennial ryegrass. The Mehlich-3 P/Al (%) critical level was 42% for tall fescue and 33% for perennial ryegrass. Soil test critical levels, based on estimates from clipping yield data, could not be determined for Kentucky bluegrass using the soils in this study. Soil testing for P has the potential to aid in protection of water quality by helping to identify sites where P fertilization can accelerate grass establishment and thereby prevent soil erosion, and by identifying sites that do not need P fertilization, thereby preventing further P enrichment of soil and runoff. Because different grass species have varying critical P levels for establishment, both soil test P and the species should be incorporated into the decision-making process regarding P fertilization.

J	Newton, A; Icely, JD				Newton, A.; Icely, J. D.			Oceanographic applications to eutrophication in tidal, coastal lagoons: the Ria Formosa, Portugal	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						chlorophyll; microplankton; ecological modelling	MARINE EUTROPHICATION; CHLOROPHYLL; NITROGEN; WATERS; YIELD	Physical and biogeochemical processes control the impact of eutrophication in tidal, coastal lagoons and the ecosystem response to nutrient enrichment. A screening model of eutrophication in a tidal, coastal lagoon considers a well-mixed box, exchanging with the ocean at a daily rate determined by physical processes and converting nutrient to phytoplankton chlorophyll at a fixed yield. The model uses nutrient levels to estimate maximum biomass, that may be limited by light-controlled growth in turbid, turbulent, highly-diluted or heavily-grazed system. The components of the box model were tested using field data from the Ria Formosa, a mesotidal coastal lagoon in southern Portugal. Sampling coincided with equinox spring tides, in spring and autumn, as well as solstice neap tides, in summer and winter, to cover the full range of tidal exchange. Discrete sampling coincided with high water, mid-ebb, low water and mid-flood to exemplify the different tidal states. Sampling stations included the ocean boundary (lagoon inlet), and two different landward boundary situations: the shallow westernmost "blind end" of the lagoon, and one near to a major sewage outlets. Results show that nutrient loading in the Ria Formosa is sufficiently diluted and flushed by the tides to limit the effects of eutrophication in the outer lagoon. Flushing, however, is insufficient in the inner lagoon. In conclusion, basin-scale parameters in simple box models can be derived from detailed research models and the results of process studies to provide end-users with simple, transparent, screening models for eutrophication and related aspects of water quality.

Development of nutrient submodules for use in the gridded surface subsurface hydrologic analysis (GSSHA) distributed watershed model	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Summer Specialty Conference of the American-Water-Resources-Association	JUN, 2005	Honolulu, HI	Amer Water Resources Assoc		watershed; nutrients; water quality; distributed; GSSHA	SOIL; TEMPERATURE; PREDICTION; RUNOFF	A primary water quality problem caused by nonpoint source pollution (NPSP) is eutrophication, from excess nutrients in receiving water bodies. The control of nutrients arising from NPSP is difficult because the source areas can be hard to identify and typical treatment methods are infeasible due to the distributed nature of the pollutants. It may be possible to reduce nutrient related water quality problems through the restoration of highly disturbed watersheds with best management practices (BMPs). While restoration attempts may provide significant returns, they can be costly to implement and often are met with resistance in agricultural communities. Extending model results beyond the range of calibration to model future conditions such as for restoration scenarios requires the use of physically-based models that include the important processes that generate streamflow and material transport, uptake, loss, transformation, and recycling of nutrients and other material. The research and development objectives of the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) in Vicksburg, Mississippi, are to develop a watershed assessment and management model to simulate transport, uptake, loss, transformation, and recycling of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus and associated material such as sediment and organic matter. In this study we will discuss current efforts at the ERDC's Environmental Laboratory to develop a state-of-the-art watershed water quality model.

J	Southworth, BE; Engle, CR; Stone, N				Southworth, Brent E.; Engle, Carole R.; Stone, Nathan			Effect of multiple-batch channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, stocking density and feeding rate on water quality, production characteristics, and costs	JOURNAL OF THE WORLD AQUACULTURE SOCIETY			English	Article							PONDS; SIZES	To quantitatively define relationships among stocking densities, feeding rates, water quality, and production costs for channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus, grown in multiple-batch systems, twelve 0.1-ha earthen ponds were stocked at 8,600, 17,300, 26,000, or 34,600 fingerlings/ha along with 2,268 kg/ha of carryover fish. Fish in all ponds were fed daily to apparent satiation using 32% protein floating feed. Temperature and dissolved oxygen in each pond were monitored twice daily; pH weekly; nitrite-N, total ammonia nitrogen, and Secchi disk visibility every 2 wk; nitrate-N, chlorophyll a, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and chemical oxygen demand monthly; and chloride every other month. The costs of producing channel catfish at different stocking densities were estimated. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) as a result of stocking density among treatment means of (1) gross or net yields, (2) mean weights at harvest, and (3) growth or survival of fingerlings (24-36%) and carryover fish (77-94%). Mean and maximum daily feeding rates ranged from 40 to 53 kg/ha/d and 123 to 188 kg/ha/d, respectively, and feed conversion ratios averaged 1.75. There were no differences in any feed-related parameter as a result of density. Water quality variables showed few differences among densities at samplings and no differences when averaged across the production season. Yield of fingerlings increased as stocking density increased with significant differences between the two highest and the two lowest stocking densities. Breakeven prices were lower at the higher stocking densities as a result of the higher yield of understocked fish and similar mean individual fish weights produced at these higher stocking densities. Overall, varying stocking densities of fingerlings in multiple-batch systems had little effect on production efficiency and water quality. Additional research on managing the population structure of carryover fish in commercial catfish ponds may be warranted.

The study area is located in a floodplain reach from Parintins (Amazonas) to near Almeirim (Para). A three-end-member mixing model designed to uncouple three fractions [high suspended inorganic matter (ip), low inorganic suspended matter (w), and high chlorophyll a (Chl)] was tested in Lake Curuai (1.5 degrees S 55.43 degrees W) based on field sampling done almost concurrently with satellite overpasses. During high water, phytoplankton patches are confined to lakes closer to terra firme under the influence of clear water inflow, whereas during the low and decreasing water stages, the patches are more evenly distributed over the floodplain.

Combined use of the EPA-Qual2E simulation model and factor analysis to assess the source apportionment of point and non point loads of nutrients to surface waters	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						source apportionment; non point pollution; point pollution; QUAL2E; integrated monitoring; nutrients; watershed management	RIVER-BASINS; RETENTION; NITROGEN	Diffuse pollution is generally indirectly estimated by area and specific emission factors as function of land use. However in many cases these estimates were proven to be remarkably inaccurate. Aim of this study was to combine a water quality simulation model, (USEPA-QUAL2E) and Factor Analysis to increase the understanding of the water pollutants source apportionment. The study concerned two different watersheds, an upland area characterised by a very scarce agricultural use, and another area covering both the upland and the lowland physiographic regions. Particularly the lowland region is included in one of the most productive agricultural areas in Italy. By comparing instream measurements with QUAL2E simulations during dry and wet weather conditions, a good fit (errors +/- 20%) was found for the dry weather scenario, whereas very poor was the model performance on the wet weather scenario. This was in the same way expected since the rainfall-driven pollutants scenario deviates significantly from QUALM general assumptions of constant emissions in steady state streamflow conditions. However the poor fit was also due to the scarcer reliability of the adopted non point emission estimates. Despite of approximations the model wet weather simulations enabled to estimate the non point contribution to the instream load at the rainfall event scale resolution. Such diffuse sources contribution was found around 80% in the area of extensive agricultural land use, and around 40% in the upland region. Factor Analysis applied to the instream measurements data shed light on the exchange from the groundwater to the surface water system that occurred in the upland region. The hypothesis of a groundwater contribution to the instream total load of nitrates was also supported by QUAL2E simulations that, when considering only the point loads, systematically underestimate the dry weather nitrate concentrations. The same pattern was not observed for the lowland region. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dosing based on streaming current values resulted in turbidities of less than 10.9 +/- 0.35 NTU and filterable and total phosphorus concentrations of less than 9.83 +/- 0.54 and 25.6 +/- 5.71 mu g/L, respectively. Inadequate slow mixing could be partially compensated for by increased settling time; however, such quiescent conditions are difficult to obtain in natural systems. For prehydrolyzed forms of aluminum, high intensity rapid mixing was counterproductive. Several classes of coagulants responded robustly to water quality and temperature changes. However, poly-aluminum chlorides modified with silica or sulfate, with low to medium basicity, were consistently the best performers in these tests, in terms of simultaneously removing phosphorus and fine particles under a wide range of operating conditions with low doses.

Our objective was to explore the inter-annual, seasonal, and daily variability in selected biological, physical, and chemical variables of these two systems. Although the study lakes demonstrated a notable inter-annual and seasonal variation in nutrient concentrations, water transparency was the only variable that was consistently more variable in LH than LN. The reason for the greater temporal variability in water transparency of LH is its major susceptibility to wind and rain events. The impact of wind events in this lake is favored by its shallowness and by its silty surface sediment; the high ratio of catchment area to lake area is responsible for the relatively higher susceptibility of LH to rain events than LN. By contrast, in the younger and deeper LN, ground-water discharge buffers certain water chemistry parameters such as conductivity, turbidity, and alkalinity. Interestingly, differences in turbidity and ground-water discharge do not seem to affect the variability in nutrient concentrations, which was similar between the lakes, although these factors may explain differences between the lakes in nutrient concentrations. This paper reveals that the unpredictability and frequency of events in Mediterranean aquatic ecosystems makes it necessary to increase data collection frequency to obtain more accurate simulations in water quality models.

Biogeochemical indices of phosphorus retention and release by wetland soils and adjacent stream sediments	WETLANDS			English	Article						phosphorus; wetlands; streams; indices; sorption; retention; and release	SORPTION; CAPACITY; WATER; SATURATION; DYNAMICS; REMOVAL; UPLANDS; STORAGE; SURFACE; FLORIDA	Eutrophication is still a water quality problem within many watersheds. The Lake Okeechobee Basin, Florida, USA, like many watersheds is impacted by eutrophication caused by excess phosphorus (P). To meet water quality criteria to reduce this impairment, several levels of information on P dynamics within the Basin are required. The use of biogeochemical indices to help determine P retention/release of different landscape units such as wetlands and streams provides useful information on P dynamics. The objective of our study was to determine P retention/release indices for a range of wetland soils and their adjacent stream sediments. We sampled several wetlands and adjacent streams within Okeechobee's Basin, which represented a range of P impacted systems. Regression analyses suggest that a single incubation of sediment/soil equilibrated at 1000 mg P kg(-1) was sufficient (> 96% of the time) to estimate maximum P sorption capacity (S-max). Using this single incubation, sampled wetlands had nearly twice the P sorption capacity (238 +/- 21 mg P kg(-1)) of stream sediments (146 +/- 14 mg P kg-1). Stream sediments also had a greater P saturation ratio (PSR) than wetland soils, indicating that sediment had a greater potential to release P. Phosphorus sorption under ambient P conditions (soil equilibrated with ambient site water) covaried best with P concentrations in site surface water and, as concentrations increased, P sorption also increased. Finally, we used soil P storage capacity (SPSC) to help estimate the ability of soils and sediments to retain additional P loadings and found that wetland soils had a greater ability to retain P. Phosphorus sorption was predicted equally well (> 73%) using either ammonium oxalate or 1 M HCl extractable Fe and Al. The use of indices to quantify P dynamics of different landscape units can inform watershed management and policies aimed at reducing P loads to receiving water bodies.

A steady increase of phosphorus loading is the most important factor of the lake eutrophication. Pollution external control projects are being implemented and will be accomplished before the year 2010. In order to predict the restoration rate by the lake's self-purification after the projects of external control, a model of predicting the removal rate of total phosphorus (TP) from lake water is developed, and a brief method of estimating the release and export rate of sediment phosphorus is suggested. Results show that, on the premise of external loading fully controlled. The restoration needs about 55 years or more. Obviously, the great P pool in the sediment will be a limiting factor of preventing the improvement of water quality after the external loading is under control. Based on the estimation we conclude that after the external control projects before 2010, in order to restore the lake in a few years, although highly cost, the first step must be the sediment dredging to remove internal loading. The second step is diverting water of River Changjiang into the lake to accelerate the improvement of lake water. Otherwise, removal of pollutant sources will become meaningless.

J	Metsamaa, L; Kutser, T; Strombeck, N				Metsamaa, Liisa; Kutser, Tilt; Strombeck, Niklas			Recognising cyanobacterial blooms based on their optical signature: a modelling study	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH			English	Article							BALTIC SEA; MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; NODULARIA-SPUMIGENA; WATER-QUALITY; INLAND; RETRIEVAL; CHLOROPHYLL; INHERENT; GULF	Mass populations of cyanobacteria are increasingly attracting the attention of environment agencies, water authorities, and human and animal health organizations, since they can present a range of water quality and treatment problems as well as hazards to human and animal health. The problem is especially severe in the Baltic Sea where cyanobacterial blooms occur every summer covering areas of more than 100 000 km(2). We studied optical properties of several phytoplankton species (including cyanobacteria) present in the Baltic Sea region. The measurements results were used in a bio-optical model together with optical properties of other phytoplankton species from literature. Our results show that cyanobacteria have a characteristic double feature (peak at 650 nm and phycocyanin absorption feature near 630 nm) in their reflectance spectra which can be detected by remote sensing instruments. Our estimation for the open Baltic Sea waters shows that concentration of chlorophyll has to be 8-10 mg m(-3) before the double feature becomes detectable by remote sensing instruments which spectral resolution is 10 nm and signal-to-noise-ratio is 1000:1. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that remote sensing can be used for early warning of emerging potentially harmful blooms as chlorophyll concentrations higher than 4 mg m(-3) qualify as blooms here.

Drainage design coefficients for eastern United States	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						drainage; models; nitrogen; drainage design; Hooghoudt equation; DRAINMOD; water quality	NITROGEN LOSSES; NITRATE LOSS; LANDS; TRANSPORT; SPACINGS; SOILS; WATER	The development of drainage simulation models has made it possible to quantitatively describe the performance of drainage systems, including the effects of design parameters on yields. While this was a primary goal of drainage researchers 40 years ago, it is no longer sufficient. Currently, the effect of drainage on nutrient loads and surface water quality is of equal or greater importance to production goals. Limited field data and modeling results indicate that nitrogen (N) loss in drainage water is proportional to subsurface drainage intensity (DI). This implies that the drainage system should be tailored to soil and site conditions, such that the DI is as small as possible. While simulation models can be used to determine drain depth and spacing required to maximize yields or profits for a specific site, the modeling expertise and/or the extensive data required are often not available. Simple approaches are still needed for estimating drain spacing and depth. The Hooghoudt equation has been used for many years for this purpose. Its application requires knowledge of the design drainage rate, which has not been defined for many locations in the US. A simulation study was conducted to determine the drain spacing corresponding to predicted maximum economic return for corn production on four soils at 10 locations in eastern United States. The drainage intensity (cm/day) corresponding to the optimum drain spacing was defined as the design drainage rate (DDR). DDR varied with growing season rainfall and ranged from an average (across the four soils) of 0.58 cm/day at Toledo, OH to 1.61 cm/day at Baton Rouge, LA. Variation of DDR among the four soils was least for the low rainfall locations and highest where growing season rainfall was high. The regression equation, DDR = 0.004P - 1.1, may be used to estimate DDR (cm/day) in terms of growing season rainfall, P (mm). These results were obtained for a drain depth of 1 In and surface depressional storage of 2 cm.

The objective of this work is to review the status and challenges in modeling fate and water transport of manure-borne pathogens (MBP) and organisms-indicators of fecal contamination at pedon, hillslope, and watershed scales. Approaches used to model various aspects are critically evaluated, including (a) release of microorganisms from manure, (b) microorganism survival and inactivation in manure, soil, and surface water, (c) partitioning and attachment of pathogenic and indicator organisms to solid particles in runoff, soil, and sediment, and (d) transport with straining or entrapment in overland flow and in streams. The current challenges and research needs are outlined that include (a) the paucity of experimental data about the transport of pathogenic microorganisms, (b) the need to quantify potential and actual input of pathogens from wildlife, (c) uncertainty in background concentrations of indicator microorganisms, (d) better understanding of the effect of manure particulates on the MBP fate and transport, (e) relating the microorganism fate and transport parameters to environmental variables, such as soil and vegetation properties and weather parameters, (e) evaluating natural tracers with the transport behavior similar to microorganisms, e.g., manure-borne phosphorus, (f) understanding the uncertainty of the stream sampling data, (g) developing a process-based model of microorganism resuspension. during the rainfall events, (i) developing upscaling techniques to utilize pedon and hillslope scale measurements and models in the watershed modeling, (j) a better insight into filtering function of vegetated buffer strips and riparian zones. Ensembles of simulations have to be made to estimate the possible distribution of simulation results and risks associated with a specific allocation of manure and manure management practices.

Economic and environmental model simulations were performed over a 30-year time horizon for each of these practices using extensive data collected from the study area. Results from model simulations indicate that while most of the practices (including terraces, no till farming, contouring, and in-field contour buffers) would reduce sediment and sediment-bound nutrient losses significantly, they have very little benefit on soluble nitrogen and phosphorus losses. This is primarily because the increased infiltration rates resulting from those practices leads to greater losses of subsurface and return flow in the heavily tile-drained watershed. Nonetheless, when these practices are combined with judicious commercial fertilizer use, appreciable reductions in soluble nutrient losses are also indicated, and improvements in sediment loss are maintained. Terraces are indicated to provide the greatest sediment loss reduction (over 60% reduction) at the watershed level, relative to the status quo. Accordingly, installed terraces also lead to the highest simulated reductions in organic nitrogen and organic phosphorus (over 70%). Predicted reductions in sediment for most of the other practices ranged from almost 30% to about 45%. Corresponding reductions in simulated organic nitrogen and organic phosphorus losses range from about 35% to almost 50%. Economic model simulations also show varied impacts. In general, costs of sediment reducing practices range from about $6 per hectare of implemented area with contouring to almost $65 per hectare when terraces are installed on high-slope cropland. Terraces also indicated the greatest sediment loss reduction. On the other hand, judicious commercial fertilizer use is indicated to offset these costs by as much as roughly $50 per hectare. The study indicates that programs that offer producers some flexibility in choosing practice combinations may lead to the best outcomes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Potential for a rye cover crop to reduce nitrate loss in southwestern Minnesota	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							GULF-OF-MEXICO; SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE; WATER-QUALITY; PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY; DRAINMOD PREDICTIONS; NITROGEN MANAGEMENT; COLD CLIMATE; CORN-BELT; MODEL; SYSTEMS	Cover cropping practices are being researched to reduce artificial subsurface drainage NO3-N losses from agricultural lands in the Upper Mississippi watershed. This study was designed to investigate the influences of fall planting date and climate on cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) biomass and N uptake in the spring, and to assess subsurface drainage NO3-N loss reductions. A soil-plant-atmosphere simulation model, RyeGro, was developed and used to predict rye cover crop establishment and growth, soil water balance, N cycling, and drainage NO3-N losses from mid-September through May in southwestern Minnesota. An imbedded stochastic weather generator provided model climate inputs. Inclusion of a rye cover crop sown on 15 September reduced N losses by 11.1 kg N ha(-1) or 45% for a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] crop rotation. Fall sowing dates of 1, 15, and 30 October resulted in reductions of 7.8, 5.8, and 4.6 kg N ha(-1) respectively, by the end of May. Desiccation of the rye on 1 May resulted in reductions of 4.5, 2.2, 1.2, and 0.7 kg N ha(-1), for the 15 September and 1, 15, and 30 October sowing dates, respectively. Cover cropping practice provides promising opportunities for reductions in N losses for cropping rotations wherein the primary crops are harvested before mid-September and planted after mid-May. We predict that a winter rye crop can reduce drainage NO3-N losses on average 7.4 kg N ha(-1) for southwestern Minnesota if planted on 15 September and desiccated on 15 May.

Forest river plants and water quality in Ghana	AQUATIC BOTANY			English	Article						aquatic macrophytes; land use; river chemistry; tropical freshwater	MACROPHYTE COMMUNITIES; SPECIES RICHNESS; DIVERSITY; CHEMISTRY; RIPARIAN; NITROGEN; STREAMS; AFRICA; CARBON	River plants and water chemistry in wet and dry seasons were sampled in a wide range of rivers with variable catchments in the forest zone of Ghana, in order to examine the relationships between the floristic composition within the river and river water and catchment environmental variables. Plant species occurring in the river or on its seasonally flooded banks along 500 m sample stretches were listed in 26 sites. Sample species richness was low (1-17 species per sample, mean 5.9). Only nine species were recorded that are confined to rivers. Cluster analysis defined five floristic groups which differed in catchment area, geology, turbidity and dissolved minerals. Analysis of water chemistry variables by principal components analysis revealed a strong principal gradient (42% of total variance) related to annual rainfall with low ionic concentrations under high rainfall. The second component described seasonal differences in water chemistry. Nitrate and chloride were more concentrated in the dry season, but sulphate and calcium were more concentrated in the wet season. Catchments with higher forest cover yielded more oligotrophic and less turbid water. Catchment geology influenced water chemistry so that sandstone areas yielded clear water, and ancient peneplain areas with bauxitic soil were characterised by exceptionally low silicon concentrations. The association of macrophyte composition with river chemistry and catchment conditions was somewhat tenuous, due to the low number of species, but the low turbidity, oligotrophic rivers under high rainfall and with a high percentage of species-rich forest cover were the more species rich. Prediction of river water quality at the scale of this study are more readily made from a knowledge of catchment rainfall and forest cover than from assessments of river plant composition.

From the results of the study, the effectiveness of ANN over statistical method was proposed. Also feasible direction of increasing ANN models' performance was provided. A hypertrophic river data was used to develop prediction models (chlorophyll a (chl. a) 41.7 +/- 56.8 mu g L-1; n=406). Higher time-series predictability was found from the ANN model. Failure of statistical methods would be due to the complex nature of ecological data in the regulated river ecosystems. Reduction of ANN model size by decreasing the number of input variables according to the sensitivity analysis did not have effectiveness with respect to the predictability on testing data set (RMSE of the ANN with all 27 variables, 25.7; 47.9 from using 2 highly sensitive variables; 42.9 from using 5 sensitive variables; 33.1 from using 1S variables). Even though the ANN model presented high performance in prediction accuracy, more efficient methods of selecting feasible input information are strongly requested for the prediction of freshwater ecological dynamics.

Modelling algal blooms in the Dutch coastal waters by integrated numerical and fuzzy cellular automata approaches	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						algal blooms; Dutch coastal waters; cellular automata; fuzzy logic; Delft3D-WAQ	NORTH-SEA; PHAEOCYSTIS BLOOMS; SPRING BLOOM; WADDEN SEA; PHYTOPLANKTON; IRRADIANCE; SIMULATION; NUTRIENTS; SALINITY; DYNAMICS	In this paper, an integrated numerical and fuzzy cellular automata model was developed to predict possible algal blooms in Dutch coastal waters basing on the irradiance, nutrients and neighbourhood conditions. The numerical module used Delft3D-WAQ to compute the abiotic conditions, and fuzzy cellular automata approach was applied to predict the algal biomass that was indicated by chlorophyll a concentration. The simulated results of year 1995 were compared with that from BLOOM II model, and the advantages, disadvantages as well as future improvement were presented. In general, through this study, it is seen that the integrated modelling deserves more research inputs because: (1) the hydrodynamic processes and nutrients concentrations can be simulated in details by numerical method; (2) the irregular and sparse water quality and biological data, and the empirical knowledge from experts can be explored by the fuzzy logic technique; (3) the spatial heterogeneity, local interactions and the emerge of patchiness could be well captured through the cellular automata paradigm.

Narva Bay is located in the south-eastern Gulf of Finland. Narva River with a catchment's area covering part of Russia and Estonia discharges water and nutrients to Narva Bay. The ecological model includes phytoplankton carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, chlorophyll a, zooplankton, detritus carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, inorganic nitrogen, inorganic phosphorus and dissolved oxygen as state variables. Both the hydrodynamic and ecosystem models were validated using a limited number of measurements. The hydrodynamic model validation included comparison of time series of currents and temperature and salinity profiles. The ecological model results were compared with the monitoring data of phytoplankton biomass, total nitrogen and phosphorus and dissolved oxygen. The comparison of hydrodynamic parameters, phytoplankton biomass, surface layer total phosphorus and dissolved oxygen and near-bottom layer total nitrogen was reasonable. Time series of spatially mean values and standard deviations of selected parameters were calculated for the whole Narva Bay. Combining model results and monitoring data, the characteristic concentrations of phytoplankton biomass, total nitrogen and phosphorus and near-bottom dissolved oxygen were estimated. Phytoplankton biomass and total phosphorus showed seasonal variations, of 0.6-1.1 and 0.022-0.032 mg/l, respectively, during spring bloom, 0.1-0.3 and 0.015-0.025 mg/l in summer and 0.2-0.6 and 0.017-0.035 mg/l during autumn bloom. Total nitrogen and near-bottom oxygen concentrations were rather steady, being 0.25-0.35 and 2-6 mg/l, respectively. The total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations show that according to the classification of Estonian coastal waters, Narva Bay water belongs to a good water quality class.

A water quality monitoring network design methodology for the selection of critical sampling points: Part II	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						critical source areas; design methodology; monitoring network; sampling points; water quality	BASIN	In order to resolve the spatial component of the design of a water quality monitoring network, a methodology has been developed to identify the critical sampling locations within a watershed. This methodology, called Critical Sampling Points (CSP), focuses on the contaminant total phosphorus (TP), and is applicable to small, predominantly agricultural-forested watersheds. The CSP methodology was translated into a model, called Water Quality Monitoring Station Analysis (WQMSA). It incorporates a geographic information system (GIS) for spatial analysis and data manipulation purposes, a hydrologic/water quality simulation model for estimating TP loads, and an artificial intelligence technology for improved input data representation. The model input data include a number of hydrologic, topographic, soils, vegetative, and land use factors. The model also includes an economic and logistics component. The validity of the CSP methodology was tested on a small experimental Pennsylvanian watershed, for which TP data from a number of single storm events were available for various sampling points within the watershed. A comparison of the ratios of observed to predicted TP loads between sampling points revealed that the model's results were promising.

S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) monitoring program over 17 years (1984-2001), field studies (1996-1997) and ecosystem modeling analyses. Results from the analysis of long-term data records collected at three stations along the salinity gradient suggested that phytoplankton are more likely controlled by abiotic mechanisms such as resource limitation than biotic mechanisms such as grazing since annual cycles of primary production and phytoplankton biomass were similar and no grazing effects were evident based on the observed relationship between phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass (R-2 < 0.2, p > 0.1). This scenario was supported by short-term field observations made over an annual cycle at three stations in the mid-channel of the estuary where both chlorophyll a and primary production demonstrated similar patterns of seasonal variation. Ratios of fluorescence before and after acidification at all study sites were relatively high suggesting low grazing pressure in the estuary. A tidally-averaged, size-structured plankton ecosystem model was previously developed and verified for the lower York River estuary.

Recent histories of six productive lakes in the Irish Ecoregion based on multiproxy palaeolimnological evidence	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Review						eutrophication; oligotrophication; palaeoecology; phosphorus; reference; WFD	EPILIMNETIC PHOSPHORUS CONCENTRATIONS; FRESH-WATER; LAND-USE; EUTROPHIC LAKES; NORTHERN SWEDEN; SEDIMENTARY; ACIDIFICATION; DIATOMS; PB-210; CS-137	Palaeolimnological data from six mesotrophic, eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes in the Irish Ecoregion, in the form of microfossil (cladocera, diatoms and pollen) and sediment chemistry data from radiometrically dated sediment cores, were used to reconstruct past variations in lake water quality and catchment conditions. Basal sediments from sediment cores from the six sites ranged in age from the late 18th century to the early 20th century. A weighted averaging partial least squares regression model was developed to reconstruct past epilimnetic total phosphorus concentrations. The results indicate that all but one of the study sites currently are in a far more productive state compared with the beginning of the sediment core record and that those same five lakes have experienced accelerated enrichment post c. 1980. Two of the sites demonstrated long-term enrichment, in one case beginning in the late 19th century, while both eutrophication and oligotrophication have occurred at three sites. The results highlight the difficulties in applying a general temporal end-point for reference conditions and demonstrate that productive lakes in the Irish Ecoregion have complex, locally specific and often long histories of enrichment. These may not be responsive to reduced external loadings of phosphorus and, as a result, restoration could prove particularly challenging. The results also provide evidence of the ways in which palaeolimnological techniques can assist implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive.

Development and application of a phosphorus model for a shallow oxbow lake	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						phosphorus; numerical models; lakes; sediment	PHOSPHATE RELEASE; SEDIMENTS; WATER; ADSORPTION; SORPTION; OXYGEN	A three-dimensional numerical model was developed for simulating the phosphor-us concentration in shallow lakes. In this model, the computational domain was divided into two parts: the water column and the bed sediment layer. The processes of mineralization, settling, adsorption, desorption, bed release (diffusion), growth, and death of phytoplankton were taken into account, and the concentration of organic phosphorus, phosphate, and related water quality constituents was simulated. The concentrations of adsorbed (particulate) and dissolved phosphate due to adsorption-desorption were calculated using two formulas derived based on the Langmuir equation. The release rate of phosphorus from the bed sediment layer was calculated by considering the effects of the concentration gradient across the water-sediment interface, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, and flow conditions. The adsorption and desorption of phosphate from sediment particles, as well as its release from bed sediment, were verified using laboratory experimental data. The model was calibrated and applied to Deep Hollow Lake in the Mississippi alluvial plain. The simulated trends and magnitudes of phosphorus concentration were compared with field observations. The simulation results show that there are strong interactions between sediment-related processes and phosphorus concentration.

Urban runoff quality characterization and load estimation in Saskatoon, Canada	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article						field investigations; land usage; regression analysis; runoff; storm sewers; urban development; water pollution; water quality; Canada	POLLUTANT LOADS; STORMWATER QUALITY; METALS; WATER	The improvement in the effluent quality of the treated sanitary sewage entering the South Saskatchewan River at Saskatoon, Canada, and the impending change in provincial legislation governing urban runoff, provided the impetus for Saskatchewan Environment to initiate the stormwater runoff quality study reported in this paper. Among others, the study involved a field program for characterizing the urban runoff water quality from four catchments, each representing a different type of land use. Both a site mean concentration approach and a multiple variable regression analysis approach were used to quantify the pollutant load contained within the runoff. Thereafter, using the runoff water quality characterizations developed in the study, rainfall-runoff pollutant loads from the entire city were estimated and compared with two local point sources to the receiving stream. On the basis of this analysis, it was found that urban runoff contributes more total suspended solids and total Kjeldahl nitrogen load, similar chemical oxygen demand load, and slightly less total phosphorus load than the two local point sources.

Using simulated rainfall to evaluate field and indoor surface runoff phosphorus relationships	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							SOIL-PHOSPHORUS; WATER-QUALITY; LOSSES; TILLAGE; INFILTRATION	While numerous studies have evaluated the efficacy of outdoor rainfall simulations to predict P concentrations in surface runoff, few studies have linked indoor rainfall simulations to P concentrations in surface runoff from agricultural fields. The objective of this study was to evaluate the capacity of indoor rainfall simulation to predict total dissolved P concentrations [TP(< 0.45)] in field runoff for four dominant agricultural soils in South Dakota. Surface runoff from 10 residue-free field plots (2 m wide by 2 m long, 2-3% slope) and packed soil boxes (I m long by 20 cm wide by 7.5 cm high, 2-3% slope) was compared. Surface runoff was generated via rainfall simulation at an intensity of 65 mm h(-1) and was collected for 30 min. Packed boxes produced approximately 24% more runoff (range = 2.8-3.4 cm) than field plots (range = 2.3-2.7 cm) among all soils. No statistical differences in either TP(< 0.45) concentration or TP(< 0.45) loss was observed in runoff from packed boxes and field plots among soil series (0.17 < P < 0.83). Three of four soils showed significantly more total P lost from packed boxes than field plots. The TP(< 0.45) concentration in surface runoff from field plots can be predicted from TP(< 0.45) concentration in surface runoff from the packed boxes (0.68 < r(2) < 0.94). A single relationship was derived to predict field TP(< 0.45) concentration in surface runoff using surface runoff TP(< 0.45) concentration from packed boxes. Evidence is provided that indoor runoff can adequately predict TP(< 0.45) concentration in field surface runoff for select soils.

Top samples (0-4 cm) from sediment cores taken in Lakes Charles, Saddleback, Little Hobbs, and Crystal had (226)Ra activities of 44.9, 17.5, 7.6, and 8.5 dpm g(-1), respectively, about an order of magnitude greater than values in deeper, older deposits. The surface sample from Lake Charles yielded the highest (226)Ra activity yet reported from a Florida lake core. Several lines of evidence suggest that groundwater augmentation is responsible for the high (226)Ra activities in recent sediments: (1) (226)Ra activity in cores increased recently, (2) the Charles, Crystal, and Saddleback cores display (226)Ra/(210)Pb disequilibrium at several shallow depths, suggesting (226)supercript stopRa entered the lakes in dissolved form, (3) cores show recent increases in Ca, which, like (226)supercript stopRa, is abundant in augmentation groundwater, and (4) greater Sr concentrations are associated with higher (226)supercript stopRa activities in recent Charles and Saddleback sediments. Sr concentrations in Eocene limestones of the deep Floridan Aquifer are high relative to Sr concentrations in surficial quartz sands around the lakes. Historical water quality inferences for the lakes were based on diatom assemblages in sediments. Recent alkalization in Lakes Charles, Saddleback, Little Hobbs, and Crystal was inferred from weighted-averaging calibration (WACALIB). The lakes also show recent trophic state increases based on WACALIB-derived estimates for limnetic total P. Although residential and agricultural sources might contribute to increased P loading, P in augmentation waters probably has had significant influence on eutrophication. Dystrophic diatoms were abundant in the early history of Lakes Saddleback, Little Hobbs, and Crystal, which suggests that these lakes contained more tannic waters during the past than at present, perhaps as a consequence of greater inflows from surrounding wetlands. Ionic content of lake waters increased, as indicated by diatom autecological analysis. Recent geochemical and biological changes detected in cores from these lakes probably are a result of deliberate groundwater augmentation, although inputs of groundwater pumped for agricultural and residential development in the watersheds also might have contributed to limnological changes.

J	Petersen, A; Vondracek, B				Petersen, A.; Vondracek, B.			Water quality in retation to vegetative buffers around sinkholes in karst terrain	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						filter strips; nitrogen; phosphorus; pollutants; runoff; sediment	GRASS FILTER STRIPS; RIPARIAN BUFFERS; SEDIMENT REMOVAL; LOAD REDUCTION; SIMULATED RAIN; RUNOFF WATER; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; POLLUTION; NUTRIENT	There are approximately 8,340 mapped sinkholes in karst terrain of southeast Minnesota. Most sinkholes are adjacent to row crops that likely contribute pollutants to surface waters and aquifers. Vegetated buffers can improve water quality by reducing sediment, fertilizers, pesticides, and other potential contaminants from runoff, and may benefit water quality when placed around sinkholes. We evaluated sediment, nitrogen, phosphorus, and runoff for buffers from 2.5 to 30 m (8.3 to 98 ft) wide with a spreadsheet model. We found buffers 30 m (98 ft) wide may reduce pollution by 80 percent, although buffers 15 m (49 ft) wide may be most cost effective. Buffers could contribute to goals of reducing sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loads in Minnesota waters. Buffers 15 m (49 ft) wide around all sinkholes would retire approximately 436 ha (1,077 ac) of land from production and cost approximately $260,000 yr(-1) based on Conservation Reserve Program payments, while requiring <14 percent of the budget of the program for groundwater protection in southeast Minnesota.

J	Wooldridge, S; Brodie, J; Furnas, M				Wooldridge, Scott; Brodie, Jon; Furnas, Miles			Exposure of inner-shelf reefs to nutrient enriched runoff entering the Great Barrier Reef Lagoon: Post-European changes and the design of water quality targets	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article						terrestrial runoff; dissolved inorganic nitrogen; geographically weighted regression; Great Barrier Reef	RIVER CATCHMENT; COASTAL WATERS; CORAL-REEFS; AUSTRALIA; NITROGEN; EVENT; ASSEMBLAGES; SEDIMENTS; RESPONSES; PATTERNS	We used historical flood plume extent data (modelled) to quantify the typical spatial extent of the summer runoff-seawater mixing zone of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) lagoon. Spatially explicit analysis of the variability of in situ chlorophyll a concentrations (observed) across the runoff-seawater mixing zone, then allowed us to explore regional differences in the nutrient enrichment impact of runoff events from the various river systems that drain the GBR catchment. We demonstrate the existence of a discernable north-south gradient along the length of the GBR, such that for equivalent runoff:seawater dilutions ratios, lower levels of nutrient enrichment (as indicated by chlorophyll a observations) result from the river systems that drain the relatively undisturbed northern areas of the GBR catchment, compared to more human-impacted central and south areas. We identify a strong correlation between this north-south enrichment gradient and the flood concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) entrained by the various river systems. By substituting the nutrient enrichment characteristics of the human-impacted river discharges with those of the undisturbed northern rivers, we provide a means to compare the short-term enriching 'footprint' for existing runoff intrusions with those that are likely to have occurred under pre-European catchment conditions. We demonstrate that under pre-European conditions, the nutrient enriching impact from river runoff was likely to have been largely constrained within 1-2 km of the coast, whereas existing conditions support the impact of reefs some 20-30 km off the coast. By using the developed spatial relations, we show that for the heavily human-impacted river systems, reductions in the end-of-river concentrations of DIN in the order 50-80% are needed in order to restore parity with pre-European conditions. We discuss these results in regard to developing end-of-catchment water quality targets for the region. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Grazing management effects on sediment and phosphorus in surface runoff	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT			English	Article						cattle; non-point-source pollution; nutrients; rainfall simulation; water quality	FESCUE GRASSLAND ECOSYSTEMS; SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER; MIXED PRAIRIE; CATTLE; VEGETATION; IMPACTS; SYSTEMS; LITTER; RAINFALL; PASTURE	Sediment and phosphorus (P) in runoff from pastures are potential non-point-source pollutants in surface waters that may be influenced by surface cover, sward height, treading damage, surface slope, soil moisture, and soil P. The objectives of the current study were to quantify sediment and total P loads in runoff produced during simulated rainfall from pastures and to evaluate their relationships with the physical and chemical characteristics of the soil and sward. Five forage management treatments-ungrazed (U), hay harvest/fall stockpile grazing (HS), continuous stocking to a sward height of 5 cm (5C), and rotational stocking to sward heights of 5 (5R) or 10 (10R) cm-were established in triplicate 0.40-ha paddocks in 3 smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) pastures for 3 years. Rainfall simulations were conducted at a rainfall intensity of 7.1 cm.h(-1) for 1.5 hours over a 0.5-m(2) area in 3 locations at 2 slope ranges in each paddock in June, August, and October of each year and the subsequent April. Forage management did not affect mean sediment load (7.3 +/- 5.0 kg.ha(-1).h(-1)). Mean total P load was greatest from 5C treatment (0.071 +/- 0.011 kg.ha(-1).h(-1)), did not differ among the U, HS, and 10R treatments (0.019 +/- 0.011 kg.ha(-1).h(-1)), and was intermediate in the 5R treatment (0.053 +/- 0.011 kg.ha(-1).h(-1)). Of the soil and sward characteristics measured, percentage surface cover was most highly related to sediment load (R-2 = 0.16) and total P load (R-2 = 0.10). Surface runoff from pastures managed to maintain adequate residual forage cover did not contribute greater sediment or P to surface waters than an ungrazed grassland.

Deoxygenation potential of the Richmond River Estuary floodplain, northern NSW, Australia	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						deoxygenation; floodplain vegetation; fill kills; acid sulphate soils; modified drainage	WATER-QUALITY; DECOMPOSITION; DYNAMICS; WETLAND; SOILS	Periodic deoxygenation events (DO < I mg/L) occur in the Richmond River Estuary on the east coast of Australia following flooding and these events may be accompanied by total fish mortality. This study describes the deoxygenation potential of different types of floodplain vegetation in the lower Richmond River catchment and provides a catchment scale estimate of the relative contribution of floodplain vegetation decomposition to deoxygenation of floodwaters. Of the major vegetation types on the floodplain slashed pasture was initially (first 5 to 7 h) the most oxygen demanding vegetation type after inundation (268 mg 02 m(-2) h(-1)), followed by dropped tea tree cuttings (195 +/- 18mg O-2 m(-2) h(-1)) and harvested cane trash (110 +/- 8mg O-2 m(-2) h(-1)). However, 10 h after inundation the oxygen consumption rates of slashed pasture (105 +/- 5mg O-2 m(-2) h(-1)) and tea tree cuttings (59 +/- 7 mg O-2 m(-2) h(-1)) had decreased to a rate less than the harvested cane trash (110 +/- 8mg O-2 m(-2) h(-1)). The oxygen demands of the different floodplain vegetation types when inundated were highly correlated with their nitrogen content (r(2) = 0.77) and molar C:N ratio (r(2) = 0.82) reflecting the dependence of oxygen demand of vegetation types on their labile carbon content. The floodplain of the lower Richmond River (as flooded in February 2001) has the potential to deoxygenate about 12.5 x 10(3) mL of saturated freshwater at 25 degrees C per day which is sufficient to completely deoxygenate floodwater stored on the floodplain with 3 to 4 days. In addition, oxidation of Fe2+ mobilized during the decomposition of floodplain vegetation via iron reduction and discharged from groundwater and surface runoff in acid sulfate soil environments could account for about 10% of the deoxygenation of floodwater stored on the floodplain. Management options to reduce floodplain deoxygenation include removing cuttings from slashed pasture and transporting off-site, reducing slashed pasture windrow loads by using comb-type mowers, returning areas of the floodplain to wetlands to allow the establishment of inundation tolerant vegetation and retaining deoxygenated floodwaters in low lying areas of the floodplain to allow oxygen consumption process to be completed before releasing this water back to the estuary.

Topdressing turf with composted manure improves soil quality and protects water quality	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL			English	Article							SEDIMENT LOSSES; HYDRAULIC-PROPERTIES; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; CHEMICAL-PROPERTIES; CREEPING BENTGRASS; SEWAGE-SLUDGE; SANDY SOIL; NITROGEN; RUNOFF; FERTILIZER	Compost can improve soil properties when incorporated into soil; however, little information is available regarding impacts of compost topdressing. Objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects that topdressing composted dairy manure onto Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) has on: (i) soil physical properties, (ii) soil chemical properties, (iii) soil nitrate (NO3-N) and P concentrations below the rootzone, (iv) total runoff and sediment losses, and (v) N and P concentrations in runoff. Plots were topdressed with compost at 0, 33, 66, and 99 m(3) ha(-1). Saturated hydraulic conductivity, bulk density, water retention, and soil nutrient levels were measured. A rainfall simulation was conducted, and runoff was collected and analyzed for total nitrogen (TN), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), total phosphorus (TP), total dissolved P (TDP), and orthophosphate (OP). Compost application of 99 m(3) ha(-1) reduced bulk density, and increased water retention and P, K, Fe, and Mn concentrations in the surface soil. Compost applications of 66 m(3) ha(-1) or greater raised soil electrical conductivity (EC); however, this increase in soil EC did not negatively impact turf quality. Rates of runoff and erosion and concentrations of TN, NO3-N, TP, TDP, and OP in runoff were not different among treatments. However, all compost treatments did increase NH4-N concentrations in runoff. There were no differences in soil NO3-N or available P levels below the root zone.

Prediction of NO3-N losses in surface runoff from a field with seepage zones using GLEAMS and RZWQM	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						model; NO3-N; OPE3; runoff; watershed	WATER-QUALITY MODEL; SOIL-MOISTURE; PESTICIDE; TRANSPORT	Seepage zones have been shown to be of critical importance in controlling contaminant export from agricultural watersheds. However, their impacts on water quality have not been effectively modeled. The Groundwater Loading Effects of Agricultural Management Systems (GLL'AMS) model and the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) were used to predict daily and monthly nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration and loss in surface runoff from an agricultural field with seepage zones. The results of the study show that calibrated GLEAMS and RZWQM predicted daily NO3-N concentration [index of agreement (D) > 0.57] in surface runoff from the field with seepage zones. Based on the different model evaluation techniques used in this study, both GLEAMS' and RZWQM performed fairly well in assessing the effects of seepage zones on daily NO3-N losses in surface runoff. However GLEAMS (D = 0.93) performed relatively better than RZWQM (D = 0.45) in predicting NO3-N loss in surface runoff on a monthly basis, while both GLEAMS and RZWQM performed equally well in predicting NO3-N loss in surface runoff on a daily basis. Both models performed poorly in predicting NO3-N concentration in surface runoff on a monthly basis (D < 0.44). Additionally, since neither model adequately simulated monthly NO3-N concentration in surface runoff from the field with seepage zones, their ability in water quality modeling for such fields will be compromised, and further model evaluation and development is justified.

Effects of land use and. land cover, stream discharge, and interannual climate on the magnitude and timing of nitrogen, phosphorus, and organic carbon concentrations in three coastal plain watersheds	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						non-point-source nutrients; watersheds; land use and land cover; biogeochemistry; climate; hydrology; Hydrologic Simulation Program Fortran; nitrogen; phosphorus; organic carbon	CONSTITUENT LOADS; MODEL; EUTROPHICATION; SEAWATER; RIVERS; BAY	In-stream nitrogen, phosphorus, organic carbon, and suspended sediment concentrations were measured in 18 subbasins over 2 annual cycles to assess how land use and land cover (LULC) and stream discharge regulate water quality variables. The LULC was a primary driver of in-stream constituent concentrations and nutrient speciation owing to differences in dominant sources and input pathways associated with agricultural, urban, and forested land uses. Stream discharge was shown to be a major factor that dictated not only the magnitude of constituent concentrations, but also the chemical form. In high discharge agricultural subbasins, where nitrate was the dominant nitrogen form, there was a negative correlation between discharge and nitrate concentration indicating groundwater inputs as the dominant pathway. In urban settings, however, nitrate was positively correlated with discharge, and, in forested subwater-sheds, where dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) was the dominant nitrogen form, there was a positive correlation between discharge and DON, indicating washoff from the watershed as the dominant input pathway. Similarly, phosphorus concentrations were strongly regulated by LULC, discharge, and seasonality. This comparative study highlights that different mechanisms regulate different forms of nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon, and thus field programs or water quality models used for regulatory purposes must assess these nutrient forms to accurately apply management plans for nutrient reductions.

J	Kadlec, RH				Kadlec, Robert H.			Free surface wetlands for phosphorus removal: The position of the Everglades Nutrient Removal Project	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						treatment wetlands; phosphorus; Everglades; intersystem comparison; sediments; models	WATER-QUALITY IMPROVEMENT; CONSTRUCTED WETLAND; WASTE-WATER; FLORIDA; PERFORMANCE; RETENTION; CAPACITY; GROWTH	The Everglades Nutrient Removal Project (ENRP) was one of the largest treatment wetlands ever built. In North America, it has been exceeded only by the Stormwater Treatment Areas, the designs for which it was developed to support. The five cells of the ENRP contained varying mixtures of submerged, emergent and floating vegetation, and produced concomitantly variable phosphor-us (P) removal. The range of first-order settling rates for total P (TP) removal was from 12 to 73 m/year for the individual cells, compared to a range of 13-23 m/year for Boney Marsh, Water Conservation Area 2A, and Orlando Easterly Wetlands. The mean TP settling rate in the ENRP of 23 m/year compares well to a mean of 16 m/year for 77 other wetland systems. No seasonal trends were detected in the ENRP, but there was +/- 50% variability for outlet TP concentrations. The ENRP operated at the low end of the spectrum of P concentrations and loadings for treatment marshes in general, with a mean inlet TP of about 100 mu g P/L, while producing 21 mu g P/L in the effluent over a 6-year period of record. Consequently, vegetation density and P content were low compared to other wetland systems. The biogeochemical cycle in the ENRP resulted in accreting residuals that had about 1000 mg P/kg dry weight. The project was built economically, but large sums were spent on research. The regulatory concept of a TP 12-month rolling average was initiated for the first time. The project fulfilled its goal of confirming and refining the information from earlier prototype systems. In turn, much of the ENRP design has been replicated in the full-scale STAs, with moderate success. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cost-effective allocation of watershed management practices using a genetic algorithm	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; RIVER-BASIN; OPTIMIZATION	Implementation of conservation programs are perceived as being crucial for restoring and protecting waters and watersheds from nonpoint source pollution. Success of these programs depends to a great extent on planning tools that can assist the watershed management process. Herein a novel optimization methodology is presented for deriving watershed-scale sediment and nutrient control plans that incorporate multiple, and often conflicting, objectives. The method combines the use of a watershed model (SWAT), representation of best management practices, an economic component, and a genetic algorithm-based spatial search procedure. For two small watersheds in Indiana located in the midwestern portion of the United States, selection and placement of best management practices by optimization was found to be nearly 3 times more cost-effective than targeting strategies for the same level of protection specified in terms of maximum monthly sediment, phosphorus, and nitrogen loads. Conversely, for the same cost, the optimization plan reduced the maximum monthly loads by a factor of 2 when compared to the targeting plan. The optimization methodology developed in this paper can facilitate attaining water quality goals at significantly lower costs than commonly used cost share and targeting strategies.

Towards an improved understanding of the nitrate dynamics in lowland, permeable river-systems: Applications of INCA-N	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						water quality; pollution; nitrogen; nitrate; model; uncertainty	WATER-QUALITY; MODEL STRUCTURE; NITROGEN MODEL; UNCERTAINTY; MANAGEMENT; CATCHMENTS; BERKSHIRE; LAMBOURN; CHALK; LAND	The Integrated Catchment Model of Nitrogen (INCA-N) was applied to the Lambourn and Pang river-systems to integrate current process-knowledge and available-data to test two hypotheses and thereby determine the key factors and processes controlling the movement of nitrate at the catchment-scale in lowland, permeable river-systems: (i) that the in-stream nitrate concentrations were controlled by two end-members only: groundwater and soil-water, and (ii) that the groundwater was the key store of nitrate in these river-systems. Neither hypothesis was proved true or false. Due to equifinality in the model structure and parameters at least two alternative models provided viable explanations for the observed in-stream nitrate concentrations. One model demonstrated that the seasonal-pattern in the stream-water nitrate concentrations was controlled mainly by the mixing of ground- and soil-water inputs. An alternative model demonstrated that in-stream processes were important. It is hoped further measurements of nitrate concentrations made in the catchment soil- and ground-water and in-stream may constrain the model and help determine the correct structure, though other recent studies suggest that these data may serve only to highlight the heterogeneity of the system. Thus when making model-based assessments and forecasts it is recommend that all possible models are used, and the range of forecasts compared. In this study both models suggest that cereal production contributed approximately 50% the simulated in-stream nitrate toad in the two catchments, and the point-source contribution to the in-stream load was minimal.

Integrated modelling of climate change impacts on water resources and quality in a lowland catchment: River Kennet, UK	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						climate change; uncertainty; downscaling; water resources; water quality; River Kennet	MULTIPLE SOURCE ASSESSMENT; NITROGEN MODEL; CHANGE SCENARIOS; LAND-USE; INCA; UNCERTAINTY; ENGLAND; FLOW; PHYTOPLANKTON; STREAM	An integrated approach to climate change impact assessment is explored by linking established models of regional climate (SDSM), water resources (CATCHMOD) and water quality (INCA) within a single framework. A case study of the River Kennet illustrates how the system can be used to investigate aspects of climate change uncertainty, deployable water resources, and water quality dynamics in upper and lower reaches of the drainage network. The results confirm the large uncertainty in climate change scenarios and freshwater impacts due to the choice of general circulation model (GCM). This uncertainty is shown to be greatest during summer months as evidenced by large variations between GCM-derived projections of future tow river flows, deployable yield from groundwater, severity of nutrient flushing episodes, and Long-term trends in surface water quality.

J	Khadam, IM; Kaluarachchi, JJ				Khadam, Ibrahim M.; Kaluarachchi, Jagath J.			Water quality modeling under hydrologic variability and parameter uncertainty using erosion-scaled export coefficients	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						export coefficients; phosphorus; nutrients; sediment discharge; joint variability uncertainty analysis; Bayesian parameter estimation; watershed management	LAND-USE CHANGE; PHOSPHORUS TRANSPORT; CALIBRATION DATA; RISK-ASSESSMENT; LOADING AREAS; CATCHMENT; NITROGEN; IMPACT; INFORMATION; PREDICTION	Water quality modeling is important to assess the health of a watershed and to make necessary management decisions to control existing and future pollution of receiving water bodies. The existing export coefficient approach is attractive due to minimum data requirements; however, this method does not account for hydrologic variability. In this paper, an erosion-scaLed export coefficient approach is proposed that can model and explain the hydrologic variability in predicting the annual phosphorus (P) loading to the receiving stream. Here sediment discharge was introduced into the export coefficient model as a surrogate for hydrologic variability. Application of this approach to model P in the Fishtrap Creek of Washington State showed the superiority of this approach compared to the traditional export coefficient approach, white maintaining its simplicity and low data requirement characteristics. In addition, a Bayesian framework is proposed to assess the parameter uncertainty of the export coefficient method instead of subjective assignment of uncertainty. This work also showed through a joint variability-uncertainty analysis the importance of separate consideration of hydrologic variability and parameter uncertainty, as these represent two independent and important characteristics of the overall model uncertainty. The paper also recommends the use of a longitudinal data collection scheme to reduce the uncertainty in export coefficients. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hein, L				Hein, Lars			Cost-efficient eutrophication control in a shallow lake ecosystem subject to two steady states	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						eutrophication control; shallow lakes; thresholds multiple states; cost-efficient management	MANAGEMENT; PHOSPHORUS; GROWTH; BIODIVERSITY; POPULATIONS; UNCERTAINTY; SYSTEMS; FISH	Eutrophication of water bodies is a common problem in many countries. Eutrophication processes are guided by thresholds, which must be taken into account in the formulation of optimal policies for eutrophication control. Whereas a range of general models have been developed to determine the point of optimum eutrophication control, there are few studies that determine optimum control policies for a specific lake. This paper analyses optimum eutrophication control for a Dutch shallow lake ecosystem. The shallow lake can be in either of two states, a turbid water state and a clear water state, each with specific plant and fish communities. Transitions from one state to the next are subject to a threshold related to the nutrient concentrations in the lake. The paper examines how long-term water quality data can be used to model this threshold effect and how costs and benefits of potential eutrophication control measures can be compared. The paper shows that the presence of a threshold causes there to be two points of local maximum efficiency in eutrophication control, one corresponding to the maintenance of a turbid water state and one to the transition to a clear water state. Ecological-economic modeling of eutrophication in the lake yields concrete information on the cost-effectiveness of different policy options for the lake ecosystem. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A stratified sample of 80 ponds, distributed all over the country, provided input data for model development. Of the 154 species recorded, 45 were selected for modelling. A total of 14 environmental parameters were preselected as candidate explanatory variables. Two types of statistical tools were used to explore the data and to develop the predictive models: linear regression (LR) and generalized additive models (GAMs). Six LR species models had a reasonable predictive ability (30-50% of variance explained by the selected predictors). There was a gradient in the quality of the 45 GAM models. Ten species models exhibited both a good fit and statistical robustness: Lemna minor, Phragmites australis, Lysimachia vulgaris, Galium palustre, Lysimachia nummularia, Iris pseudacorus, Lythrum salicaria, Lycopus europaeus, Phalaris arundinacea, Alisma plantago-aquatica, Schoenoplectus lacustris, Carex nigra. Altitude appeared to be a key explanatory variable in most of the species models. In some cases, the degree to which the shore was shaded, connectivity between water bodies, pond area, mineral nitrogen levels, pond age, pond depth, and the extent of agriculture or pasture in the catchment were selected as additional explanatory variables. The species models demonstrated that it is possible to predict species abundance of aquatic macrophytes and that each species responded individually to distinct environmental variables.

J	Muller, B; Stierli, R; Wuest, A				Mueller, Beat; Stierli, Ruth; Wueest, Alfred			Phosphate adsorption by mineral weathering particles in oligotrophic waters of high particle content	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							CONSTANT CAPACITANCE MODEL; PHOSPHORUS; SEDIMENTS; SYSTEMS; SURFACE; DESORPTION; HEMATITE; WETLAND; CLAYS; SOIL	We investigated the interactions of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) and dissolved nonreactive phosphorus (DNRP) with suspended and settled aquatic particles. The sorption to minerogenic particles from an alpine catchment collected in rivers, hydropower reservoirs, and a downstream ultraoligotrophic lake was modeled using Langmuir-type isotherms. DRP and DNRP exhibited about equal affinities to particle surfaces. The sorption of dissolved species to surfaces alters the fate of P in water bodies. In spite of the small surface-binding constants, high particle concentrations enhance the sorption of P to surfaces, and, consequently, chemical analysis of DRP can substantially underestimate the potentially bioavailable P. In unpolluted rivers with high content of suspended mineral particles, e. g., triggered by heavy rain events (2 mu g DRP/L, 1.3 g/L suspended particles), P loads solely based on DRP measurements underestimate the true load of potentially bioavailable P by more than a factor of two. Modeling P sorption equilibria with a single type of surface site generates a management tool for water quality in P-limited oligotrophic systems.

J	Cunha, A; Almeida, A				Cunha, A.; Almeida, A.			Influence of an estuarine plume and marine sewage outfall on the dynamics of coastal bacterioplankton communities	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY			English	Article						marine bacterioplankton; marine outfall; estuarine plume; coastal ocean	EXTRACELLULAR ENZYME-ACTIVITY; CLOSTRIDIUM-PERFRINGENS; FECAL POLLUTION; TREATMENT-PLANT; WATER-QUALITY; HUDSON RIVER; IMPACT; PHYTOPLANKTON; SALMONELLA; BACTERIA	Marine bacterioplankton in the coastal region off Aveiro (NW Portugal) develop under the influence of the plume of a mesotrophic estuarine system (Ria de Aveiro) and, more recently, under the influence of the discharges of a marine sewage outfall (S. Jacinto). In an attempt to compare the degree of disturbance introduced by these 2 features to the abundance of sewage bacteria and heterotrophic activity of natural bacterioplankton, water samples were collected at 10 offshore and nearshore locations. Rates of ectoenzymatic activity and monomer incorporation were determined as proxies for potential heterotrophic activity of natural bacterial communities. ATP and chl a concentrations were used as estimates of the total abundance of phytoplankton. Faecal coliforms and total colony counts were used as indicators of sewage bacteria contamination. However, ATP, chl a, faecal coliforms, total colony counts, ammopeptidase activity and the maximum rate of leucine incorporation (leucine Vm) correlated negatively with linear distance to the mouth of the estuary, establishing the estuarine plume as an importance source of disturbance. Chl a, aminopeptidase activity and total colony counts also correlated negatively with linear distance to the sewage outfall, but no significant impact on the concentration of faecal bacteria could be detected. Compliance with the European Union Bathing Water Directive 76/160/EEC was achieved in 97% of samples. The ratio between P-glucosidase activity (polymer degradation) and glucose incorporation (monomer uptake) increased as the distance from the mouth of the estuary and from the sewage outfall increased. This indicates that, in addition to inputs of bacteria and nutrients, changes in the quality of the available organic substrates and/or sewage-related toxic effects may impose a shift in the functioning of heterotrophic bacterioplankton communities in this costal area.

J	Khadam, IM; Kaluarachchi, JJ				Khadam, Ibrahim M.; Kaluarachchi, Jagath J.			Trade-offs between cost minimization and equity in water quality management for agricultural watersheds	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							RIVER-BASIN; POLLUTION; MODELS; SUSTAINABILITY; ABATEMENT	[ 1] Allocation of pollution control responsibilities is an important problem in environmental economics. Previous research has developed the least-cost formulation that addresses both cost efficiency and hydrologic uncertainty. However, the least-cost formulation does not explicitly consider the distribution of pollution control responsibilities that has a serious implication on equity. A theoretical framework for evaluating the trade-offs between cost efficiency and equity is developed in this work. In this paper the efficiency equity curve that defines the cost of achieving equity is developed. It also evaluates the impacts of hydrologic variability and parameter uncertainty on the trade-off between cost efficiency and equity, and the impacts of the choice of equity criteria on phosphorus management decisions. A demonstration example is also presented that analyzed phosphorus management in the Fishtrap Creek catchment and the lower Nooksack River basin located in northwestern Washington State.

The effect of grass buffer strips on phosphorus dynamics - A critical review and synthesis as a basis for application in agricultural landscapes in France	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Review						phosphorus; diffuse pollution; grass buffer strip; agriculture	VEGETATIVE FILTER TREATMENT; SIMULATED VEGETATION; SURFACE RUNOFF; WATER-QUALITY; SOIL; SEDIMENT; FILTRATION; PHOSPHATE; TRANSPORT; NUTRIENT	Recommending the use of "grass buffer strips" to control diffuse P transfer has become well accepted among extension advisors, agricultural consultants, planners, and other practitioners that influence the structure of the agricultural landscape. These grassed areas are put in place to capture the P contained in runoff from source fields. They are designed to function as a filter and a sediment trap although it is often unclear what the long-term disposition of the accumulated P may be. The objective of this work was to determine if the available scientific literature justifies the continued recommendation of this approach in the prevention of phosphorus movement from agricultural soils to surface waters. We employed a theoretical analysis of the mechanisms of the buffering effect and the specific behaviour of phosphorus in typical grass buffer strips to establish the critical set of literature applicable to this question. An adequate body of literature exists describing many aspects of P dynamics and the short-term functioning of grass buffer strips over their seasonal cycles. Despite variable results in a diversity of landscape contexts, overall, the use of grass buffer strips appears to provide useful short-term functions in the reduction of P transport to surface waters. Long-term benefits remain questionable given the relatively short-term use of this approach in P reduction and the lack of long-term experimental results, but this current lack of data is not sufficient to deter the continued incorporation of grass buffer strips in the landscape of French agricultural. Additionally, a more comprehensive conceptual model integrating the short-term functioning of grass buffer strips with seasonal cycles and the long-term consequences of cumulative storage emerged from our synthesis.

Relating effect and response traits in submersed aquatic macrophytes	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						disturbance; ecosystem processes; morphological traits; species effects; species response; submersed aquatic macrophytes; water draw-down; wetlands	PLANT TRAITS; SPECIES RICHNESS; WATER-QUALITY; SEDIMENT; PHOSPHORUS; LAKES; BIODIVERSITY; NITROGEN; GROWTH; ALGAE	Reliably predicting the consequences of short- or long-term changes in the environment is important as anthropogenic pressures are increasingly stressing the world's ecosystems. One approach is to examine the manner in which biota respond to changes in the environment ("response traits") and how biota, in turn,,affect ecosystem processes ("effect traits"). I compared the response and effect traits of four submersed aquatic macrophytes to understand how. water level management may affect wetland plant populations and ecosystem processes. I measured resource properties (nutrients in sediment and water), non-resource properties (pH, alkalinity, sediment temperature; oxygen production), and biotic properties (periphyton biomass) in replicated outdoor monocultures of Stuckenia pectinata, Potamogeton nodosus, P. crispus, and Zannichellia palustris. After seven weeks, three of eight replicates of each species treatment were subjected to a temporary water draw-down that desiccated aboveground plant parts. The four species differed in their effects on ecosystem properties associated with nutrient uptake and photosynthetic activity. Shoot growth rate was negatively correlated with light transmittance to the sediment surface whereas root growth rate and root: shoot ratio were correlated with a species' ability to deplete nutrients in sediment interstitial water. Occupation of space in the water column was correlated with water alkalinity and pH and with sediment temperature. Root growth rate was related simultaneously to species effects on sediment nutrient dynamics and recovery of ecosystem properties after water draw-down. This suggests that this morphological trait may be used to predict the effects of environmental change on ecosystem functioning within the context of water level management.

Intradaily variability of water quality in a shallow tidal lagoon: Mechanisms and implications	ESTUARIES AND COASTS			English	Article							GOVERNING PHYTOPLANKTON BLOOMS; FOOD WEBS; ESTUARIES; RESTORATION; ECOSYSTEMS; TRANSPORT; HABITATS; ECOLOGY; DELTA; TIME	Although surface water quality and its underlying processes vary over time scales ranging from seconds to decades, they have historically been studied at the lower (weekly to interannual) frequencies. The aim of this study was to investigate intradaily variability of three water quality parameters in a small freshwater tidal lagoon (Mildred Island, California). High frequency time series of specific conductivity, water temperature, and chlorophyll a at two locations within the habitat were analyzed in conjunction with supporting hydrodynamic, meteorological, biological, and spatial mapping data. All three constituents exhibited large amplitude intradaily (e.g., semidiurnal tidal and diurnal) oscillations, and periodicity varied across constituents, space, and time. Like other tidal embayments, this habitat is influenced by several processes with distinct periodicities including physical controls, such as tides, solar radiation, and wind, and biological controls, such as photosynthesis, growth, and grazing. A scaling approach was developed to estimate individual process contributions to the observed variability. Scaling results were generally consistent with observations and together with detailed examination of time series and time derivatives, revealed specific mechanisms underlying the observed periodicities, including interactions between the tidal variability, heating, wind, and biology. The implications for monitoring were illustrated through subsampling of the data set. This exercise demonstrated how quantities needed by scientists and managers (e.g., mean or extreme concentrations) may be misrepresented by low frequency data and how short-duration high frequency measurements can aid in the design and interpretation of temporally coarser sampling programs. The dispersive export of chlorophyll a from the habitat exhibited a fortnightly variability corresponding to the modulation of semidiurnal tidal currents with the diurnal cycle of phytoplankton variability, demonstrating how high frequency interactions can govern long-term trends. Process identification, as through the scaling analysis here, can help us anticipate changes in system behavior and adapt our own interactions with the system.

Changes in salinity, nutrients and turbidity, which were mainly due to the changes in freshwater input, had an important influence on the structure of the planktonic assemblages. Nevertheless, coastal upwelling can also influence the productivity of the lower estuarine area during short periods both in winter and in summer. In 2000, a short-term freshwater pulse during May (average 126.46 m(3) s(-1)) was markedly beneficial; phytoplanktonic diversity increased, and this caused an increase in zooplanktonic diversity. As phyto-zooplankton coupling in these systems is an important regulator of processes in the trophic web, changes in the dominant groups can have consequences on water quality, especially on the occurrence of toxic plankton blooms. Modelling simulations indicate that a day discharge of 50 m(3) s(-1), every week during critical periods, such as summer/autumn, could be enough to avoid cyanobacteria blooms. Since freshwater "pulses" can be managed by operating the freshwater release from hydrotechnical structures, understanding the relationships between the periodicity and magnitude of inflow pulse events and the estuarine ecosystem structure and healthy functioning is a crucial step towards the development of management modelling tools, as proposed in this study.

The Neuse River Estuary in eastern North Carolina is experiencing a decline in water quality due to increasing anthropogenic inputs. Potentially serious consequences of these inputs are the introduction and persistence of bacterial pathogenic organisms from human and animal waste. A critical factor in determining human health risk is the partitioning of these organisms between particle-attached and free-living cells in the water column. Particle-associated bacteria are generally less mobile in the environment, settle faster, and may have different rates of mortality than their free phase counterparts. Surface and bottom water samples were collected during both dry weather and storm events throughout the summer of 2004 to gage changes in particle concentration, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, and the partitioning of two indicators of fecal contamination: Enterococcus sp. (ENT) and E. coli (EC). Increases in concentrations of these indicators coincided with increases in particles in suspension following storm events. In surface waters, both ENT and EC exhibited similar patterns, controlled primarily by runoff inputs (i.e., storms). In bottom waters, resuspension of sediments was additional source of particles and both indicators. Partitioning of these indicators between particle attached and free living exhibited an overall average of 38% of bacteria associated with particles capable of settling out of the water column. This fraction compares well with previous estimates of attachment of indicators in stormwater. The ability to estimate attachment rates and characterize particle suspensions provides a powerful tool for management and assessment of water quality in estuaries.

The lower Truckee River is home to the endangered cui-ui and threatened Lahontan cut-throat trout, with DO standards being established to in part protect these species. Hydrodynamics, nutrient concentrations, periphyton biomass, and DO data spanning August 2000-December 2001 were used to calibrate and verify a modified version of the Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program Version 5 (WASP5). Under typical loading conditions the periphyton community is nitrogen limited, however nitrogen loading from an upstream wastewater treatment facility increased greatly during the analysis period due to approved site construction activities (discharge permit excursion) causing the periphyton community to temporarily become phosphorus limited. The developed modeling approach, with limited calibration, was able to accurately track dynamic system responses. Removing the impact of the noted discharge permit excursion resulted in a minimum computed DO value of 4.13 mg/L, occurring at the downstream end of the modeling domain on August 8, 2001. Additionally removing the impact of all nutrient loads from area agriculture resulted in a predicted minimum DO value of 4.54 mg/L, while also shifting its location significantly upstream and its timing to April 26, 2001. Meeting all prescribed DO standards required establishing a minimum in-stream flow value of 1.81 m3/s (64.0 ft3/s) downstream of Derby Dam.

The primary objective of this study was to compile measured annual nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) load data representing field scale transport from agricultural land uses. This effort expanded previous work that established an initial nutrient export coefficient dataset. Only measured annual N and P load data published in scientific peer-reviewed studies were included in the present compilation. Additional criteria for inclusion were: spatial scale (field scale or farm scale, minimum 0.009 ha); land use (homogeneous, either cultivated agriculture or pasture/rangeland/hay); natural rainfall (not rainfall simulation); and temporal scale (minimum one year). Annual N and P load data were obtained from 40 publications, resulting in a 163-record database with more than 1,100 watershed years of data. Basic descriptive statistics in relation to N and P loads were tabulated for tillage management, conservation practices, fertilizer application, soil texture, watershed size, and land use (crop type). The resulting Measured Annual Nutrient loads from AGricultural Environments (MANAGE) database provides readily accessible, easily queried watershed characteristic and nutrient load data and establishes a platform suitable for input of additional project specific data.

A four-year field study was carried out to investigate water management practices and losses of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in rice paddy irrigation fields in southern Korea. The amount and water quality of rainfall, irrigation, surface drainage, and infiltration were measured and analyzed to estimate inputs and losses of N and P. The observed irrigation amount surpassed consumptive use, and approximately 52 to 69 percent of inflow (precipitation plus irrigation) was lost to surface drainage. Field data showed that significant amounts of irrigation water and rainfall were not effectively used for rice paddy culture. Water quality data indicated that drainage from paddy fields could degrade the recipient water environment. The nutrient balance indicated that significant amounts of nutrients (29.5 percent of total N and 8.6 percent of total P compared to input) were lost through surface drainage. Furthermore, up to half the nutrient losses occurred during nonstorm periods. The study results indicate that inadequate water management influences N and P losses during both storm and nonstorm periods. Proper water management is required to reduce nutrient losses through surface drainage from paddy fields; this includes such measures as minimum irrigation, effective use of rainfall, adoption of proper drainage outlet structures, and minimized forced surface drainage.

Addressing total phosphorus impairments with water quality trading	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						nonpoint source pollution; nutrients; point source pollution; rivers/streams; surface water; water quality; water quality trading; total maximum daily load		Water quality trading is a voluntary economic process that provides an opportunity for dischargers to reduce the costs associated with meeting a discharge limitation. Trading can provide a cost effective solution for point sources (i.e., wastewater treatment plants) to meet strict effluent limitations set in response to total maximum daily loads (TMDLs). A successful trading program often depends on first determining the trading suitability of a pollutant for a particular watershed. A simple technical approach has been developed to identify sub-watersheds within the Raritan River Basin, New Jersey, where water quality trading could provide a cost effective and scientifically feasible method for addressing total phosphorus impairments. The methodology presented will serve as a model to conduct similar analyses in other watersheds. The Raritan River Basin was divided into 12 subwatershed-based study areas. Point-nonpoint source trading opportunities were examined for each study area by examining the point and nonpoint source total phosphorus loading to impaired water bodies. Of the 12 subwatersheds examined, four had a high potential for implementing a successful trading program. Since instream phosphorus concentrations are closely related to soil erosion, an additional analysis was performed to examine soil erodibility. Recommendations are presented for conducting an economic analysis following the feasibility study.

Empirical modeling of hydrologic and NPS pollutant flux in an urbanizing basin	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						nonpoint source pollution; sediment; nutrients; urbanization; impervious surface; land use/land cover	WATER-QUALITY; PARTICULATE MATTER; STREAMS; FLOW	Long term effects of precipitation and land use/land cover on basin outflow and nonpoint source (NPS) pollutant flux are presented for up to 24 years for a rapidly developing headwater basin and three adjacent headwater basins on the urban fringe of Washington, D.C. Regression models are developed to describe the annual and seasonal responses of basin outflow and NPS pollutant flux to precipitation, mean impervious surface (IS), and land use. To quantify annual change in mean IS, a variable called delta IS is created as a temporal indicator of urban soil disturbance. Hydrologic models indicate that total annual surface outflow is significantly associated with precipitation and mean IS (r(2) = 0.65). Seasonal hydrologic models reveal that basin outflow is positively associated with IS during the summer and fall growing season (June to November). NPS pollutant flux models indicate that total and storm total suspended solids (TSS) flux are significantly associated with precipitation and urban soil disturbance in all seasons. Annual NPS total nitrogen flux is significantly associated with both urban and agricultural-soil disturbance (r2 = 0.51). Seasonal models of phosphorus flux indicate a significant association of total phosphorus flux with urban soil disturbance during the growing season. Total soluble phosphorus (TSP) flux is significantly associated with IS (r(2) = 0.34) and urban and agricultural soil disturbance (r(2) = 0.58). In urbanizing Cub Run basin, annual TSP concentrations are significantly associated with IS and cultivated agriculture (r(2) = 0.51).

However, due to the buffering capacity of soils and lake ecosystems, such effects may appear long after intensive agriculture started. Here we present the study of a coupled shallow lake catchment model, which allows a glimpse of the magnitude of these buffer-related time delays. Results show that the buffering capacity of the lake water was negligible whereas buffering in the lake sediment postponed the final lake equilibrium for several decades. The surface soil layer in contact with runoff water was accountable for a delay of 550 years. The most important buffer, however, was the percolation soil layer that may cause a delay of 150-1700 years depending on agricultural P surplus levels. Although the buffers could postpone final lake equilibria for a considerable time, current and target agricultural surplus levels eventually led to very turbid conditions with total P concentrations of 2.0 and 0.6 mg L-1 respectively. To secure permanent clear water states the current agricultural P surplus of 15 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) should drop to 0.7 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1). We present several simple equations that can be used to estimate the sustainable P surplus levels, buffer related time delays and equilibrium P concentrations in other catchment-lake systems.

J	Zhang, WW; Shi, MJ; Huang, ZH				Zhang, Weiwen; Shi, Minjun; Huang, Zuhui			Controlling non-point-source pollution by rural resource recycling. Nitrogen runoff in Tai Lake valley, China, as an example	SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE			English	Article						NPS pollution; Nitrogen runoff; Compost; Recycling; Subsidy		Agricultural non-point-source (NPS) pollution is regarded as the dominant contributor to water quality degradation and eutrophication in China. Nitrogen (N) is a primary source of pollution in fresh water bodies. In this work a linear programming model was developed to simulate the effectiveness of different nitrogen runoff control policies, using Pinghu City in Tai Lake valley as an example. Four policy scenarios were tested: a tax at a rate equivalent to 50% of the cost of nitrogen fertilizer (S1); a ban on summer fertilizer applications to make the most use of fertilizer applied in the spring (S2); mandatory substitution of regular fertilizers by controlled-release fertilizers (S3); and a subsidy of US$300 ha(-1) (RMB phi 150 mu(-1)) for using compost (S4). The results indicate that all four policies would effectively reduce nitrogen runoff-by 9.8, 26.8, 14.4, and 80.0%, respectively. A subsidy for recycling domestic animal manure and utilizing compost had the most significant effect on the reduction of nitrogen runoff without reducing household income. This research suggests that measures to control agricultural NPS pollution should be combined with a policy to promote recycling of bio-resources and that financial support for NPS pollution control combined with bio-resource recycling should be regarded as one aspect of public investment in regional sustainable development.

J	Jin, XC; Wang, SR; Bu, QY; Wu, FC				Jin, Xiangcan; Wang, Shengrui; Bu, Qingyun; Wu, Fengchang			Laboratory experiments on phosphorous release from the sediments of 9 lakes in the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River region, China	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION			English	Article						phosphorus release; kinetics; sediment composition; DPS; ERI; middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River region	SOIL-PHOSPHORUS; SHALLOW LAKES; PHOSPHATE; ADSORPTION; WATER; SORPTION; METAL; FRACTIONS; OXIDES; AREA	Phosphorus (P) has been recognized as the most critical nutrient limiting lake productivity. In addition, P release from sediments may have a significant effect on the water quality and may result in continuous eutrophication in eutrophic lakes. In this study, P release kinetics from sediments and their relationship with sediment composition were investigated, eutrophication risk index (ERI) and degree of phosphorus saturation (DPS) were used to evaluate the eutrophication risk of the studied sediments, and their influencing factors were also discussed. The results show that total P (TP), organic matter (OM), Al2O3+Fe2O3 and the percentage of sand particles were the most important factors affecting the ability of P sorption. P release process was similar for all studied sediments, consisting of the quick and slow reaction processes. The quick reaction mainly occurred within 0.5 h, and slow reaction after 0.5 h. P release occurred within 20 h and then reached the dynamic equilibrium. P release process was slower than P sorption process. Three models (Power function model, Parabolic diffusion model and Simple Elovich model) can satisfactorily describe the P release kinetics. P release was mainly affected by TP, OM, sorbed total phosphorus (STP), DPS and sand particles, and quick P release was mainly a physical process. For the slightly polluted sediments, Al2O3+Fe2O3 mainly restrained P release. But for the heavily polluted sediment both OM and Al2O3+Fe2O3 promoted P release. Both DPS and ERI can be used to evaluate the P-induced lake eutrophication risk, and their threshold values were 6.6% and 25%, respectively. Based on the assessment by DPS and ERI, most of the studied sediments were in eutrophication risk for the studied sediments. For the heavily polluted sediments, Al2O3+Fe2O3 was significantly correlated with DPS. But for the slightly polluted sediments it was significantly negatively correlated with DPS and OM, and the sand particle percentage was negatively related to ERI.

J	Zobrist, J; Reichert, P				Zobrist, Juerg; Reichert, Peter			Bayesian estimation of export coefficients from diffuse and point sources in Swiss watersheds	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						export coefficients; nutrients; chloride; river; watershed; water quality; Bayesian data analysis		By combining prior knowledge with data from 11 watershed outlets in Switzerland we estimated export coefficients for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate, total nitrogen, chloride, potassium and alkalinity from different land use categories over a 24 year investigation period. The analysis clearly attributes the observed reduction of SRP loads in the rivers to a decrease in contributions from urban areas from about 0.5 to about 0.04 kg P inhab(-1) a(-1) between 1980 and 1990. This reflects measures taken to reduce phosphate discharge from urban areas into receiving water bodies and it significantly increases the relative contribution from intensively used agricultural land (about 0.03 g P m(-2) a(-1)) to total SRP load. At the relatively coarse resolution level of this study, there was no significant trend in any of the other export coefficients. Dominant sources of nitrate, chloride and potassium are intensive agriculture with contributions of about 2.9 g N m(-2) a(-1), 8.7 g Cl m(-2) a(-1), and 1.9 g K m(-2) a(-1), and urban diffuse and point sources with contributions of about 2.1 kg N inhab(-1) a(-1), 20 kg Cl inhab(-1) a(-1), and 2.5 kg K inhab(-1) a(-1). Contributions from intensively used agricultural land are significantly higher than the background exports from extensively used land, forests and barren land which are in the order of 0.5 g N m(-2) a(-1), 1.1 g Cl m(-2) a(-1) and 0.6 g K m(-2) a(-1) (2.2 for barren land). Dependence of alkalinity exports on land use was much smaller with contributions between 1.6 and 3.8 mol m(-2) a(-1). From a methodological point of view, our results reveal that Bayesian inference is an excellent mathematical framework to overcome the identification problems resulting from a partially ill-defined regression problem if prior knowledge is available.

History of land cover change and biogeochemical impacts in the Choptank River basin in the mid-Atlantic region of the US	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Studying Land Use Effects in Coastal Zones with Remote Sensing and GIS	AUG 13-16, 2003	Kemer, TURKEY				CHESAPEAKE BAY ANOXIA; NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT; COASTAL-PLAIN; NITRATE CONTAMINATION; WATER-QUALITY; UNITED-STATES; PHYTOPLANKTON; DYNAMICS; ESTUARY; HYDROCHEMISTRY	The Choptank River basin lies on the Atlantic coastal plain of North America. A terrestrial basin (1756 km(2)) surrounds a tributary of Chesapeake Bay (280 km(2)) with degrading water quality. Land use is dominated by agriculture (65%) and forest (26%); urban areas are small (6%), and the human population density is low (59 km(-2)). Reconstruction of the land cover history showed deforestation and agriculturalization by colonizing Europeans during 1650-1850, with relatively stable patterns thereafter. In the twentieth century, slow urbanization and loss of agriculture occurred as human populations increased, accompanied by mechanization and application of commercial fertilizers. We modelled the effects of these changes using the hydrochemical model GWLF, which showed that, despite relatively stable land cover after 1850, nutrient export increased primarily due to application of fertilizers and human wastewater discharges. As a result of increased inputs to the estuary, algal biomass and turbidity have increased, indicative of eutrophication. Although land cover conversion is often considered an important driver of eutrophication, the intensity of land use (i.e. land use modifications such as application of fertilizers and human population density) can also produce eutrophication in areas with a relatively stable land cover.

An integrated modelling system for management of the Patuxent River estuary and basin, Maryland, USA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Studying Land Use Effects in Coastal Zones with Remote Sensing and GIS	AUG 13-16, 2003	Kemer, TURKEY				GLOBAL NITROGEN-CYCLE; LAND-USE CHANGE; CHESAPEAKE BAY; NUTRIENT; TRANSPORT; INPUTS	The Patuxent River watershed is a heavily impacted basin (2290 km(2)) and estuarine tributary (120 km(2)) of the Chesapeake Bay, USA. To assist management of the basin, we are testing a coupled modelling system composed of a watershed model (HSPF), an estuarine circulation model (CH3D), and an estuarine water-quality model (CE-QUAL-ICM). The modelling system is being tested to guide the development of Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs), and therefore errors in the models must be carefully evaluated. A comparison of daily total nitrogen (TN) concentrations simulated in HSPF with observations indicated that there was no significant bias, with an rms error of 37%. In contrast, modelled total phosphorus (TP) and total suspended solids (TSS) had significant bias with larger rms errors (65% and 259%, respectively). In the estuary, CH3D accurately simulated tides, temperature, and salinity. CE-QUAL-ICM overestimated nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the upper estuary and underestimated in the lower estuary, primarily because intertidal marshes are not currently a model component. Model errors declined from short (<= 1 day) to long (multi-year) timescales as under- and overestimations cumulatively cancelled. Watershed model errors propagate into the estuarine models, interacting with each subsequent model's errors, which limits the effectiveness of this TMDL management tool at short timescales.

J	Barlow, K; Fenton, J; Nash, D; Grayson, R				Barlow, Kirsten; Fenton, John; Nash, David; Grayson, Rodger			Modelling phosphorus transport in a surface irrigation drain	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES			English	Article						surface drains; ditches; volume routing; elovich equation	OFF PASTURE PLANTS; ROUGHNESS COEFFICIENT; INORGANIC PHOSPHORUS; SIMULATED RAINFALL; DAIRY PASTURE; NEW-ZEALAND; RUNOFF; SEDIMENTS; RELEASE; AUSTRALIA	Understanding phosphorus (P) transport from agricultural land is essential to the development of effective management strategies that reduce the impact of agriculture on inland water quality. This paper describes the development and application of a process based model describing P transfer down a farm scale irrigation drain. The model uses a volume routing equation combined with the Kostiakov infiltration equation to route water down the drain. Using estimated infiltration parameters and literature values of Manning's Roughness the flow-model predicted the total volume of water transfer down a 180 m long irrigation drain within 5%, with flow rates predicted within 10%. The flow was then used to provide input data for modelling P transfer down the drain. The P model combines a simple advective equation with rate equations to describe P release by plants and the uptake and release of P by bed sediments. Data from four field investigations were used to parameterise the model with concentrations and loads predicted within 5%. Applied over 14 months, the results from four modelled management scenarios suggest that a bare earth drain, or an intermittently cleared drain may reduce P export over 180 m by 9-19%. While the cost of current management strategies is likely to ultimately limit implementation on commercial farms, the model presented in this paper provides a useful basis for the investigation of further management scenarios, which may reduce P export from irrigated dairy farms.

Data from 30 lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River indicate that the nutrient gradient was the major factor affecting the distribution of chironomids across these sites. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that of 12 summer water environmental variables, total Phosphorus was most important, accounting for 20.1% of the variance in the chironomid data. This was significant enough to allow the development of quantitative inference models. A TP inference model was developed using weighted averaging (WA), partial least squares (PLS) and weighted averaging partial least squares (WA-PLS). An optimal two-component WA-PLS model provided a high jack-knifed coefficient of prediction for conductivity r(jack)(2) = 0.76, with a low root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEPjack = 0.13). Using this model it is possible to produce long-term quantitative records of past water quality for lacustrine sites across the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which has important implications for future lake management and ecological restoration.

J	Lindenschmidt, KE				Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich			Testing for the transferability of a water quality model to areas of similar spatial and temporal scale based on an uncertainty vs. complexity hypothesis	ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY			English	Article						chloride; heavy metals; river modelling; Saale; suspended sediments; WASP5	HABITAT MODELS; CARSON RIVER; TRANSPORT; STREAM; SEDIMENT; BEHAVIOR; IMPACT	The transferability of a water quality model, WASP5, to different reaches of a large river, which vary in both quantity and quality of the surface water is tested. The transferability is set in a theoretical framework based on a hypothesis proposed by Snowling and Kramer (Snowling, S.D., Kramer, J.R., 2001. Evaluating modelling uncertainty for model selection, Ecol. Model. 138, 17-30) stating that as a model becomes more complex in process description, the error between simulations and measurements decreases and the overall model sensitivity increases. This hypothesis is extended to include model transferability by observing the behaviour of the complexity versus uncertainty curves when a model is transferred from one area to another. An overall increase in model error and a decrease in parameter sensitivity are indicative of lack of model transferability. Data from the Saale River, Germany, was used to test the extended hypothesis. The constituents modelled are suspended sediments, chloride and two heavy metals, copper and zinc. The parameters describing sorption of heavy metals to suspended solids or particulate organic carbon proved to be very sensitive to simulation results, hence different complexity levels of the sorption process were implemented. The model was first calibrated and then validated separately for the middle and lower courses of the river. The complexity versus the model error and parameter sensitivities was plotted for the two river courses. juxtaposition of the two sets of curves shows that the model is transferable between the two reaches when simulating heavy metal transport. Some difficulty arose in capturing a peak of suspended sediments, which is due to exuberant phytoplankton growth. A model restructuring is suggested for simulating the middle course of the Saale River to include the storage (dead) zones in this part of the river, which are havens for phytoplankton growth and potential inoculants of large amounts of algae in the main stem of the river.

Eutrophication due to excess phosphorus loading is common in many impaired lakes. Various strategies are available to lake residents for addressing declining lake water quality, including septic system upgrades and establishing riparian buffers. This study examines 25 lakes to determine whether septic upgrades or riparian buffers are a more cost-effective strategy to meet a phosphorus reduction target. We find that riparian buffers are the more cost-effective strategy in every case but one. Large transaction costs associated with the negotiation and monitoring of riparian buffers, however, may be prohibiting lake residents from implementing the most cost-effective strategy.

Flow-specific trends in river-water quality resulting from the effects of the clean air act in three mesoscale, forested river basins in the northeastern United States through 2002	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						river water-quality trends; acid rain; trends methods; northeastern US	NITROGEN; CHEMISTRY; PRECIPITATION; ACIDIFICATION; DEPOSITION; ECOSYSTEM	Two new methods for assessing temporal trends in stream-solute concentrations at specific streamflow ranges were applied to long (40 to 50-year) but sparse (bi-weekly to quarterly sampling) stream-water quality data collected at three forested mesoscale basins along an atmospheric deposition gradient in the northeastern United States (one in north-central Pennsylvania, one in southeastern New York, and one in eastern Maine). The three data sets span the period since the implementation of the Clean Air Act in 1970 and its subsequent amendments. Declining sulfate (O-4(2-)) trends since the mid 1960s were identified for all 3 rivers by one or more of the 4 methods of trend detection used. Flow-specific trends were assessed by segmenting the data sets into 3-year and 6-year blocks, then determining concentration-discharge relationships for each block. Declining sulfate (O-4(2-)) trends at median flow were similar to trends determined using a Seasonal Kendall Tau test and Sen slope estimator. The trend of declining O-4(2-) concentrations differed at high, median and low flow since the mid 1980s at YWC and NR, and at high and low flow at WR, but the trends leveled or reversed at high flow from 1999 through 2002. Trends for the period of record at high flows were similar to medium- and low-flow trends for Ca2+ + Mg2+ concentrations at WR, non-significant at YWC, and were more negative at low flow than at high flow at NR; trends in nitrate (NO3-), and alkalinity (ALK) concentrations were different at different flow conditions, and in ways that are consistent with the hydrology and deposition history at each watershed. Quarterly sampling is adequate for assessing average-flow trends in the chemical parameters assessed over long time periods (similar to decades). However, with even a modest effort at sampling a range of flow conditions within each year, trends at specified flows for constituents with strong concentration-discharge relationships can be evaluated and may allow early detection of ecosystem response to climate change and pollution management strategies.

J	Bergstrom, L; Kirchmann, H				Bergstrom, Lars; Kirchmann, Holger			Leaching and crop uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus from pig slurry as affected by different application rates	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT; NITRATE; MANURE; SOILS; FERTILIZER; AGRICULTURE; PROSPECTS; LOAM	The influence of increasing pig slurry applications on leaching and crop uptake of N and P by cereals was evaluated in a 3-yr study of lysimeters filled with a sandy soil. The slurry was applied at N rates of 50 (S50), 100 (S100), 150 (S150), and 200 (S200) kg ha(-1) during 2 of the 3 yr. The P rates applied with slurry were: 40 (S50), 80 (S100), 120 (S150), and 160 (S200) kg ha(-1) yr(-1). Simultaneously, NH4NO3 and Ca(H2PO4)(2) were applied at rates of 100 kg N ha(-1) and 50 kg P ha(-1) respectively, to additional lysimeters (F100), while others were left unfertilized (FO). During the 3-yr period, the leaching load of total N tended to increase with increasing slurry application to, on average, 139 kg ha-1 at the highest application rate (S200). The corresponding N leaching loads (kg ha(-1)) in the other treatments were: 75 (FO), 103 (F100), 93 (S50), 120 (S100), and 128 (S150). The loads of slurry-derived N in the S100, S150, and S200 treatments were significantly larger (P < 0.05) than those of fertilizer-derived N. In contrast, P leaching tended to decrease with increasing input of slurry, and it was lower in all treatments that received P at or above 50 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) with slurry or fertilizer than in the unfertilized treatment. The crop use efficiency of added N and P was clearly higher when NH4NO3 and Ca(H2PO4)2 Were used rather than slurry (60 vs. 35% for N, 38 vs. 69% for P), irrespective of slurry application rate. Therefore, from both a production and water quality point of view, inorganic fertilizers seem to have environmental benefits over pig slurry when used on sandy soils.

Evaluation of the ADAPT model for simulating nitrogen dynamics in a tile-drained agricultural watershed in central Illinois	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							NITRATE; SYSTEMS; SOILS; CORN	Assessing the accuracy of agronomic and water quality simulation models in different soils, land-use systems, and environments provides a basis for using and improving these models. We evaluated the performance of the ADAPT model for simulating riverine nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) export from a 1500-km(2) watershed in central Illinois, where approximately 85% of the land is used for maize-soybean production and tile drainage is common. Soil chemical properties, crop nitrogen (N) uptake coefficient, dry matter ratio, and a denitrification reduction coefficient were used as calibration parameters to optimize the fit between measured and simulated NO3-N load from the watershed for the 1989 to 1993 period. The applicability of the calibrated parameter values was tested by using these values for simulating the 1994 to 1997 period on the same watershed. Willmott's index of agreement ranged from 0.91 to 0.97 for daily, weekly, monthly, and annual comparisons of riverine nitrate N loads. Simulation accuracy generally decreased as the time interval decreased. Willmott's index for simulated crop yields ranged from 0.91 to 0.99; however, observed crop yields were used as input to the model. The partial N budget results suggested that 52 to 72 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) accumulated in the soil, but simulated biological N fixation associated with soybeans was considerably greater than literature values for the region.

Combining management practices to reduce sediment, nutrients, and herbicides in runoff	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						claypan; integrated management; surface runoff; tillage; water quality	PHOSPHORUS LOSSES; TILLAGE SYSTEM; WATER-QUALITY; CONSERVATION TILLAGE; SOYBEAN ROTATION; SURFACE RUNOFF; SOIL; ATRAZINE; TRANSPORT; NITROGEN	Best management practices have been recommended for controlling nutrient, herbicide, or sediment losses with surface runoff. This study was designed to determine the best overall combination of tillage and application practices to reduce surface losses from cropland. Runoff was collected from two Kansas sites in sorghum-soybean rotation during the 2001 to 2004 crop years and analyzed for bioavailable phosphorus (P), soluble F, total F, ammonium, nitrate, total nitrogen (N), sediment, atrazine, and metolachlor concentrations. No-till treatments consistently experienced higher runoff water volumes than the chisel/disk tillage system used to warm and dry these clay soils in the spring. For this reason the no-till treatments also had higher nutrient and herbicide losses than chisel/disk tillage regardless of use of high or tow application management techniques. The high included fertilizer and herbicide application practices intended to reduce losses with runoff while the standard application broadcast applied fertilizer and herbicide at planting. Few consistent differences were seen for pollutant loss between the high and standard application management. When average losses for all eight location-years were compared to chisel/disk low, soluble P tosses were 3.0 and 2.1 times higher for no-till low and no-till high, respectively; metolachlor losses were 2.4 and 2.7 times higher for no-till low and no-till high, respectively; and atrazine tosses were 4.8 and 6.1 times higher for no-till low and no-till high, respectively. The chisel/disk tow did experience two times higher sediment losses compared with the no-till low or no-till high, when averaging over all eight location-years. However, tolerable soil loss was not exceeded. chisel/disk low generally had small losses for all tested pollutants and may be the best management combination to simultaneously reduce nutrient, herbicide, and sediment tosses with cropland runoff for sites like those used in this study.

Application of phosphorus sorbing materials to streamside cattle loafing areas	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						phosphorus; phosphorus sorbing materials; runoff; water quality	SOIL-PHOSPHORUS; PARTICULATE PHOSPHORUS; SOLUBLE PHOSPHORUS; POULTRY LITTER; OVERLAND-FLOW; RUNOFF; SOLUBILITY; ALUMINUM; LOSSES; SATURATION	Excessive soil phosphorus (P) concentrations among cattle loafing areas located in close proximity to surface waters represent great potential for P transport. This study assessed the ability of several P sorbing materials in reducing P losses from streamside cattle loafing areas. Simulated rainfall was applied at seven (time 1) and 28 (time 2) days after P sorbing material applications to runoff plots on cattle loafing areas located at Amish farms. Treatments consisted of alum, water treatment residuals, fly-ash, gypsum, and no amendment (control). Alum addition reduced time 1 runoff P concentrations the most followed by water treatment residuals similar to gypsum, then fly-ash. However, runoff P losses from P sorbing materials were not significantly different from the control at time 2. These results suggest that P sorbing materials alone provide only a temporary solution to P tosses from cattle loafing areas and should be used with other best management practices.

Modification and validation of GLEAMS for prediction of phosphorus leaching in waste-amended soils	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						desorption; GLEAMS; long-term waste applications; model validation; phosphorus leaching; sorption; swine lagoon liquid	COASTAL-PLAIN; SANDY SOILS; MODEL; PHOSPHATE; FIELD; SIMULATION; WATER; EUTROPHICATION; SATURATION; MOVEMENT	Excess phosphorus applied to soils with low P adsorption capacities can enter surface water via leaching and subsurface transport, thereby negatively impacting water quality. Computer simulation models can be used to describe the effects of management practices on P leaching losses, provided the models are appropriately validated. The objectives of this research were to modify and validate P subroutines in the GLEAMS (Groundwater Loading Effects of Agricultural Management Systems) model to more accurately reflect P sorption and desorption, and then use the modified model to determine crop and waste management effects on long-term P leaching losses below the root zone of a grazed pasture with > 20-year history of swine lagoon liquid application and considerable P buildup in the soil profile. GLEAMS was modified with the Langmuir equation to partition labile P between adsorbed and solution phases. The modification improved predictions of percolate P concentrations and soil P accumulation in acid sandy soils receiving waste-based P additions. The modification also increased model sensitivity to changes in crop and P management. The modified model predicted that P-based swine lagoon liquid applications would decrease P leaching by > 20 kg ha(-1) year(-1) compared to N-based applications. Eliminating all P applications decreased the predicted P leaching losses by less than 1 kg ha(-1) year(-1), compared to P-based swine lagoon liquid application. Results show that P can continue leaching from P-saturated soils even in the absence of P additions.

A soil-plant-atmosphere simulation model, RyeGro, was developed to quantify the probabilities that a winter rye cover crop will reduce artificial subsurface drainage nitrate-N losses given climatic variability in the region. This article describes the plant growth submodel of RyeGro, Grosub, which estimates biomass production with a radiation use efficiency-based approach for converting intercepted photosynthetically active radiation to biomass. Estimates of nitrogen (N) uptake are based on an empirical plant N concentration curve. The model was calibrated with data from a three-year field study conducted on a Normania clay loam (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Aquic Haplustoll) soil at Lamberton, Minnesota. The model was validated with data measured from a field trial in St. Paul, Minnesota. The cumulative rye aboveground biomass predictions for the calibration years differed by -0.45, 0.09, and 0.16 Mg ha(-1) (-17%, 9%, and 32%), and the plant N uptake predictions differed by -10.5, 8.0, and 4.0 kg N ha(-1) (-16%, 30%, and 21%) from the observed values. The predictions of biomass production and N uptake for the validation year varied by -1.4 Mg ha(-1) and 16 kg N ha(-1) (-27% and 24%) from the values observed in the field study, respectively. A local sensitivity analysis of eight input parameters indicated that model output is most sensitive to the maximum leaf area index and radiation use efficiency parameters. Grosub demonstrated the capability to predict seasonal aboveground biomass production of fall-planted rye in southwestern Minnesota within an accuracy of +/- 30% in years when production exceeds I Mg ha(-1) by mid-May, and to predict seasonal rye N uptake within +/- 25% of observed values.

Nutrient mass balances in semi-intensive shrimp ponds from Sonora, Mexico using two feeding strategies: Trays and mechanical dispersal	AQUACULTURE			English	Article						shrimp culture ponds; Litopenaeus vannamei; feeding strategies; production; nutrient budget	OF-CALIFORNIA ECOREGION; NITROGEN BUDGET; PENAEUS-MONODON; WATER-QUALITY; AQUACULTURE; PHOSPHORUS; FARMS; GULF; EFFLUENT; CULTURE	An experiment was conducted to determine the effect of two feeding practices - use of feeding trays (FT) and a mechanical feed dispersal device (FD) - on the growth performance and nutrient mass balances of white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. Cultured shrimp fed by feeding trays showed greater mean weight (32.3 +/- 0.9 g) and yield than those fed by mechanical dispersal (29.5 +/- 0.5 g). Feed added, shrimp survival and feed conversion were not significantly different between the two feeding strategies. Of the total input of nitrogen and phosphorus to the ponds fed by dispersion, 27.2% and 13.6% were recovered, respectively, yielding 2920 +/- 30 kg/ha of shrimp. Ponds in which trays were used showed nitrogen and phosphorus recovery of 28.3% and 14.3%, respectively, and a yield of 3325 +/- 153 kg/ha. The estimated environmental losses of nitrogen and phosphorus per ton of shrimp produced were 73.3 and 13.2 kg/ton, respectively, for the FD treatment; whereas in FT ponds losses were 70.6 and 12.8 kg/ton, respectively. This study showed the potential of feeding trays as a better strategy for shrimp culture that permits the addition of most feed rates by an improvement in yield of L. vannamei and a reduction of environmental losses of nitrogen and phosphorus in comparison to mechanical feed dispersion.

Shrimp was stocked for two crops and mollusks for a single crop during the study. Two oyster densities (10 and 16/m(2)), two clam densities (8 and 10/m(2)) and one shrimp density (30/m(2)) were evaluated in the experiment. Total ammonium nitrogen and chlorophyll-a were significantly lower in the ponds with the highest combined density of mollusks. During the first crop, shrimp reached 12.6 to 14.88 g in 19 weeks from postlarvae of 10 days age (around 0.002 g), with a survival ranging from 48.3% to 63.1% and a yield from 1866 to 2665 kg/ha. During the second crop, the gain in weight, survival and yield of shrimp ranged from 12.23 to 13.26 g, 61.9% to 67.3%, and 2271 to 2677 kg/ha, respectively. Oyster mean weight increased between 40.2 to 50.1 g in 6 months, with a poor survival of 10.7% to 16.2% and a yield of 746 to 1014 kg/ha. Clams grew in a range from 13.3 to 14.0 g in the same period, with a survival of 45.5% to 50.2% and a yield of 617 to 793 kg/ha. It may be concluded that polyculture of these three species seems to be feasible and that the presence of mollusks in the ponds might not have an adverse but a beneficial effect on the productive performance of shrimp.

Nitrogen removal from domestic wastewater using the marshland upwelling system	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						nitrogen; marshland upwelling system; wetlands; decentralized wastewater treatment	FLOW CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; VERTICAL-FLOW; NUTRIENT; PERFORMANCE; COLIFORM; TEMPERATURE; FATE	Malfunctioning or nonexistent wastewater treatment systems are one of the primary causes of water quality degradation in coastal areas. The marshland upwelling system (MUS) was developed as a low-cost, low-maintenance on-site treatment alternative for coastal dwellings, in which wastewater is injected into the saline subsoil and pushed toward the surface by buoyancy forces. Four injection regimes, characterized by flow rate (L/min), duration (min), and frequency (h), were evaluated for a MUS located in Moss Point, Mississippi, from June 2001 to June 2002 to determine the system's ability to remove nitrogen from wastewaters generated from recreational facilities. Nitrogen data were collected from a cluster of monitoring wells surrounding the injection well. The injection regime of 2.8 L/min (30 min/3 h) resulted in the best removal efficiency. Total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) were reduced from an influent average of 168 and 160 to 2.4 and 1.5 mg-N/L, respectively. Vector distance-based removal coefficients were estimated to be 0.88 and 0.84 m(-1) for TKN and TAN, respectively. Subsequently, 3.2 and 3.1 vector meters were required to reduce TKN and TAN to 10 mg-N/L. The probabilities of the system effluent to exceed 10 mg-N/L were estimated to be 3% for TKN and 0% for TAN, respectively. Bench-scale laboratory studies indicated the potential for further treatment in the upper zone of the MUS system due to increases in redox potential caused by the Juncus roemerianus' rhizosphere, which provided a nitrification zone.

J	Komatsu, E; Fukushima, T; Shiraishi, H				Komatsu, Eiji; Fukushima, Takehiko; Shiraishi, Hiroaki			Modeling of P-dynamics and algal growth in a stratified reservoir - mechanisms of P-cycle in water and interaction between overlying water and sediment	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						water quality modeling; phosphorus dynamics; algal growth; water-sediment interaction; iron-bound phosphate	NITROGEN-LIMITED GROWTH; EUTROPHICATION MODEL; MARINE-PHYTOPLANKTON; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; PHOSPHATE RELEASE; PHOSPHORUS; QUALITY; LAKES; PREDICTION; SHALLOW	A water quality model was designed to represent longitudinal and vertical concentration variations in narrow, stratified lakes/reservoirs and was applied to the Shimajigawa reservoir in Japan. In order to predict the concentrations of nutrients, DO, iron, and plankton, three models were combined. They consisted of a runoff model, a lake/reservoir flow-transport model, and an ecological model. it is thought that algal growth in reservoirs is increased by the release of phosphorus from the sediment and that both the formation and dissolution of an iron-phosphate complex are key factors controlling the rate at which phosphorus is released. Thus, to understand the dynamics of phosphorus in the lake/reservoir, the iron cycle and related redox reactions in the water and sediment column were taken into consideration. In addition, the processes of phosphorus adsorption/sedimentation under aerobic conditions and phosphorus desorption/release from the sediment were described by modeling the creation and decomposition of the iron-bound phosphate complex. Following the calibration of its parameters, the model was shown to be able to reproduce the actual oxygen profile, the dynamics of iron and nutrients, and algal growth. In particular, by combining the ecological model with the iron-bound phosphate sub-model, we were able to predict changes in PO4-P concentrations in the hypolimnion. This shows that the combination of the iron-bound phosphate sub-model with the ecological model is very useful in understanding the dynamics of phosphorus in a lake/reservoir where a seasonal cycle between aerobic and anaerobic conditions occurs. In addition, the relationship between occasional algal blooms and phosphorus dynamics was investigated using the model. Algal densities in the reservoir were found to be strongly related to the amounts of phosphate transported from the lower layer to the epilimnion when turnover occurred, and were affected by the phosphorus dynamics of the lower layer. In turn, the amount of phosphate transported in this way was found to increase in accordance with the amount released from the sediment, which was found to depend on the development of an anaerobic layer.

A water quality model was applied to predict concentrations of inorganic nutrients, chlorophyll-a, and dissolved oxygen (DO) in the Ria de Aveiro lagoon, Portugal. Both data and modelling results point out that the DO distribution in the lagoon is controlled by tidal transport processes. The DO distribution in the Ria de Aveiro seems to be mainly controlled by tidal processes, as its concentration remains relatively high and close to sea values. The far end of the lagoon, where the intertidal salt marshes are important, the DO concentration is dominantly affected by re-aeration and the flooding/drying processes over the intertidal salt marshes, the phytoplankton activity, the nitrification processes and oxidation of the organic matter. These processes play an important role in the creation of the summer hypoxic/anoxic situations, when primary production and advective transport are low. Data and modelling results show strong relationship between nutrients and the CHL-a concentrations during spring-summer, but weak during winter-spring, evidencing the light and nutrients limiting effect during, respectively the last and the former period. High NO3 and NH4 concentrations or important spikes in the concentration precede or coincide, in general, with the CHL-a increase. The main results concerning the DO evolution and distribution demonstrate that a generalized eutrophication state is unlikely to occur within the lagoon, except near its very far end, during summer and in a situation of high BOD concentrations. The good connection between Ria de Aveiro lagoon and the sea and the circulation pattern inside the lagoon are, therefore, responsible for relatively high level of oxygen water content in the water column, throughout its main channels.

PAMOLARE I Training Package, Planning and Management of Lakes and Reservoirs: Models for Eutrophication Management. UNEP-DTIE-IETC and ILEC, 1091 Oroshimo-cho, Kusatsu, Shiga 525-0001, Japan], was developed for Lake Fure situated 12-17 km north of Copenhagen, Denmark. The model was calibrated and validated against two years data from 2001 and 2002, respectively. Furthermore, the model was applied for examining the effects of an ongoing restoration project in the lake by testing three different prognosis scenarios: (1) aeration of the hypolimnion, (2) biomanipulation by removing the trash fish from the lake, (3) two processes described in the two scenarios were applied simultaneously. The calibration yielded acceptable results with a standard deviation (S.D.) of less than 45% for the phytoplankton abundance considered as the most important state variable in the model. The validation results were acceptable for the key state variable, phytoplankton abundance, compared to the observations. Thus, the model was applied to set up prognoses and the results from the prognoses showed that a major improvement in the water quality of the lake might be expected with a significant reduction in the phytoplankton abundance land in the concentration of total phosphorus (TP) in 10 years as expected from the restoration project in the lake. Moreover, the model suggested that the combined application of biomanipulation and aeration practices described in Scenario 3 was the most effective among the three restoration scenarios tested, in obtaining a significant reduction in both phytoplankton abundance and the concentration of TP in the lake. The validation of prognoses is possible when data are available on the development of the lake's status at later stages of the restoration project and after. The lower confidence in data possibly resulted in the high discrepancy from the observations in the validation simulations for zooplankton, the peak values of cyanobacteria, and the timing of phytoplankton, zooplankton and cyanobacteria in the calibration and validation simulations. These have to be taken into account during evaluating the results from the model for the management of the lake. It is recommended that an improved predictive model based on the one presented in this paper is developed due to the explained limitations in the current model developed in this study. It is also suggested that such a model is incorporated into monitoring of the lake's status for a better-informed decision-making in the management of Lake Fure in the future. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	Murdoch, PS; Shanley, JB				Murdoch, Peter S.; Shanley, James B.			Detection of water quality trends at high, median, and low flow in a Catskill Mountain stream, New York, through a new statistical method	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							ADIRONDACK REGION; ACIDIC DEPOSITION; ACIDIFICATION; CHEMISTRY; NITROGEN; PRECIPITATION; RECOVERY; NITRATE; FOREST; SITE	[ 1] The effects of changes in acid deposition rates resulting from the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 should first appear in stream waters during rainstorms and snowmelt, when the surface of the watershed is most hydrologically connected to the stream. Early detection of improved stream water quality is possible if trends at high flow could be separately determined. Trends in concentrations of sulfate (SO42-), nitrate (NO3-), calcium plus magnesium (Ca2++ Mg2+), and acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) in Biscuit Brook, Catskill Mountains, New York, were assessed through segmented regression analysis (SRA). The method uses annual concentration-to-discharge relations to predict concentrations for specific discharges, then compares those annual values to determine trends at specific discharge levels. Median-flow trends using SRA were comparable to those predicted by the seasonal Kendall tau test and a multiple regression residual analysis. All of these methods show that stream water SO42- concentrations have decreased significantly since 1983; Ca2++ Mg2+ concentrations have decreased at a steady but slower rate than SO42-; and ANC shows no trend. The new SRA method, however, reveals trends that differ at specified flow levels. ANC has increased, and NO3- concentrations have decreased at high flows, but neither has changed as significantly at low flows. The general downward trend in SO42- flattened at median flow and reversed at high flow between 1997 and 2002. The reversal of the high-flow SO42- trend is consistent with increases in SO42- concentrations in both precipitation and soil solutions at Biscuit Brook. Separate calculation of high-flow trends provides resource managers with an early detection system for assessing changes in water quality resulting from changes in acidic deposition.

Consequently, the Dutch Flow Model (DUFLOW) based water quality model "Spreewald" and results from the emission model "Modelling Nutrient Emissions in River Systems" (MONERIS) were used to estimate to which extent wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) could contribute to the NO3- concentration in surface waters if they were operated without denitrification. It is demonstrated that an effective phosphorus retention in sediments by means of surface water NO3- is possible only under specific conditions, i.e. (i) a sufficient supply of surface water to the sediment by advective fluxes, (ii) a sufficient amount of sediment iron to provide phosphorus binding sites in the case of sediment oxidation, (iii) a redox system not leading to a rapid NO3- and FeOOH depletion and to phosphorus release from organic pools by high microbial activities. Model results show that in-stream denitrification processes counteract a significant increase of NO3- surface water concentrations from WWTPs operated without denitrification during summer, when eutrophication risk through phosphorus is highest. The increase of NO3- surface water concentrations in winter due to decreased denitrification in the surface water is of minor relevance for phosphorus release from sediments.

It receives pollutants from numerous anthropogenic activities, especially from intensive agricultural practices, urban sewages, stock grazing land and small industries. In this study, hydrologic and chemical parameters are assessed during two periods (1990-1991) and (2001-2002) to evaluate the effects of the climatic changes on phosphorous trends and consequently on the trophic status of Trichonis Lake. Even though large quantities of fertilizers are applied in the lake's catchment, phosphorus loads are still in the permissible level as estimated according to Vollenweider's relationship based on total phosphorus concentration. Due to relatively higher rainfall precipitation during the last years, an increased amount of the phosphorus entering into the lake system is flushed out, thus keeping the trophic status of the lake in oligotrophic levels. In contrast, lower rainfall rates during the first period (1990-1991) have led to the decrease in phosphorus flush out and its detainment into the lake water and sediment resulting to mesotrophic conditions. As the trophic status of the lake is mainly hydrologically dependent and thus unpredictable, effective management plans targeting the elimination of nutrient pollution loadings are necessary.

J	Stewart, NT; Boardman, GD; Helfrich, LA				Stewart, Nathan T.; Boardman, Gregory D.; Helfrich, Louis A.			Characterization of nutrient leaching rates from settled rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) sludge	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						trout sludge; nutrients; leaching; solids management	WATER-QUALITY; PHOSPHORUS; FRACTIONATION; EFFLUENTS; FARMS	The leaching of nutrients from settled rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) sludge into overlying water was evaluated over a 7-day period. Nutrient leaching was assessed in a stagnant reaction tank and one agitated by aeration to simulate turbulent conditions in stocked production raceways. Leaching of total phosphorus (TP), ortho-phosphate (OP), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), and total organic carbon (TOC) occurred rapidly during the first 24 h in both stagnant and agitated conditions. The highest 24 h leaching occurred in the agitated tank, and power regression equations accurately described the varying rates of increasing TP, OP, TAN and TKN. In the stagnant tank, linear increases of TP, OP, TKN and TAN concentrations occurred during the first 24 h. These linear increases continued from days 2 to 7, but at slower rates than occurred during the first 24 h. Average nutrient leaching rates (mg leached/g sludge-h); (dry weight basis) were calculated based on linear concentration increases. In the agitated tank, nutrient concentrations decreased after 60 h, as aerobic bacterial uptake and/or chemical precipitation was suspected. Therefore, average leaching rates could not be determined. These findings reveal that daily cleanout of settling areas could eliminate the release of TP, OP, TAN, TKN, and TOC from settled solids by 66%, 65%, 39%, 76%, and 51%, respectively, as compared to weekly cleanout schedules. Sustained leaching rates indicate nutrient release will likely continue beyond 7 days. This information suggests aggressive and continuous sludge management is most beneficial for maintaining high water quality and regulatory discharge compliance in fish production.

Measurement of integrated effects of salinity and nutrient changes simultaneously can help ascertain whether N sources of similar magnitude and stable isotope (delta N-15) signatures are river dominated. We used Enteromorpha spp., an opportunistic macroalga, to obtain integrated measures of salinity, nutrient supply, and nutrient source in estuaries. We outplanted cultured algae in the field along spatial gradients within three southern California estuaries for 24 hours in wet and dry seasons. Tissue was analyzed for potassium (K+) to measure osmoregulatory changes, total nitrogen to examine changes in nutrient supply, and delta N-15 to assess nutrient sources. Discrete measures of water salinity correlated with tissue K content; however, there was significant variability in the relationship, suggesting that the algae were subject to considerable variation in salinity over a tidal cycle. Tissue total N was not always related to snapshot measures of water column dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), suggesting that integrated measures may be better at capturing the temporal and spatial complexity of nutrient availability. The combination of tissue K, total N, and delta N-15 measures revealed that inflowing rivers delivered N from watershed sources to Mugu Lagoon and Carpinteria Salt Marsh, while both the inflowing river and a mid estuary source were important sources of high delta N-15 N in Upper Newport Bay. These experiments revealed complex patterns of supply and sources of N and demonstrate the usefulness of macroalgal indicators over water sampling to detect these patterns.

Neural net modeling of estuarine indicators: Hindcasting phytoplankton biomass and net ecosystem production in the Neuse (North Carolina) and Trout (Florida) Rivers, USA	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						algae; estuary; neural networks; regression; ecosystem modeling	NETWORK APPROACH; BLOOM DYNAMICS; WATER-QUALITY; COASTAL; RESPIRATION; METABOLISM; RESPONSES; GROWTH; FISH; CONSEQUENCES	Phytoplankton biomass, as chlorophyll (Chl) a, and net ecosystem production (NEP), were modeled using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Chl a varied seasonally and along a saline gradient throughout the Neuse River (North Carolina). NEP was extremely dynamic in the Trout River (Florida), with phototrophic or heterotrophic conditions occurring over short-term intervals. Physical and chemical variables, arising from meteorological and hydrological conditions, created spatial and/or temporal gradients in both systems and served as interacting predictors for the trends/patterns of Chi a and NEP. ANNs outperformed comparable linear regression models and reliably modeled Chi a concentrations less than 20 mu g L-1 and NEP values, denoting the apparent non-linear interactions among abiotic and indicator variables. ANNs underestimated Chi a concentrations greater than 20 mu g L-1, likely due to the periodicity of data acquisition not being sufficient to generalize system variability, the designated 'lag' effect for variables not being adequate to portray estuarine flow dynamics, the exclusion of (one or more) variables that would have improved prediction, and/or an unrealistic expectation of network performance. Variables indicative of meteorological and hydrological forcing and/or proxy measurements of phytoplankton had the greatest relative impact on prediction of Chl a and NEP. Except for their predictive capability, ANNs might appear to be of limited value for ecological applications and problem solving; interpreting the absolute impact of and/or interacting relationships among network variables is intrinsically difficult. Statistical methods or 'rule extraction' algorithms that convey comprehensible network interpretation are needed prior to the routine use of ANNs in programs assessing and/or forecasting the response of biotic indicators to perturbation or for a means to discern estuarine function.

J	Greening, H; Janicki, A				Greening, Holly; Janicki, Anthony			Toward reversal of eutrophic conditions in a subtropical estuary: Water quality and seagrass response to nitrogen loading reductions in Tampa Bay, Florida, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						eutrophication; nutrient management; seagrass; Tampa Bay	NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT; COASTAL; ATTENUATION; RIVER	Coastal waters have been significantly influenced by increased inputs of nutrients that have accompanied population growth in adjacent drainage basins. In Tampa Bay, Florida, USA, the population has quadrupled since 1950. By the late 1970s, eutrophic conditions including phytoplankton and macroalgal blooms and seagrass losses were evident. The focus of improving Tampa Bay is centered on obtaining sufficient water quality necessary for restoring seagrass habitat, estimated to have been 16,400 ha in 1950 but reduced to 8800 ha by 1982. To address these problems, targets for nutrient load reductions along with seagrass restoration goals were developed and actions were implemented to reach adopted targets. Empirical regression models were developed to determine relationships between chlorophyll a concentrations and light attenuation adequate for sustainable seagrass growth. Additional empirical relationships between nitrogen loading and chlorophyll a concentrations were developed to determine how Tampa Bay responds to changes in loads. Data show that when nitrogen load reduction and chlorophyll a targets are met, seagrass cover increases. After nitrogen load reductions and maintenance of chlorophyll a at target levels, seagrass acreage has increased 25% since 1982, although more than 5000 ha of seagrass still require recovery. The cooperation of scientists, managers, and decision makers participating in the Tampa Bay Estuary Program's Nitrogen Management Strategy allows the Tampa Bay estuary to continue to show progress towards reversing many of the problems that once plagued its waters. These results also highlight the importance of a multi-entity watershed management process in maintaining progress towards science-based natural resource goals.

Modeling of non-point source pollution in a Mediterranean drainage basin	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT			English	Article						SWAT model; calibration; verification; hydrograph; sediments; nutrients; management scenarios; Mediterranean drainage basin	GROUNDWATER-FLOW; WATER-QUALITY; PREDICTION; RUNOFF; SWAT	SWAT ver. 2000 was used to predict hydrographs, and sediment, nitrate and total phosphorus loadings from a 1349 km(2) mountainous/agricultural watershed in Northern Greece. The model was calibrated and verified using continuous meteorological data from eight stations within the drainage area, and runoff, sediment and nutrient concentrations measured at nine stations located within the main tributaries of the watershed, for the time period from May 1st, 1998 to January 31st, 2000. Model validation methodology and resulting input parameters appropriate for Mediterranean drainage basins are presented. Predicted by the model hydrographs, sedimentographs and pollutographs are plotted against observed values and show good agreement. Model performance is evaluated using the root mean square error computation and scattergrams of predicted versus observed data. The validated model is also used to test the effectiveness of three alternative cropping scenarios in reducing nutrient loadings from the agricultural part of the watershed. The study showed that this model, if properly validated, can be used effectively in testing management scenarios in Mediterranean drainage basins.

A biogeochemical model is proposed that explicitly accounts for the effects of sediment-nutrient interactions on multiple components of phytoplankton metabolism dynamics, including algal photosynthesis and respiration, pH, carbonate speciation, dissolved oxygen, and biochemical oxygen demand. Sediment-nutrient interactions relate nutrient uptake and release to pH, sediment oxygen demand, sediment organic matter, and iron. pH is a state variable in our model, affects sediment- nutrient adsorption, and constrains model parameters. The model replicates water quality observations in a small Southeastern Piedmont impoundment and suggests that pH-dependent sediment- nutrient adsorption dominates both orthophosphate and ammonium dynamics, with phosphate adsorption being controlled by ligand exchange to iron oxides, and ammonium adsorption being controlled by the cation exchange capacity. Sediment organic matter accumulation and decay also affects nutrient availability, and may explain the longterm increase of hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen deficit in Lake Lanier, a large Southeastern Piedmont impoundment.

While models can provide insights and advice for public policy on load reduction goals, they are caricatures of nature, and it is wise to use independent modeling approaches. In this paper, we describe our simple, biophysically based model that offers a middle ground between statistical models and complex dynamic models. Our model suggests that the target total nitrogen load reduction of 35% will reduce hypoxic volumes by 36-68%, which, on average (53% or 3.4 km(3)) is lower than values reported for 1950-1970 (4.2 km(3)), and roughly half of the values reported for 1980-1990 (7.2 km(3)). By pursuing a simple model construct, we were able to quantify uncertainty to a greater extent than is possible with the more complex numerical models. Yet, by retaining some mechanistic detail we could validate the model against state variables and process rates, an advantage over simple regressions.

Sediment respiration and lake trophic state are important predictors of large CO2 evasion from small boreal lakes	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY			English	Article						boreal lakes; carbon dioxide; CO2 emission; land use; nutrients; O-2 depletion; regional extrapolation; respiration; sediment; water quality	CARBON-DIOXIDE SUPERSATURATION; DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; PHYTOPLANKTON PRODUCTION; TERRESTRIAL CARBON; NORTH-TEMPERATE; SURFACE WATERS; METHANE; EMISSION; FLUXES; MINERALIZATION	We show that sediment respiration is one of the key factors contributing to the high CO2 supersaturation in and evasion from Finnish lakes, and evidently also over large areas in the boreal landscape, where the majority of the lakes are small and shallow. A subpopulation of 177 randomly selected lakes (< 100 km(2)) and 32 lakes with the highest total phosphorus (P-tot) concentrations in the Nordic Lake Survey (NLS) data base were sampled during four seasons and at four depths. Patterns of CO2 concentrations plotted against depth and time demonstrate strong CO2 accumulation in hypolimnetic waters during the stratification periods. The relationship between O-2 departure from the saturation and CO2 departure from the saturation was strong in the entire data set (r(2)=0.79, n=2 740, P < 0.0001). CO2 concentrations were positively associated with lake trophic state and the proportion of agricultural land in the catchment. In contrast, CO2 concentrations negatively correlated with the peatland percentage indicating that either input of easily degraded organic matter and/or nutrient load from agricultural land enhance degradation. The average lake-area-weighted annual CO2 evasion based on our 177 randomly selected lakes and all Finnish lakes > 100 km(2) (Rantakari & Kortelainen, 2005) was 42 g C m(-2) LA (lake area), approximately 20% of the average annual C accumulation in Finnish forest soils and tree biomass (covering 51% of the total area of Finland) in the 1990s. Extrapolating our estimate from Finland to all lakes of the boreal region suggests a total annual CO2 evasion of about 50 TgC, a value upto 40% of current estimates for lakes of the entire globe, emphasizing the role of small boreal lakes as conduits for transferring terrestrially fixed C into the atmosphere.

The European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires that member states establish type-specific reference conditions for all waterbodies, including freshwater lakes. This presents a problem in those locations where human activity has resulted in significant changes to the biological, chemical and physical characteristics of waterbodies. 2. Seventy-six oligotrophic and meso-oligotrophic [0-19 mu g total phosphorus (TP) L-1] lakes thought to be relatively unimpacted by human activity have been nominated as candidate reference lakes (CRL) by the Irish Environmental Protection Agency. This research has used palaeolimnological (lake sediment-based) techniques to test the actual and historical ecological site-specific status of a representative selection of these CRL. Where the temporal record of sedimentation was sufficiently long, the study adopted c. 1850 AD as the primary baseline date for reference conditions. 3. Short sediment cores were obtained from the deepest parts of 35 CRL, and chronologies were established from profiles of spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCP). Twenty-two cores of sediment appeared to date back to c. 1850 on the basis of SCP concentrations. Unless the SCP chronologies suggested otherwise, diatom assemblages present in top and bottom samples from the cores were used as proxies of, respectively, present-day and reference conditions. Past lake water pH (DI-pH) and TP concentration (DI-TP) were inferred from the diatom data. Higher resolution sampling (up to five sediment samples per core) was adopted at seven sites where the SCP-based chronology was more robust and for at least one core from each of the most common types of CRL. Sediment chemistry data were determined to identify possible anthropogenic drivers of the observed changes in the diatom assemblages. 4. Ordination and dissimilarity measures identified the main patterns of variation in the diatom data. Eleven of 34 CRL for which diatom data were available showed little or no change in biological status between core top and bottom samples. Core bottom samples in six of these dated back to pre- or c. 1850 and reference (and high ecological) status could therefore be confirmed in these cases. The estimated age of core bottom samples in the remaining five cores was in the period just after c. 1850 to c. 1950 AD (four cores) or was impossible to determine (one core). Twenty-three (68%) of the CRL sampled showed biologically important deviation from the reference condition, with acidification and nutrient enrichment seemingly the main causes of change. Catchment disturbance, notably peat erosion possibly linked to recent afforestation, also appeared to have been a factor in some cases. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study provides the first systematic examination of changes to water quality in (perceived) pristine lakes over the last c. 150 years for Ireland, and demonstrates the potential of palaeolimnology to support the implementation of the WFD. The results indicate that diatom communities in low alkalinity lakes have been particularly altered, and acidification and nutrient enrichment appear to have been important drivers for some lakes. Furthermore, higher resolution results call into question the validity of applying c. 1850 as the date for reference conditions across Ireland.

J	Gong, CL; Yin, Q; Kuang, DB; Tian, H				Gong Cai-Lan; Yin Qiu; Kuang Ding-Bo; Tian Hua			Study on the spectral reflectivity models of different water quality parameters in Huangpu river	JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES			English	Article						Huangpu river; water quality parameter; spectral reflectivity model		For Huangpu river, spectral reflectivities were measured synchronously with typical water quality parameters, including total phosphor (TP), total nitrogen (TN), dissolved oxygen ( DO), chemical oxygen demand with potassium permanganate (CODMn) chemical oxygen demand with cadmium (CODCr), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), total suspended sediments (TSS), ammoniac nitrogen (NH3-N) and turbidity degree(Turb). Relationships between the nine water quality parameters were analyzed. The linear relationship models were studied between water quality parameters and normalized reflectivities. The results show that there are good relationships between the normalized spectral reflectivities and the water quality parameters except for NH3-N and CODCr. If the normalized spectral reflectivities are replaced by the ratio of spectral reflectivity at different hands, the relativity will be improved, and the correlative coefficients will be more than 0.5 for NH3-N and CODCr.

New in situ method for measuring seston uptake by suspension-feeding bivalve molluscs	JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH			English	Article						bivalve; fluorometry; seston uptake; suspension-feeding; Crassostrea; Mercenaria; Mytilus	CONTROL PHYTOPLANKTON BIOMASS; WATER-QUALITY; CRASSOSTREA-VIRGINICA; MERCENARIA-MERCENARIA; OYSTER REEFS; RESTORATION; TARGETS; EXAMPLE; BEDS	The most commonly used methods for measuring the amount of seston removed from the water column (uptake) by populations of suspension-feeding bivalve molluscs involve taking discrete water samples followed by laboratory analyses. Here we describe a new method based on in situ fluorometry that provides rapid measurement of seston removal rates. The new system is comprised of two identical units, each consisting of an in situ fluorometer, data logger and peristaltic pump with plastic tube attached to a deployment device. The deployment device allows precise placement of the fluorometer probe and intake end of the plastic tube so that in situ fluorescence (chlorophyll a) can be measured and water can be sampled for seston analyses in the laboratory from the same height. The typical setup involves placing one unit upstream and the other downstream of the study area and sampling the water at periodic intervals. Changes in seston concentration are revealed in the field by the fluorometers, and the sampled water can be analyzed in the laboratory for various seston parameters. Comparisons of the in situ data with data from laboratory analyses of pumped water samples were made for three species at four study sites: the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), hard clam (Mercenaria mercenaria), and blue mussel (Mytilus edulis). Comparisons of measured upstream versus downstream seston concentrations indicated significant (t-tests, P < 0.05) differences (uptake) for six of eight trials based on in situ fluorometry, but only marginally significant (P < 0.10) differences at two of the four trials using laboratory chlorophyll a measurements. These data demonstrate that compared with sampling methods requiring laboratory analyses, the new in situ method provides much more rapid quantitative assessments and may provide more accurate estimates.

J	Grunwald, S; Qi, C				Grunwald, Sabine; Qi, Chen			GIS-based water quality modeling in the Sandusky Watershed, Ohio, USA	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Geographic Information System (GIS); SWAT; nutrients; simulation; sediment transport; nonpoint source pollution	SOURCE POLLUTION MODELS; PREDICTING SEDIMENT; RIVER-BASIN; PHOSPHORUS; TRENDS; SWAT	This study focused on the Sandusky Watershed (SW) in Ohio, located within the Great Lakes Basin, with emphasis on two of its subwatersheds, namely Honey Creek (HC) and Rock Creek (RC). The goal was to assess the capabilities of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate suspended sediment (SS), phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) yield in the SW that contribute major sediment and nutrient loads into Lake Erie. The model was calibrated using water flow and water quality parameters for water years 1998 to 1999 and validated model simulations covering the period of water years 2000 to 2001 for monthly conditions. The validation of SS showed correlation coefficients of 0.29 (SW), 0.75 (HC) and 0.69 (RC). Correlation coefficients for P were 0.68 (SW), 0.78 (HC) and 0.37 (RC); for NO2-N 0.84 (HC) and 0.38 (RC); for NO3-N 0.27 (HC) and 0.76 (RC); for NH3-N 0.57 (SW), 0.49 (HC), and 0.13 (RC). In addition, mean errors, root mean square errors, Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients, and graphs were used to compare simulated to measured data. Simulation success was variable with poor and good simulations, but in most cases, simulated water quality values followed the trend of measured data except for extreme (or intense) rainfall/runoff events. Reviews of 17 applications indicated that the SWAT is suitable for long term continuous simulations but not for storm events. A spatially distributed modeling approach generated maps showing the spatial distribution of SS, P, and N for each simulation element across the Sandusky Watershed.

Tidal and longitudinal variation of faecal indicator bacteria in an estuarine creek in south-east Queensland, Australia	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article						faecal indicator bacteria; water quality parameters; tidal variation	TERM ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABILITY; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; WATER-QUALITY; ENTERIC BACTERIA; PHYTOPLANKTON ABUNDANCE; BRACKISH-WATER; MARINE WATERS; SURVIVAL; SEDIMENTS; SEAWATER	A two-part study conducted in Elimbah Creek, a shallow estuarine waterway in south-east Queensland, Australia, examined the variations in physico-chemical parameters of water quality, chlorophyll a, and faecal indicator bacteria abundances of total coliform, Escherichia coli and enterococci, spatially at high and low tide and also over a 12 h tidal cycle. Gradients of increasing faecal indicator bacteria from the mouth to the upper, tidal freshwater reaches were observed, despite isolated peaks during either tidal phase. Phytoplankton biomass (measured as chlorophyll a) did not noticeably increase during the study. Variations in the abundances of all three faecal indicator bacteria and their correlations with physico-chemical parameters indicated that although the creek was likely subject to some level of faecal contamination, tidal movement serves to limit faecal indicator and phytoplankton levels in the creek through physico-chemical stress and dilution. However, each faecal indicator bacteria investigated provided different estimations of faecal contamination, which challenges the effectiveness of employing a single type of faecal indicator bacteria when investigating the level of faecal contamination in waterways.

J	Edmonds, RL; Mikkelsen, K				Edmonds, Robert L.; Mikkelsen, Kerri			Influence of salmon carcass placement in red alder riparian areas on stream chemistry in lowland western Washington	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT			English	Article							OREGON COAST RANGE; PACIFIC SALMON; NATIONAL-PARK; FRESH-WATER; NITROGEN; GROWTH; TRENDS; ECOSYSTEMS; NUTRIENTS; SIZE	Populations of Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp., which historically returned large quantities of marine-derived nutrients (MDN) to Pacific Northwest streams and riparian areas, are now much lower. In response, salmon carcasses are now being placed in streams and riparian areas to compensate for the loss of MDN, particularly organic N and P. Our objectives were to determine (1) whether placement of chum salmon O. keta carcasses in riparian areas dominated by red alder Alnus rubra, an N-fixing tree, changed stream chemistry and (2) whether carcass placement affected water quality. Study sites were Brown and Le Bar creeks, two small streams in the Skokomish River valley in western Washington. The amount of N in carcasses placed in riparian areas in Brown and Le Bar creeks in November 1999 was estimated to be 22.4 and 59.8 kg/ha, respectively, while the amount of P was 2.7 and 7.2 kg/ha. Monthly stream grab samples were taken between September 1999 and October 2000 upstream and downstream of salmon carcass placement areas and analyzed for NO3-N, NH4-N, PO4-P, pH, electrical conductivity, and alkalinity. The maximum concentration was low for NO3-N (0.32 mg/L), NH4-N (0.10 mg/L), and PO4-P (0.026 mg/L). Salmon carcass placement did not significantly change stream chemistry. This could have been because of the particular amounts of N and P added or uptake by soil organisms, riparian vegetation, and stream processes. Substantial amounts of nutrients in salmon carcasses can be added to the system with little influence on stream water quality. Red alder in the riparian areas did not strongly influence the stream concentration of NO3-N.

In this study we evaluated surface and groundwater interaction in the riparian zone of an incised stream during a spring high flow period using detailed stream stage and hydraulic head data from six wells, and water quality sampling to determine whether the riparian zone can be a source of nitrate pollution to streams. Study results indicated that bank storage of stream water from Walnut Creek during a Large storm water runoff event was limited to a narrow 1.6 m zone immediately adjacent to the channel. Nitrate concentrations in riparian groundwater were highest near the incised stream where the unsaturated zone was thickest. Nitrate and dissolved oxygen concentrations and nitrate-chtoride ratios increased during a spring recharge period then decreased in the latter portion of the study. We used MODFLOW and MT3DMS to evaluate dilution and denitrification processes that would contribute to decreasing nitrate concentrations in riparian groundwater over time. MT3DMS model simulations were improved with a denitrification rate of 0.02 1/d assigned to the floodplain sediments implying that denitrification plays an important role in reducing nitrate concentrations in groundwater. We conclude that riparian zones of incised channels can potentially be a source of nitrate to streams during spring recharge periods when the near-stream riparian zone is largely unvegetated.

Effects of sampling frequency on estimates of dissolved silica export by streams: The role of hydrological variability and concentration-discharge relationships	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							HIGH-ELEVATION CATCHMENTS; WATER-QUALITY; HYDROGRAPH SEPARATION; HEADWATER CATCHMENT; SIERRA-NEVADA; UNITED-STATES; NITROGEN; PHOSPHORUS; TRANSPORT; RIVER	[ 1] Accurate estimates of solute export are critical for mass balance studies of elemental flux. We explored how variation in hydrology ( e. g., flashiness) and concentration-discharge relationships modulate the effect of solute sampling frequency on bias and precision associated with estimates of dissolved silica export in rivers. Dissolved silica concentration and discharge data from 14 rivers were used to parameterize a nonlinear concentration-discharge model, which was used to generate simulated data for daily dissolved silica concentration for 20 rivers. We determined how solute sampling at various intervals affects bias, precision, and root-mean-square error of export estimates. Bias and coefficient of variation of dissolved silica export increased with coarser sampling intervals. Flashiness and the coefficient of variation of daily discharge typically explained 90% or more of the variation in bias and precision of dissolved silica export, particularly at finer sampling intervals. Our analysis should be useful to researchers and land managers who are planning or evaluating sampling programs to determine solute flux or who seek error estimates for solute export.

The objective of this study was to develop nitrogen (N) and irrigation best management practices for citrus in sandy soils to maintain optimal crop yield and quality, and to minimize N leaching below the rootzone. A replicated plot experiment was conducted in a highly productive 20+ year-old 'Hamlin' orange [Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck] trees on 'Cleopatra mandarin' [(Citrus reticulata Blanco)] rootstock grove located on a well drained Tavares fine sand (hyperthermic, uncoated, Typic Quartzipsamments) in Highland County. FL. Nitrogen rates (112-280 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) were applied as fertigation (FRT), water soluble granular (WSG). a combination of 50% FRT and 50% WSG, and controlled release fertilizer (CRF). Tensiometers were used to monitor the soil moisture content at various depths in the soil profile as basis to optimize irrigation scheduling. Fruit yield and quality and nutritional status of the trees were reported in a companion paper. Soil solution was sampled at 60, 120, and 240 cm depths under the tree canopy using suction lysimeters. Concentrations of NO3-N in the soil solution at 240 cm deep, which is an indicator of NO3-N leaching below the tree rootzone, generally remained below the maximum contaminant limit (MCL) for drinking water quality (10 mg L-1) in most samples across all N sources and rates, but for few exceptions. Total N in the fruit was strongly correlated with fruit load. thus. at a given N rate N removal by the fruit was lower during years of low fruit yield as compared to that during the years of high fruit yield. Furthermore. there was a strong linear relation between N and K in the fruit. This supports the need to maintain 1:1 ratio between the rates of N and K applications. In a high fruit production condition, the N in the fruit accounted for about 45% of the total N input on an annual basis. Fifteen percent of the total N input at 280 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) was not accounted for in the citrus N budget. which could be due to leaching loss. This estimate of potential leaching was very close to that predicted by LEACHM simulation model. The improved N and irrigation management practices developed in this study contributed to an improved N uptake efficiency and a reduction in N losses. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper proposes an overview of existing estimation methods and a framework to select the most suited one given available streamflow and concentration data. Correlations between contaminant concentration and streamflow should first be checked to generate missing concentration values by regression. However, correlations are not always strong, in which case the ratio estimator method is more appropriate. Given a 6-year data set (1989-1995) from the Beaurivage River (Quebec, Canada) with, at best, a weekly sampling, the ratio estimator method was selected to estimate annual and seasonal loads of sediments and nutrients (N and P). Results show relatively steady annual loads (on average 8.1 and 1.1 kg ha yr(-1) for total dissolved N and total P, respectively) and a low erosion rate (0.23 t ha yr(-1)). The results also confirm that nutrient and sediment transport via runoff is essentially a springtime process in this region, and they indicate that dissolved P represents the bulk of the total P load, most likely due to artificial subsurface drainage systems in the watershed. These results are compared to the results obtained by using averaging methods and to several other sources of information from literature, confirming the order of magnitude but highlighting some remaining uncertainties. Finally, some research avenues are proposed to improve the proposed framework and to investigate other estimation methods adapted to data characteristics. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These projections were then used to drive four effect models linked to assess the effects on hydrology, and nitrogen (N) concentrations and fluxes, in the Bjerkreim river basin (685-km(2)) and its coastal fjord, southwestern Norway. The four effect models were the hydrological model HBV, the water quality models MAGIC, INCA-N and the NIVA FJORD model. The downscaled climate scenarios project a general temperature increase in the study region of approximately I degrees C by 2030-2049 (MPI IS92a) and approximately 3 degrees C by 2071-2100 (HAD A2). Both scenarios imply increased winter precipitation, whereas the projections of summer and autumn precipitation are quite different, with the MPI scenario projecting a slight increase and the HAD scenario a significant decrease. As a response to increased winter temperature, the HBV model simulates a dramatic reduction of snow accumulation in the upper parts of the catchment, which in turn lead to higher runoff during winter and lower runoff during snowmelt in the spring. With the HAD scenario, runoff in summer and early autumn is substantially reduced as a result of reduced precipitation, increased temperatures and thereby increased evapotranspiration. The water quality models, MAGIC and INCA-N project no major changes in nitrate (NOD concentrations and fluxes within the MPI scenario, but a significant increase in concentrations and a 40-50% increase in fluxes in the HAD scenario. As a consequence, the acidification of the river could increase, thus offsetting ongoing recovery from acidification due to reductions in acid deposition. Additionally, the increased N loading may stimulate growth of N-limited benthic algae and macrophytes along the river channels and lead to undesirable eutrophication effects in the estuarine area. Simulations made by the FJORD model and the HAD scenario indicate that primary production in the estuary might increase up to 15-20%, based on the climate-induced changes in river flow and nitrate concentrations alone.

Impacts of climate change on in-stream nitrogen in a lowland chalk stream: An appraisal of adaptation strategies	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Kennet; climate change; water quality; nitrate; ammonia; Thames; land use; adaptation	MULTIPLE SOURCE ASSESSMENT; LAND-USE CHANGE; RIVER KENNET; CATCHMENTS INCA; MODEL STRUCTURE; GLOBAL CHANGE; NITRATE; DYNAMICS; ENGLAND; RISDALSHEIA	The impacts of climate change on nitrogen (N) in a lowland chalk stream are investigated using a dynamic modelling approach. The INCA-N model is used to simulate transient daily hydrology and water quality in the River Kennet using temperature and precipitation scenarios downscaled from the General Circulation Model (GCM) output for the period 1961-2100. The three GCMs (CGCM2, CSIRO and HadCM3) yield very different river flow regimes with the latter projecting significant periods of drought in the second half of the 21st century. Stream-water N concentrations increase over time as higher temperatures enhance N release from the soil, and lower river flows reduce the dilution capacity of the river. Particular problems are shown to occur following severe droughts when N mineralization is high and the subsequent breaking of the drought releases high nitrate loads into the river system. Possible strategies for reducing climate-driven N loads are explored using INCA-N. The measures include land use change or fertiliser reduction, reduction in atmospheric nitrate and ammonium deposition, and the introduction of water meadows or connected wetlands adjacent to the river. The most effective strategy is to change land use or reduce fertiliser use, followed by water meadow creation, and atmospheric pollution controls. Finally, a combined approach involving all three strategies is investigated and shown to reduce in-stream nitrate concentrations to those pre-1950s even under climate change. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Evaluating various water stress calculations in RZWQM and RZ-SHAW for corn and soybean production	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							DOUBLE-CROPPING SYSTEM; QUALITY MODEL RZWQM; HYBRID MODEL; PLANT; EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN	Better understanding of water stress calculation is needed to improve crop production simulation. In this study, the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) and RZWQM-SHAW (Simultaneous Heat And Water) (RZ-SHAW) Hybrid Model were evaluated for simulating corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] growth and water use under a range of water conditions in the Central Great Plains. In both models, a water stress index (WSI) was calculated as a nonlinear form of the ratio between actual transpiration (AT) and potential transpiration (PT) [WSI = (AT/PT)(alpha), 0 < alpha < 1]. Evapotranspiration (ET) was calculated using the Shuttleworth-Wallace approach on a daily basis (ETSW-DAY) in RZWQM and using either the Shuttleworth-Wallace approach on hourly basis (ETSW-HR) or the SHAW approach (ETSHAW) in RZ-SHAW. Results showed that RZWQM using ETSW-DAY provided similar simulation for both corn and soybean production as RZ-SHAW using the ETSW-HR option, given that the same plant parameters were used. However, RZ-SHAW with ETSHAW provided less accurate simulations for corn and soybean growth. This study demonstrated that, when RZ-SHAW is used for plant simulation, AT and PT should be calculated the same way as in RZWQM to preserve the plant parameters. Otherwise, recalibration of plant growth parameters is needed. This study also showed that the alpha value varied from crop to crop and among ET calculations. Based on the results, it is suggested to use alpha = 0.75 for corn and alpha = 0.5 for soybean in RZ-SHAW with the ETSW-HR option.

The data collected for Kumluca Plain of Turkey have been utilized to develop the approach. The plain is known with its intensive agricultural activities, which imply excessive application of fertilizers. The characteristics of the soils and underlying groundwater for this plain were monitored during the years 1999 and 2000. Additionally, an extensive field survey related to the types and yields of crops, fertilizer application and irrigation water was carried out. Both the soil and groundwater have exhibited high levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and salinity with considerable spatial and temporal variations. The pollution level of groundwater at several established stations within the plain were assessed using Fuzzy Logic. Water Pollution Index (WPI) values are calculated by Fuzzy Logic utilizing the most significant groundwater pollutants in the area namely nitrite, nitrate and orthophosphate together with the groundwater vulnerability to pollution. The results of the calculated WPI and the monitoring study have yielded good agreement. WPI indicated high to moderate water pollution levels at Kumluca plain depending on factors such as agricultural age, depth to groundwater, soil characteristics and vulnerability of groundwater to pollution. Fuzzy Logic approach has shown to be a practical, simple and useful tool to assess groundwater pollution levels.

Wollastonite as reactive filter medium for sorption of wastewater ammonium and phosphorus	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						nutrient removal; wastewater treatment; sorbent material; adsorption; sorption mechanisms	BLAST-FURNACE SLAG; ION-EXCHANGE; CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; PHOSPHATE REMOVAL; ADSORPTION; RECOVERY; SORBENTS; CLAY	The utilisation of reactive filter media to remove ammonium and phosphorus can improve the effluent water quality of wastewater treatment systems. The objective of this study was to estimate the ammonium and phosphorus sorption capacity of wollastonite, a calcium meta silicate (CaSiO3) that is distributed worldwide. Phosphorus sorption mechanisms were also investigated. Batch sorption experiments with agitating bottles were carried out and both phosphate and ammonium solutions as well as wastewater were used. The results showed minor ammonium adsorption, with only 3-15% of the ammonium in the solutions being adsorbed to the wollastonite. Neither the reaction time (0.5-20 h) nor the initial concentrations of phosphorus and ammonium (11-114 mg l(-1) NH4-N) were of importance. For high initial phosphate concentrations, phosphate was greatly adsorbed to the wollastonite (850 mg kg(-1) at an initial phosphate concentration of 61 mg l(-1) PO4-P). However, phosphate sorption was minor when the initial phosphate concentration was low. This study showed that sorption reactions were important when phosphate was removed by wollastonite, and indicated precipitation of phosphate on the wollastonite surfaces as one possible mechanism for phosphate retention. The results from this study indicated that the wollastonite investigated may not be suitable for municipal wastewater treatment applications due to the low phosphorus sorption capacity for low initial phosphorus concentrations.

Nutrient water quality in a tropical coastal zone with groundwater discharge, northwest Yucatan, Mexico	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						nutrient water quality; groundwater; Yucatan; nitrate contamination; eutrophication; nutrients	MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES; EUTROPHICATION; BAY; NITROGEN; IMPACT; RIVER; TRANSFORMATIONS; ACCUMULATION; DEPOSITION; PENINSULA	This work is the beginning of a coastal water quality monitoring program to establish the baseline for the implementation of an integrated coastal management of the Yucatan Peninsula tropical ecosystem. Coastal water quality is affected by the increasing economic development. This area has no rivers because of its karst geomorphology, and the coastal freshwater comes from springs or seeps. Coastal water quality was studied in four towns from January to December 2000. Statistically significant differences among water quality variables and processes are discussed. Along with groundwater discharge, domestic and shrimp farming sewage are the main sources of nutrients, predominantly of nitrogen and silica. Salinity dilution is used to estimate the groundwater fraction that influences each area in northwestern Yucatan. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Microcystis persisted at the upper estuary where the water circulation was poor and values ranged between 2.9 x 10(4) and 2.7 x 10(6) cells ml(-1) throughout the study. Simultaneously measured physical (salinity, temperature, rainfall and secchi disc) and chemical parameters (nutrients and dissolved oxygen) were evaluated together with Microcystis data. Although the Microcystis blooms generally occur in summer due to the increase in temperature, the blooms were recorded in winter in the present study. The abundance of Microcystis depended on the variations in salinity and both blooms were recorded below S = 2. A moderate partial correlation between Microcystis abundance and salinity was detected in the presence of temperature, dissolved oxygen and precipitation data (r = -0.561, p = 0.002). The M. cf. aeruginosa abundance was low in the summer when the salinity was higher than winter. A remarkable increase in the eukaryotic phytoplankton abundance following the improvements in the water quality of the estuary occurred, whilst the Microcystis abundance remained below bloom level.

Mapping hydrological pathways of phosphorus transfer in apparently homogeneous landscapes using a high-resolution DEM	GEODERMA			English	Article						landscape; phosphorus; overland flow; eutrophication; water quality	SOIL-PHOSPHORUS; AGRICULTURAL LAND; SURFACE WATERS; NITROGEN; LOSSES; QUALITY; RUNOFF	Agriculture is a significant contributor to the diffuse loading of phophorus (P) in fresh water systems. At the landscape level, source areas and targeted surface waters are connected through different hydrological pathways. One of these pathways, P removal through surface runoff, may increase in relative importance when storm events occur and in wet seasons. With Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) it is possible to identify dominant surface pathways in the landscape although resolution of available DEMs is often not detailed enough for areas with low relief or for more detailed landscape-field studies. New high-resolution DEMs that do combine a high resolution with substantial spatial coverage provide the opportunity to develop site-specific management alternatives for sensitive or critical source areas at the landscape level. The objective of this paper is to map hydrological pathways of P for a relatively flat glacial till landscape in the Northern part of the Netherlands and to compare two strategies (A and B) in this landscape for minimizing P loading of surface waters following different scenarios. Strategy A assumes equal lowering of phosphate input rates for all fields and strategy B takes into account the relative sensitivity of fields for removal through overland flow. Available soil data, which did not allow to geo-reference individual fields, showed high soil P levels in about 5% of all fields. Data on field inputs of total phosphate (P2O5) were available for 29 farms and showed that fertilized fields received on average 124 kg ha(-1) in the year 2000. Transfer potential of each individual field was evaluated on the basis of two characteristics in a 5 x 5 in resolution DEM:1) the degree of internal drainage through re-distribution and 2) the degree of external drainage, which indicates the overland flow potential. Almost every field was characterised by sinks (98%) and external drainage into along-field ditches (99%). In addition, almost half of the fields showed drainage directly into surface waters (47%). Applying a classification scheme to rank the sensitivity for losses through overland flow provided a framework to distribute catchment inputs of phosphate at field level (strategy B). Comparing the strategy of distributed phosphate inputs (B) with generic phosphate inputs (A) showed that catchment input-to-output ratios are higher for strategy B for three out of four of the applied scenarios.

Biogeochemical constraints on the ecological rehabilitation of wetland vegetation in river floodplains	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Living Rivers - Trends and Challenges in Science and Management held in Honour of Piet Nienhuis	OCT 31, 2003	Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen, NETHERLANDS		Radboud Univ Nijmegen	biodiversity; biogeochemistry; eutrophication; flooding; nature conservation; review; water management	PLANT-SPECIES RICHNESS; AQUATIC VASCULAR PLANTS; FRESH-WATER WETLANDS; HEAVY-METALS; NUTRIENT DYNAMICS; PHOSPHORUS RETENTION; PHRAGMITES-AUSTRALIS; PHOSPHATE RELEASE; ORGANIC-MATTER; RHINE-DELTA	The European policy for river management during peak discharge periods is currently changing from exclusion strategies (reinforcement of dykes) to allowing a more natural situation by creating more floodplain space to reduce water levels during peak discharges. In addition, water retention and water storage areas have been created. The new measures are generally being combined with nature development strategies. Up till now, however, ecological targets of broadscale floodplain wetland restoration including sedge marshes, species-rich floodplain forests and carrs, riparian mesotrophic grasslands and other biodiverse riverine ecosystems, have hardly developed in these areas. Most studies on the conditions needed for sustainable ecological development of floodplains have focused on hydrological and geomorphological rather than biogeochemical issues (including nutrient availability and limitation). There are, however, large differences in the composition of river water and groundwater and in sediment quality between rivers in densely populated areas and those in more pristine areas, which serve as a reference. It is very likely that these factors, in combination with heavily altered hydrological regimes and the narrow areas confined between the dykes on both sides of the rivers, impose major constraints on sustainable ecological development of riverine areas. Another issue is that existing wetlands are generally considered to be very appropriate for water retention and conservation, although recent research has shown that this may pose a serious threat to their biodiversity. The present paper reviews the biogeochemical constraints on the combination of floodplain rehabilitation, water conservation and the conservation and development of wetlands. It is concluded that biogeochemical problems (mainly related to eutrophication) predominantly arise in less dynamic parts of the river system, to which the flood-pulse concept applies less. Sound knowledge of the biogeochemical processes involved will contribute to greater efficiency and a better prediction of the opportunities for restoration and development of riverine wetlands. This information can be directly applied in nature management, water management, policy-making and consultancy.

Since Croatia accommodates large detention areas, both natural (e.g., Mokro Polje) and controlled (Lonjsko Polje), it serves as an excellent example for planned detention areas elsewhere in Europe. This modelling study focuses on the controlled detention area of Lonjsko Polje. The flooding characteristics of the area are assessed in combination with the vegetation development and the transport and storage of sediment and phosphorus. Results of the modelling show that it is not so much the intake capacity that determines the flood duration time of a detention area, but the drainage capacity. A too long inundation duration following a flood event is shown to lead to major shifts in the vegetation composition. The results further indicate that about 30% of the sediment and adsorbed phosphorus that enters the detention area during an extreme (1:100 years) flood is retained within the area; this is about 10% of the total sediment and adsorbed phosphorus load of the Sava. Results of this study can be used to properly design and manage detention areas along lowland rivers.

Neuquen river case, Patagonia, Argentina	INGENIERIA HIDRAULICA EN MEXICO			Spanish	Article						optimization model; regional planning; lineal programming		A developed methodology allows to make a regional planification based on the river's water quality and their guide levels for different uses. To get this methodology it was use an optimization model, that allows to obtain the best combination of town and industrial liquid treatments of the region, whichs can make cheaper their construction and maintenance costs. The established regional stages of economical development, were simulate with the QLAL2E model, from this model was obtain the restriction coefficients of the optimization model. More over, this model allowed to prognosticate the behavior of the principal water quality components (dissolved and biochemical demand of oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and others) for different proposed stages. This methodology was apply over a section of Neuquen River (Argentina) which receives urban, industrial and farming effluents of three cities Centenario (Plant 1), Cinco Saltos (Plant 2) and Parque Industrial (Plant 3). From results, it can be affirmed that under present situation, there is not contamination hazard. However, under future scenarios, advanced and secondary treatment is required to assure meeting the quality standards, particulary when river discharge approach it annual minimum.

Estimating yields of salt- and water-stressed forages with remote sensing in the visible and near infrared	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							FOLIAR SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE; PLANT STRESS; VEGETATION INDEXES; BIOMASS PRODUCTION; NITROGEN STATUS; LEAF; CORN; EFFICIENCY; SALINITY; IMAGERY	In and irrigated regions, the proportion of crop production under deficit irrigation with poorer quality water is increasing as demand for fresh water soars and efforts to prevent saline water table development occur. Remote sensing technology to quantify salinity and water stress effects on forage yield can be an important tool to address yield loss potential when deficit irrigating with poor water quality. Two important forages, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and tall wheatgrass (Agropyron elongatum L.), were grown in a volumetric lysimeter facility where rootzone salinity and water content were varied and monitored. Ground-based hyperspectral canopy reflectance in the visible and near infrared (NIR) were related to forage yields from a broad range of salinity and water stress conditions. Canopy reflectance spectra were obtained in the 350- to 1000-nm region from two viewing angles (nadir view, 45 degrees from nadir). Nadir view vegetation indices (VI) were not as strongly correlated with leaf area index changes attributed to water and salinity stress treatments for both alfalfa and wheatgrass. From a list of 71 VIs, two were selected for a multiple linear-regression model that estimated yield under varying salinity and water stress conditions. With data obtained during the second harvest of a three-harvest 100-d growing period, regression coefficients for each crop were developed and then used with the model to estimate fresh weights for preceding and succeeding harvests during the same 100-d interval. The model accounted for 72% of the variation in yields in wheatgrass and 94% in yields of alfalfa within the same salinity and water stress treatment period. The model successfully predicted yield in three out of four cases when applied to the first and third harvest yields. Correlations between indices and yield increased as canopy development progressed. Growth reductions attributed to simultaneous salinity and water stress were well characterized, but the corrections for effects of varying tissue nitrogen (N) and very low leaf area index (LAI) are necessary.

Accuracy and performance of three water quality models for simulating nitrate nitropen losses under corn	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							TILLAGE-RESIDUE MANAGEMENT; SEASONAL NITROGEN DYNAMICS; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; SOIL NITRATE; CALIBRATION; BEHAVIOR; NCSWAP; GROUNDWATER; PESTICIDE; TRANSPORT	Simulation models can be used to predict N dynamics in a soil-water-plant system. The simulation accuracy and performance of three models: LEACHM (Leaching Estimation And CHemistry Model), NCSWAP (Nitrogen and Carbon cycling in Soil, Water And Plant), and SOILN to predict NO3-N leaching were evaluated and compared to field data from a 5-yr experiment conducted on a Hagerstown silt loam (fine, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalf). Nitrate N losses past 1.2 m from N-fertilized and manured corn (Zea mays L.) were measured with zero-tension pan lysimeters for 5 yr. The models were calibrated using 1989-1990 data and validated using 1988-1989, 1990-1991,1991-1992, and 1992-1993 NO3-N leaching data. Statistical analyses indicated that LEACHM, NCSWAP, and SOILN models were able to provide accurate simulations of annual NO3-N leaching losses below the 1.2-m depth for 8, 9, and 7 of 10 cases, respectively, in the validation years. The inaccuracy in the models' annual simulations for the control and manure treatments seems to be related to inadequate description of processes of N and C transformations in the models' code. The overall performance and accuracy of the SOILN model were worse than those of LEACHM and NCSWAP. The root mean square error (RMSE) and modeling efficiency (ME) were 10.7 and 0.9,9.5 and 0.93, and 20.7 and 0.63 for LEACHM, NCSWAP, and SOILN, respectively. Overall, the three models have the potential to predict NO3-N losses below 1.2-m depth from fertilizer and manure nitrogen applied to corn without recalibration of models from year to year.

Role of rainfall intensity and hydrology in nutrient transport via surface runoff	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							WATER-QUALITY; DISSOLVED PHOSPHORUS; SWINE MANURE; MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN; SOILS; DENITRIFICATION; FERTILIZER; NITRATE; LOSSES	Loss of soil nutrients in runoff accelerates eutrophication of surface waters. This study evaluated P and N in surface runoff in relation to rainfall intensity and hydrology for two soils along a single hillslope. Experiments were initiated on 1- by 2-m plots at foot-slope (6%) and mid-slope (30%) positions within an alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)-orchard-grass (Dactylis glomerata L.) field. Rain simulations (2.9 and 7.0 cm h(-1)) were conducted under wet (spring) and dry (late-summer) conditions. Elevated, antecedent soil moisture at the foot-slope during the spring resulted in less rain required to generate runoff and greater runoff volumes, compared with runoff from the well-drained mid-slope in spring and at both landscape positions in late summer. Phosphorus in runoff was primarily in dissolved reactive form (DRP averaged 71% of total P), with DRP concentrations from the two soils corresponding with soil test P levels. Nitrogen in runoff was mainly nitrate (NO3-N averaged 77% of total N). Site hydrology, not chemistry, was primarily responsible for variations in mass N and P losses with landscape position. Larger runoff volumes from the foot-slope produced higher losses of total P (0.08 kg ha(-1)) and N (1-35 kg ha(-1)) than did runoff from the mid-slope (0.05 total P kg ha(-1); 0.48 kg N ha(-1)), particularly under wet, springtime conditions. Nutrient losses were significantly greater under the high intensity rainfall due to larger runoff volumes. Results affirm the critical source area concept for both N and P: both nutrient availability and hydrology in combination control nutrient loss.

Hauling stress and associated delayed mortality have been implicated as potential causes of low pond survival. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of biomass density, substrate, and salinity on water quality and transport survival of juvenile freshwater prawns Macrobrachium rosenbergii. The trial was designed as a 3 X 2 X 2 factorial and evaluated three biomass densities (10, 20, and 30 g/L), the presence or absence of added substrate (plastic mesh to provide a 200% increase in surface area), and the presence or absence of added salt (0 parts per thousand or 6 parts per thousand). Model transport tanks were 15-L, open styrofoam containers aerated with pure oxygen and compressed air. Water quality analyses were performed prior to stocking. After 24 h, water quality analyses were again conducted and all prawns were removed, designated as alive or dead, weighed, and counted. After 24 It of simulated transport, three-way analysis of variance indicated no significant interactions (P > 0.05) between the main effects of density, substrate, or salinity for prawn survival or water quality. When the main effects were analyzed separately, survival was significantly influenced by density. Survival was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in the high-density treatment (30 g/L: 89% survival) than in the medium- (20-g/L) and low-density (10-g/L) treatments, which were not significantly different (P > 0.05) and averaged 95% survival overall. Total ammonia nitrogen and un-ionized ammonia nitrogen concentrations significantly increased (P < 0.05) as biomass density increased. The addition of salt to the transport water did not significantly affect survival (P > 0.05) but did result in a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in both pH and un-ionized ammonia nitrogen. Added substrate had no significant (P > 0.05) impact on any measured variable. These data indicate that good survival can be achieved at a biomass density of 20 g/L and that increased salinity appears to reduce the buildup of toxic metabolites. The addition of substrate to the transport tank appears to provide no benefit.

Evaluation of SWAT in simulating nitrate nitrogen and atrazine fates in a watershed with tiles and potholes	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						atrazine; chemical pollution; modeling; nitrate; pesticide; pothole; subsurface drainage; SWAT; tile drains; water quality; watershed	SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE WATER; QUALITY; LOSSES; GROUNDWATER; HERBICIDES; TILLAGE; SYSTEMS; RUNOFF	We evaluated a version of the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT-M) that was modified to more accurately simulate the drainage and water flow in a landscape dominated by closed surface depressions or potholes at a watershed scale using ten years of measured nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and atrazine data in stream discharge in the Walnut Creek watershed (WCW). The model was calibrated during the period of 1992 to 1995 and validated during the period of 1996 to 2001. Stream sites in the middle and outlet of the WCW were selected to assess overall performance of the model, while one drainage district drain was used for investigating chemical loads in subsurface flows. With the introduction of an independent tile drain lag time parameter, the performance of SWAT-M for daily flow simulation was improved In comparison to our previous results, the Nash-Sutcliffe E values for the calibrated daily flow at the mid-watershed and outlet simulated by the enhanced SWAT model rose from 0.55 to 0.69 and from 0.51 to 0.63, respectively. Of special note, the E value for calibrated flow rose from -0.23 to 0.40 for the drainage district drain, which was dominated by tile and subsurface flow. Both the predicted corn yields and N uptake by corn were very similar to the measured data. The predicted yield and N uptake by soybean were relatively lower than the measured values. The monthly NO3-N loads in stream discharges at the center and outlet of the Walnut Creek watershed were accurately predicted with good Nash-Sutcliffe E values of 0.91/0.80 and 0.85/0.67 in calibration/validation, respectively. Nevertheless, the model's simulation of the daily NO3-N loads was not as good as the monthly simulation. The good agreement between the simulated and measured monthly NO3-N loads from the drainage district site leads us to conclude that SWAT can reasonably simulate tile flow from pothole-dominated landscapes, although the model needs to be improved in the simulation of daily subsurface NO3-N fluxes. The enhanced SWAT-M model simulated the NO3-N loads in a watershed with intensive tile drainage systems much more accurately than the original SWAT2000 version. A second pesticide degradation half-life in soil was added for SWAT-M, which greatly improved the model performance for predicting atrazine losses from the watershed. Overall, SWAT-M is capable of simulating atrazine loads in the stream discharge of the WCW and is a much-improved tool over SWAT2000 for predicting both daily and monthly atrazine losses in nearly level, tile-drained watersheds.

Sediment and nutrient modeling for TMDL development and implementation	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Review						BMP; hydrology; loading; modeling; nutrients; receiving water; sediment; TMDL; water quality; watershed	NONPOINT-SOURCE POLLUTION; SMALL AGRICULTURAL WATERSHEDS; NITRATE-NITROGEN; ORGANIC-MATTER; FIXED AMMONIUM; PHOSPHORUS; SOIL; RELEASE; SWAT; TRANSPORT	At present, there are over 34,000 impaired waters and over 58,000 associated impairments officially listed in the U.S. Nutrients and sediment are two of the most common pollutants included in the list. States are required to identify and list those waters within their boundaries that are not meeting standards, to prioritize them, and to develop Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for the pollutants of concern. Models are used to support development of TMDLs, typically to estimate source loading inputs, evaluate receiving water quality, and determine source load allocations so that receiving water quality standards are met. Numerous models are available today, and selection of the most suitable model for a specific TMDL project can be daunting. This article presents a critical review of models simulating sediment and nutrients in watersheds and receiving waters that have potential for use with TMDL development and implementation. The water quality models discussed, especially those with sediment and/or nutrient components, include loading models (GWLF and PLOAD), receiving water models (AQUATOX, BATHTUB, CE-QUAL-W2, QUAL2E, and QUAL2K), and watershed models having both loading and receiving components (AGNPS, AnnAGNPS, CASC2D/GSSHA, DWSM, HSPF, KINEROS2, LSPC, MIKE SHE, and SWAT). Additional models mentioned include another receiving water quality model (WASP), watershed models (ANSWERS storm event, ANSWERS continuous, PRMS storm event, SWMM, and WEPP), and BMP models (APEX, REMM, and VFSMOD). Model sources, structures, and procedures for simulating hydrology, sediment, and nutrients are briefly described for the reviewed models along with an assessment of their strengths, limitations, robustness, and potentials for using in sediment and/or nutrient TMDLs. Applications of AGNPS, APEX, BATHTUB, CE-QUAL-W2, GWLF, and SWAT in TMDL developments are presented. Applications of some of the other models (DWSM, GSSHA, and KINEROS2) relevant to TMDL studies are also presented The models proved to be useful; however, they require a learning process. Simple models are easy to use but have limitations; comprehensive models are labor and data intensive but offer extensive analysis tools. Finally, recommendations are offered for advancing the sediment and nutrient modeling technologies as applied to TMDL development and implementation. Advances could be made towards: making the best use of existing models, enhancing the existing models, combining strengths of existing models, developing new models or supplemental components with physically based robust routines, numerous field applications, sensitivity analyses, full documentation, and rigorous education and training.

J	McDowell, RW				McDowell, R. W.			Contaminant losses in overland flow from cattle, deer and sheep dung	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION			English	Article						E. coli; phosphorus; ammonium; nitrate; sediment; risk	NEW-ZEALAND; GRAZING ANIMALS; PHOSPHORUS; FECES; PASTURE; RELEASE; SEDIMENT; NITROGEN; SEASON	The loss of contaminants (phosphorus, nitrogen, sediment and faecal bacteria) in overland flow represents a risk to surface water quality. This study examined the loss of contaminants in overland flow after application of cattle, deer and sheep dung at an equivalent stocking rate (15 su ha(-1)) to field plots. After 1, 3, 7, 12, 19 and 30 days three replicate intact samples of the control and each dung treatment were excavated using a cutting blade (100 cm long x 20 cm wide x 10 cm deep), placed into boxes and simulated rainfall used to generate flow. Data indicated that P fractions, NH4+-N, suspended sediment (SS) and E. coli concentrations generally decreased with time since application due to chemical and physical breakdown of dung. The exceptions were E. coli from sheep dung (relatively constant at 5.25 log(10) cfu 100mL(-1)) and NO3--N for all dung (constant between 0.5 and 1.0 mg NO3--N L-1). Integrating data with time and expressing this relative to current limits for lowland surface water quality gave an estimate of the potential risk posed by dung released into overland flow during a grazing period of 30 d. This showed that the greatest risk was for E. coli > dissolved reactive P > total P > NH4+-N, while NO3--N and SS risk was negligible. However, since most risk was accounted for by the first few days after deposition when dung was wet, risk could be minimised by not grazing on areas likely to produce overland flow (e. g., wet soils).

As a suitable process for the utilization of DNPAOs in BNR, an anaerobic/oxic/anoxic granular sludge (AOAGS) process was proposed in this study. in spite of performing aeration for nitrifying bacteria, the AOAGS process can create anaerobic/anoxic conditions suitable for the cultivation of DNPAOs because anoxic zones exist inside the granular sludge in the oxic phase. Thus, DNPAOs can coexist with nitrifying bacteria in a single reactor. In addition, the usability of DNPAOs in the reactor can be improved by adding the anoxic phase after the oxic phase. These characteristics enable the AOAGS process to attain effective removal of both nitrogen and phosphorus. When acetate-based synthetic wastewater (COD: 600 mg/L, NH4-N: 60 mg/L, PO4-P: 10mg/L) was supplied to a laboratory-scale sequencing batch reactor under the operation of anaerobic/oxic/anoxic cycles, granular sludge with a diameter of 500 Pin was successfully formed within 1 month. Although the removal of both nitrogen and phosphorus was almost complete at the end of the oxic phase, a short anoxic period subsequent to the oxic phase was necessary for further removal of nitrogen and phosphorus. As a result, effluent concentrations of NH4-N, NOx-N and PO4-P were always lower than 1 mg/L. It was found that penetration depth of oxygen inside the granular sludge was approximately 100 mu m by microsensor measurements. in addition, from the microbiological analysis by fluorescence in situ hybridization, existence depth of polyphosphate-accumulating organisms was further than the maximum oxygen penetration depth. The water quality data, oxygen profiles and microbial community structure demonstrated that DNPAOs inside the granular sludge may be responsible for denitrification in the oxic phase, which enables effective nutrient removal in the AOAGS process.

No clear effects of decreasing non-point loading (atmospheric deposition, agriculture, forestry) are found, however, and nitrate concentrations are increasing in some rivers. The aim of this study was to determine the origin and timing of inorganic nitrogen loading to the Simojoki using the dynamic, semi-distributed INCA-N model. The simulation results showed that, at the river outlet, only about half of the inorganic nitrogen load originated from anthropogenic sources. The inorganic nitrogen load largely depended on runoff and half of the annual load was centred around the snowmelt period in April-May. There was a risk of increasing nitrogen load due to changes in agricultural land use. Water protection measures at all diffuse sources could decrease the anthropogenic part of the inorganic N load to the sea, but individual measures would only result in small reductions.

Therefore, methods to reduce the number of parameters via sensitivity analysis are important for the efficient use of these models. This paper describes a novel sampling strategy that is a combination of latin-hypercube and one-factor-at-a-time sampling that allows a global sensitivity analysis for a long list of parameters with only a limited number of model runs. The method is illustrated with an application of the water flow and water quality parameters of the distributed water quality program SWAT, considering flow, suspended sediment, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, nitrate and ammonia outputs at several locations in the Upper North Bosque River catchment in Texas and the Sandusky River catchment in Ohio. The application indicates that the methodology works successfully. The results also show that hydrologic parameters are dominant in controlling water quality predictions. Finally, the sensitivity results are not transferable between basins and thus the analysis needs to be conducted separately for each study catchment. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Bohme, M				Boehme, Michael			Distribution of water quality parameters in two cross-sections of the river Elbe measured with high local, temporal, and analytic resolution	ACTA HYDROCHIMICA ET HYDROBIOLOGICA			English	Article						transverse mixing; groyne field; phytoplankton; sedimentation; dead zone model	FLOW; PHYTOPLANKTON; MODEL	The river Elbe is a large eutrophic lowland river with high primary production and high phytoplankton biomass in the growing season. The objective of the study was to gain basic knowledge of the role of dead zones for phytoplankton distribution and the oxygen balance of the river Elbe. At two sampling stations water temperature, oxygen concentration, conductivity, pH value, turbidity, and chlorophyll fluorescence were measured with high precision to learn about the distribution of these parameters across the cross-sections. The structures indicate differences in the intensity of physical and biological processes between the shallow waters near the shores, which are characterized by groyne fields, and the deep bulk flow. The conductivity clearly shows the high transverse mixing intensity in the groyne fields in contrast to the bulk flow. Groyne fields and the first, the groyne head near margin lamella of the bulk flow can be regarded as a unit. Groyne field results indicate higher primary production of phytoplankton, oxygen release, and higher pH. The turbidity of water entering the groyne fields decreases rapidly because of sedimentation within a short time. The groyne head lamella of the bulk now sometimes shows higher chlorophyll fluorescence than the central lamella of the bulk flow and the water of the groyne field. The processes which contribute to the observed distribution are discussed, but could not yet be quantified. A modification of the dead zone model is proposed.

J	Lyssenko, C; Wheaton, F				Lyssenko, Catherine; Wheaton, Fred			Impact of rapid impulse operating disturbances on ammonia removal by trickling and submerged-upflow biofilters for intensive recirculating aquaculture	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						biofilter; nitrification; wastewater; aquaculture; nitrifying bacteria; ammonia; impulse shock	NITROGEN REMOVAL; AERATED BIOFILTER; WATER-TREATMENT; NITRIFICATION; SYSTEM; DENITRIFICATION; KINETICS; PERFORMANCE; FILTERS; LOAD	Biofilters are regularly used in aquaculture production systems to remove ammonia and nitrite and are the only economically feasible ammonia removal devices in saltwater systems. Six identical 5.23 L biofilters, three trickling and three submerged-upflow filters, were operated at predetermined water quality conditions (pH 7.5, temperature 25 degrees C, salinity 5 ppt, TAN 1 mg/L), and then perturbed to simulate a number of possible operating disturbances, e.g. increased fish load, flushing of culture tanks, closing off of valves. Each disturbance was a controlled impulse change in ammonia concentration, temperature, pH or salinity. The maximum water quality ranges were pH 6-9, TAN 0.5-4.0 mg/L, temperature 15-35 degrees C, and salinity 0-10 ppt. After each disturbance, the water quality was immediately returned to the predetermined (baseline) values. The ammonia removal across the filters was monitored during the disturbance and the recovery period for loss and subsequent restoration of biofilter removal efficiency. Baseline nitrification rates resumed within 1-2 h after cessation of the shock. Some impulse shocks were temporarily detrimental to both filter types-especially low pH (-29% efficiency), low salinity (-13% to -18% efficiency), and low temperature (-11% to -13% efficiency). Raising the temperature (+9% to +12% efficiency) and TAN concentration (+0.30 to +0.36 mg/L of filter additional TAN removal) appears to be beneficial to the biofilter. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Robson, BJ; Webster, IT				Robson, BJ; Webster, IT			Representing the effects of subgrid-scale variations in bathymetry on light and primary production	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						primary production; subgrid-scale effects; box models; analytical model; water quality	WATER-QUALITY; MODEL; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; ECOSYSTEM	Rates of production by primary producers in aquatic ecosystems are strongly affected by light. Traditional models of phytoplankton and other primary producers assume a single, uniform depth and hence uniform light conditions across each grid cell or model box. This introduces an error when the depth of the bed varies significantly within a cell. Accuracy can be improved by using higher-resolution models to allow production across a greater range of depths to be simulated, however, this comes at a considerable cost in terms of model complexity and CPU times. For models with many state variables simulating large domains or long periods of time, this added computational cost may prohibit detailed sensitivity analysis or parameter estimation techniques. Here, a semi-analytical approach to modelling light limitation in aquatic systems is developed and compared with both coarse-resolution and high-resolution models in a simple case study. The model is applied to simulations of both phytoplankton and microphytobenthos in well-mixed, nutrient-replete systems. It is demonstrated that the semi-analytical approach gives results that closely match those of the higher-resolution model, but at a much lower computational cost. In an example phytoplankton model presented here with bathymetry varying by 150% of the mean depth, a single-box model produces a 14% error in the predicted change in phytoplankton concentration over 10 days, while the semi-analytical model reduces this error to only 0.8%.

The modelling effort was supported with data collected in the field for a 2-year period for both reservoirs. Spatial and temporal distributions of temperature in the water column of the two reservoirs were well reproduced by the hydrodynamic model. Model calculated concentrations of key water quality constituents such as nutrients, dissolved oxygen, and algal biomass matched the measured values closely in both reservoirs. Most importantly, vertical stratification of temperature and dissolved oxygen in the Tseng-Wen Reservoir was mimicked by the model throughout this 2-year period. The calibrated model was then used to simulate water quality response to various nutrient reduction scenarios. Model results reveal that a 30-55% reduction of the phosphorus loads will upgrade the existing eutrophic/mesotrophic to oligotrophic conditions in the Te-Chi Reservoir. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The main cause of the degradation of the water quality in the DSL is eutrophication. The euphotic layers of these lakes are trophically different, ranging from the oligo-mesotrophy of lakes Maggiore and Garda to the meso-eutrophy of lakes Iseo and Lugano. The trophic status as estimated by using total phosphorus and chlorophyll a has provided consistent results in agreement with the models proposed by OECD (1982. Eutrophication of Waters. Monitoring, Assessment and Control, OECD, Paris). Though related with chlorophyll a and TP, the Secchi disk depths have significantly underestimated the trophic status of the DSL. Two trophic indices using the algal orders (PTIorders) and species (PTIspecies) were drawn up on the basis of the distribution of phytoplankton along a trophic gradient defined by the application of multivariate methods; the scores emerging from these indices were used to make a definitive ecological classification of water bodies on a scale from 1 to 5, in accordance with the Water Framework Directive. A third index (PTIOE) was computed as the ratio between the annual mean values of the cumulative biovolumes of two groups of algal orders with opposite trophic characteristics. The three PTI indices were highly correlated, providing a consistent classification of the water bodies. The indices proposed in this work were specifically adopted for use in the DSL. However, the criteria for their implementation constitute a robust and impartial tool for assessing similar indices in other lake typologies and for evaluating the degree of specificity of the trophic indicator values assigned to the single phytoplankton orders and species.

Water quality trends in a coastal lagoon impacted by non-point source pollution after implementation of protective measures	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						coastal lagoon; eutrophication; trophic state index; nutrient elimination; non-point source pollution	MARINE ECOSYSTEMS; FRESH-WATER; LAKE; SHALLOW; EUTROPHICATION; CHLOROPHYLL; LIMITATION; STATE	Water quality data from two different monitoring periods are used to evaluate the trophic state and effectiveness of various protective measures on the restoration of a eutrophic, coastal Mediterranean lagoon. Main protective measures included elimination of municipal/industrial raw wastewater discharges in the rivers outflowing to the lagoon, sediment/erosion control practices in the lagoon's drainage basin (i.e., construction of sediment/debris dams and grade control structures, reforestation and ban on livestock grazing), and reduction of fertilizer application quantities as a result of changes in crops. Water quality data include, among others, chlorophyll a, dissolved oxygen and nutrient concentrations, various physicochemical parameters, and transparency, measured during two monitoring periods, i.e., before (1983-84) and after (1998-99) implementation of protective measures. Rainfall depth for the two time periods was also available. Empirical equations were developed, from statistical analyses of the data, relating the water quality parameters during the two monitoring periods. These models help identify water quality trends. Based on the analyses, it seems that measures were effective in reducing sediments transported into the lagoon. However, the lagoon remains eutrophic to hypereutrophic, mostly due to phosphorus released in the water column from bottom sediments. Therefore, future restoration efforts should be directed towards the management of bottom sediments.

Nearly 35.4 Tg N was input from different sources, with output from harvested crops of about 21.2 Tg N. Soil surface N balance for agricultural lands showed a surplus of about 14.4 Tg. Livestock manure constituted 44% of total inputs, followed by 32.5% from inorganic fertilizer, 11.9% from atmospheric deposition and 11.6% from N fixation. Though the N balance was negative in some states, due to aggregation of states in agroecological regions, all regions showed surplus N loads, with a range of about 19-110 kg/ha. The lowest loads were found for AEZ 17 in the Eastern Himalaya, with 19 kg/ha surplus, and the highest surplus N load in AEZ 7 with 111 kg/ha in Deccan plateau and the Eastern Ghats. Temporal trends in fertilizer consumption from 1950-2000 for India suggested a massive increase of similar to 47-fold, whereas production of major crops, rice, wheat and maize, increased nearly similar to 4.0-, 10- and 6-fold, respectively. Fertilizer consumption patterns were highly concentrated in Tamilnadu (204.6 kg/ha), Haryana (132.0 kg/ha) and Punjab (148.6 kg/ha). The paper addresses the role of agricultural intensification and its implications for water quality in agroecological regions of India.

Environmental and economic analysis of switchgrass production for water quality improvement in northeast Kansas	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						SWAT model; switchgrass production; economic analysis; commodity crops; water quality; sediment yield; surface runoff; soil erosion	SEDIMENT; MODEL	The primary objectives of this research were to determine SWAT model predicted reductions in four water quality indicators (sediment yield, surface runoff, nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) in surface runoff, and edge-of-field erosion) associated with producing switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) on cropland in the Delaware basin in northeast Kansas, and evaluate switchgrass break-even prices. The magnitude of potential switchgrass water quality payments based on using switchgrass as an alternative energy source was also estimated. SWAT model simulations showed that between 527,000 and 1.27 million metric tons (Mg) of switchgrass could be produced annually across the basin depending upon nitrogen (N) fertilizer application levels (0-224 kg N ha(-1)). The predicted reductions in sediment yield, surface runoff, NO3-N in surface runoff, and edge-of-field erosion as a result of switchgrass plantings were 99, 55, 34, and 98%, respectively. The average annual cost per hectare for switchgrass ranged from about $190 with no N applied to around $345 at 224 kg N ha(-1) applied. Edge-of-field break-even price per Mg ranged from around $41 with no N applied to slightly less than $25 at 224 kg N ha(-1) applied. A majority of the switchgrass produced had an edge-of-field break-even price of $30 Mg-1 or less. Savings of at least 50% in each of the four water quality indicators could be attained for an edge-of-field break-even price of $22-$27.49 Mg-1. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Like phytoplankton, actively growing macroalgae release N to the water column; yet little is known about the quantity or nature of this release. Using N-15 labeling in laboratory and field experiments, we estimated the quantity of N released relative to assimilation and gross uptake by Gracilaria vermiculophylla (Ohmi) Papenfuss (Rhodophyta, Gracilariales), a non-native macroalgae. Field experiments were carried out in Hog Island Bay, a shallow back-barrier lagoon on the Virginia coast where G. vermiculophylla makes up 85%-90% of the biomass. There was good agreement between laboratory and field measurements of N uptake and release. Daily N assimilation in field experiments (32.3 +/- 7.2 mu mol N.g dw(-1).d(-1)) was correlated with seasonal and local N availability. The average rate of N release across all sites and dates (65.8 +/- 11.6 mu mol N.g dw(-1).d(-1)) was 67% of gross daily uptake, and also varied among sites and seasons (range=33%-99%). Release was highest when growth rates and nutrient availability were low, possibly due to senescence during these periods. During summer biomass peaks, estimated N release from macroalgal mats was as high as 17 mmol N.m(-2).d(-1). Our results suggest that most estimates of macroalgal N uptake severely underestimate gross N uptake and that N is taken up, transformed, and released to the water column on short time scales (minutes-hours).

Estimating TMDL background suspended sediment loading to great lakes tributaries from existing data	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						total maximum daily load (TMDL); geospatial analysis; land use; land cover; sediment transport; surface water; water quality	RIVER; PHOSPHORUS	The total maximum daily load (TMDL) for suspended sediment is the maximum quantity of suspended sediment that can enter a waterway without affecting the beneficial uses of the waterway. It is calculated as the sum of permissible allotments of point sources of suspended sediment, permissible allotments of nonpoint sources of suspended sediment, background (natural) loading of suspended sediment, and a margin of safety. The goal of this project was to develop methods for estimating background levels of sediment loads in tributaries of the Great Lakes. Such quantification is key to determining permissible TMDL in waters that do not meet water quality standards under the Clean Water Act of 1972. Suspended sediment loading for 46 rivers was estimated from data collected at U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gages. Land use and physiographic attributes were estimated for these gaged basins with a geographic information system (GIS). Basin attributes and sediment yield data are the basis for examining two approaches to estimating background suspended sediment loads. One method, based upon envelope curves of sediment yield and drainage area, will be shown to have considerable merit. A second method, based upon correlation of sediment yield to various basin attributes such as drainage area and land use, will be shown to be fraught with difficulties.

The impact of runoff generation mechanisms on the location of critical source areas	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						nonpoint source pollution; land use/land cover; runoff modeling; watershed management; TMDL; phosphorus	STREAM WATER-QUALITY; LAND-USE; PHOSPHORUS TRANSPORT; STORM RUNOFF; MODEL; BASIN; FLOW; DYNAMICS	Identifying phosphorus (P) source areas and transport pathways is a key step in decreasing P loading to natural water systems. This study compared the effects of two modeled runoff generation processes - saturation excess and infiltration excess - on total phosphorus (TP) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations in 10 catchment streams of a Catskill mountain watershed in southeastern New York. The spatial distribution of runoff from forested land and agricultural land was generated for both runoff processes; results of both distributions were consistent with Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number (SCS-CN) theory. These spatial runoff distributions were then used to simulate stream concentrations of TP and SRP through a simple equation derived from an observed relation between P concentration and land use; empirical results indicate that TP and SRP concentrations increased with increasing percentage of agricultural land. Simulated TP and SRP stream concentrations predicted for the 10 catchments were strongly affected by the assumed runoff mechanism. The modeled TP and SRP concentrations produced by saturation excess distribution averaged 31 percent higher and 42 percent higher, respectively, than those produced by the infiltration excess distribution. Misrepresenting the primary runoff mechanism could not only produce erroneous concentrations, it could fail to correctly locate critical source areas for implementation of best management practices. Thus, identification of the primary runoff mechanism is critical in selection of appropriate models in the mitigation of nonpoint source pollution. Correct representation of runoff processes is also critical in the future development of biogeochemical transport models, especially those that address nutrient fluxes.

Transport processes were obtained from the companion CH3D-WES hydrodynamic model. The model activated 18 state variables in the water column, including physical variables; phytoplankton; multiple forms of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus; dissolved oxygen; and fecal coliform. The water column was coupled to a sediment diagenesis model that computed sediment-water fluxes of dissolved oxygen, methane, ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate, based on computed inputs of particulate organic matter. The model successfully computed the annual cycles and spatial distributions of key water quality components. Nutrient loads were calculated and nutrient budgets were constructed as part of the model exercise. Load sources included river inflows, distributed loads, sewer overflows and atmospheric loading. The Sammamish River was identified as the largest source of nutrients to Lake Washington, followed by the Cedar River and other distributed sources. The majority of the nutrient load is deposited in the sediments. A lesser amount leaves via Lake Union. Our nutrient loads were 30% (nitrogen) to 60% (phosphorus) higher than the loads from the late 1970s.

Determining ecoregional reference conditions for nutrients, Secchi depth and chlorophyll a in Kansas lakes and reservoirs	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						nitrogen; phosphorus; nutrient criteria; ecoregion; eutrophication	FRESH-WATER; EUTROPHICATION; PHOSPHORUS; MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN; MARINE	Baseline environmental conditions are a critical consideration in the development of scientifically defensible aquatic nutrient criteria. We applied three methods to ecoregionally stratified data to determine reference conditions in Kansas lakes and reservoirs with respect to total phosphorus, total nitrogen, Secchi depth, and planktonic chlorophyll a (chl a). First, minimally developed lake/watershed units were identified based on existing geographical databases and visual basin surveys. Lakes and reservoirs in these watersheds were considered minimally-to-least impacted "reference" waters. Second, median nutrient, Secchi depth, and chl a values were determined for the best one-third of lakes and reservoirs and applied as indicators of reference condition (trisection). Third. a regression-based extrapolation method was applied to estimate water quality conditions in the absence of anthropogenic influences. The first method suggested no ecoregional effect on the trophic status of minimally impacted reference water bodies, whereas the other two methods indicated some significant ecoregional differences. Lack of ecoregional effect in reference bodies could indicate that differences were driven by anthropogenic influences rather than natural regional characteristics. Reference conditions. as determined by these three methods, broadly agreed for all parameters and were generally at or less than literature values for the mesotrophic-eutrophic threshold for lakes and reservoirs Worldwide. Reference values for total phosphorus were primarily less than levels commonly associated with cyanobacterial blooms. Overall, the data suggest that multiple methods can be used to determine reference condition, and that in Kansas lakes and reservoirs reference condition corresponds to mesotrophic state.

In this study, littoral paludification, its occurrence, types and main environmental determinants were studied in boreal lakes with varying size (41-560 km(2)) and total phosphorus content (4.5-35.5 mu g L-1) in Finland. The relative importance of catchment characteristics, water quality and water level regulation on paludification was analysed at the lake level (n = 20), whereas the importance of site morphology, soil quality and aquatic vegetation was analysed at the site level (n = 289). This study utilised two novel statistical methods in numerical analyses: generalised linear mixed models and variation partitioning (W). Bottom ward overgrowth was the main paludification type in the studied lakes. At the lake level, the magnitude of spring flooding and the altitude of the lake had a negative response to paludification, whereas the existence of water level regulation, cover of clay soil and total phosphorus content correlated positively to paludification. At the site level, the paludification was negatively related to slope angle, and positively to the occurrence of clay soil, Glyceria maxima (reed sweet-grass) and the abundance of eutrophy indicator species. However, a considerable amount of variation in littoral paludification both at lake and site levels was accounted for by the joint effects of predictors and may thus be causally related to two or all three groups of predictors.

Effects of shelter belts on fence-line pacing of deer and associated impacts on water and soil quality	SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						red deer; fence-line pacing; shelter belt; phosphorus; Escherichia coli; eutrophication; hydrology	PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; SOUTHLAND	Sustainable land use for deer farming requires the maintenance of good soil and water quality, which can be adversely affected by fence-line pacing. This study tested the hypothesis that the absence or presence of shelter belts (one or two) in paddocks decreases fence-line pacing and associated soil and water quality impacts. Soils near the fence line and in the rest of the paddock, in paddocks containing zero, one or two shelter belts, were sampled for bulk density and macroporosity (pores > 30 mu m diameter). Large intact samples (1 x 0.2 x 0.1 m(3)) were used to generate overland flow via rainfall simulation. The flow was tested for nutrients [phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) fractions], suspended sediment (SS), and the faecal indicator bacteria, Escherichia coli. Results showed that bulk density, void volume, SS, particulate P and total P were affected by location (fence line or rest of paddock) but, along with all other measurements except E. coli, were not affected by the number of shelter belts. Thus, the inclusion of shelter had no effect on the concentration of contaminant lost in overland flow or any soil physical or hydrological parameter, but decreased the run-off of E. coli. The lack of contrast between the location of soils can be partly attributed to the soil type (Brown, NZ soil classification, USDA Taxonomy: Typic Fragiudalf), which when compared with past studies was less erosive and lost less P into solution. Other factors may have been different management or the lesser impact of weaners compared with older hinds and stags on soil properties. Although only E. coli concentrations were decreased by the inclusion of shelter, factors such as improved production and animal welfare weigh heavily in favour of installing and maintaining shelter on deer farms. However, the environmental benefit of shelter should be tested in other farms where factors such as slope, soil, climate and farm management may increase the contrast with no shelter.

Evaluation of the RZWQM for simulating tile drainage and leached nitrate in the Georgia piedmont	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							WINTER COVER CROPS; WATER-QUALITY MODEL; SOUTHERN PIEDMONT; SOIL-WATER; NITROGEN; YIELD; MANAGEMENT; GROWTH; RYE	Models have become an important tool for evaluating the impact of agricultural management practices on water quality. We evaluated the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM version 1.3.2004.213), for simulating the drainage and NO3 leaching under conventional and notillage management practices in cotton (Gossipium hirsutum L.) production and rye (Secale cereale L.) cover cropping practices in a Cecil (kaolinitic, thermic, Typic Kanhapludult) soil in Georgia, USA. We calibrated the model for the drainage and NO3 leaching in maize (Zea mays L.) production and for cotton development and water use in a previous study based on experimental data collected from 1992 through 1993 at Watkinsville, GA. For the current study, we used an independent data set collected from 1997 through 2000. Differences in measured and simulated the drainage were 926 mm in conventional tillage and 712 mm in no-tillage treatments. Measured and simulated values of leached NO3 were different by 62 and 73 kg harespectively, for the two tillage treatments. Some of the differences in simulated drainage compared with the calibration study could be attributed to differences in simulated evapotranspiration and runoff. Comparing the simulated and calculated water balances and winter rye production of the calibration study with the current study, however, the effects of winter cover cropping practices during the 4-yr period at the study site since the model was calibrated have affected the amount of soil water available for drainage and NO3 leaching at the depth of the drains.

J	Marchetti, R; Castelli, F; Contillo, R				Marchetti, R; Castelli, F; Contillo, R			Nitrogen requirements for flue-cured tobacco	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							SOIL TEXTURE; MINERALIZATION; DYNAMICS; TILLAGE; WHEAT	Fertilizer N excesses may have negative effects on both crop and water quality. To reduce the risk of N excesses it is essential to accurately define fertilizer N rates. The estimate of the most suitable N rate is complicated by the fact that a certain amount of the N taken up by the crop during the growth season is supplied by the soil. The aim of this work was to estimate the amount of N that can become available for plant uptake during the crop growth season. The effects of five N rates (0, 20,40,60, and 80 kg N ha(-1)) on production traits of flue-cured tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) cv. K326, and on selected items of an N balance applied to the soil-plant system were studied on a loam soil, in 1998 and 1999, at Bovolone (Verona, northern Italy). The fertilizer N rate positively and significantly influenced cured-leaf yields only in 1999, whereas the time to harvest increased linearly for increasing N rates, in both years (0.25 d on average for every further kg of fertilizer N). The N balance indicated a remarkable reduction of the soil organic N stock and an increase of the soil inorganic N levels throughout the crop growth period. As these changes were both proportional to the fertilizer N rate, the occurrence of a positive priming effect was hypothesized. The formulation of N fertilizer recommendations to farmers should take into account the existence of priming effect phenomena.

The effectiveness of the nitrification process can be evaluated by nitrification kinetics. Nitrification in the bacterial film of the biofilter involves physical, chemical and biological processes that are governed by a variety of parameters such as substrate and dissolved oxygen concentrations, organic matters, temperature, pH, alkalinity, salinity and turbulence level. The impacts of these parameters upon nitfification kinetics make predicting the performance of a biofilter for a given application an engineering challenge. Knowing the performance of a biofilter is critical for both designers and managers. This paper summarizes the current knowledge on nitrification kinetics as affected by the aforementioned factors based on literature and the results from the authors' laboratories. These factors were ranked according to their significance of impact on biofilter nitrification performance. The information presented can be used as a reference for the design and operation of biofilters in recirculating aquaculture systems. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Schulz, HK; Smietana, P; Schulz, R				Schulz, Holger K.; Smietana, Przemyslaw; Schulz, Ralf			Estimating the human impact on populations of the endangered noble crayfish (Astacus astacus L.) in north-western Poland	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Astacus astacus; Anguilla anguilla; fishery; human impact; mark-recapture; Orconectes limosus; water quality		1. The Pomorskie Lakeland close to the town of Miastko shows the highest density of stocks of the noble crayfish Astacus astacus (L.) in the lowlands of north-western Poland. In summer 2002, the present statu's of this highly threatened species was analysed by means of mark and recapture trapping. 2. Nine lakes with known occurrence of A. astacus were investigated. Each lake was surveyed with regard to the crayfish population density, water quality and potential recent and historical impact of fisheries and recreation. The estimated population density was evaluated statistically with respect to a set of potential environmental variables. 3. The estimated densities of A. astacus populations varied from very abundant (6.6 adult individuals per trap per night) to absent. Two lakes were found to contain the non-indigenous crayfish Orconectes limosus (Raf.). The population density was not correlated with conductivity, pH, transparency, alkalinity, the concentration of ammonium, calcium, chloride, nitrate, nitrite, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, or with the trophic status of the lakes. A. astacus occurred in lakes ranging from mesotrophic to eutrophic. 4. The results suggest that both occurrence and density of A. astacus populations depended on criteria associated with human activities that have altered the aquatic environment. Abundance of A. astacus was negatively correlated with eel (Anguilla anguilla) stocking intensity (r = -0.88: p < 0.01) and number of yearly net catches (r = -0.66; p < 0.05) and positively correlated with distance to nearest town (r = 0.72; p < 0.05). 5. It is concluded that the introduction of O. limosus most likely resulted from fishery activities, emphasizing the need for regulations to reduce the negative impact of lake fisheries on native crayfish stocks.

Often, restoration practices focus on single problems whereas comprehensive, multidisciplinary approaches are needed to address both the symptoms and underlying causes of impairment. A comprehensive assessment of a small, urbanized watershed in west Michigan, USA was conducted to evaluate the major stressors in the system. This assessment approach for the Mona Lake watershed included analyses of land use/land cover change, water quality in both the major surface inflows and the receiving water body, and toxic inputs into a major inflow. Because these issues are common to many watersheds, we developed a conceptual model that spatially links these stressors and predicted impacts, allowing us to assess them in a comprehensive manner. Based on our results, we generated a set of recommendations targeted for specific source or problem areas. This approach can be applied to other watersheds.

The effects of various factors on ballast water treatment using crumb rubber filtration: Statistic analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference of the Association-of-Environmental-Engineering-and-Science-Professors	JUL, 2005	Clarkson Univ, Potsdam, NY	Assoc Environm Engn Sci Professors	Clarkson Univ	ballast water; crumb rubber; filtration; plankton; waste tires		Removal of turbidity, phytoplankton, and zooplankton from ballast water with waste-tire-made crumb rubber filtration was evaluated in this study. The influences of various design, operational, and water quality parameters (filter depth, media size, filtration rate, temperature, turbidity, running time, etc.) on filtration performance were investigated. Statistical approaches were used to develop empirical models, including a head loss model which partially resembles the Kozeny equation, to evaluate these factors. Regression models, validated with data from the field study, were used for predicting the influence of operational parameters on crumb rubber filtration. Sensitivity analyses of the significance of each factor were conducted. Results showed that media size played a very important role in the removal of suspended matter, while temperature, filter depth, influent turbidity, and running time did not have a significant influence. Head loss was most affected by filtration rate and media size. These results indicated that the behaviors of the crumb rubber filtration for ballast water treatment cannot be described by the theories and models for conventional granular media filtration without modification.

However, water quality is typically defined in abstract terms and management activities are rarely quantified with respect to their impact on lake water quality. Here we show by demonstration of systems for Lake Kinneret, Israel and the Naroch Lakes of Belarus how water quality can be quantified in relation to lake management activities to be a part of sustainable management.

Therefore, different methods need to be tested in order to achieve reliable assessment of lake background conditions and water quality. Sediment-based techniques provide one such tool for lake management. In this work, 10 lakes, presumed to be naturally eutrophic, were investigated with a paleolimnological short core study. The aim of the study was to examine the composition of the diatom assemblages in their natural state, estimate their change over time and assess the background nutrient levels. One sediment profile from each lake was divided into six sub-samples that were analyzed for diatoms (60 samples). Diatom-based inference models were applied to reconstruct the past total phosphorus concentration and assess the eutrophication. The results indicated that all the lakes studied had already been nutrient-rich before the impact of modem agriculture. However, diatom assemblages have changed remarkably over time and total phosphorus concentrations have generally increased, so at present only two of the study lakes are close to their natural status. This suggests that naturally eutrophic lakes will probably require management actions to fulfill the new directive requirements in the future. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sediment and phosphorus transport in irrigation furrows	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							EXTRACTABLE SOIL-PHOSPHORUS; SURFACE RUNOFF; AGRICULTURAL PHOSPHORUS; RELEASE; LOSSES; EUTROPHICATION; RAINFALL; EROSION; WATERS; DEPTH	Sediment and phosphorus (P) in agricultural runoff can impair water quality in streams, lakes, and rivers. We studied the factors affecting P transfer and transport in irrigated furrows in six freshly tilled fallow fields, 110 to 180 in long with 0.007 to 0.012 in m(-1) slopes without the interference of raindrops or sheet flow that occur during natural or simulated rain. The soil on all fields was Portneuf silt loam (coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Durinodic Xeric Haplocalcids). Flow rate, sediment concentration, and P concentrations were monitored at four, equally spaced locations in each furrow. Flow rate decreased with distance down the furrow as water infiltrated. Sediment concentration varied with distance and time with no set pattern. Total P concentrations related directly to sediment concentrations (r(2) = 0.75) because typically > 90% of the transported P was particulate P, emphasizing the need to control erosion to reduce P loss. Dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) concentrations decreased with time at a specific furrow site but increased with distance down the furrow as contact time with soil and suspended sediment increased. The DRP concentration correlated better with sediment concentration than extractable furrow soil P concentration. However, suspended sediment concentration tended to not affect DRP concentration later in the irrigation (> 2 h). These results indicate that the effects of soil P can be overshadowed by differences in flow hydraulics, suspended sediment loads, and non-equilibrium conditions.

J	Tate, KW; Atwill, ER; Bartolome, JW; Nader, G				Tate, Kenneth W.; Atwill, Edward R.; Bartolome, James W.; Nader, Glenn			Significant Escherichia coli attenuation by vegetative buffers on annual grasslands	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							CRYPTOSPORIDIUM-PARVUM OOCYSTS; CATTLE FECAL DEPOSITS; FILTER STRIPS; WATER-QUALITY; SIMULATED RAIN; CALIFORNIA; TRANSPORT; SOIL; POLLUTION; NITROGEN	A study was conducted to estimate the retention efficiency of vegetative buffers for Escherichia coli deposited on grasslands in cattle fecal deposits and subject to natural rainfall-runoff conditions. The study was conducted on annual grasslands in California's northern Sierra Nevada foothills, a region with a distinct wet-dry season Mediterranean climate. We used 48, 2.0- by 3.0-m runoff plots to examine the efficacy of 0.1-, 1.1-, and 2.1-m buffers at three land slopes (5, 20, and 35%) and four dry vegetation matter levels (225, 560, 900, and 4500 kg/ha) across 27 rainfall-runoff events during two rainfall seasons. Buffer width treatments were implemented by placement of cattle fecal material containing known loads of E. coli 0.1, 1.1, or 2.1 in upslope of the plot runoff collector. Mean total runoff to total rainfall ratio per plot ranged from 0.014:1 to 0.019:1 and reflected the high infiltration capacity of these soils. Approximately 94.8 to 99.995% of total E. coli load applied to each plot appears to be either retained in the fecal pat and/or attenuated within 0.1 in downslope of the fecal pat, irrespective of the presence of a wider vegetated buffer. Relative to a 0.1-m buffer, we found 0.3 to 3.1 log(10) reduction in E. coli discharge per additional meter of vegetative buffer across the range of residual dry vegetation matter levels, land slope, and rainfall and runoff conditions experienced during this project. Buffer efficiency was significantly reduced as runoff increased. These results support the assertion that grassland buffers are an effective method for reducing animal agricultural inputs of waterborne E. coli into surface waters.

This study evaluated the use of soil test phosphorus (STP) levels to predict dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) concentrations in runoff water from agricultural soils using laboratory rainfall simulation. The objectives of this study were to determine (i) to what extent STP concentrations can be used as a basis to predict P losses from Alberta soils and (ii) how extended rainfall simulation run times affected DIP losses. Soil samples collected from a total of 38 field sites, widely scattered throughout the southern half of Alberta, were subjected to rainfall simulation in the laboratory. The STP concentrations were determined using Miller-Axley, Norwest, Kelowna, Modified Kelowna Mehlich-III, and distilled water extraction methods. Each rainfall simulation event lasted for at least 90 rain. Runoff samples were collected in time series for the duration of each simulation, during two distinct runoff intervals: (i) for the first 30 min of continuous runoff (T-30) and (ii) for 40 min during runoff equilibrium (T-eq). For all the STP extractants and both runoff intervals, the relationship with DIP-flow-weighted mean concentration (FWMC) was linear and highly significant with r(2) values ranging from 0.74 to 0.96. However, the slopes of the resulting regression lines were, on average, 1.85 times greater for the T30 runoff interval over those computed for the T,, interval. Thus experimental methodology greatly influenced regression parameters, suggesting that more work was needed to verify these relationships under natural conditions. In addition, with many of the r(2) values greater than 0.90 there would be little, if any, benefit derived by including soil properties in regression analysis.

Most of these waters were small, unstratified, alkaline and rich in nutrients. Using weighted-averaging techniques, robust and accurate transfer functions were developed for median pH-values ranging from 3.4 to 9.3 and dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations from < 1.6 to 63 mg l(-1) (jackknifed r(2) approximate to 0.87, RMSEP < 10% of the observed range), while a less precise model was obtained for sodium (2-571 mg l(-1); jackknifed r(2) approximate to 0.69, RMSEP 9.9% of the range). Restricting the data set to circumneutral and alkaline sites (pH >= 6.5) revealed the importance of additional variables, including calcium, silica, chemical oxygen demand and potential gross oxygen production (a proxy for metabolic activity and phytoplankton abundance). Calibration models for these variables were strong enough to be useful (jackknifed r(2) 0.57-0.59, RMSEP 13.1-16.4% of the observed range), although estimations should not always be considered entirely independent. Except for the predominant pH gradient, removal of all taxa with a distribution unrelated to the variable of interest improved model performance. In general, such taxa were proportionally represented among taxa classified according to their principal habitat. Application of the present models to diatom assemblages of shallow-water sediments obtained from historical samples and, most importantly, herbarium-macrophyte specimens, will improve hindsight into regional freshwater conditions and add to base-line setting of ecological quality standards in a highly impacted region.

J	Bittencourt, S; Gobbi, EF				Bittencourt, Simone; Gobbi, Eduardo Felga			Maximum allowable phosphorus load in the Piraquara II Reservoir, a TMDL process application	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO			Portuguese	Article						water quality; water resource planning; watershed management	WATER	For the implementation and operation of the Brazilian Federal law on water resources of 1997 it is indispensable to use planning tools that take into account the effect of all activities or processes that cause or contribute to the loss of quality of a waterbody. For this purpose, the nutrient phosphorus was evaluated by the TMDL (total maximum daily load)process developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency - EPA in the drainage area of contribution to the future Piraquara II Reservoir, Piraquara River Watershed, Parana State, Brazil. The TMDL process determines the maximum amount of a pollutant load a waterbody can receive without violating the established water quality standards, and allocates loads of this pollutant between point and nonpoint sources. In the present research the TMDL methodology was used to demonstrate its usefulness in the management of water resources. Sceneries of soil use were simulated by mathematic modeling to define a total phosphorus concentration in the reservoir under the limit range for eutrophication established in the study (0.025-0. 10 mg L-1 of P). The current soil use was simulated aiming to foresee the initial condition of water quality in the waterbody. The data obtained indicate that the resulting total phosphorus concentration in the reservoir did not meet the established standard. In a second simulation with adoption of potential control measures, such as recomposed riparian areas and no-till systems, the exportated total phosphorus load from the watershed decreased. With adoption of such conservation measure the simulated water quality of the reservoir improved and attained the established standard, demonstrating the applicability of the methodology.

J	Vadas, PA; Krogstad, T; Sharpley, AN				Vadas, PA; Krogstad, T; Sharpley, AN			Modeling phosphorus transfer between labile and nonlabile soil pools: Updating the EPIC model	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL			English	Article							DISSOLVED PHOSPHORUS; RESIDUAL PHOSPHORUS; POULTRY LITTER; WATER-QUALITY; RUNOFF; PHOSPHATE; MANAGEMENT; EXTRACTABILITY; AVAILABILITY; PREDICTION	Phosphorus transfer from agricultural soils to surface waters is an important environmental issue. Commonly used computer models like EPIC have not always been appropriately updated to reflect our improved understanding of soil P transformations and transfer to runoff. Our objectives were to determine if replacing EPIC's constant sorption and desorption rate factor (0.1) with more dynamic rate factors can more accurately predict changes in soil labile P on addition to and depletion of P from soils. From published data, methods were developed to easily determine dynamic sorption and desorption rate constants from soil properties. These methods were tested with data from new soil P incubation experiments where changes in soil labile P after P addition to and depletion from nine U.S. soils were measured. Replacing constant 0.1 P sorption rate factors with dynamic factors improved prediction of soil labile P with time after P additions but more so for high-clay than low-clay soils. EPIC's constant 0.1 P desorption rate factor greatly underpredicted soil P desorption. Increasing the constant to 0.6 improved predictions, whereas dynamic P desorption rate factors most accurately predicted P desorption. Soil P simulations showed that replacing constant P sorption and desorption rate factors with dynamic ones may change dissolved P loads (kg ha(-1)) in runoff for common soil, cropping, and runoff scenarios by only 1 to 8% in the long term but by 8 to 30% in the short term. These improvements are recommended given the simplicity of making EPIC's sorption and desorption rate factors dynamic.

Cumulative uncertainty in measured streamflow and water quality data for small watersheds	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						error propagation; nonpoint-source pollution; nutrient transport; water quality monitoring	AGRICULTURAL WATERSHEDS; SAMPLE PRESERVATION; REACTIVE PHOSPHORUS; INORGANIC-PHOSPHATE; STORAGE; NITROGEN; RUNOFF; FLOW; STRATEGIES; SORPTION	The scientific community has not established an adequate understanding of the uncertainty inherent in measured water quality data, which is introduced by four procedural categories: streamflow measurement, sample collection, sample preservation/storage, and laboratory analysis. Although previous research has produced valuable information on relative differences in procedures within these categories, little information is available that compares the procedural categories or presents the cumulative uncertainty in resulting water quality data. As a result, quality control emphasis is often misdirected, and data uncertainty is typically either ignored or accounted for With an arbitrary margin of safety. Faced with the need for scientifically defensible estimates of data uncertainty to support water resource management. the objectives of this research were to: (1) compile selected published information on uncertainty related to measured streamflow and water quality data for small watersheds, (2) use a root mean square error propagation method to compare the uncertainty introduced by each procedural category, and (3) use the error propagation method to determine the cumulative probable uncertainty in measured streamflow, sediment, and nutrient data. Best case, typical, and worst case "data quality" scenarios were examined. Averaged across all constituents, the calculated cumulative probable uncertainty (+/-%) contributed under typical scenarios ranged from 6% to 19% for streamflow measurement, from 4% to 48% for sample collection, from 2% to 16% for sample preservation/storage, and from 5% to 21% for laboratory analysis. Under typical conditions, errors in storm loads ranged from 8% to 104% for dissolved nutrients, from 8% to 110% for total N and P and from 7% to 53% for TSS. Results indicated that uncertainty can increase substantially under poor measurement conditions and limited quality control effort. This research provides introductory scientific estimates of uncertainty in measured water quality data. The results and procedures presented should also assist modelers in quantifying the "quality" of calibration and evaluation data sets, determining model accuracy goals, and evaluating model performance.

Remote sensing of the water quality of shallow lakes: A mixture modelling approach to quantifying phytoplankton in water characterized by high-suspended sediment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							FRESH-WATER; CHLOROPHYLL; COLOR; TM; REFLECTANCE; ALGORITHMS; DISTRICT; BALATON; SEAWIFS; ALGAE	Remote sensing has the potential to provide truly synoptic views of water quality, in particular, the spatial distributions of phytoplankton. Whilst the spectral capabilities of satellites used in ocean colour work have improved significantly over recent years, the application of satellite remote sensing to lake water is constrained by the need for high spatial resolution image data and thus remains limited by spectral resolution capabilities. This becomes a significant problem when attempting to quantify chlorophyll a (Chl a) in waters characterized by high and heterogeneous suspended sediment concentrations (SSC). The SSC dominates the spectral reflectance, masking the spectral influence from other components in broad spectral band systems, making Chl a determination from remote sensing imagery difficult. This paper presents a linear mixture modelling approach to derive accurate estimates of Chl a from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. This approach was tested in Lake Balaton, Europe's largest shallow lake characterized by high suspended sediment and, until recently, frequent eutrophic and hypereutrophic episodes. The last significant bloom occurred in September of 2000 and a Landsat TM image was acquired for 11th September, during which ground reference data of water quality was collected. The modelled image-derived results of Chl a demonstrate an excellent correspondence (r(2) = 50.95) between the ground-based measurements of Chl a, and yield considerable detail of lake phytoplankton distributions. The September 2000 calibration was then successfully applied to a July 1994 Landsat TM image and validated with Chl a data collected coincidently within two days of the image.

The phosphorus concentration of suspended solids in water columns and in the bottom sediment during soil puddling before the transplanting of rice seedlings have been measured analytically. We have estimated the gross phosphorus loads and the economical loss of losing fertilizer from rice paddy fields in the whole Lake Biwa basin during the same period. Additionally, the discussions and conclusions made in the session 'Ecosystem approach to water monitoring and management' organized during the Third World Water Forum held in Kyoto, are introduced. The importance of sediment control in carrying out overall water quality programmes has been emphasized not only for watersheds with severe land degradation, but also for basins where the sedimentation impacts are considered rather small, and there is a need to reverse the long-term water quality trend in shallow reservoirs in international river basins, such as La Plata River basin in South America. Establishing international standards and regulations for controlling fine sediments, making an effective economic evaluation of the impacts induced by sedimentation applicable to local farmers, as well as developing an effective project focusing on treating sedimentation to improve nutrient control should be initiated on a global scale, as with the Global Environmental Facility project.

J	Giupponi, C; Vladimirova, I				Giupponi, C; Vladimirova, I			Ag-PIE: A GIS-based screening model for assessing agricultural pressures and impacts on water quality on a European scale	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						water pollution; agriculture; modelling; nitrogen; GIS; DPSIR	GROUNDWATER VULNERABILITY; POLLUTION; NITRATE; RESOURCES; POLICIES; TOOL	Diffuse pollution of water resources from agricultural sources is a major environmental issue in the European Union, and has been dealt with by specific legislation: the Nitrate Directive of 1991 and the Water Framework Directive of 2000. These attempts to provide a coordinated approach to solving environmental problems require methods and tools for spatial analysis and modelling on a continental scale, with river basins being used as spatial units. This paper presents a screening model (Ag-PIE), developed in a GIS environment, for the assessment of pressures from agricultural land use and the consequent impacts on surface and groundwater. Ag-PIE has been applied at the European scale (EU15), with focus on nitrogen pollution from chemical fertilisers and manure. The model adopts a multi-criteria evaluation procedure applied to spatial data layers which represent the variety of factors affecting the pollution process. The DPSIR (Driving forces, Pressures, State, Impact, Responses) approach is applied to provide the modelling approach with a conceptual framework and to further analyse and communicate results. Ag-PIE is ultimately aimed at providing a too] making use of state-of-the-art geographical databases to support policy-makers at the European level. The scale of reference adopted is the river basin, in particular those that extend across national boundaries. The quality of the results obtained has been assessed against existing related studies and monitoring reports and by means of sensitivity analysis. Conclusions are driven by considering the potential of Ag-PIE in devising policy support and its strengths and weaknesses in view of identifying future research needs. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Water quality parameters, including pH, temperature, conductivity, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total phosphorus, total organic carbon, chloride, and total suspended solids, were routinely measured in seven watersheds from October 2001 to September 2003. Military land use was categorized by the bare ground extent, road network, and designated military zones in each watershed as well as by soil characteristics and forest type. Natural watershed variables, area and soil texture, influenced the stream water pH and total phosphorus, respectively. The stream water total phosphorus, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total organic carbon, and total suspended solids were well predicted by at least one aspect of military management as an explanatory variable. Stream water total Kjeldahl nitrogen and total organic carbon were negatively correlated with military land extent. While the military land extent did not show significant relationships with either total phosphorus or chloride, the road network used to support military training had significant relationships with both total phosphorus and chloride.

This paper presents results of applications of artificial neural networks (ANN) and evolutionary algorithms (EA) for ordination, clustering, forecasting and rule discovery of complex limnological time-series data of two distinctively different lakes. Ten years of data of the shallow and hypertrophic Lake Kasumigaura (Japan) are utilized in comparison with 13 years of data of the deep and mesotrophic Lake Soyang (Korea). Results demonstrate the potential that: (1) recurrent supervised ANN and EA facilitate 1-week-ahead forecasting of outbreaks of harinful algae or water quality changes, (2) EA discover explanatory rule sets for timing and abundance of harinful outbreaks algal populations, and (3) non-supervised ANN provide clusters to unravel ecological relationships regarding seasons, water quality ranges and long-term environmental changes.

Source apportionment modeling of volatile organic compounds in streams	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						source apportionment; volatile organic compounds; modeling; volatilization; Henry's gas law	SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI; ACETONE; RIVER; USA; NITROGEN; WATER; FATE; CATCHMENT; TRANSPORT; SEDIMENTS	It often is of interest to understand the relative importance of the different sources contributing to the concentration c, of a contaminant in a stream; the portions related to sources 1, 2, 3, etc. are denoted c(w,1), c(w,2), c(w,3), etc. Like c(w) the fractions (alpha(1) = C-w,C-1/c(w1), alpha(2) = c(w,2/cw), alpha(3) = c(w,3)/c(w), etc. depend on location and time. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can undergo absorption from the atmosphere into stream water or loss from stream water to the atmosphere, causing complexities affecting the source apportionment (SA) of VOCs in streams. Two SA rules are elaborated. Rule 1: VOC entering a stream across the air/water interface exclusively is assigned to the atmospheric portion of cw. Rule 2: VOC loss by volatilization, flow loss to groundwater, in-stream degradation, etc. is distributed over c(w,1), c(w,2), c(w,3), etc. in proportion to their corresponding a values. How the two SA rules are applied, as well as the nature of the SA output for a given case, will depend on whether transport across the air/water interface is handled using the net flux F convention or using the individual fluxes J convention. Four hypothetical stream cases involving acetone, methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE), benzene, chloroform, and perchloroethylene (PCE) are considered. Acetone and MTBE are sufficiently water soluble from air for a domestic atmospheric source to be capable of yielding c, values approaching the common water quality guideline range of I to 10 mu g/L. For most other VOCs, such levels cause net outgassing (F > 0). When F > 0 in a given section of stream, in the net flux convention, all of the alpha(j) for the compound remain unchanged over that section while c, decreases. A characteristic time tau(d) can be calculated to predict when there will be differences between SA results obtained by the net flux convention versus the individual fluxes convention. Source apportionment modeling provides the framework necessary for comparing different strategies for mitigating contamination at points of interest along a stream.

J	Gardner, LR; Kjerfve, B; Petrecca, DM				Gardner, LR; Kjerfve, B; Petrecca, DM			Tidal fluxes of dissolved oxygen at the North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						salt marshes; dissolved oxygen; transport; salt advection; outwelling; USA; South Carolina; North Inlet	SALT-MARSH BASIN; SOUTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES; SOUTH-CAROLINA; METABOLISM; TRANSPORT; ECOSYSTEM; NUTRIENT; TRANSECT	Advective, dispersive and total dissolved oxygen (DO) fluxes from 1297 complete tidal cycles were analyzed to test the '' outwelling '' hypothesis as it pertains to DO. A 910 day time series of meteorological and water quality data (approximately 35,000 half-hourly observations) was used to assess DO fluxes and dynamics at Crab Haul Creek, a small (1.1 km(2)) tidal salt marsh basin at North Inlet, South Carolina, within the North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve. A basin storage curve, derived from water velocity measurements made across a permanent transect in the tidal creek every half hour for eight semidiurnal tidal cycles, enabled water discharges to be estimated from tide height readings in the 910 day time series. The discharges along with DO concentration measurements were used to calculate DO fluxes for each tidal cycle in the series. The long-term mean dispersive and advective DO fluxes were -0.281 g O-2 s(-1) and -0.375 g O-2 s(-1), respectively. Based on '' t '' tests both means are significantly less than zero (p < 0.02), indicating exports. Furthermore a significant correlation was found between the dispersive DO export and the tidal mean solar radiation, indicating that photosynthesis is the principal process driving the dispersive export of DO. On the other hand no significant correlations were found between the advective export of DO and solar radiation or between the dispersive fluxes of DO and salt. The absence of such correlations indicates that the advective export of DO is simply an artifact of a slight ebb sampling bias in our computation of the tidal mean discharge. On a unit area basis the average annual dispersive export of DO is 8.9 g m(-2) yr(-1) or 0.28 mol DO m(-2) yr(-1). This is a small fraction of the oxygen produced in the basin by phytoplankton (18 mol DO m(-2) yr(-1)) and its contribution to the DO resources of the receiving waters is far exceeded by the oxygen demand associated with the concurrent export of dissolved organic carbon (200-300 g m(-2) yr(-1)).

In contrast, the regeneration may also start with clear-cut plots, which often occur after calamities like wind-throw or bark beetle attack. During regeneration the forest ecosystem becomes a highly dynamic system. Nutrient losses from the soil may occur as the element turnover is affected by the reduced nutrient uptake of forest trees as well as the enhanced mineralisation and nitrification due to higher soil temperature and soil moisture. Continuous cover forestry may help to reduce these nutrient losses. In order to test this, we investigated water and element fluxes of two chronosequences. The first investigated regeneration in the shelterwood system, while the second concerned itself with regeneration on clear-cut plots. In a shelterwood-cut about 30% of the mature spruce trees are removed and young beech trees are planted. Some 10 years later a secondary felling is carried out and at age 20 of the beech regeneration the final harvest of the mature trees occurs. Thus, the studied time steps were (a) the first 5 years after the initial cut and planting, (b) 10-year-old beech regeneration after the second shelterwood cut and (c) 20-year-old beech regeneration after the final harvest. Our results indicate that nutrient losses with seepage water - especially nitrogen, calcium and magnesium - occur during the first years after the clear cut and, to a lesser extent, after secondary felling on the selective-cut plot. This may temporarily affect seepage water quality due to elevated nitrate concentrations, which reached values of more than 100 mg l(-1). In the time span between planting and an age 20 of the beech regeneration, total losses of nitrogen from the main rooting zone reach 230 kg ha(-1) after clear cut. Preliminary estimates of the total nitrogen loss in the shelterwood system range between 150 and 230 kg ha(-1) indicating either significantly lower or equal losses of nutrients.

J	Bryant, RB; Gburek, WJ; Veith, TL; Hively, WD				Bryant, RB; Gburek, WJ; Veith, TL; Hively, WD			Perspectives on the potential for hydropedology to improve watershed modeling of phosphorus loss	GEODERMA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Conference of the Soil-Science-Society-of-America	NOV 03, 2003	Denver, CO	Soil Sci Soc Amer		hydropedology; watershed modeling; curve number; hydrologic response unit	TRANSPORT	Predicting P loading to surface water bodies requires accurate partitioning of infiltration and runoff from potential source areas and portrayal of spatial landscape relationships between source areas and surface water bodies. This paper presents perspectives on the potential for hydropedology to improve watershed modeling of phosphorus (P) loss as it affects water quality. Calibrating the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and similar watershed models to the hydrograph at the watershed outlet may not reflect accurate partitioning of runoff among hydrologic response units (HRUs), and default runoff parameters for HRUs are often a poor representation of reality. Hydropedology combines knowledge and skills from the disciplines of hydrology, pedology, and soil physics to address this problem. While there are untapped data and existing knowledge within these disciplines that can be brought to bear, there is also a need for additional interdisciplinary collaboration. Issues that affect process modeling at field, farm, subcatchment, and watershed scales need to be addressed through combined knowledge of the structure of the system as related to the specific objective of better linking runoff generation from potential source areas to surface water bodies. Improved watershed modeling as applied to nutrient loss and water quality issues affords both challenges and opportunities for hydropedology if scientists are willing to bridge disciplines, data, and scales to address current limitations.

The freshwater research on which these advances are based was triggered by well-publicised blooms of cyanobacteria during the 1980s and early 1990s, particularly a 1000 km long bloom on the Darling River. In estuaries the study which greatly enhanced our understanding but simultaneously served to stimulate further research into estuarine eutrophication, the Port Phillip Bay Study, was initially designed to address perceived problems of toxicants in the Bay but provided profound insights into drivers for, and ecosystem responses to, eutrophication. Subsequent estuarine research has largely been stimulated by management questions arising from Australia's increasing coastal development for residential purposes. The research has shown that some of the beliefs extant at the time of the blooms were incorrect. For example, it is now clear that stratification and light penetration, not nutrient availability, are the triggers for blooms in the impounded rivers of southeastern Australia, although nutrient exhaustion limits the biomass of blooms. Again, nitrogen seems to play as important a role as phosphorus does in controlling the biomass of these freshwater blooms. The research has also shown that aspects of eutrophication, such as nutrient transport, are dominated by different processes in different parts of Australia. Many of the biophysical processes involved in eutrophication have now been quantified sufficiently for models to be developed of such processes as sediment-nutrient release, stratification, turbidity and algal growth in both freshwater and estuarine systems. In some cases the models are reliable enough for the knowledge gained in particular waterbodies to be applied elsewhere. Thus, there is now a firm scientific foundation for managers to rely upon when managing algal blooms. Whilst these findings have already been presented to managers and communities throughout Australia, there is still a considerable way to go before they are absorbed into their modus operandi.

J	Becker, A; Herschel, A; Wilhelm, C				Becker, A; Herschel, A; Wilhelm, C			Biological effects of incomplete destratification of hypertrophic freshwater reservoir	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						destratification; restoration; water quality; phytoplankton; cyanobacteria	CYANOBACTERIUM MICROCYSTIS; PHYTOPLANKTON; LAKE; BUOYANCY; RESTORATION; ZOOPLANKTON; MODEL	This paper describes results of partial destratification of a large reservoir with complex morphology. In order to reduce phytoplankton growth by light limitation, the upper 20 m of the water column were destratified in the Bleiloch Reservoir (Thuringia, Germany). Temperatures, phytoplankton, and zooplankton were investigated before and during aeration to determine the effects of the partial destratification on plankton. The measure induced an increase of phytoplankton dynamics. Since 1991 nuisance cyanobacteria blooms increased in the hypertrophic Bleiloch reservoir (Thuringia, Federal Republic of Germany), as light conditions improved due to a reduction of coloured wastewaters supplied by a cellulose mill. Warm inflowing water formed an upper layer, which reached the bubble plume near the dam, and was only weakly affected by the deeper mixed water body. The water column stability decreased, which caused an overturn 2-3 weeks earlier, because the hypolimnion warmed up faster. These physical effects of the destratification delayed the seasonal succession of phytoplankton. Cyanobacteria were suppressed but diatoms and chlorophytes became more abundant. Copepods maintained higher population densities throughout the summer. During artificial mixing, the algal diversity increased, not only because k-strategists selected a stratified water column, but also because episodic thermal instability enabled r- and k-strategists to co-exist in a competitive environment.

The river suffers agricultural impacts in its upper course and urban and industrial organic pollution in its lower course. Epilithic diatoms were sampled eight times from September 2000 to August 2002, at six sites. Species were identified and densities and relative abundances of populations were determined. Simultaneously, physical, chemical and microbiological variables were measured ( water temperature, conductivity, turbidity, pH, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand, ammonium, organic nitrogen, total nitrogen, ortho-phosphate, total phosphate, chloride and faecal coliforms). In order to interpret the environmental and biological variables, discriminant analysis and the TWINSPAN methods (Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis) were applied. The results indicated that the concentrations of ortho-phosphate, ammonium, total organic nitrogen, BOD5 and faecal coliforms characterized a pollution gradient along the river, where changes in the abundance or species composition were observed. Species were classified into three groups: Group A, including species more tolerant to heavy organic pollution and eutrophication, represented by Luticola goeppertiana, L. mutica, Eolimna subminuscula, Nitzschia palea and Sellaphora pupula; Group B, comprised of tolerant and widely distributed species such as Eunotia bilunaris, Frustulia crassinervia, F. saxonica, Navicula cryptocephala, N. cryptotenella, Nitzschia palea var. tenuirostris, Surirella angusta, Pinnularia microstauron and Ulnaria ulna and Group C, with less pollution tolerant species represented by Eunotia sp. and Gomphonema parvulum.

In this study the phytoplankton community model, PROTECH, was used to experiment with the effects of elevated temperatures and increased nutrient load on phytoplankton succession and productivity. The response of a phytoplankton community to combined incremental changes in these drivers was analysed, in order to elucidate the resulting ecological changes. Annual mean phytoplankton biomass increased with increases in temperature and nutrient loading, although the latter had the larger effect. The phenology of the dominant phytoplankton taxa changed with increasing water temperature; the three spring blooming species all peaked earlier in the year. The simulated summer bloom of Anabaena became earlier in the year and the Chlorella bloom later. The increased phytoplankton biomass was largely dominated by the cyanobacterium Anabaena, which was especially prevalent during the summer bloom. This resulted in a progressive loss of phytoplankton biodiversity with increasing water temperature and nutrient supply. Model experimentation showed that whilst both factors greatly affected the community, the changes to nutrient loading generally had the greater effect and that at low nutrient levels the effect of water temperature change was reduced considerably. Finally, the model predicted that cyanobacteria have the potential to dominate the phytoplankton community, with clear consequences for water quality, and that this dominance was at its greatest when high water temperatures were combined with high nutrient loads.

J	Itahashi, S; Komada, M; Takeuchi, M				Itahashi, Sunao; Komada, Michio; Takeuchi, Makoto			Methods for estimating the nitrogen load on a catchment scale	JARQ-JAPAN AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH QUARTERLY			English	Review						GIS; N outflow coefficient; pollutant load unit; potential N outflow		A Windows-based system for estimating the potential nitrogen (N) outflow in a catchment has been developed. The system includes a conversion method for administrative-based data from national scale statistics, such as the agricultural census, into a catchment-based data by utilizing the geographic information system (GIS). The system calculates N loads based on the pollutant load unit (PLU) method in a catchment and converts them to potential N outflows by introducing the outflow coefficients. For the catchments of tributaries flowing into Lake Kasumigaura in central Japan, where nonpoint sources were predominant, the N loads and the potential N outflows from 1950 to 1995 were estimated. The actual N outflows from the tributaries were also estimated using the water quality monitoring data at the outlet of the tributary catchment and meteorological data. These potential N outflows and actual N outflows were compared. Results obtained were as follows. (i) Some estimates by the present method, such as the drainage area and cultivation areas of various crops in each tributary, well agreed with those estimated by other methods and published data, indicating that this method was capable of estimating catchment-based data from the administrative-based statistics. (ii) Changes in the potential outflows during the period from 1950 to 1995 reflected the changes in livestock production and methods of waste water treatments. (iii) Comparison between the N potential outflows and the actual N outflows suggested that about 47% of the generated N load which leached down to groundwater from the soil surface flowed out and that a time-lag between two outflows appeared. Thus, the developed system offered good possibilities of realistic quantitative analyses on the contribution of non-point sources to water quality on the scale of a catchment.

J	Litwack, HS; DiLorenz, JL; Huang, P; Najarian, TO				Litwack, HS; DiLorenz, JL; Huang, P; Najarian, TO			Development of a simple phosphorus model for a large urban watershed: A case study	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						phosphorus; watershed management; urban areas; case reports; data analysis; water quality		Often, the initiation of a total maximum daily load (TMDL) program is delayed until intensive monitoring data can be collected-even in watersheds where large historical data sets exist. This paper provides a case study of a modeling effort that utilizes available historical data to fulfill an intermediate goal of a TMDL program for the Passaic River Basin. The subject model is developed to simulate total phosphorus concentrations (and loads) within the basin's effluent-dominated streams. The model is based on the assumption that the primary process controlling in-stream total phosphorus concentrations is the dilution of the cumulative upstream effluent load-which was computed on a continuous (daily) basis. Model comparisons indicate a generally good fit to long-term river-monitoring data at several key sites. Model results, and data analyses, suggest that secondary processes have a relatively minor impact on total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in this relatively large, urbanized system. This finding is consistent with a previous QUAL2E model study of the system, and consistent with the relatively conservative behavior of TP reported in many medium-to-large river systems throughout the United States. Model results are used to facilitate TMDL planning efforts for a major water supply reservoir in the basin.

J	Erlandsson, CP; Stigebrandt, A				Erlandsson, CP; Stigebrandt, A			Increased utility of the Secchi disk to assess eutrophication in coastal waters with freshwater run-off	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS			English	Article							DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; MICROBIAL PARTICLES; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; OCEANIC OPTICS; ATLANTIC-OCEAN; GULLMAR FJORD; FLUORESCENCE; TRANSPARENCY; DEGRADATION; ABSORPTION	Changed local Supply of nutrients in coastal waters can lead to changed content of phytoplankton. This influences the visibility, and thereby the water quality in the surface layers, which can be observed by e.g., the Secchi disk. However, the translation of Secchi depth observations to plankton content is complicated by the existence of light attenuating matter entering with run-off from land. To increase the utility of Secchi depth measurements to assess local eutrophication in coastal waters, a formula for calculating the Secchi depth in areas influenced by freshwater was developed. The study includes data analysis of Seechi depth, chlorophyll content, wind speed, and freshwater height estimated from salinity at two stations in the Gullmar Fjord in Sweden. The correlation coefficient between calculated and observed Secchi depths at the inner station close to the freshwater source increased from 0.63 using chlorophyll as the only dependent parameter, to 0.75 (p < 0.001) including the accumulated freshwater in the surface layer from run off, and wind speed. At the outer station close to the mouth of the fjord it increased from 0.68 to 0.70 (p < 0.001) The correlation between observed and calculated Secchi depth decreased considerably, if the restriction to observations made at sun elevations higher than about 30 degrees above the horizon was relaxed.

It is the final receptor of both municipal and industrial wastewaters from the city of Thessaloniki and of two heavily polluted rivers, Axios and Aliakmon. Nutrient enrichment and consequent eutrophication is the primary water quality issue of Thermaikos. The mathematical model WASP 6.0 was used to simulate the hydrodynamics, nutrient dynamics and phytoplakton evolution in the gulf The model is a physical-based model that compartmentalizes the water body into high dispersivity, uniform concentration compartments. It then performs mass balances oil water quantity and quality. In addition to the hydrodynamics, the model can simulate the carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous and plankton concentrations in the water body. Monthly hydrologic and water quality fluxes from 1997 to 1998, inputs to the gulf and seasonal nutrient surveys in the gulf were used to calibrate nutrient dynamics. The gulf was compartmentalized into 12 compartments, six were horizontal and two were vertical. Salinity data were used to calibrate the hydrodynamic variables of the model. Model calibration was conducted by minimizing the root mean square error between field observations and model simulation. The model was able to capture the variation of salinity and nutrient concentrations. The results showed the importance of Thessaloniki effluents to the Thessaloniki Bay and Gulf and the Axios and Aliakmon River loads to the degree of eutrophication of the entire gulf. The model can be used to assess management scenarios to improve the water quality of the gulf. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Suites of abiotic variables served as predictors for the trends/patterns in chl a concentrations. Spatial and temporal gradients of sampling stations throughout the bay were evident, with physical/chemical differences arising from hydrological/meteorological forcing and zebra mussel recruitment. Chlorophyll a concentrations displayed corresponding disparities; concentrations differed between the inner and outer bays and varied intra- and inter-annually. Trained networks reproduced the intrinsic variance and magnitude of chl a dynamics. Modeled-measured concentrations best approximated a 1:1 relationship in a hybrid network incorporating both supervised and unsupervised training whereas concentrations greater than 15 mu g/L were underestimated in networks utilizing only supervised training, likely because of inadequate training data. Variables indicative of phytoplankton nutrition, acting as proxy measurements of algal biomass, and/or corresponding to descriptors of hydrological and meteorological forcing had the greatest influence upon modeled concentrations. A conjunctive decision tree and a novel sensitivity analysis provided rule-based information and comprehensible interpretation of relationships among multiple predictor variables. From this, the "knowledge" embedded in trained networks proved extractable and usable for ecological theory generation and/or decision making within water-quality problem solving. Forecasting initiatives within the developing Great Lakes Observing System may be best served by embedding neural networks in mechanistic models to quantitatively initialize variables, qualitatively delineate conditions for projecting ecological structure, and/or estimate deviations from predictability within mechanistic simulations.

J	Lai, GY; Yu, G; Gui, F				Lai Geying; Yu Ge; Gui Feng			Preliminary study on assessment of nutrient transport in the Taihu Basin based on SWAT modeling	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES D-EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Taihu Basin; nutrients; catchment resource inputs; SWAT model; simulation	NITROGEN; RELEASE; POINT	With the Taihu Basin as a study area, using the spatially distributed and mechanism-based SWAT model, preliminary simulations of nutrient transport in the Taihu Basin during the period of 1995-2002 has been carried out. The topography, soil, meteorology and land use with industrial point pollution discharge, the loss of agricultural fertilizers, urban sewerage, and livestock drainages were all considered in the boundary conditions of the simulations. The model was calibrated and validated against water quality monitoring data from 2001 to 2002. The results show that the annual total productions of nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) into Lake Taihu are 40000t and 2000t respectively. Nutrient from the Huxi Region is a major resource for Lake Taihu. The non-point source (surface source) pollution is the main form of catchment sources of nutrients into Lake Taihu, occupied TN 53% and TP 56% respectively. TN and TP nutrients from industrial point pollution discharge are 30% and 16%, and sewerage in both forms of point source and non-point source are TN 31% and TP 47%. Both the loss of agricultural fertilizers and livestock drainages from the catchment should be paid more attention as an important nutrient source. The results also show that SWAT is an effective model for the simulation of temporally and spatially nutrient changes and for the assessment of the trends in a catchment scale.

The results show that the concentration of TSS is the most important factor impacting PAR attenuation, followed by chlorophyll a; chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) has little impact on the PAR euphotic depth. During 1993-2003, the mean yearly PAR euphotic depths of the typical lake regions ranged from 1.04 to 1.95 m with a mean value of 1.35+/-0.23 m. The PAR euphotic depth fell into 3 spatial zone types: Type I, the lowest, including the lake center and the inflows of rivers; Type II, intermediate, including Meiliang Bay, Wulihu Lake and Gonghu Bay; Type III, the greatest, including the East Lake Taihu; corresponding mean depths were approximately 1.1, 1.4, 2.0 m, respectively. The seasonal variations of euphotic depths were not quite the same in different lake regions. In the lake center, the mean values of PAR euphotic depth in summer and autumn were significantly greater than those in winter and spring; in the Meiliang Bay, winter means were significantly greater than in the other three seasons; in the East Lake Taihu, winter means were significantly less than in the other three seasons. However, no distinct seasonal change was recorded in the Wulihu Lake, Gonghu Bay and the inflows of rivers. The spectral distributions of euphotic depth present a minimal value at the blue light wave band of 400 nm, and a peak at the green light wave band of around 580 nm. In 1998 and 1999, based on the seasonal many-day continuous measurements, the PAR euphotic depths at station 2 were recorded 2.00+/-0.21, 2.52+/-0.45, 1.58+/-0.24, 2.00+/-0.15 m in spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively. The peak value of 440 nm absorbed by phytoplankton corresponded to a euphotic depth of only 0.81-1.47 m (mean 1.07+/-0.29 m), which was much lower than the mean PAR euphotic depth of 1.98+/-0.41 m.

J	Bruland, GL; Richardson, CJ				Bruland, GL; Richardson, CJ			An assessment of the phosphorus retention capacity of wetlands in the Painter Creek Watershed, Minnesota, USA	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION			English	Article						Lake Minnetonka; Minnesota; phosphorus fractionation; phosphorous sorption; water quality; watershed; wetland	FORESTED WETLANDS; FLOODPLAIN FOREST; SOIL-PHOSPHORUS; LAKE MINNETONKA; FRACTIONS; DYNAMICS; SURFACE	Lake Minnetonka, located in southeastern Minnesota, U.S.A., is currently experiencing increased eutrophication due to excessive phosphorus (P) loading in runoff from agriculture and urban areas. This phenomenon has been exacerbated by the isolation of wetlands in the surrounding watershed from the surface water drainage network. In order to determine if rerouting surface water through these wetlands would be a feasible method for reducing P inputs, we assessed the P retention capacity of wetlands in a subwatershed of Lake Minnetonka, the Painter Creek Watershed (PCW). The objectives of our study were to determine which of 15 different wetland sites in the PCW had the highest P sorption capacity, identify which soil properties best explained the variability in P sorption, and utilize P fractionation to determine the dominant form of soil P. Our results indicated that despite similar vegetation and hydrogeomorphic settings, wetlands in the PCW had considerably different P sorption capacities. Depth-averaged P sorption index (PSI) values showed considerable variability, ranging from 14.6 to 184. The Katrina Marsh, Painter Marsh, South Highway 26, and West Jennings Bay sites had the highest depth-averaged PSIs. The soil properties that best predicted PSI were soil organic matter, exchangeable calcium, and oxalate extractable iron. Phosphorus fractionation data revealed organic P to be the dominant form of soil P, indicating that organic matter accumulation is another P storage mechanism in these wetlands.

J	Kuo, JT; Wang, YY; Lung, WS				Kuo, JT; Wang, YY; Lung, WS			A hybrid neural-genetic algorithm for reservoir water quality management	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						artificial neural networks; Feitsui Reservoir; nutrient model; total phosphorus; genetic algorithms; water quality management	NETWORK; PREDICTION; MODEL; LAKE	A combined neural network and genetic algorithm (GA) was developed for water quality management of Feitsui Reservoir in Taiwan. First, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was employed to simulate the behavior of nutrient loads into the reservoir. The data from watershed loads, precipitation in the watershed, and outflow were used in the ANN model to forecast the total phosphorus concentration in the reservoir. A 6-year (1992-97) record of water quality data was used for network training, and additional data collected in 1998-2000 were used for model verification. Further, a GA was used with this ANN model to optimize the control of nutrient loads from the watershed. The GA was used as a search strategy to determine the proper reduction rates of nutrient loads from the watershed so that the objective function could be as close to the optimal value as possible. The study results indicate that the ANN model can effectively simulate the dynamics of reservoir water quality. The GA is able to identify control schemes that reduce the in-reservoir total phosphor-us concentration by as much as 60%, and water quality in the reservoir can be expected to achieve an oligotrophic (most of the time) or mesotrophic level if the watershed nutrient loads are reduced by 10-80%.

J	Saloranta, TM				Saloranta, TM			Highlighting the model code selection and application process in policy-relevant water quality modelling	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Workshop on Environmental Applications of Machine Learning (EAML)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2004	Bled, SLOVENIA			modelling; water management; benchmark criteria; MyLake	SIMULATION-MODEL; SEA; ICE	The paper illustrates and discusses some rather simple and pragmatic means to enhance the quality of model-based knowledge input for decision-making. Firstly, we apply a stepwise description of the modelling process to describe our "case story", in which we first define modelling objectives and then use the benchmark criteria approach to evaluate model codes and to select an appropriate model code to be set up, analysed, and applied to simulate the long-term (decades) phosphorus-phytoplankton interactions and thus the eutrophication problem in Lake Vansjo-Storefjorden, Norway. Results from the simulations with the MyLake model indicate that at least 50% reduction in phosphorus loads are needed in order to reach the strictest environmental goal in the long-term. We believe that by: (1) following (and documenting) the step-by-step modelling process outlined in this paper, by (2) using available (internet-based) inventories to get an overview of existing model codes, and by (3) performing and documenting the model code selection with help of the benchmark criteria approach, at least some of the barriers to model use in environmental management can be removed.

The diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana was cultured with Ag, Zn, Cu, or Ni and used as diets for adult A. tonsa over a 7-d exposure, and copepod survival and reproduction were measured throughout the exposure period. For all metals, reproduction was the most sensitive endpoint, with 20% effect concentrations (EC(20)s) corresponding to exposures of T pseudonana to 0.64, 0.3, 1.2, and 2.4 mu g/L for Ag, Zn, Cu, and Ni, respectively. The corresponding metal concentrations in the algae added to copepod test solutions (EC(20)s) were 5.44, 0.55, 22.3, and 15.3 mu g/g for Ag, Zn, Cu, and Ni, respectively. None of the applied metal concentrations influenced algal growth.

Uncertainty analysis was used to determine the impacts of uncertainty in field and network parameters of the model on the predicted outflows and nitrate-nitrogen loads at the outlet of the watershed. The model, which links DRAINMOD field hydrology and a spatially distributed routing model using a kernel function, accurately predicted the outlet flows and nitrate-nitrogen loads from a lower coastal plain watershed. Model predictions were within 1% of both measured outflows and nitrate-nitrogen loads. Uncertainty analysis indicated that uncertainty in stream velocities, decay coefficient and field exports significantly contributed to the uncertainty in the predicted outlet flows, loads and mean watershed delivery ratio.

The watershed model has been calibrated and validated using measured data available for the two main rivers. The results indicate that the mean annual nitrogen inputs into the Thau lagoon is 117 +/- 57 tons y(-1), with the two main rivers, contributing for 80% of total annual nitrogen export. The variations of outputs to the lagoon are nonetheless important from 1 year to another. Due to the local agricultural practices and a reduced in-stream natural depuration, point sources seem to be the main factor affecting the fresh water quality. The coupling with the lagoon model allowed to estimate the impact of those terrestrial inputs on the lagoon nitrogen cycling and primary productivity. Influence of river discharges makes itself felt essentially near the river outlets. The northern bordure of the lagoon is then characterised by highly variable dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations, especially during flood events, while more stable and lower concentrations were simulated in the southern part of the lagoon. Simulated chlorophyll a ranged 1-15 mu g l(-1), with maximums in March. Mean annual phytoplankton production was 364 +/- 142 gC m(-2). The simulations showed that maximum annual productions are due to macrophytes (up to 1300 gC m(-2) y(-1)), but at the whole lagoon scale, annual phytoplankton production resulted greater. From our results it also appeared that the greatest part of primary producers nitrogen requirements is satisfied by nutrient regeneration within the lagoon. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we coupled the CERES-Maize Version 3.5 crop growth model with RZWQM to provide RZWQM users with the option for selecting a more comprehensive plant growth model. In the hybrid model, RZWQM supplied CERES with daily soil water and nitrogen contents, soil temperature, and potential evapotranspiration, in addition to daily weather data. CERES-Maize supplied RZWQM with daily water and nitrogen uptake, and other plant growth variables (e.g., root distribution and leaf area index). The RZWQM-CERES hybrid model was evaluated with two well-documented experimental datasets distributed with DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) Version 3.5, which had various nitrogen and irrigation treatments. Simulation results were compared to the original DSSAT-CERES-Maize model. Both models used the same plant cultivar coefficients and the same soil parameters as distributed with DSSAT Version 3.5. The hybrid model provided similar maize prediction in terms of yield, biomass and leaf area index, as the DSSAT-CERES model when the same soil and crop parameters were used. No overall differences were found between the two models based on the paired t test, suggesting successful coupling of the two models. The hybrid model offers RZWQM users access to a rigorous new plant growth model and provides CERES-Maize users with a tool to address soil and water quality issues under different cropping systems.

Although previous studies have suggested that the relationship between STP and soluble P loss is soil-type specific [e.g. Pote, D.H., Daniel, T.C., Nichols, D.J., Sharpley, A.N., Moore, P.A., Miller, D.M., Edwards, D.R., 1999b. Relationship between phosphorus levels in three ultisols and phosphorus concentrations in runoff. J. Environ. Qual. 28,170-175; Daly, K., Mills, P., Coulter, B., McGarrigle, M., 2002. Modeling phosphorus concentrations in Irish rivers using land use, soil-type, and soil phosphorus data. J. Environ. Qual. 31, 590-599]; these conclusions were typically derived from analyses on dried soil samples. Drying soil samples has been found to substantially increase P solubility [e.g. Bartlett, R., James, B., 1980. Studying dried, stored soil samples-some pitfalls. Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 44, 721-724; Turner, B.L., Haygarth, P.M., 2001. Phosphorus solubilization in rewetted soils. Nature 411, 258]. In this study, P solubility was compared among air-dried soil samples, and samples maintained at sampled moisture content in order to minimise drying-induced changes. Water-extractable P (P-w) and P desorbed to solutions containing an iron-oxide strip (P-feo) were used to represent soil P solubility. The soils analysed included a range of soil-types from the Mask catchment in western Ireland. STP (Morgan P) and the degree of P sorption saturation (DPSS) were found to be strongly linearly related with moist soil sample P solubility (e.g. P-feo with Morgan P r(2) = 0.81, p <= 0.0001). Soil organic matter content had a significant negative influence on P solubility, and, among moist samples, peat soils contained significantly less soluble P than mineral soils per unit Morgan P content (p <= 0.0001) and per unit DPSS (p <= 0.05). A solubility factor of 0.27 was derived for peat soils, compared with mineral soils, per unit Morgan P content. This solubility factor was incorporated into a simple P desorption index (PDI). When this PDI was applied to existing Morgan P and soil-type data for the 12 Mask subcatchments of contrasting typology, the consequent subcatchment ranking was correlated weakly but significantly with average subcatchment stream P concentrations and annual molybdate-reactive P loads (r(s) = 0.54-0.64, p < 0.02 to < 0.05). Drying soil samples resulted in large increases in soil P solubility, obscured the differential peat-mineral soil-type effect, and resulted in the development of an unsuccessful PDI.

A greenhouse experiment was conducted with 11 annual bluegrass (Poa annua var. reptans Hausskn.) ecotypes from eastern Canada (Quebec and Ontario) and the USA, and three bentgrass (Agrostis spp.) species to compare N uptake and potential for N leaching. Two-month-old grasses were established for a 6-wk period in lysimeter columns simulating a golf-green profile. An unplanted root zone control was included. Water-soluble fertilizer was applied at 25 kg N ha(-1) (NH4NO3) every 14 d for 57 d. Leachate samples were collected every second day and analyzed for NO3-N and ammonium N (NH4-N) content. Dry weight and N concentration were determined on clippings, shoots, and roots. Ammonium N leaching was negligible for all grasses. Less NO3-N leaching losses occurred under bentgrasses (6-11% of applied N) than under annual bluegrasses (28-71% of applied N). Differences in NO3-N leaching were also found within annual bluegrasses; Quebec P. annua > Ontario P. annua > USA P. annua. Grasses with a greater aboveground biomass developed a larger and deeper root system and were associated with a greater N uptake (r = 0.94) and, therefore, a lower NO3-N leaching (r = -0.94). Breeding programs and management practices to improve turfgrass root development appear to be critical to reduce fertilizer N leaching under sand-based putting greens.

J	Jackson, RD; Allen-Diaz, B; Oates, LG; Tate, KW				Jackson, RD; Allen-Diaz, B; Oates, LG; Tate, KW			Spring-water nitrate increased with removal of livestock grazing in a california oak savanna	ECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						water quality; wetlands; nitrogen loss; livestock grazing; mixed effects modeling; Mediterranean ecosystems	SOIL-NITROGEN; RIPARIAN ECOSYSTEMS; CHANNEL MORPHOLOGY; ANNUAL GRASSLAND; NUTRIENT FLUXES; DRINKING-WATER; STREAM; GROUNDWATER; DYNAMICS; PLANT	We characterized spatial and temporal changes in nitrate concentrations of the leachate from annual grasslands and subsequently emergent spring-waters and tested the effect of livestock grazing removal on them. Nitrate patterns indicated that annual grassland soils are a likely N source to spring-fed wetlands, which appear to intercept and transform N along its hydrologic path from upland soils to spring-fed, headwater streams. Above-ground biomass and soil N extractions suggested that removal of livestock grazing from these wetlands impaired this function by allowing dead plant material to accumulate inhibiting plant production ( hence, plant N demand), resulting in elevated stream-water nitrate (NO3-) concentrations. Nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes indicated that grazing removal may increase the relative importance of this N-loss pathway. Microbial biomass varied with season but was not affected by grazing treatments suggesting that N2O losses were related to differences in NO3- availability rather than grazing effects on microbial community composition or their activity. Spring-fed wetlands provide important ecosystem services such as plant uptake and denitrification at transition zones between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. These N-retention and transformation functions may be enhanced through biomass harvesting by livestock.

The problem is especially acute in the Baltic Sea where cyanobacterial blooms occur every summer covering areas of more than 100 000 km(2). It has been shown that quantitative mapping of cyanobacteria during bloom conditions is possible with hyperspectral instruments. These sensors, however, cannot provide synoptic spatial coverage and high revisit times needed for near real-time monitoring of potentially harmful blooms. The aim was to estimate whether spectral resolution of multispectral sensors, which can provide needed coverage, is adequate for quantitative mapping of cyanobacteria and whether it is possible to separate potentially harmful blooms of cyanobacteria from waters dominated by algae using ocean colour satellites. The modelling results show that multispectral sensors like ALI, Landsat or MODIS are not capable of separating waters dominated by cyanobacteria from waters dominated by other algae species, as their spectral band configuration does not allow detecting absorption features caused by phycocyanin (present primarily in cyanobacteria) or any other spectral features that are characteristic to cyanobacteria only. MERIS bands 6 and 7 allow detecting phycocyanin absorption feature near 630 nm and a small peak in reflectance spectra near 650 nm characteristic to only cyanobacteria. Thus, MERIS can be used in detecting cyanobacteria if they are present in relatively high quantities. Unfortunately it is not possible to use MERIS for early warning of emerging potentially harmful blooms as the minimum biomass needed to cause features in reflectance spectra typical to cyanobacteria is higher than the biomass already considered as a bloom in the Baltic Sea.

The effects of partial forest harvests on stream chemistry have not received as much attention, even though partial cutting is a more common forestry practice than clearcutting in this region. Changes in stream water chemistry following a partial cut are reported here from a 10 ha study catchment in a northern hardwood forest in the Catskill Mountains of southern New York, and are compared to those of a nearby 48 ha reference catchment. The lower two thirds of the treatment catchment was harvested in February-April 2002 by a shelterwood method, such that 33% of the basal area of the catchment was removed. Stream NO3-, NH4+, Ca-2(+), K+, and total dissolved aluminum (Al-to) concentrations increased significantly after the harvest. Stream Ca2+, Mg2+ and NH4+ concentrations peaked 5 months after the initiation of the harvest, NO3- and K+ concentrations peaked 6 months after cutting, and Al-to concentrations peaked 1 year after cutting. Streamflow was not significantly affected by the harvest when compared to the flow of three nearby streams. Export of NO3- in stream water increased five-fold the year after the cut, and briefly exceeded atmospheric inputs of inorganic nitrogen during 4 months in the fall of 2002. Changes in stream NO3- and K+ concentrations were less than predicted by the relative basal area removed compared with those of a recent nearby clearcut. In contrast, changes in Ca-2(+), Mg-2(+) and Al-to concentrations were approximately proportional to basal area removal in these two cuts. Stream chemistry returned to values close to those of the pre-cut period and to reference values by early spring of 2003, just over a year after the initiation of the harvest, except for NO3- concentrations, which remained elevated above background 18-20 months after completion of the cut.

Variation in detritus quality and quantity can have significant effects on aquatic invertebrate food webs. Allochthonous inputs of detritus are the principal energy source for organisms in aquatic tree hole microsystems. We compared the effects of two major detritus types found in tree holes, senescent leaves (Sugar Maple and White Oak) and invertebrate carcasses (dead adult fruit flies and crickets), on several water quality characteristics of laboratory microcosms as well as on mass, survival and population performance of the dominant tree hole consumer, Ochlerotatus triseriatus (Diptera: Culicidae). To date, no study has documented the effects of animal detritus in tree hole microsystems or on resident consumers. 2. Aquatic environments receiving invertebrate carcasses had significantly greater total nitrogen, total reactive phosphorus and higher pH, than leaf-based environments. Decay rate of invertebrate carcasses was greater compared to leaf material. Consumption of O-2 by micro-organisms increased with increasing detritus amounts, but we detected no difference between detritus types. 3. Ochlerotatus triseriatus larvae grew faster in animal-based treatments, and mean mass of larvae was significantly greater when more animal detritus was used. The effect of animal-based treatments on larvae translated into higher performance for adults, which were three times heavier than counterparts from plant-based containers. Survivorship and estimated population growth rates were significantly greater for O. triseriatus reared on animal-based versus plant-based detritus. 4. We hypothesise two mechanisms for the pronounced effect of invertebrate carcasses on mosquito performance relative to that associated with leaf detritus: (i) invertebrate carcasses decompose more quickly and release nutrients more effectively into the aquatic environment; or (ii) O. triseriatus larvae may directly ingest nutrient-rich components of invertebrate carcasses. Because even relatively small animal detritus additions can have strong effects on O. triseriatus populations, studies need to be conducted to explore the overall role of animal detritus in tree holes in nature.

The responses of water quality, Such as dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, and water clarity, to nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment loads are analyzed. From the response surface, a water quality response is estimated under loading conditions beyond that of a limited set of scenarios. Response Surfaces may be used to determine the possible universe of nutrient and sediment load reductions needed to obtain a particular water quality standard and to examine the tradeoffs among nutrient and sediment load reductions that achieve the same water quality objective.

J	Panno, SV; Hackley, KC; Kelly, WR; Hwang, HH				Panno, SV; Hackley, KC; Kelly, WR; Hwang, HH			Isotopic evidence of nitrate sources and denitrification in the Mississippi River, Illinois	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							SOURCE IDENTIFICATION; STABLE-ISOTOPES; WATER-QUALITY; GROUND-WATER; NITROGEN; OXYGEN; HYPOXIA; AQUIFER; CONTAMINATION; PHOSPHORUS	Anthropogenic nitrate (NO3-) within the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River basin and discharge to the Gulf of Mexico has been linked to serious environmental problems. The sources of this NO3- have been estimated by others using mass balance methods; however, there is considerable uncertainty in these estimates. Part of the uncertainty is the degree of denitrification that the NO3- has undergone. The isotopic composition of NO3- in the Mississippi River adjacent to Illinois and tile drain (subsurface drain) discharge in agricultural areas of east-central Illinois was examined using N and O isotopes to help identify the major sources of NO3- and assess the degree of denitrification in the samples. The isotopic evidence suggests that most of the NO3- in the river is primarily derived from synthetic fertilizers and soil organic N, which is consistent with published estimates of N inputs to the Mississippi River. The 1:2 relationship between delta O-18 and delta N-15 also indicate that, depending on sample location and season, NO3- in the river and tile drains has undergone significant denitrification, ranging from about 0 to 55%.

J	McDowell, RW				McDowell, RW			Phosphorus and sediment loss in a catchment with winter forage grazing off cropland by dairy cattle	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							OVERLAND-FLOW; NEW-ZEALAND; SURFACE WATERS; SOILS; PASTURE; QUALITY; RUNOFF; SOUTHLAND; NITROGEN; STREAMS	The loss of phosphorus and sediment to surface waters can impair their quality: It was hypothesized that the practice of winter grazing dairy cattle on cropland of moderate slope (5 - 20%) would exacerbate the loss of P and suspended sediment (SS) from land to water. In a small (4.3 ha) catchment two flumes were installed, upstream and downstream of one field (about 2 ha) that had been cropped for 2 yr and grazed in winter (June-July) by dairy cattle. Flow proportional samples were taken and measured for dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), particulate phosphorus (PP), total phosphorus (TP), and SS. During the 2002 hydrologic year (March-February) loads of SS increased per hectare downstream (1449 kg ha(-1)) compared to upstream (880 kg ha(-1)). The same increase from upstream (873 kg ha(-1)) to downstream (969 kg ha(-1)) happened in 2003. However, while in 2003 TP increased downstream by 1.64 kg ha(-1) compared to upstream (0.24 kg ha(-1)), in 2002 an increase of only 0.006 kg ha(-1) at the downstream flume occurred compared to upstream (0.98 kg ha(-1)). Investigation of P transport pathways suggested that overland flow contributed < 0.1 kg P ha(-1) to stream flow, 10 and 5% of TP load in 2002 and 2003, with the greater load in 2002 reflecting more rainfall in that year. The contribution to stream flow by subsurface flow was estimated at 0.3 kg P ha(-1). Stream bed sediments showed an increase in total P concentration in summer when no flow occurred due to the admission by the farmer of 10 cattle upstream of the cropped paddock in summer 2001 - 2002 and 20 cattle between the two flumes in 2003 to graze stream banks. This action was calculated to contribute via dung at least, the remaining P lost: about 0.5 kg Pin 2002 and 1.0 kg P in 2003. Clearly, not allowing animals to "clear-up" stream banks is a priority if good surface water quality is to be achieved. Furthermore, compared to stock access the impact of winter grazing cropland on P losses was minimal, but SS load was increased by an average of 75%.

Phosphorus budgets for Pennsylvania cropland: 1930 to 2002	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						fertilizer; manure; nutrient budgets; Pennsylvania; phosphorus		Historically phosphorus (P) was applied to cropland based on expected crop response and to correct soil nutrient deficiencies. As these deficiencies have become less common and animal production has intensified in many regions, concerns about surplus cropland P becoming a water resource pollutant have replaced historical concerns. To understand spatial and temporal changes in P surpluses, P budgets were developed for Pennsylvania cropland at approximately ten-year intervals from 1939 to 2002. The P balance, the difference between inputs to crop land (manure and fertilizer) and outputs (harvested crops), estimates the change in soil P storage plus P losses through runoff, erosion and leaching. Although the state-level P balance decreased since 1949, in 20 counties the maximum excess P occurred since 1992. Nutrient budgets, such as those developed for P in this research, can contribute to more informed strategies to reduce or prevent cropland P surpluses and thus reduce the risk to water quality.

Assessments of oxygen resources are based on DO profiles of 1 m resolution conducted hourly to weekly during April-October. Closure of an industry that operated on the lake's shore until 1986 resulted in an abrupt decrease in primary production and organic carbon deposition and marked changes in hypolimnetic and epilimnetic DO regimes. The hypolimnetic DO response was gradual, reflecting the influence of sediment feedback. The onset of complete hypolimnetic anoxia, which occurred by early June through the 1980s, took place approximately one month later over 1997-2002. The anoxic factor decreased significantly over the study interval, from 97 +/- 5 d to 67 +/- 2 d. Epilimnetic DO concentrations responded rapidly to the abrupt change in lake metabolism. Before closure of the industry, 41% of the April to mid-September DO observations deviated from saturation concentrations by > 30%. In the years immediately following industry closure, this degree of disequilibrium occurred in 23% of DO observations. Percent saturation values during fall turnover increased gradually during the study, from 49 +/- 2 to 65 +/- 2. DO concentrations in the lake's upper waters have been subject to substantial diet fluctuations (> 4 mg/L), with daily minima and maxima generally occurring at approximately 7:00 and 16:00, respectively. Measurements made at 11:00 and 22:00 were most likely to be representative of daily average conditions. Diel variations and sampling frequency were demonstrated to be important issues for the evaluation of status with respect to water quality standards for DO. Levels of DO in the lake's upper waters have been positively correlated with chlorophyll a concentrations (r = 0.52).

J	Chen, YJC; Wu, SC; Lee, BS; Hung, CC				Chen, YJC; Wu, SC; Lee, BS; Hung, CC			Behavior of storm-induced suspension interflow in subtropical Feitsui Reservoir, Taiwan	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							TURBIDITY CURRENTS; LAKE; SEDIMENTATION; PHOSPHORUS; UNDERFLOW; WATER	A storm-induced suspension interflow (a kind of turbidity current) in subtropical deep (113-m maximum depth) Feitsui Reservoir, Taiwan, was traced and simulated for both water quantity and quality control. To trace the path of the turbidity current, the spatial and temporal distributions of water temperature, turbidity, and concentration of total phosphorus were obtained weekly from seven sampling sites at 10-m intervals vertically. These were obtained to trace the path of the turbidity current. A hydrodynamic model Simulation agreed closely with the observations. Thermal stratification of the water column was disrupted by storms. After plunging into the reservoir, the suspension interflow resulting from higher concentrations of the Suspended solids and lower water temperature moved horizontally toward the dam at depths of 50-60 m. Adjusting the location of subsurface withdrawal accordingly reduced the intake Of Suspended solids and total phosphorus associated with the turbidity current. Some of the suspended solids in the tower layer might still affect the surface water quality through vertical mixing, especially when thermal stratification is disturbed.

J	Shigaki, F; Sharpley, A; Prochnow, LI				Shigaki, F; Sharpley, A; Prochnow, LI			Animal-based agriculture, phosphorus management and water quality in Brazil: Options for the future	SCIENTIA AGRICOLA			English	Review						diffuse pollution; eutrophication; poultry production; swine production; surface runoff	SOIL TEST PHOSPHORUS; RUNOFF PHOSPHORUS; POULTRY MANURE; SURFACE RUNOFF; LOSSES; TILLAGE; CONSERVATION; SATURATION; IMPACTS; SYSTEMS	Eutrophication has become a major threat to water quality in the U.S., Europe, and Australasia. In most cases, freshwater eutrophication is accelerated by increased inputs of phosphorus (P), of which agricultural runoff is now a major contributor, due to intensification of crop and animal production systems since the early 1990s'. Once little information is available on the impacts of Brazilian agriculture in water quality, recent changes in crop and animal production systems in Brazil were evaluated in the context of probable implications of the fate of P in agriculture. Between 1993 and 2003, there was 33% increase in the number of housed animals (i.e., beef, dairy cows, swine, and poultry), most in the South Region (i.e., Parana, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina States), where 43 and 49% of Brazil's swine and poultry production is located, respectively. Although grazing-based beef production is the major animal production system in Brazil, it is an extensive system, where manure is deposited over grazed pastures; confined swine and poultry are intensive systems, producing large amounts of manure in small areas, which can be considered a manageable resource. This discussion will focus on swine and poultry farming. Based on average swine (100 kg) and poultry weights (1.3 kg), daily manure production (4.90 and 0.055 kg per swine and poultry animal-unit, respectively), and manure P content (40 and 24 g kg(-1) for swine and poultry, respectively), an estimated 2.5 million tones of P in swine and poultry manure were produced in 2003. Mostly in the South and Southeast regions of Brazil (62%), which represent only 18% of the country's land area. In the context of crop P requirements, there was 2.6 times more P produced in manure (1.08 million tones) than applied as fertilizer (0.42 million tonnes) in South Brazil in 2003. If it is assumed that fertilizer P use represents P added to meet crop needs and accounts for P sorbed by soil in unavailable forms each year, if swine and poultry manure were to replace fertilizer, there would be an annual P surplus of 0.66 million tonnes in the South region alone. These approximations and estimates highlight that, similarly to other parts of the world, there is a potential for surplus P to quickly accumulate in certain regions of Brazil. Unless measures are developed and implemented to utilize manure P, repeated annual surpluses will create an increasingly difficult problem to solve. These measures can be grouped as source and transport management. Source management attempts to decrease dietary P, use feed additives, manure treatment and composting, as well as careful management of the rate, timing, and method of manure applications. Transport management attempts to control the loss of P in runoff from soil to sensitive waters via use of conservation tillage, buffer or riparian zones, cover crops, and trapping ponds or wetlands. These measures are discussed in the contest of Brazil's climate, topography, and land use, and how successful remediation programs may be implemented at farm and watershed level.

J	Daniel, JA; Phillips, WA; Northup, BK				Daniel, JA; Phillips, WA; Northup, BK			Influence of summer management practices of grazed wheat pastures on runoff, sediment, and nutrient losses	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						legumes; livestock grazing; summer fallow; winter wheat	POTENTIAL GROUNDWATER RECHARGE; FOOTHILLS FESCUE GRASSLANDS; INFILTRATION RATES; NEW-MEXICO; WATER; TILLAGE; ALBERTA; YIELD	The agricultural economy of the southern Great Plains relies on practices that incorporate grazed winter wheat and associated summer management practices. Information exists about the impact of these practices on water quality, but data related to runoff and associated nutrient and sediment movement due to high intensity, late summer storms in the southern Great Plains are limited. This study examined runoff and runoff water quality from two winter wheat management strategies: winter wheat with summer chemical fallow (WWF) and winter wheat with summer legumes (WWSL) and two grazing treatments (grazed and ungrazed) from 1998 to 2002. Four pastures were planted in conservation winter wheat and grazed from November to May. Summer legumes were direct seeded in two of the pastures in March and grazed mid-July to September Runoff from plots (1.5 X 3 m) was quantified with a rainfall simulator, with rainfall intensities representing a late summer, short duration (15 min), high intensity (10 cm/h) summer storm. Runoff samples were analyzed for nitrate-N (NO3-N), bioavailable and water-soluble phosphorus (BAP and WSP, respectively), and sediment yield. Overall, the WWF practice had greater runoff, sediment, and nutrient losses than the WWSL strategy. Likewise, grazing produced greater runoff, sediment, and nutrient losses than ungrazed plots. The worst-case scenario was WWF pastures that incorporated winter grazing, with 71% of applied rainfall lost as runoff. The greatest losses for sediment (284 kg/ha), NO3-N (124 kg/ha), BAP (380 g/ha), and WSP (38 g/ha) were found with the grazed WWF practice. Understanding the mechanism of interaction between late summer storms and summer management practices will improve large-scale mitigation strategies to reduce erosion and enhance capture of water resources.

Simulating water quality improvements in the Upper North Bosque River watershed due to phosphorus export through turfgrass sod	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						manure; modeling; nitrogen; nonpoint-source pollution; phosphorus; sediment; SWAT; turfgrass BMP; waste application fields; water quality	MANURE PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; MANAGEMENT; MODEL	The Upper North Bosque River (UNBR) watershed is under a total maximum daily load (TMDL) mandate to reduce loading of soluble phosphorus (P) in impaired river segments. To address these problems, Texas A&M University researchers have developed a Best Management Practice (BMP) that removes excess nutrients from impaired watersheds through turfgrass sod Harvest of manure-grown sod removes a thin layer of topsoil along with any residual P in this soil layer In order to assess the impact of the turfgrass BMP on a watershed scale, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to predict water quality changes among four scenarios in the UNBR watershed. The SWAT model was modified to incorporate turfgrass harvest routines for simulation of manure and soil P export during harvest of turfgrass sod SWAT simulations of the four BMP scenarios predicted reductions of 20% to 36% for instream P loads in the UNBR depending on manure P rate and areas allotted to sod In addition, total N load was reduced on average by 31 % and sediment load declined on average 16.7% at the watershed outlet. The SWAT model predicted up to 176 kg/ha P was removed per harvest of sod top-dressed with 100 kg manure P/ha. Export increased to 258 kg/ha of P per harvest for the manure P application rate of 200 kg/ha. Depending on the implementation scenario, simulations indicated the turfgrass BMP could export between 262 and 784 metric tons of P out of the UNBR watershed every year.

Modeling long-term water quality impact of structural BMPs	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						conservation effects; phosphorus; sediment; SWAT; watershed modeling		Structural best management practices (BMPs) that reduce soil erosion and nutrient losses have been recommended and installed on agricultural land for years. A structural BMP is expected to be fully functional only for a limited period after installation, after which degradation of the BMP is likely to lead to a reduction in the water quality improvement provided by the BMP. Assessing the impact of BMPs on water quality is of widespread interest, but no standard methods exist to determine the water quality impact of structural BMPs, particularly as the impact changes through time. The objective of this study was to determine the long-term (similar to 20 year) impact of structural BMPs in two subwatersheds of Black Creek on sediment and phosphorus loads using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The BMPs were represented by modifying SWAT parameters to reflect the impact the practice has on the processes simulated within SWAT, both when practices are fully functional and as their condition deteriorates. The current condition of the BMPs was determined using field evaluation results from a previously developed BMP condition evaluation tool. Based on simulations in the two subwatersheds, BMPs in good condition reduced the average annual sediment yield by 16% to 32% and the average annual phosphorus yield by 10% to 24%. BMPs in their current condition reduced sediment yield by only 70% to 10% and phosphorus yield by 7% to 17%.

Hydrologic evaluation of The Soil and Water Assessment Tool for a large tile-drained watershed in Iowa	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						AVSWAT-X; CEAP; hydrologic modeling; SWAT; tile drains; watershed	SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE; GROUNDWATER-FLOW; NITRATE-NITROGEN; SWAT MODEL; INTEGRATION; VALIDATION; LOSSES	The presence of subsurface tile drainage systems can facilitate nutrient and pesticide transport, thereby contributing to environmental pollution. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) water quality model is designed to assess nonpoint and point source pollution and was recently modified for tile drainage. Over 25% of the nation's cropland required improved drainage. In this study, the model's ability to validate the tile drainage component is evaluated with nine years of hydrologic monitoring data collected from the South Fork watershed in Iowa, since about 80% of this watershed is tile drained. This watershed is a Conservation Effects Assessment Program benchmark watershed and typifies one of the more intensively managed agricultural areas in the Midwest. Comparison of measured and predicted values demonstrated that inclusion of the tile drainage system is imperative for obtaining a realistic watershed water balance. Two calibration/validation scenarios tested if the results differed in how the data set was divided. The optimum scenario results for the simulated monthly and daily flows had Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (ENS) values during the calibration/validation (1995-1998/1999-2004) periods of 0.9/0.7 and 0.5/0.4, respectively. The second scenario results for the simulated monthly and daily flows had ENS values during the calibration/validation (1995-2000/2001-2004) periods of 0.8/0.5 and 0.7/0.2, respectively. The optimum scenario reflects the distribution of peak rainfall events represented in both the calibration and validation periods. The year 2000, being extremely dry, negatively impacted both the calibration and validation results. Each water budget component of the model gave reasonable output, which reveals that this model can be used for the assessment of tile drainage with its associated practices. Water yield results were significantly different for the simulations with and without the tile flow component (25.1% and 16.90%, expressed as a percent of precipitation). The results suggest that the SWAT2005 version modified for tile drainage is a promising tool to evaluate streamflow in tile-drained regions when the calibration period contains streamflows representing a wide range of rainfall events.

In this statistical technique, preconceptualizations that reflect research questions or existing knowledge of system structure create the initial framework for model development, while both direct and indirect effects and measurement errors are considered. Given the interesting features of this method, it is quite surprising that the number of applications in ecology is limited, and even less common in aquatic ecosystems. This study presents two examples where structural equation modeling is used for exploring ecological structures; i.e., summer epilimnetic phytoplankton dynamics. Both eutrophic (Lake Mendota) and mesotrophic (Lake Washington) conditions were used to test an initial hypothesized model that considered the regulatory role of abiotic factors and biological interactions on lake phytoplankton dynamics and water clarity during the summer stratification period. Generally, the model gave plausible results, while a higher proportion of the observed variability was accounted for in the eutrophic environment. Most importantly, we show that structural equation modeling provided a convenient means for assessing the relative role of several ecological processes (e.g., vertical mixing, intrusions of the hypolimnetic nutrient stock, herbivory) known to determine the levels of water quality variables of management interest (e.g., water clarity, cyanobacteria). A Bayesian hierarchical methodology is also introduced to relax the classical identifiability restrictions and treat them as stochastic. Additional advantages of the Bayesian approach are the flexible incorporation of prior knowledge on parameters, the ability to get information on multimodality in marginal densities (undetectable by standard procedures), and the fact that the structural equation modeling process does not rely on asymptotic theory which is particularly important when the sample size is small (commonly experienced in environmental studies). Special emphasis is given on how this Bayesian methodological framework can be used for assessing eutrophic conditions and assisting water quality management. Structural equation modeling has several attractive features that can be particularly useful to researchers when exploring ecological patterns or disentangling complex environmental management issues.

The comparison of the measured total phosphorus with the reference level based on the morphoedaphic index, shows that the water quality could be estimated as 'moderate' in lake Peipsi and 'good' in Vortsjarv despite that the measured TP values were higher in the latter. Comparing the changes observed in different quality elements with the normative definitions for quality classes given in the Water Framework Directive yielded quality estimates from 'high'to 'moderate' for both lakes. Applying the "one-out all-out" principle according to which the ecological status is determined by the biological quality element, which shows the greatest anthropogenic disturbance, both lakes fall unequivocally into the 'moderate' category. Averaging the quality estimates for lakes Peipsi and Vortsjarv no matter whether on a quality element level or a single parameter level would indicate good status in both lakes that is close to the subjective cognitive expert opinion of the authors.

J	Merrill, AG; Benning, TL				Merrill, AG; Benning, TL			Ecosystem type differences in nitrogen process rates and controls in the riparian zone of a montane landscape	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						riparian; nitrogen cycling; watershed; groundwater quality; wetland montane; nutrient dynamics	ENZYME-ACTIVITY; GROUNDWATER NITRATE; MICROBIAL BIOMASS; ORGANIC-CARBON; DENITRIFICATION; SOILS; FOREST; DYNAMICS; CALIFORNIA; WETLAND	Nitrogen (N) inputs to the world's aquatic ecosystems have increased over the past 100 years. Riparian zones and other wetlands are known to remove N from ground and surface waters before they enter lakes and streams. However, the effect of riparian wetlands on water quality has been shown to differ dramatically among sites. Sources of landscape variation in riparian N dynamics have been poorly documented and rarely quantified. Within the Lake Tahoe Basin (LTB), we hypothesized that differences in riparian N dynamics correlate to differences in ecosystem type. To test this hypothesis, we randomly selected 20 plots, four each of five ecosystem types, along a tributary to Lake Tahoe. Throughout the snow-free season, we measured soil N transformations and groundwater chemistry in each plot. We found significant differences in denitrification potential, net mineralization, net nitrification and groundwater nutrient flux among different ecosystem types. These results suggest that classification of riparian zones into ecosystem types might be useful in predicting landscape differences in riparian water quality effects. We also tested for factors expected to directly and indirectly control riparian N process rates using data collected at each study site. Using correlation and multiple regression analysis, we found that N process rates were most highly correlated with different control factors according to ecosystem type. Differences in direct and indirect control factors among ecosystem types indicate that construction of mechanistic, landscape models of riparian processes might be most accurately done by stratifying the riparian zone into ecosystem types rather than by viewing it as a single, homogeneous part of the watershed.

The final part of the Besos River (Spain) flows inside a heavily industrialized area in greater Barcelona. Following a classical model in the 1970s, the river was canalized, theoretically to reduce the high flow impact but in practice to gain flat areas where building was easy. The result was many artificially created impervious areas which made infiltration difficult, and the invasion of the river-related high-flow zones by industrial facilities and urbanized areas. Additionally, for several decades, the Besos River was the most altered fluvial basin of Catalonia. Trying to improve the really bad conditions of that section of the river, a big conversion of part of its final section was undertaken in the 1990s. There, the low flow concrete channel was re-naturalized, bending it, and in the reclaimed bed surface an urban park and a tertiary wastewater treatment system were implemented. After treatment, the effluent directly enters the river, thus improving water quality. Water from the tertiary treatment, constructed wetlands, has the following percentage of removal if compared with the effluent of the activated sludge facility: 40% for suspended solids; 62% for COD; 20% for NH4+-N; 58% for P; and 1.1 log U/100 mL for fecal coliforms.

The possibility that similar production rates are because of utilization of different foods was investigated using exploratory techniques of multivariate analyses. Using factor analysis, trophic pathways through which food becomes available to fish were explored, and using ANOVA models, water quality, sediment quality and tilapia growth and yields were compared. Conceptual graphic models of the main ecological processes occurring in feed-driven and organically fertilized environments are presented and discussed. In both environments, autotrophic and heterotrophic pathways are important processes that result in the availability of natural foods that are utilized by the fish. Extrapolated fish yield data indicate that with equal nutrient input and stocking density, organically fertilized environments could achieve production rates similar to those in feed-driven environments. The general assumption that supplemental or complete foods are well utilized by tilapia in outdoor stagnant ponds remains challenged, and further research on tilapia feeding behaviour and food selection in feed-and organic fertilizer-driven environments is needed.

J	Lyon, SW; Lembo, AJ; Walter, MT; Steenhuis, TS				Lyon, SW; Lembo, AJ; Walter, MT; Steenhuis, TS			Defining probability of saturation with indicator kriging on hard and soft data	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES			English	Article						indicator kriging; indicator semivariogram; geostatistics; binary logistic regression; risk assessment	SOIL-MOISTURE PATTERNS; HYDROLOGICAL FLUX MEASUREMENTS; AGRICULTURAL WATERSHEDS; PHOSPHORUS TRANSPORT; DATA SET; VARIABILITY; UNCERTAINTY; AREAS; CONNECTIVITY; INFORMATION	In humid, well-vegetated areas, such as in the northeastern US, runoff is most commonly generated from relatively small portions of the landscape becoming completely saturated, however, little is known about the spatial and temporal behavior of these saturated regions. Indicator kriging provides a way to use traditional water table data to quantity probability of saturation to evaluate predicted spatial distributions of runoff generation risk, especially for the new generation of water quality models incorporating saturation excess runoff theory. When spatial measurements of a variable are transformed to binary indicators (i.e., I if above a given threshold value and 0 if below) and the resulting indicator semivariogram is modeled, indicator kriging produces the probability of the measured variable to exceed the threshold value. Indicator kriging gives quantified probability of saturation or, consistent with saturation excess runoff theory, runoff generation risk with depth to water table as the variable and the threshold set near the soil surface. The probability of saturation for a 120 in x 180 in hillslope based upon 43 measurements of depth to water table is investigated with indicator semivariograms for six storm events. The indicator semivariograms show high spatial structure in saturated regions with large antecedent rainfall conditions. The temporal structure of the data is used to generate interpolated (soft) data to supplement measured (hard) data. This improved the spatial structure of the indicator semivariograms for lower antecedent rainfall conditions. Probability of saturation was evaluated through indicator kriging incorporating soft data showing, based on this preliminary study, highly connected regions of saturation as expected for the wet season (April through May) in the Catskill Mountain region of New York State. Supplementation of hard data with soft data incorporates physical hydrology of the hillslope to capture significant patterns not available when using hard data alone for indicator kriging. With the need for water quality models incorporating appropriate runoff generation risk estimates on the rise, this manner of data will lay the groundwork for future model evaluation and development.

Rica) were studied to determine how diatoms were related to measured environmental conditions. Twenty-three sites, affected by different land use practices, were selected and monitored for 21 months. Water chemistry was characterized by moderate specific conductivity (100-300 mu S/cm), neutral to alkaline pH and moderate to high values of soluble reactive phosphor-us (10-70 mu g/L). Anthropogenic impact was reflected in lower oxygen saturation, elevated nitrogen compounds and measured sediment load. A diverse diatom flora of 212 taxa was found. Patterns in the diatom distribution in relation to environmental variables, as revealed by canonical correspondence analysis, showed that riparian shading, pH, conductivity, current velocity and turbidity were the most important measured factors in determining species composition. The relationship between conductivity and pH was sufficiently strong to develop weighted-averaging regression and calibration models. Optima and tolerances of the most common diatom taxa are presented.

In the tidal freshwater Hudson River they make up about 6% of the river bottom area. Direct sampling of water masses passing through patches of vegetation and week-long continuous monitoring of water characteristics were used to determine plant effects on dissolved oxygen and suspended sediments. Vegetated areas could have dissolved oxygen concentrations substantially higher than in the main channel and suspended sediments and turbidity were frequently higher in vegetated areas. Patches of Vallisneria americana had variable capacity to maintain super-saturated oxygen concentrations; patch size accounted for some of the variability whereas larger-scale differences in main-channel influent water also contributed. Differences in turbidity among sites were harder to account for; width of plant beds and abundance of neighboring vegetated areas contributed weakly to predictions of local turbidity. Functional heterogeneity within ecosystems is common and attempts to explain variability may require understanding different controlling factors for different functions and appreciating that factors operate at multiple scales.

J	Robertson, DM; Saad, DA; Heisey, DM				Robertson, DM; Saad, DA; Heisey, DM			A regional classification scheme for estimating reference water quality in streams using land-use-adjusted spatial regression-tree analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						classification; ecoregions; land use; nutrients; regionalization; regression tree		Various approaches are used to subdivide large areas into regions containing streams that have similar reference or background water quality and that respond similarly to different factors. For many applications, such as establishing reference conditions, it is preferable to use physical characteristics that are not affected by human activities to delineate these regions. However, most approaches, such as ecoregion classifications, rely on land use to delineate regions or have difficulties compensating for the effects of land use. Land use not only directly affects water quality, but it is often correlated with the factors used to define the regions. In this article, we describe modifications to SPARTA (spatial regression-tree analysis), a relatively new approach applied to water-quality and environmental characteristic data to delineate zones with similar factors affecting water quality. In this modified approach, land-use-adjusted (residualized) water quality and environmental characteristics are computed for each site. Regression-tree analysis is applied to the residualized data to determine the most statistically important environmental characteristics describing the distribution of a specific water-quality constituent. Geographic information for small basins throughout the study area is then used to subdivide the area into relatively homogeneous environmental water-quality zones. For each zone, commonly used approaches are subsequently used to define its reference water quality and how its water quality responds to changes in land use. SPARTA is used to delineate zones of similar reference concentrations of total phosphorus and suspended sediment throughout the upper Midwestern part of the United States.

Although these areas are small, located in the bottomlands of the headwater catchments, and scattered in the rural landscape, they strongly influence hydrology, water quality, and biodiversity over the whole catchment area. Valley bottom wetlands often are considered as controversial wetlands. Awareness of the functional role of wetlands is increasing, in parallel with their progressive disappearance in intensive farming landscapes. The need to improve tools for controlling wetland management is a primary consideration for decision makers and land users. This article proposes a method for the inventory of valley bottom wetlands. The method is based on the functional analysis of potential, existing, and efficient valley bottom wetlands (the PEEW approach). Several indicators are proposed for checking the validity of such an approach. Potential wetlands are delineated by means of a topographic index using topographic and pedoclimatic criteria computed from a Digital Elevation Model and easily accessible databases. Existing wetlands are identified from observed surface moisture, the presence of specific wetland vegetation, or soil feature criteria. Efficient wetlands are defined through a given function, such as flow or pollutant regulation or biodiversity control. An analysis of areas at the limits between potential, existing, and efficient wetlands highlights land cultivated or drained in the past, which currently represents negotiating areas in which rehabilitation and other intended management actions can be implemented.

This division is often implicit in the choice of sampling stations and in pollution abatement measures applied to different locations - it is now an explicit requirement of European Union Directive 2000/60/EC (Water Framework Directive) and recommended by United States Agencies such as EPA and NOAA. The approach considers both natural characteristics and the human dimension, by means of a stepwise methodology, which considers, on the one hand, morphology and salinity distribution, and, on the other, appropriate indicators of pressure and state. In the present application, nitrogen and phosphorus loading was used as the pressure component and chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen as indicators of state. The criteria for system division were defined based on (1) an adimensional shape factor and salinity classes for the natural component; and (2) a normalised pressure index and (ASSETS) eutrophication symptom classes for the human dimension. Water quality databases and GIS were used to develop spatial distributions for the various components, and the results were aggregated into a final water body division, using tidal excursion as a "common sense" test. The methodology was applied to three well-studied systems in Portugal, a tubular estuary (Mondego), a wide lagunal estuary (Sado) and a coastal barrier island system (Ria Formosa). Although a final definition of water bodies will usually be a policy decision, this type of approach for the division of coastal systems into management units scientifically informs the decision-making process.

A model chain (STONE) has been developed to study and predict the magnitude of the resulting ground- and surface water pollution under different environmental conditions. STONE has three main components, namely: 1) the fertiliser distribution model CLEAN; 2) the atmospheric transport and deposition model OPS; and 3) the soil and soil-water quality model ANIMO. The goal of this study was to assess the accuracy of the STONE model output by comparing model predictions with independent observations, while accounting for spatial variation and differences in spatial support. The specific STONE output considered was mineral phosphorous concentration in the top soil. Predictions from STONE are made at the block support and, specifically, for 500 X 500 in grid cells, whereas the observations are on a point support. Therefore, aggregation of the point observations or disaggregation of the STONE model predictions is needed in order to test the accuracy of the STONE model. This study used the aggregation route. Specifically, ordinary and regression block kriging were used to aggregate the point observations to the block support. Overall, there was a good correspondence between the kriged observations and the STONE predictions, with no evidence of bias in the model predictions. However, there were meaningful differences locally, which was partly attributed to the smoothing of the kriging interpolator. Closer inspection revealed that not all of the differences could be attributed to measurement errors in the phosphorous observations and interpolation errors in the kriged phosphorous maps. Thus, it was demonstrated that the STONE output suffers from input and/or model errors. However, quantification of these errors was restricted by the fairly large interpolation uncertainty of the kriged phosphorous observations. Nevertheless, the spatial pattern of error in the STONE predictions could be partly attributed to combinations of landuse and soil type. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Sterile Ulva sp. in Kanazawa Bay, Yokohama, Japan, was selected as model algae. The water content in the alga cells was almost the same as the previous result for Ulva lactuca. The rates of ammonia-nitrogen uptake by algae were measured under various conditions including tropical conditions, i.e., higher light flux density and temperature, to know the effects of these conditions. Sterile Ulva sp. could remove ammonia-nitrogen in culture medium effectively. The algae took up ammonia-nitrogen even under no light. Light enhanced assimilation of ammonia-nitrogen in the alga cell. The tropical condition enhanced ammonia-nitrogen uptake by the alga. The ammonia-nitrogen uptake rate decreased with an increasing ammonia-nitrogen content in the alga cell. Based on these experimental results, we studied the mechanism of ammonia-nitrogen uptake by algae in terms of a Michaelis-Menten model with an inhibitory effect. The ammonia-nitrogen uptake obeyed the Michaelis-Menten model with uncompetitive inhibition by the inhibitor working on the complex of ammonia-nitrogen and its carrier, and the ammonia-nitrogen content in an alga cell was positively related to the inhibitory effect on ammonia-nitrogen uptake. Consequently, the uptake by alga was proposed for controlling the ammonia-nitrogen content in shrimp aquaculture ponds in developing countries, and useful information for shrimp pond design was provided.

Yet, few investigations have considered the potential information that is encoded in seasonal dynamics with respect to the paleolimnological record. We used a one-year sequence of diatoms obtained from sediment traps and water samples, as well as the sedimentary diatom record covering the past ca. 1000 years in Bates Pond, Connecticut (USA), to investigate which variables influence the seasonal distribution of diatoms and how this can be used for the interpretation of the fossil record. The seasonal patterns in diatom assemblages were related to stratification and, to a lesser extent, to nitrate, silica, and phosphorus. During mixing periods in spring and autumn, both planktonic and benthic species were collected in the traps, while few lightly silicified, spindle-shaped planktonic diatoms dominated during thermal stratification in summer. Changes in fossil diatom assemblages reflected human activity in the watershed after European settlement and subsequent recovery in the 20th century. A long-term trend in diatom assemblage change initiated before European settlement was probably related to increased length of mixing periods during the Little Ice Age, indicated by the increase of taxa that presently grow during mixing periods and by application of a preliminary seasonal temperature model. We argue that the analysis of seasonal diatom dynamics in temperate lakes may provide important information for the refinement of paleolimnological interpretations. However, investigations of several lakes and years would be desirable in order to establish a more robust seasonal data set for the enhancement of paleolimnological interpretations.

This subalpine, constructed, surface flow wetland treatment system consists of two cells in series, with a design water surface area of about 0.6 ha. Water quality monitoring from October 2002 through September 2003 was conducted with autosamplers at the inflow and outflow sites during 24 sampling events, with a median duration of 53 hours, representing 42 percent of total inflow to this wetland during the year. Monitoring data indicate an improvement of 49 percent or greater in effluent concentrations of dissolved phosphorus, nitrate, orthophosphorus, and total suspended solids. On average, event mean concentrations of total phosphorus were reduced from a median 279 mu g/l at the inflow to 94 mu g/l at the outflow. Event mean concentrations of total nitrogen were reduced from a median 1,599 mu g/l at the inflow to 810 mu g/l at the outflow. Net nutrient retention for the sampling period was estimated at 3 g phosphorus (p)/m(2)/y and 13 g nitrogen (N)/m(2)/y. Almost 4,000 kg of suspended sediment was captured by this wetland system during the year.

Economic efficiency and economic impacts of the Hennepin and Hopper Lakes Restoration Project in Illinois were evaluated. The project converted 999 ha of cropland to bottomland forest, backwater lakes, and floodplain wetland habitat. Project benefits were estimated by summing the economic values of wetlands estimated in other studies. Project costs were estimated by the loss in the gross value of agricultural production from the conversion of corn and soybean acreage to wetlands. Estimated annual net benefit of wetland restoration in the project area amounted to US$1,827 per ha of restored wetland or US$1.83 million for the project area, indicating that the project is economically efficient. Impacts of the project on the regional economy were estimated (using IMPLAN) in terms of changes in total output, household income, and employment. The project is estimated to increase total output by US$2,028,576, household income by US$1,379,676, and employment by 56 persons, indicating that it has positive net economic impacts on the regional economy.

A stable statistical model that included Year and riverine nitrate + nitrite loading for the 2 months prior to the measurement of hypoxic zone size described 82% of its variation in size from 1978 to 2004. The usefulness of the term Year is consistent with the documented increase in carbon stored in sediments after the 1970s, which is when the hypoxic zone is predicted to have become it regular feature on the shelf and to have expanded westward. The increased carbon storage is anticipated to cause a sedimentary respiratory demand influencing the size of the zone, and whose temporal influence is cumulative and transcends the annual variations in nitrogen loading. The variable Year is negatively correlated with the TN:TP ratio in a way that suggests N, not P, has become more important as a factor limiting phytoplankton growth in the last 20 years. Nitrogen, in particular nitrate + nitrite, and not phosphorus, dissolved silicate, or their molar ratios, appears to be the major driving factor influencing the size of the hypoxic zone oil this shelf. This conclusion is consistent with cross-system analyses that conclude that the TN:TP ratio in the Mississippi River, currently fluctuating around 20:1, is indicative of nitrogen, not phosphorus, limitation of phytoplankton growth. Nutrient management that places stronger emphasis on reducing nitrogen loading as compared to phosphorus loading, is justified. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The research version of LEACHMN was evaluated using data from lysimeters and field experiments conducted at the University of Lome Research Farm in Togo, West Africa. The model was calibrated for the mineralization, nitrification, denitrification and volatilization rate constants with measured values of NO3-N leaching losses and maize (Zea mays L.) N uptake collected from the lysimeter experiment. The model was then tested against measured data of soil profile NO3-N distribution and maize N uptake from the field experiment and drainage water collected from the lysimeter experiment. The testing procedure involved two scenarios with increasing level of generalization for transformation rate constants (i) rate constant values for each N treatment and (ii) rate constant values averaged over N treatments. LEACHMN effectively simulated drainage water volume and rate (r(2)= 0.94 to 0.99). During the calibration efforts, the model satisfactorily simulated NO3-N leaching losses (r(2)=0.98) and accurately simulated growing season cumulative maize N uptake. The variation of the calibrated rate constants among N treatments was primarily linked to the model's incapacity to accurately simulate maize N uptake throughout the growing period. When tested using calibrated rate constants for each treatment, the model was successful in simulating soil pro. le NO3-N distribution (r(2)=0.52 to 0.94). Simulations of soil pro. le NO3-N distribution were not satisfactory (r(2)=0.03 to 0.49) when rate constants were averaged over N treatments. Improvement of the plant N uptake routine of the model is needed to increase the model's performance. Using the LEACHMN model to predict N dynamics on the Ferralsols of southern Togo appears feasible when appropriate calibrations are performed.

J	Oquist, KA; Strock, JS; Mulla, DJ				Oquist, KA; Strock, JS; Mulla, DJ			Influence of alternative and conventional management practices on soil physical and hydraulic properties	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL			English	Article							PHOSPHORUS LOSSES; TILLAGE; MANURE; QUALITY; SYSTEMS; RUNOFF	This study examined the effects of alternative and conventional farming practices on soil physical properties, including texture, organic C content, bulk density, moisture retention, and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s). There were no significant differences in soil organic C contents between the alternative and conventional management systems. Bulk density in the A horizon was 3% lower under alternative management practices (1.39 Mg m(-3)) than under conventional practices (1.43 Mg m(-3)). Saturated hydraulic conductivity was significantly higher in the A horizon under alternative management practices (45.5 cm d(-1)) than under conventional management (18.1 cm d(-1)). Differences in conductivity were greater for soils located at bottom-slope positions than soils at mid- or upper-slope positions. The b value of Campbell's moisture retention equation was significantly smaller for alternative practices than conventional management practices in the A, B, and C horizons. In the B and C horizons, the smaller b values could have been due to smaller clay contents in soils of the alternatively managed system. The Campbell equation air entry value was significantly larger for alternative practices (1.1 kPa) than conventional practices (0.79 kPa) in the A horizon. Differences in bulk density, air entry, and K-s between the alternative and conventional management systems were attributed to differences in crop rotations and nutrient or tillage management between the two systems. These results provide a useful database of soil physical and hydraulic properties that can be used by modelers to estimate the impacts of alternative agricultural practices on water movement and water quality.

J	Singh, KP; Malik, A; Singh, VK				Singh, KP; Malik, A; Singh, VK			Chemometric analysis of hydro-chemical data of an alluvial river - A case study	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION			English	Article						chemometrics; alluvial river; hydrochemistry; cluster analysis; principal component analysis; discriminant analysis; partial-least squares	WATER-QUALITY; GOMTI RIVER; PHOSPHORUS; BASIN; AREA	Hydrochemistry of an alluvial river was investigated employing the chemometric techniques such as cluster analysis (CA), principal component analysis (PCA), discriminant analysis (DA) and partial least square (PLS) with a view to extract information about the variables responsible for spatial and temporal variations in river hydrochemistry and water quality, the hidden factors explaining the structure of the hydro-chemical database of the river, factors/processes influencing the river hydro-chemistry. Analysis of spearman's correlation coefficient revealed non-significant correlation of the pollution indicator (BOD, COD, SO4, F, NH4-N, NO3-N) variables with season and significant correlation with site, indicating contribution of the site-specific anthropogenic sources in the catchments. Spatial CA clustered the monitoring sites (10nos.) into three groups of relatively non-polluted sites, moderately polluted sites, and highly polluted sites. Temporal CA differentiated among the samples of monsoon and non-monsoon months. PCA rendered considerable data reduction, in terms of eight parameters explaining about 71% of the total variance and evolved six PCs. PCA grouped samples belonging to different seasons and sites distinctly correlating them with natural and anthropogenic variables. Temporal and spatial DA rendered 97 and 92% correct assignations of the samples, respectively, and revealed that temperature, pH, BOD, DO, alkalinity and Ca are the most significant variables to discriminate between the different seasons and account for most of the expected temporal variations in hydrochemistry of the river, whereas, hardness, DO, BOD, COD, Ca and Mg were the most significant discriminating variables in space. Spatial and temporal groupings of the samples were successfully achieved through PLS modeling. PLS showed that the summer season samples are dominated by PO4, TDS, F, K, COD, BOD, Na, Cl, hardness and alkalinity, whereas, samples of winter season by DO, pH, NH4-N and coliforms. Furthermore, PLS indicated site-specific dominance of anthropogenic contaminants suggesting for their pollution sources in the corresponding catchments of these sites.

The Forest Watershed and Riparian Disturbance (FORWARD) project examines the problem from a watershed perspective rather than a forest polygon viewpoint. The main objective of this study was to devise an artificial neural network (ANN) modeling tool that can predict flow and total phosphorus (TP) concentration for ungauged watersheds (where daily flow is not monitored). This dictates that all inputs should be easily accessed via a public domain database, like the Environment Canada weather database, without the need to install flow gauges in each modeled watershed. Daily flow and TP concentration for two of the project watersheds were modeled using ANNs. The two watersheds (1A Creek, 5.1 km(2) and Willow Creek, 15.6 km(2)) were chosen to reflect variations in wetland area and composition in the study area. Flow was modeled with a feed-forward multilayer perceptron ANN trained with the error back-propagation algorithm. Simulated values for flow were then used, as inputs, to model TP concentration using the same neural networks algorithm. One hidden layer with three slabs; each operating with a different activation function was utilized to simulate the conceptual differences between base flow, snowmelt, and storm events. Time domain analysis was conducted to identify possible model time-lagged inputs reflecting the time dependency of the modeled variables. Spectral analysis was used to address data hystereses. Our results highlight the capabilities of ANN in modeling complex ecosystems and highly correlated variables. Results also indicated that more research towards the phosphorus dynamics in wetlands is required to better represent the impact of wetland area and composition on the water-phase phosphorus in ANN modeling.

J	Hu, WP; Jorgensen, SE; Zhang, FB				Hu, WP; Jorgensen, SE; Zhang, FB			A vertical-compressed three-dimensional ecological model in Lake Taihu, China	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						three-dimensional ecological model; phytoplankton; nitrogen; phosphorus; Lake Taihu	ULVA-RIGIDA	A three-dimensional ecological model on the basis of the analyses of environmental characteristics is set up for Lake Taihu, one of the largest shallow lakes in China. The hydrodynamic processes, nutrient cycling, chemical processes and biological processes are integrated in the model. Model state variables include: water current, surface displacement, nutrients of nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as their different forms such as ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, phosphate phosphorus, etc., biomasses of macroplankton, phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish, and also the nutrient levels of macroplankton and phytoplankton. A nutrient budget and sediment transformation are also coupled in the model. The data from January 17, 1997 to January 18, 1998 are use to calibrate the model. The model results have shown good agreement with the observations. It implies that the model could be used for the lake environmental management and research for examining the processes and determining the water quality. The reasons of deviations between the modelled results and the observed values are also discussed. There are six factors that explain the deviations of the modelled results from the observed values and they can be grouped into two sets. One set of problems is associated with the standard deviation introduced by sampling and analyses. The second set of problems can be solved by introduction of processes lacking in the present model (resuspension, phytoplankton transportation mode under the wind with low speed, shifts in species composition and vafied size of phytoplankton and zooplankton). The latter two processes should be included in the model at a later stage by integration of a structurally dynamic approach into the three-dimensional model. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The total maximum daily load system (TOLOS), based on ArcView SWAT (AVSWAT) using geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS), was incorporated with the SWAT model to simulate water balance and water quality from irrigated paddy fields. Model parameters related to hydrology and water quality were calibrated and validated by comparing model predictions with the field data collected for 4 years. The results indicated that the simulated runoff and water quality values were acceptably close to the observed data. Water quality parameters also appeared to be reasonably comparable to the field data. The applicability of the system for TMDL development was tested in terms of TMDL allocations and the redistribution of load reductions to 23 sub-areas within the watershed. The results demonstrated that the urbanized subwatershed #2, with residences and other community activities, required the largest allocation of road reduction. TOLOS thus appears to be a useful tool for planning TMDL for a small watershed including rice paddies in Korea. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Malmaeus, JM; Blenckner, T; Markensten, H; Persson, I				Malmaeus, JM; Blenckner, T; Markensten, H; Persson, I			Lake phosphorus dynamics and climate warming: A mechanistic model approach	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						climate scenario; phosphorus; lakes; LEEDS-model; PROBE-model; regional climate model; eutrophication	WATER; TEMPERATURE; NUTRIENTS; NITROGEN; CYANOBACTERIA; CHLOROPHYLL; SIMULATIONS; MANAGEMENT; DOMINANCE; REGIME	Model results in this work indicate that lakes may respond very differently to climate change depending on their physical character. A physical lake model and a mechanistic phosphorus model are combined with two temperature scenarios generated by a regional climate model (RCM) in three sites in central Sweden-Lake Erken and two basins of Lake Malaren (Galten and Ekoln). In the phosphorus model water mixing, mineralization, diffusion and biouptake are temperature dependent. In the simulations, Lake Erken is much more sensitive to climate warming than the two basins of Lake Malaren, and the reason is shown to be the much longer water residence time in Lake Erken (7 years), stressing the importance of internal lake processes. In Galten and Ekoln the water residence times are less than I year, and the effects of water temperature changes are small. In Lake Erken the concentration of epilimnetic-dissolved phosphorus is almost doubled in spring and autumn in the warmest climate scenario. Since the lake is mostly phosphorus limited, this means that the potential for phytoplankton production is almost doubled. The implication would be that in Lake Erken, and in other eutrophic lakes with long water residence times, eutrophication problems may become serious in the future, and that managers may need to take action today in order to maintain good water quality in these lakes.

J	Dahl, M; Wilson, DI; Hakanson, L				Dahl, M; Wilson, DI; Hakanson, L			A combined suspended particle and phosphorus water quality model: Application to Lake Vanern	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						LEEDS model; lake; phosphorus; aquatic water systems		A dynamic model describing the flow of phosphorus and suspended particulate matter for large fresh water lakes is proposed and validated against data from Lake Vanern in Sweden. The model was modified to handle two separate sub-basins, but increasing the horizontal resolution further by splitting the basins into coastal area and pelagial failed, as the model fit to experimental data deteriorated. Besides, the scant reference data available for the coastal areas makes this a dubious exercise. Parameters for the nutrient dynamics in the water column required less tuning (up to 60%) than the sedimentation and sediments (up to a factor 70). The fit to experimental data is good for the periods between 1900 and 1940 and that after 1980, but is less satisfactory for the more polluted conditions in the middle of the century. The model is applied to two scenarios: increased emissions from a pulp and paper mill by the lake, and decreased phosphorus emissions achieved by a combination of effects on farmland, woodland, and rural households.

J	Lindenschmidt, KE				Lindenschmidt, KE			The effect of complexity on parameter sensitivity and model uncertainty in river water quality modelling	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						biological oxygen demand; dissolved oxygen; model complexity; phytoplankton-nutrient dynamics; Saale; WASP5	MERCURY TRANSPORT; CARSON RIVER	Snowling and Kramer [2001. Evaluating modelling uncertainty for model selection. Ecol. Modell. 138(1), 17-30] proposed a hypothesis stating that as a model becomes more complex in terms of increased number of parameters and variable, the error between simulations and measurements decreases and the overall model sensitivity increases. In this paper, the hypothesis is tested using a river water quality model of the lower course of the Saale river, Germany. The eutrophication module of WASP5 (5th version of Water quality Analysis Simulation Program), which was developed by the U.S. EPA, was implemented. The model allows the complexity of the dissolved oxygen balance and dynamics in a water body to be easily varied from a simple Streeter-Phelps approach of dissolved oxygen-biological oxygen demand (DO-BOD) interaction to more complex phytoplankton-nutrient dynamics. Five complexities were modelled and plotted against a normalized root-mean-squared error and a normalized global sensitivity. The results verify the hypothesis. A utility function, which minimizes both error and sensitivity, shows that the most complex model is not necessarily the most "useful". In the case of the lower Saale river, modelling only the phytoplankton-nutrient cycle has almost as much descriptive power as when the complexity is increased by adding the DO-BOD cycle. The low sensitivity of the parameters linking the two cycles also indicates their weak coupling in the Saale river system. This verifies the observations that the source of the organic loading in the Saale has shifted from primary (point load) to secondary (phytoplankton) origin. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Forsyth, AR; Bubb, KA; Cox, ME				Forsyth, AR; Bubb, KA; Cox, ME			Runoff, sediment loss and water quality from forest roads in a southeast Queensland coastal plain Pinus plantation	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						forestry roads; erosion; runoff; sediment; bedload; nutrients	SOIL-EROSION; MANAGEMENT; MODEL	Runoff and sediment loss from forest roads were monitored for a two-year period in a Pinus plantation in southeast Queensland. Two classes of road were investigated: a gravelled road, which is used as a primary daily haulage route for the logging area, and an ungravelled road, which provides the main access route for individual logging compartments and is intensively used as a haulage route only during the harvest of these areas (approximately every 30 years). Both roads were subjected to routine traffic loads and maintenance during the study. Surface runoff in response to natural rainfall was measured and samples taken for the determination of sediment and nutrient (total nitrogen, total phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon and total iron) loads from each road. Results revealed that the mean runoff coefficient (runoff depth/rainfall depth) was consistently higher from the gravelled road plot with 0.57, as compared to the ungravelled road with 0.38. Total sediment loss over the two-year period was greatest from the gravelled road plot at 5.7 t km(-1) compared to the ungravelled road plot with 3.9 t km(-1). Suspended solids contributed 86% of the total sediment loss from the gravelled road, and 72% from the ungravelled road over the two years. Nitrogen loads from the two roads were both relatively constant throughout the study, and averaged 5.2 and 2.9 kg km(-1) from the gravelled and ungravelled road, respectively. Mean annual phosphor-us loads were 0.6 kg km(-1) from the gravelled road and 0.2 kg km-(1) from the ungravelled road. Organic carbon and total iron loads increased in the second year of the study, which was a much wetter year, and are thought to reflect the breakdown of organic matter in roadside drains and increased sediment generation, respectively. When road and drain maintenance (grading) was performed runoff and sediment loss were increased from both road types. Additionally, the breakdown of the gravel road base due to high traffic intensity during wet conditions resulted in the formation of deep (10 cm) ruts which increased erosion. The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP):Road model was used to compare predicted to observed runoff and sediment loss from the two road classes investigated. For individual rainfall events, WEPP:Road predicted output showed strong agreement with observed values of runoff and sediment loss. WEPP:Road predictions for annual sediment loss from the entire forestry road network in the study area also showed reasonable agreement with the extrapolated observed values. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The spectral light absorption and backscattering are essential in the development of analytical, reflectance model and multi-spectral algorithms on water quality monitoring. With regard to the increasing use of analytical reflectance model in the interpretation of remote sensing data, it seems timely to investigate the relationship of the specific absorption and the specific backscattersing coefficients and their respective concentrations for chlorophyll-a, suspended sediments and yellow substances in complex inland waters of different trophic states. Variability in the specific absorption coefficients and specific backscattering coefficients of living phytoplankton, suspended sediments and yellow substances was analyzed using a dataset of 42 spectra in Taihu Lake, which were determined from 400nm to 750nm with 1 nm increment in between p wavelength. Based on the quantitative relations inherent optical properties and constituents' concentrations, a reflectance model was established, which is consistent with in situ reflectance spectra in correlation profiles with the three optically active substances. Advancements in mapping the inherent optical properties in the high turbid eutrophic inland waters will underlie the research program of the water quality monitoring, and facilitate the environmental monitoring using remote sensing data.

Remote sensing provides a convenient and synoptic method for determining those parameters from upwelling radiances. In this study, imagery data and in situ water sample concurrent with Landsat overpass was acquired. As neural networks has been proven successful in modeling a variety of geophysical transfer functions, here, both regression model and empirical neural network were established to simulate the relationship between these two water parameters and the satellite-received radiances. It was found that neural network model played much better in accuracy than regression model with Landsat TM visible and near infrared bands as inputs. The relative RMSE for the neural network were < 7%. while the RMSE for regression analysis were less than 25% in general. Contour maps of TOC concentration and TP were produced with regression and neural network models, these two water quality parameters distribution characteristics were analyzed with ambient background. Future work still need to be done for the dynamic characteristic of Chagan Lake water quality with Landsat TM data, and the algorithms developed in this study need to be tested with multi-date imagery data and other lakes in Songnen Plain, which have developed in similar geological and environmental backgrounds.

To express changes of the quality, we introduce a model for purify functions in a river. The function is complex and non-linear. So, we use multi-layer neural networks and construct a function in the network, and use the derivatives for the cause and the effect of water quality. As for the learning and test data, we use ideal data derived from observations of the Tamagawa in Tokyo and add uniform random numbers to them. Since the model calculations represent river purification well, we apply the model to the Thmagawa. Thus, we can estimate the water purification functions, and find the river has no decomposing power for the nitrogen substances today.

This resulted in major changes in many of the ecosystem services provided by this seagrass, such as loss of bay scallops (Argopecten irradians) and disappearance of brant (Branta bernicla). Natural recovery of Z. marina, possibly deriving from either small remnant stands or undocumented transplant projects after the demise of Z marina, has been significant in four northern bays, with over 7319 ha reported through 2003 compared to 2129 ha in 1986, an average expansion rate of 305 ha year(-1). This rapid spread was likely due to seeds and seed dispersal from recovering beds. However, no recovery had occurred in the southern coastal bays prior to restoration efforts, possibly due to both their distance from potential donor beds, restricted entrances to the bays, and the narrow time period when seeds are available for colonization via rafting reproductive shoots carrying viable seeds. Survival and expansion of small test plots (4 m(2)) in these southern coastal bays between 1997 and 2000 demonstrated that propagule supply, rather than water quality, was limiting seagrass recovery in these bays. In 2001, we initiated a large-scale Z marina restoration effort in the southern coastal bays utilizing seeds, while simultaneously monitoring water quality using spatially and temporally intensive water quality mapping techniques. Between 2001 and 2004, approximately 24 million seeds harvested from natural, dense beds in Chesapeake Bay were broadcast into experimental plots ranging in size from 0.2 to 2 ha in four coastal bays having no seagrass, totaling approximately 46 ha through 2004. Successful germination (estimated at 5-10% of seeds broadcast), growth and expansion of Z. marina in and around these plots over this 3-year test period, as well as water quality data, suggest conditions are appropriate for plant growth. Low-level aerial photographs in 2004 showed 38% of the bottom in 52-0.4 ha plots was covered by vegetation. Increasing Z marina coverage will have important implications for fisheries and waterfowl but may potentially conflict with aquaculture, which is rapidly expanding in this region. Continued recovery will depend on maintaining good water quality to avoid the macro-algal accumulations and phytoplankton blooms that have characterized other coastal lagoons. The patterns of natural seagrass recovery and the results of restoration efforts we describe here, as well as seagrass recoveries from wasting disease outbreaks, anoxic events, hurricanes, and propeller scarring reported elsewhere, suggest that seeds and seed dispersal play an important role in the recovery and expansion of these beds.

J	East, TL; Sharfstein, B				East, TL; Sharfstein, B			Development of a decision tree model for the prediction of the limitation potential of phytoplankton in Lake Okeechobee, Florida, USA	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE			English	Article						bioassay; decision tree model; nutrient limitation; light limitation; subtropical lake	SUBTROPICAL LAKE; NUTRIENT-ENRICHMENT; LIGHT LIMITATION; AVAILABILITY; IRRADIANCE; PRODUCTIVITY; PHOSPHORUS; TURBIDITY; NITROGEN	Conducting long-term algal bioassays in large, complex systems such as Lake Okeechobee is an expensive and time-intensive undertaking, especially in comparison with physical and chemical monitoring. This paper describes a water quality-based decision tree model for predicting whether the phytoplankton in Lake Okeechobee is limited by light or nutrients. The model was developed and validated using the results of algal bioassays coupled with routinely monitored water quality data. Algal bioassays indicated that the factor most commonly limiting phytoplankton production in Lake Okeechobee for the period of October 1997 to November 2000 was light (59 %) followed by nitrogen (41 %). Limitation status of the phytoplankton was positively correlated with irradiance (in terms of Secchi depth/total depth) and phytoplankton biomass (in terms of chlorophyll-a) and negatively related to dissolved inorganic nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations. A cross-tabulation procedure was used to examine how the frequency of occurrence of light limitation and nutrient limitation varied as a function of these variables. The cross-tabulation procedure was also used to derive the empirical threshold values used to construct the model. This result supports both the accuracy of the derived critical threshold values and the validity of using chemical measurements in predicting whether light is limiting or nutrients are limiting in Lake Okeechobee. The model successfully predicted light limitation versus nutrient limitation in three independent validation data sets 70 % to 85 % of the time. When nutrient limiting conditions prevailed, the model did not successfully predict which nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus, or a combination of nitrogen and phosphorus) was limiting. Our results suggest that the predictive abilities of the model could be enhanced by using time-specific data rather than averaged monthly data.

However, the risk of P and N loss from grazed pastures varies with time. Current practice in southern New Zealand is to select a field, cultivate, sow in Brassica spp ., and graze in winter to save remaining pasture from damage. This deposits dung when soil is wet and OF likely. Hence, we determined P, NH4+-N, NO3--N, and E. coli loss from dung in OF via simulated rainfall from intact grazed pasture and cropland treatments of a soil. Analysis of OF, 0, 1, 4, 11, 24, and 43 days after dung deposition at the upslope end of soil boxes indicated that total P (TP), NH4+-N, and SS concentrations decreased sharply from day zero and leveled out after 11 days. More particulate P and SS were lost from the cultivated than pasture treatment, whereas the reverse occurred for dissolved organic P because of greater sorption of phytase active materials. Escherichia coli losses were high (1x10(5) 100 mL(-1)) in both treatments throughout.

Even flooded conditions nitrification in subsurface soil was identified, but nitrate concentrations in leachate were less than 10 mg/L, the standard drinking water nitrate concentration set by the World Health Organization (WHO). The NO3-N and ortho-P concentrations in the leachate were generally higher than those in the surface flooding water. Field data implied that leaching losses would not be accurately estimated under the flooded conditions of the paddy field when using the N and P concentrations of surface flooding water and infiltration depth. The leaching losses of NO3-N from paddy fields were high immediately after fertilization. The study results suggested that proper fertilization and irrigation strategies are required to reduce leaching losses of NO3-N from paddy fields.

Permeable pavements made up of a matrix of concrete blocks with voids offer one solution to the problem of increased stormwater runoff and decreased stream water quality. Experiment results indicate that lower pore size pavement showed a higher runoff reduction rate compared with other pavement. Also, water absorption capability of pavement will drop the surface temperature of pavement. Compared to runoff, the turbidity and phosphorus concentration were lower than 27 [NTU] and 0.5 [mg/L], respectively. It appears that turbidity and phosphorus are concentrated in the pavement void.

Their productive nature is linked to the fact that they process much of the world's riverine and coastal watershed discharge. These watersheds support more than 75% of the human population and are sites of large increases in nutrient loading associated with urban and agricultural expansion. Increased nutrient loading has led to accelerated primary production, or eutrophication; symptoms include increased algal bloom activity (including harmful taxa), accumulation of organic matter, and excessive oxygen consumption (hypoxia and anoxia). While nutrient-enhanced eutrophication is a "driver" of hypoxia and anoxia, physical-chemical alterations due to climatic events, such as stormwater discharge, flooding, droughts, stagnancy, and elevated temperatures are also involved. The complex interactions of anthropogenic and climatic factors determine the magnitude, duration, and aerial extent of productivity, algal booms, hypoxia, and anoxia. Using the eutrophic Neuse River Estuary (NRE), North Carolina, USA, as a case study, the physical-chemical mechanisms controlling algal bloom and hypoxia dynamics were examined. Because primary production in the NRE and many other estuaries is largely nitrogen (N) limited, emphasis has been placed on reducing N inputs. Both the amounts and chemical forms of N play roles in determining the composition and extent of phytoplankton blooms that supply the bulk of the organic carbon fueling hypoxia. Biomass from bloom organisms that are readily grazed will be readily transferred up the planktonic and benthic food chain, while toxic or inedible blooms frequently promote sedimentary C flux, microbial mineralization, and hence may exacerbate hypoxia potential. From a watershed perspective, nutrient input reductions are the main options for reducing eutrophication. Being able to distinguish the individual and cumulative effects of physical, chemical and biotic controls of phytoplankton productivity and composition is key to understanding, predicting, and ultimately managing eutrophication. Long-term collaborative (University, State, Federal) monitoring, experimental assessments, and modeling of eutrophication dynamics over appropriate spatial and temporal scales is essential for developing realistic, ecologically sound, and cost-effective nutrient management strategies for estuarine and coastal ecosystems impacted by both anthropogenic and climatic perturbations.

Nitrate-nitrogen is the cause of this eutrophication in the Gulf and its source is mainly due to increased fertilizer use in the American Midwest. In that same Midwest, the land has also been artificially drained and 80-90% of the original wetlands have been lost. Our proposed restoration involves the strategic creation and restoration of 2.2 million ha of wetlands in the MOM basin where in-field wetlands intercept agricultural runoff and diversion wetlands are overflowed by flooding river water. Case studies that total 50 wetland-years of data from Illinois, Ohio, and Louisiana are summarized as the basis for the restoration area estimate. Benefits of this restoration, in addition to solving the Gulf hypoxia, include water quality improvement, reduction of public health threats, habitat creation, and flood mitigation that will accrue to the locations in the MOM basin where the restoration occurs. Before the restoration commences, there is a need for formal and rigorous large-scale research in the basin to reduce uncertainties. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, to date in most cases, there is a clear absence of a concise strategy or methodology for designing monitoring networks, especially when deciding upon the placement of sampling stations. Since water quality monitoring networks can be quite costly, it is very important to properly design the monitoring network so that maximum information extraction can be accomplished, which in turn is vital when informing decision-makers. This paper presents the development of a methodology for identifying the critical sampling locations within a watershed. Hence, it embodies the spatial component in the design of a water quality monitoring network by designating the critical stream locations that should ideally be sampled. For illustration purposes, the methodology focuses on a single contaminant, namely total phosphorus, and is applicable to small, upland, predominantly agricultural-forested watersheds. It takes a number of hydrologic, topographic, soils, vegetative, and land use factors into account. In addition, it includes an economic as well as logistical component in order to approximate the number of sampling points required for a given budget and to only consider the logistically accessible stream reaches in the analysis, respectively. The methodology utilizes a geographic information system (GIS), hydrologic simulation model, and fuzzy logic.

In the Netherlands, riparian zones are subject to high nitrogen inputs. We combined hydrological, chemical and soil profile data with groundwater modelling to evaluate whether chronically N loaded riparian zones were still mitigating diffuse nitrate fluxes. Hydraulic parameters and water quality were monitored over 2 years in 50 piezometres in a forested and grassland riparian zone. Average nitrate loadings were high in the forested zone with 87 g NO(3)(-)-N m(-2) y(-1) and significantly lower in the grassland zone with 15 g NO(3)(-)-N m(-2) y(-1). Groundwater from a second aquifer diluted the nitrate loaded agricultural runoff. Biological N removal however occurred in both riparian zones, the grassland zone removed about 63% of the incoming nitrate load, whereas in the forested zone clear symptoms of saturation were visible and only 38% of the nitrate load was removed.

We used long-term data and a simulation model to investigate temporal fluctuations in zebra mussel populations, which govern the ecological and economic impacts of this pest species. 2. The size of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) population in the Hudson River estuary fluctuated approximately 11-fold across a 13-year period, following a cycle with a 2-4 year period. 3. This cycling was caused by low recruitment during years of high adult population size, rapid somatic growth of settled animals, and adult survivorship of 50% per year. 4. Adult growth and body condition were weakly correlated with phytoplankton biomass. 5. The habitat distribution of the Hudson's population changed over the 13-year period, with an increasing proportion of the population spreading onto soft sediments over time. The character of soft-sediment habitats in the Hudson changed because of large amounts (mean = 34 g DM m(-2)) of empty zebra mussel shells now in the sediments. 6. Simulation models show that zebra mussel populations can show a range of long-term trajectories, depending on the balance between adult space limitation, larval food limitation, and disturbance. 7. Effective understanding and management of the effects of zebra mussels and other alien species depend on understanding of their long-term demography, which may vary across ecosystems.

We studied four (4) aspects of the problem: (a) the need to quantify and map theses losses at the watershed level, (b) to find a roughness indicator that give us information on the sensitivity of the soil to erosion and on agricultural practices, (c) to estimate the organic matter content of a soil as an indicator at the same time of the cohesion between soil particles and of the quality of the soil and finally (d) to quantify and map soil conservation practices at the watershed level. We used the SWAT model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool, USDA) for modeling the losses. We also used three (3) systems to estimate the ground surface roughness (pin-profiler, 3D stereo model and Laser scanning system) and extract a roughness indicator. Soil sampling, spectral signatures of soil and crop residues, vegetation indices and satellite imagery were then used to estimate organic matter content and soil conservation practices. Results show that the SWAT model has to be adapted to Quebec conditions but it was able to map areas sensible to losses. For the surface roughness, the pin-profiler proves to be the cheapest, fastest and easiest way to get data, however the standard deviation (sd) of heights is not the only or best indicator. An autocorrelation test combined with sd should lead to a more representative indicator of roughness. Organic matter content is estimated best with the second derivative at 561 nm of normalized reflectance spectra. Tests need to be done on an a different area and with satellite imagery. Finally, results using a Landsat TM image with the CRIM index prove to be useful to map crop residues as an indicator of soil conservation. Validation needs to be done on the ground.

J	Kneis, D; Knoesche, R; Bronstert, A				Kneis, D.; Knoesche, R.; Bronstert, A.			Analysis and simulation of nutrient retention and management for a lowland river-lake system	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							PHOSPHORUS RELEASE; WATER-QUALITY; POINT SOURCES; SHALLOW; SEDIMENTS; MODEL; DENITRIFICATION; MUGGELSEE; PHYTOPLANKTON; PREDICTION	In the context of the European Water Framework Directive, we studied the possible impact of reduced emissions on phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations in a lowland river-lake system (Havel River, Germany). As a prerequisite, we quantified the retention of nutrients in the river from mass balances and deduced its seasonal variation. We detected that about 30% of the total nitrogen input is retained within the surveyed river section. In contrast, phosphorus release from sediments was shown to cause a considerable increase in present P concentrations. Average net phosphorus release rates of about 20 mg P m(-2) d(-1) in late summer were estimated for the Havel Lakes. Based on the observed patterns of N retention and P release we parametrized a newly developed water quality simulation program (TRAM), which allows alternative model approaches of different complexity to be implemented and tested. To account for the future trend of internal P loading, the phosphorus excess in lake sediments was estimated from core samples and included in the model as a state variable. For analyzing scenarios of reduced nutrient emissisions, the water quality simulation program was linked to mesoscale hydrological catchment models for the first time. From scenario simulations we conclude that internal P loading is likely to counteract efforts of emission control for decades. Even by significant reductions in external P loads, a persistent phosphorus limitation of primary production can hardly be established in the analyzed time frame of 13 years. Though in the short run a continued reduction in nitrogen loads appears to be the more promising approach of eutrophication management, we recommend enhanced efforts to diminish both N and P emissions.

In the present paper, along with ANN, we select genetic programming (GP) for modelling and prediction of algal blooms in Tolo Harbour, Hong Kong. The study of the weights of the trained ANN and also the GP-evolved equations shows that they correctly identify the ecologically significant variables. Analysis of various ANN and GP scenarios indicates that good predictions of long-term trends in algal biomass can be obtained using only chlorophyll-a as input. The results indicate that the use of biweekly data can simulate long-term trends of algal biomass reasonably well, but it is not ideally suited to give short-term algal bloom predictions.

Seasonal dependency patterns often reveal relationships which would be unnoticed if all data are treated together. The aim of this study is to examine water quality constituent concentration vs. flow in a regulated small stream in order to detect seasonal relationships and to interpret them with regard to watershed processes. Expected relationship patterns have been observed for some water quality constituent like conductivity, suspended solids, etc. Some unexpected relationships have been detected which arise from the particular hydrologic regime of the stream and the surrounding watershed. The information gained can be used in watershed management studies to control contaminants reaching waterways.

Direct impacts of the Lake Maid (TM) on water quality and the potential foi- spread of viable plant fragments were evaluated in this study, conducted on the San Joaquin River Delta. Analyses of water nutrient concentrations (total and dissolved phosphorus, nitrate and nitrite, and organic carbon) and measurements of conventional water quality parameters as well as fragment density were conducted over a 10-day treatment period. A mesocosm experiment, plant biomass estimation, and a costeffectiveness evaluation were also performed. The Lake Maid (TM) successfully removed all above ground plant biomass at two study sites and partially removed plant biomass at a third site without affecting nutrient concentrations or water quality in the treatment areas. The likelihood of spreading plant fragments is high, but in areas of extensive aquatic plant infestation, like the San Joaquin River Delta, this may not be a management concern. During the 10-day treatment period, the Lake Maid (TM) proved to be an effective, low-maintenance plant control method for removal of submersed vegetation in small areas where additional plant fragmentation is tolerable.

Phosphorus loading, during snow melt and storm events, is the main source of nutrient enrichment to water bodies on the Canadian Boreal Plain. This study compared two approaches for modelling total phosphorus (TP) concentration: autoregressive moving average with exogenous input (ARMAX) and artificial neural network (ANN) models. Derived models were applied to a small forested watershed on the Canadian Boreal Plain. Results showed that ANN outperformed ARMAX based on four measures of goodness-of-fit statistics. This study confirmed that the ANN modelling approach is superior to ARMAX in modelling time-correlated gapped data, provided step-by-step guidelines for modelling time-correlated variables, and presented a feasible alternative for modelling diffuse pollutants in small forested watersheds.

To generate hypotheses relating to watershed controls on streams in the presence and absence of disturbance, we quantified relationships between stream variables and soil distribution in nine undisturbed small (M = 5.4 km(2)) watersheds for two relatively dry and snowmelt-dominated seasons (May through October 2002 and 2003). We also considered data from one harvested and two burned watersheds. Among soil types, only peatland cover had an association with runoff and water quality. Runoff and ammonium exports were positively related to peatland cover in both years (r(2) = 0.50 to 0.90; P < 0.05). In the first year, additional relationships to peatland cover existed for particulate phosphorus and suspended sediment exports (r(2) = 0.64 and 0.65, respectively), whereas in the second year they existed for dissolved phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon exports (r(2) = 0.67 and 0.78, respectively). Hypotheses generated relate to the role of peatlands as sources for water moving toward stream channels, water exchange between streams and riparian groundwater, and the influence of disturbance and precipitation patterns on runoff generation.

To simulate hydrologic and water quality impacts of land use changes, the Long-Term Hydrologic Impact Assessment (L-THIA) system has been used. The L-THIA system estimates pollutant loading based on direct runoff quantity and land use based pollutant coefficients. The accurate estimation of direct runoff is important in assessing water quality impacts of land use changes. An automated program was developed to calibrate the L-THIA model using the millions of curve number (CN) combinations associated with land uses and hydrologic soil groups. L-THIA calibration for the Little Eagle Creek (LEC) watershed near Indianapolis, Indiana was performed using kind use data for 1991 and daily rainfall data for six months of 1991 (January 1-June 30) to minimize errors associated with use of different temporal land use data and rainfall data. For the calibration period, the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient was 0.60 for estimated and observed direct runoff. The calibrated CN values were used for validation of the model for the same year (July 1-December 31), and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient was 0.60 for estimated and observed direct runoff. The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient was 0.52 for January 1, 1991 to December 31, 1991 using uncalibrated CN values. As shown in this study, the use of better input parameters for the L-THIA model can improve accuracy. The effects on direct runoff and pollutant estimation of the calibrated CN values in the L-THIA model were investigated for the LEC. Following calibration, the estimated average annual direct runoff for the LEC watershed increased by 34%, total nitrogen by 24%, total phosphorus by 22%, and total lead by 43%. This study demonstrates that the L-THIA model should be calibrated and validated prior to application in a particular watershed to more accurately assess the effects of land use changes on hydrology and water quality.

This is especially true for areas like the northeastern U.S. where copious research has shown that variable source area hydrology largely governs runoff generation. The goal of this study was to develop a scientifically justified method to identify the locations that generate overland flow. Furthermore, this methodology must be computationally simple enough that it can be utilized or incorporated into nutrient management plans and other established water quality tools. We specifically tested the reliability of the 'distance from a stream,' D-s, and the 'topographic index,' lambda, to predict areas with a high propensity for generating overland flow, i.e. hydrologically sensitive areas (HSA). HSAs were defined by their probability of generating runoff, P-sat, based on 30 year simulations using a physically based hydrological model. Using GIS, each location's P-sat was correlated with D-s and lambda. We used three Delaware Co., NY watersheds in the New York City watershed system with areas varying in size from 1.6 to 37 km(2) and with forested and agricultural land uses. The topographic index gave stronger, more regionally consistent correlations with P-sat than did D-s. Equations correlating lambda and P-sat for each month are presented and can be used to estimate hydrological sensitivity in the region surrounding our study watersheds, i.e. in Delaware Co. This work is currently being incorporated into an Internet Mapping System to facilitate user-friendly, on-line identification of HSAs. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Catchments at the Fort Benning Military Installation (near Columbus Georgia) experience a range of upland disturbance intensities due to; spatial variability in the intensity of military training. We used this disturbance gradient to investigate the effects of upland soil and vegetation disturbance on stream chemistry. During baseflow, mean total suspended sediment (TSS) concentration and mean inorganic suspended sediment (ISS) concentration increased with catchment disturbance intensity (TSS: R-2 = 0.7, p = 0.005, range = 4.0-10.1 mg L-1, ISS: R-2 = 0.71, p = 0.004, range 2.04-7.3 mg L-1); dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (R-2 = 0.79, p = 0.001, range = 1.5-4.1 mg L-1) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration (R-2 = 0.75, p = 0.008, range = 1.9-6.2 mu g L-1) decreased with increasing distur nitrate (NO3-), and dissolved bance intensity; and ammonia (NH4+) inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations were unrelated to disturbance intensity. The increase in TSS and ISS during storms was positively correlated with disturbance (R-2 = 0.78 and 0.78, p = 0.01 and 0.01, respectively); mean maximum change in SRP during storms increased with disturbance (r - 0.7, p = 0.04); and mean maximum change in NOT during storms was marginally correlated with disturbance (r = 0.58, p = 0.06). Soil characteristics were significant predictors of baseflow DOC, SRP, and Ca2+, but were not correlated with suspended sediment fractions, any nitrogen species, or pH. Despite the largely, intact riparian zones of these headwater streams, upland soil and vegetation disturbances had clear effects on stream chemistry during baseflow and stormflow conditions.

J	Xue, LQ; Hao, ZC				Xue Lian-qing; Hao Zhen-chun			Nutrient exchange and release experiment and its simulation study in lake water-sediment interface	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES			English	Article						phosphate and nitrogen release; water-sediment interface experiments; simulation model	RETENTION	The sediment distributed and insolated under lake was collected for experiments. The nutrient layer distribution conditions of sampled sediment and its physical and chemical characteristics were analyzed to simulate and assess the influence degree to lake water quality. Based on the dynamic water exchanging experiments the nutrient release process in sediment and influence mechanism to substance exchanging on water-sediment interface was studied, and the correlation between the changing content of total phosphors and total nitrogen in sediment and covered water were analyzed for setting up a simulation model. At the same time the influence degree is explained in detail. The experimental results indicated that even if clean water without nutrient contents was used for water exchangement so as to decrease pollution or prevent eutrophication, however owing to the vertical nutrient distribution in lake sediment, it will lead to the increasing release amount greatly especially when the organic nutrient contained in sediment turns into inorganic status because of isolation. Besides the release process of total phosphate (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) were modeled and each nutrient's exchanging equation at interface caused by covered water nutrient concentration changing was set up. According to the simulating prediction, TP and TN content of cover water will also sustain a steady higher level in a long period. The nutrient release amount of sediment is not only affected by the covered water concentration but also connects with accumulative time. The experiments provide the fundamental theoretical and practical basis for taking ecological restoration project. And research is helpful to prevent or restore lake eutrophication.

Diatom-based weighted-averaging transfer functions for great lakes coastal water quality: Relationships to watershed characteristics	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						Great Lakes environmental indicators; diatoms; phosphorus; coastlines; watershed; stressors	TOTAL PHOSPHORUS; SURFACE WATERS; INDICATORS; VARIABILITY; GENERATION; DYNAMICS; WETLANDS; MODEL	In an effort to develop indicators for Great Lakes near-shore conditions, diatom-based transfer functions to infer water quality variables were developed from 155 samples collected from coastal Great Lakes wetlands. embayments and high-energy shoreline sites. Over 2,000 diatom taxa were identified, and 352 taxa were sufficiently abundant to include in transfer function development. Multivariate data exploration revealed strong responses of the diatom assemblages to stressor variables. including total phosphorus (TP). Spatial variables such as lake. latitude and longitude also had notable relationships with assemblage characteristics. A diatom inference transfer function TP provided a robust reconstructive relationship (r(2) = 0.67; RMSE = 0.28 log(mu g/L); r(2)jackknife = 0.55; RMSEP = 0.33 log (mu g/L)) that improved following the removal of 13 samples that had poor observed-inferred TP relationships (r(2) = 0.75; RMSE = 0.22 log(mu g/L); r(jackknife)(2) = 0.65; RMSEP = 0.26 log (mu g/L)). Diatom-based transfer functions for other water quality variables, such as total nitrogen chloride. and chlorophyll a also performed well. Measured and diatom-inferred water quality data were regressed against watershed characteristics (including gradients of agriculture, atmospheric deposition, and industrial facilities) to determine the relative strength of measured and diatom-inferred data to identify watershed stressor influences. With the exception of pH, diatom-inferred water quality variables were better predicted by watershed characteristics than were measured water quality variables. Because diatom communities are subject to the prevailing water quality in the Great Lakes coastal environment. it appears they can better integrate water quality information than snapshot measurements. These results strongly support the use of diatoms in Great Lakes coastal monitoring programs.

Results showed that the presence of the scallops could strongly decrease seston and chlorophyll a concentrations in the water column. Moreover, in a limited water column, increasing scallop density could cause seston depletion due to scallop's filtering and biodeposition process, and impair scallop growth. Both filtration rate and biodeposition rate of C. farreri showed significant negative correlation with their density and positive relationship with seston concentration. Calculation predicts that the daily removal of suspended matter from water column by the scallops in Sishili Bay ecosystem can be as high as 45% of the total suspended matter; and the daily production of biodeposits by the scallops in early summer in farming zone may amount to 7.78 g m(-2), with daily C, N and P biodeposition rates of 3.06 x 10(-1), 3.86 x 10(-2) and 9.80 x 10(-3) g m(-2), respectively. The filtering and biodeposition by suspension-cultured scallops could substantially enhance the deposition of total suspended particulate material, suppress accumulation of particulate organic matter in water column, and increase the flux of C, N and P to benthos, strongly enhancing pelagic-benthic coupling. It was suggested that the filtering-biodeposition process by intensively suspension-cultured bivalve filter-feeders could exert strong top-down control on phytoplankton biomass and other suspended particulate material in coastal ecosystems. This study also indicated that commercially suspension-cultured bivalves may simultaneously and potentially aid in mitigating eutrophication pressures on coastal ecosystems subject to anthropogenic N and P loadings, serving as a eutrophic-environment bioremediator. The ecological services (e.g. filtering capacity, top-down control, and benthic-pelagic coupling) functioned by extractive bivalve aquaculture should be emphasized in coastal ecosystems.

We hypothesized that such problems could be minimized by using a knifing technique to move the fertilizer granules into the subsurface root zone of perennial forages, and conducted a study to determine the effect on runoff water quality. Plots were constructed on a hillside (8 to 10 percent slope) field with a silt loam soil covered by well-established bermudagrass [Cynodon doctylon (L.) Pers.] and mixed grass forage. Each plot had borders to isolate runoff and a downslope trough with sampling pit for collection. Inorganic 13-13-13 fertilizer granules were applied at 1.34 Mg ha(-1) (0.6 t ac(-1)) by one of three methods: surface spreading, incorporation, or surface spreading on soil cuts. Each treatment had six replications and there were three control plots that were not fertilized. Runoff samples from simulated rainfall applied at 50 mm h(-1) (2 in hr(-1)) and natural rainfall events showed that nutrient losses in runoff from incorporated fertilizer were statistically no higher than from control plots, but were usually at least go percent less than those from surface-applied fertilizer. Soil cuts slightly decreased nutrient losses from surface-applied fertilizer, but this effect was rarely significant. When compared to surface-applied fertilizer, the incorporated fertilizer not only improved water quality, but also showed a strong tendency to increase forage yield.

Influence of landscape characteristics on local habitat and fish biomass in streams of Michigan's Lower Peninsula	LANDSCAPE INFLUENCES ON STREAM HABITATS AND BIOLOGICAL ASSEMBLAGES	American Fisheries Society Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	Symposium on Influences of Landscape on Stream Habitat and Biological Communities	AUG 25-26, 2004	Madison, WI				PATH-ANALYSIS; WATER-QUALITY; RIVER; ASSEMBLAGES; SYSTEM; COMMUNITIES; DISTRIBUTIONS; CONSERVATION; FRAMEWORK; ECOLOGY	Biologists need to understand causal relations among key habitat elements and fishes to effectively protect and manage stream systems. Though much groundwork has been laid, development of an analytic framework that incorporates spatial hierarchy of stream characteristics to predict instream habitat and fish assemblages has been challenging. A key issue is the complex web of direct and indirect effects that arise when one attempts to include all pertinent habitat parameters in analyses. Covariance structure analysis (CSA) was specifically developed for untangling such webs. We used CSA to quantitatively describe relations between catchment- and local-scale habitat variables and fish biomass in streams of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. Catchment-scale variables characterizing stream size, land use, and surficial geology had significant direct and indirect effects on, and explained 50-83% of spatial variation in, mean depth, velocity, July mean temperature, 90% exceedence flow yield, and total phosphorus values in streams. These variables also had significant direct effects on substrate composition at sites, accounting for up to 30% of the spatial variation in individual substrate classes. Local-scale variables-mean depth, total phosphorus, and percent cobble-had significant direct effects on total fish biomass, explaining 26% of spatial variation among sites. Catchment area and percent of agricultural and urban land uses in the catchment had significant indirect effects on fish biomass. Our findings clearly demonstrated the ecological complexity and multiscale nature of fish habitat in stream ecosystems.

Cultural eutrophication in the Choptank and Patuxent estuaries of Chesapeake Bay	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							COASTAL-PLAIN ESTUARY; LAND-USE; NITRATE CONTAMINATION; PHYTOPLANKTON GROWTH; NUTRIENT DISCHARGES; WATER-QUALITY; LARGE-SCALE; RIVER; NITROGEN; PHOSPHORUS	The Choptank and Patuxent tributaries of Chesapeake Bay have become eutrophic over the last 50-100 years. Systematic monitoring of nutrient inputs began in similar to 1970, and there have been 2-5-fold increases in nitrogen (N) and phosphor-us (P) inputs during 1970-2004 due to sewage discharges, fertilizer applications, atmospheric deposition, and changes in land use. Hydrochemical modeling and land-use yield coefficients suggest that current input rates are 4-20 times higher for N and P than under forested conditions existing 350 yr ago. Sewage is a major cause of increased nutrients in the Patuxent; agricultural inputs dominate in the Choptank. These loading increases have caused three major water-quality problems: (1) increased nutrients, phytoplankton, and turbidity; (2) decreased submerged grasses due to higher turbidity and epiphyton shading; and (3) bottom-water hypoxia due to respiration of excess organic matter. Oxygen in the Patuxent is consistently < 3 mg L-1 in bottom waters in summer, whereas oxygen in Choptank bottom waters has been decreasing for the last 20 yr and is now approaching 3 mg L-1 in wet years. The low N:P of sewage inputs to the Patuxent results in an N-limited, P-saturated system, whereas the Choptank is primarily limited by N, but with P limitation of phytoplankton during spring river flows. Insufficient action has been taken to improve the water and habitat quality of these estuaries, although reduced eutrophication in dry years suggests that both estuaries will respond to significant decreases in nutrients.

Both systems have experienced large post-World War 11 increases in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loading, and nutrient reductions have been initiated to alleviate symptoms of eutrophication. However, ecosystem-level effects of these nutrient reductions are strongly affected by hydrologic variability, including severe droughts and a recent increase in Atlantic hurricane activity. Phytoplankton community responses to these hydrologic perturbations, including storm surges and floods, were examined and when possible, compared for these systems. In both systems, the resulting variability in water residence time strongly influenced seasonal and longer-term patterns of phytoplankton biomass and community composition. Fast-growing diatoms were favored during years of high discharge and short residence time in CB, whereas this effect was not observed during high discharge conditions in the longer residence time NRE/PS. In the NRE/PS, all phytoplankton groups except summer cyanobacterial populations showed decreased abundance during elevated flow years when compared to low flow years. Although hurricanes affected the CB less frequently than the NRE/PS, they nonetheless influenced floral composition in both systems. Seasonally, hydrologic perturbations, including droughts, floods, and storm-related deep mixing events, overwhelmed nutrient controls on floral composition. This underscores the difficulty in predicting seasonal and longer-term phytoplankton production and compositional responses to nutrient input reductions aimed at controlling eutrophication of large estuarine ecosystems.

Mass volume transport data were obtained with cross-estuary transect flow measurements taken near the entrance to the estuary. Although trends were minimally influenced by hurricanes, analyses were significantly affected by the sustained drought near the end of the study. As examples, decreasing trends in total N (TN), total P (TP), and bottom-water dissolved oxygen concentrations, and in TN loadings were significant considering all data, but these trends were not significant when the sustained drought was excluded from analysis. In addition, the trend in TN loading was especially sensitive to the initial sampling period. NH4+ concentrations dramatically increased (overall by similar to 500%) as a persistent trend regardless of attempts to control for climatic events. An increasing trend in NH4+ also was documented in an adjacent, rapidly flushed Coastal Plain estuary, the Cape Fear. The NH4+ data suggest a regional-scale effect of high inputs from inadequately controlled, increasing nonpoint sources. The fragility of TN loading trends, the striking increase in NH4+ concentrations, and the lack of management emphasis on controlling nonpoint sources such as "new" industrialized swine production collectively do not support recent reports of achievement of a 30% reduction in TN loading to the Neuse. Nonpoint sources remain a critical target for reduction to alleviate the negative effects of cultural eutrophication in this system, as in many estuaries throughout the world.

Paleo-indicators and water quality change in the Charlotte Harbor estuary (Florida)	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							MISSISSIPPI RIVER; CYANOBACTERIAL BLOOMS; SURFACE SEDIMENTS; LAKE-SEDIMENTS; CARBON FLOW; MARINE; EUTROPHICATION; NITROGEN; PIGMENTS; PRODUCTIVITY	We reconstructed water quality changes for 1800 to 2000 in Charlotte Harbor (Florida), a shallow subtropical estuary, by using a suite of biological and geochemical proxies in dated sediments collected in the region of a present day, midsummer hypoxic zone. The declining freshwater loading into the estuary from 1931 to the 1980s is not the probable causal agent encouraging the appearance or expansion of a hypoxia zone (measuring up to 90 km(2) in summer). Rather, the reconstructed trends in nitrogen loading indicate increased phytoplankton production has likely caused a decline in bottom water oxygen concentrations. Sedimentary biogenic silica (BSi), carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations increased concurrently with known or inferred changes in nutrient loadings. There were direct relationships between phytoplankton pigments and BSi, heavier delta S-14 with increased carbon loading, and sequestration of P, Al, and Fe as carbon loading increased. The results from the sediment analyses and the results from mixing models using C : N ratios and delta C-13 suggest an estuarine system that is responsive to increased carbon loading from the nitrogen-limited phytoplankton community and whose sediments are becoming increasingly anoxic as a result. The present nitrogen loading is about three times above that prior to the 1800s, suggesting that without management intervention the anticipated doubling of the watershed's population from 1990 to 2020 will greatly increase the nitrogen loading to this estuary and will lead to much higher amounts of phytoplankton biomass and accumulation and exacerbate hypoxic conditions.

Relating precipitation and water management to nutrient concentrations in the oligotrophic "upside-down" estuaries of the Florida Everglades	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							PHOSPHORUS LIMITATION; ORGANIC-MATTER; NITROGEN; BAY; ENRICHMENT; SALINITY; BIOGEOCHEMISTRY; VEGETATION; DYNAMICS; QUALITY	We present 8 yr of long-term water quality, climatological, and water management data for 17 locations in Everglades National Park, Florida. Total phosphorus (P) concentration data from freshwater sites (typically < 0.25 mu mol L-1, or 8 mu g L-1) indicate the oligotrophic, P-limited nature of this large freshwater-estuarine landscape. Total P concentrations at estuarine sites near the Gulf of Mexico (average approximate to 0.5 mu mol L-1) demonstrate the marine source for this limiting nutrient. This "upside down" phenomenon, with the limiting nutrient supplied by the ocean and not the land, is a defining characteristic of the Everglade landscape. We present a conceptual model of how the seasonality of precipitation and the management of canal water inputs control the marine P supply, and we hypothesize that seasonal variability in water residence time controls water quality through internal biogeochemical processing. Low freshwater inflows during the dry season increase estuarine residence times, enabling local processes to control nutrient availability and water quality. El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events tend to mute the seasonality of rainfall without altering total annual precipitation inputs. The Nino3 ENSO index (which indicates an ENSO event when positive and a La Nina event when negative) was positively correlated with both annual rainfall and the ratio of dry season to wet season precipitation. This ENSO-driven disruption in seasonal rainfall patterns affected salinity patterns and tended to reduce marine inputs of P to Everglades estuaries. ENSO events also decreased dry season residence times, reducing the importance of estuarine nutrient processing. The combination of variable water management activities and interannual differences in precipitation patterns has a strong influence on nutrient and salinity patterns in Everglades estuaries.

J	Alexander, RB; Smith, RA				Alexander, Richard B.; Smith, Richard A.			Trends in the nutrient enrichment of US rivers during the late 20th century and their relation to changes in probable stream trophic conditions	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							WATER-QUALITY; TEMPERATE STREAMS; CONSTITUENT LOADS; UNITED-STATES; NITROGEN; PHOSPHORUS; CHLOROPHYLL; FLUX	We estimated trends in concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) and the related change in the probabilities of trophic conditions from 1975 to 1994 at 250 nationally representative riverine monitoring locations in the U.S. with drainage areas larger than about 1,000 km(2). Statistlcally significant (p < 0.05) declines were detected in TP and TN concentrations at 44% and 37% of the monitoring sites, and significant increases were detected at 3% and 9% of the sites, respectively. We used a statistical model to assess changes in the probable trophic-state classification of the sites after adjusting for climate-related variability in nutrient concentrations. The probabilistic assessment accounts for current knowledge of the trophic response of streams to nutrient enrichment, based on a recently proposed definition of "eutrophic," "mesotrophic," and "oligotrophic" conditions in relation to total nutrient concentrations. Based on these trophic definitions, we found that the trophic state improved at 25% of the monitoring sites and worsened at fewer than 5% of the sites; about 70% of the sites were unchanged. Improvements in trophic-state related to declines in TP were more common in predominantly forested and shrub-grassland watersheds, whereas the trophic state of predominantly agricultural sites was unchanged. Despite the declines in TP concentrations at many sites, about 50% of all monitoring sites, and more than 60% of the sites in predominantly agricultural and urban watersheds, were classified as eutrophic in 1994 based on TP concentrations. Contemporaneous reductions in major nutrient sources to streams, related to wastewater treatment upgrades, phosphate detergent bans, and declines in some agricultural sources, may have contributed to the declines in riverine nutrient concentrations and associated improvements in trophic conditions.

The objectives of the present study were to determine the biodiversity of the gastropod communities in lowland rivers under the impact of agriculture, the relationship between gastropod communities and environmental factors, and to estimate the usefulness of the gastropod communities as an indicator of water quality. Four rivers that flow through an agricultural area were investigated. A high value of chlorophyll a, a low value of total dissolved oxygen and a high concentration of phosphates or total phosphorus and organic matters are present in the rivers. Gastropod communities in the rivers of the Ciechanowska Upland are influenced by bottom sediments, the physical and chemical parameters of water, and the abundance of macrophytes, which are typical of eutrophic water. In the rivers of the Ciechanowska Upland, gastropods can be biological indicators of dissolved oxygen in water - Viviparus viviparus (Linnaeus, 1758) and Lymnaea peregra (O. F. Muller, 1774) can be indicators of anthropopressure. The values of diversity indices varied from site to site, but did not decrease along the river.

Potential role of sponge communities in controlling phytoplankton blooms in Florida Bay	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						sponges; phytoplankton blooms; benthic grazing; Florida Bay	INNER-SHELF LAGOON; FILTRATION-RATE; WATER-QUALITY; USA; SEAGRASS; SYNECHOCOCCUS; POPULATIONS; LIMITATION; ABUNDANCE	An unprecedented series of ecological disturbances have been recurring within Florida Bay since the summer of 1987. Persistent and widespread phytoplankton and cyanobacteria blooms have coincided with the large scale decimation of sponge communities. One hypothesis is that the large scale loss of suspension-fee ding sponges has rendered the Florida Bay ecosystem susceptible to these recurring blooms. The primary objective of this study was to experimentally evaluate the potential for suspension-feeding sponges to control nuisance phytoplankton blooms within Florida Bay prior to a large sponge die-off event. To achieve this objective, we determined the extent and biomass of the surviving sponge community in the different basins of Florida Bay. Many areas within Florida Bay possessed sponge densities and biomasses of 1 to 3 ind. M-2 or 100 to 300 g m(-2) respectively. The dominant species included Spheciospongia vesparia, Chondrilla nucula, Cinachyra alloclada, Tedania ignis and Ircinia sp., which accounted for 68% of individual sponges observed and 88% of sponge biomass. Laboratory grazing rates of these dominant sponges were experimentally determined on 4 different algal food treatments: a monoculture of cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus, a monoculture of the diatom Cyclotella choctawhatcheeana, a monoculture of the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum hoffmanianum, and an equal volume of the 3 monocultures combined. To estimate the impact of a mass sponge mortality event on the system-wide filtration rate of Florida Bay, we combined estimates of the current sponge biomass and laboratory sponge filtration rates with estimates of mean volumes of the sub-basins of Florida Bay. This study implies that the current blooms occurring within the central region of Florida Bay can be explained by the loss of the dominant suspension feeder in this system, and there is no need to invoke a new addition of nutrients within this region for the blooms to occur.

J	Uthicke, S				Uthicke, Sven			Photosynthetic efficiency and rapid light curves of sediment-biofilms along a water quality gradient in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES			English	Article						PAM; WQ gradient; benthic microalgae (BMA); nutrient limitation; light limitation	CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; CORAL-REEFS; ELECTRON-TRANSPORT; MICROPHYTOBENTHOS; ASSEMBLAGES; RATES; PHYTOPLANKTON; MICROALGAE; PHOSPHATE; NUTRIENTS	The use of pulse-amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry in situ and in vivo as an indicator for nutrient and light status of microphytobenthos communities was investigated on the Great Barrier Reef. The 10 reefs investigated were located along a previously described water quality gradient, confirmed by sediment chemistry parameters (C-org, N) and incident light measurements. Estimates of the efficiency of Photosystem 11 (PSII) were biased when not corrected for background fluorescence that increased with increasing inorganic C content of the sediments. Uncorrected values mimicked a decline in quantum efficiency towards areas with presumed lower nutrient levels. Upon correction, maximum and effective quantum efficiency (ca. 0.59) did not vary significantly along the gradient. The maximum quantum efficiency (F-V/F-m,F-corr) measured after dark-adaptation did not differ statistically from effective quantum efficiency in the field (phi(PSII,corr)). F-0 values measured in the laboratory were much lower than in situ F readings, indicating a higher concentration of biomass on the surface of the sediment in the field. Rapid light curve parameters (initial slope (x, relative electron transport rate at light saturation rETR(max), irradiance at onset of light saturation E-k) were lower during in vitro readings than in situ. rETR(max) and alpha values exhibited no statistical differences along the gradient. In contrast, E-k increased towards midshelf reefs and correlated with incident PAR, indicating that microphytobenthos communities were highly adapted to incident light conditions. Because coral reef microphytobenthos was previously shown to be nitrogen limited, it was unexpected that efficiency measurements would not vary. It is hypothesised that, due to potential for differential vertical migration, the actual species involved in photosynthesis at a given time are nutrient sufficient. Higher nutrient supply may change the community composition on the surface to dominance by species with higher productivity.

The Yucatan Peninsula is a karstic tropical region that is strongly influenced by submerged groundwater discharge (SGD) into the coastal zone. Phytoplankton community structure and its relationship with regional and local water quality variables were studied in four ports of the northwestern Yucatan Peninsula. Water quality was strongly related to SGD, and variations in phytoplankton community structure were related to local nutrient loading and hydrographic conditions, turbulence, and human impacts. Our study provides an ecological baseline for the Yucatan Peninsula and serves as a basis for establishing monitoring programs to predict changes at sites with high hydrological variation and in developing an early alert system for harmful toxic algal blooms.

J	Haraldsen, TK; Stalnacke, P				Haraldsen, TK; Stalnacke, P			Methods for water quality sampling and load estimation in monitoring of Norwegian agricultural catchments	NORDIC HYDROLOGY			English	Article						flow; nitrogen; phosphorus; suspended solids	TRANSPORT; RIVERS	Different sampling procedures are applied to monitor water quality in agricultural catchments in the Nordic countries. The need for comparing monitoring results from the Nordic countries was the incentive for establishing a project aimed at comparing estimates of nutrient losses determined using different sampling strategies. Three different sampling methods were compared in three Norwegian catchments: weekly flow-proportional composite sampling (FPCS), weekly composite sampling with temporally equidistant subsampling every second hour (TECS) and temporally equidistant weekly point sampling (PS). Differences in load estimated between the three tested sampling strategies were smaller for nitrogen than for phosphorus or suspended solids. Point sampling tended to miss some of the peaks in concentrations of phosphorus and suspended solids, particularly during flow events, causing significantly lower load estimates for phosphorus and suspended solids by point sampling compared with composite sampling strategies. Flow-proportional composite sampling gave the most reliable data for event-responsible compounds or when the predictability of peaks was low. Based on this investigation, and similar studies in the other Nordic countries, a flow-proportional sampling strategy is recommended for studies of water quality in agricultural streams.

J	Kallio, K				Kallio, Kari			Optical properties of Finnish lakes estimated with simple bio-optical models and water quality monitoring data	NORDIC HYDROLOGY			English	Article						attenuation; lakes; optical models; reflectance; Secchi depth; water quality	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; AIRBORNE IMAGING SPECTROMETRY; COASTAL WATERS; CHLOROPHYLL-A; SECCHI DISK; INHERENT; OCEAN; CLARITY; PHYTOPLANKTON; FEASIBILITY	The aim of this study was to estimate the distributions of spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient, attenuation depth and subsurface reflectance of Finnish lakes. In addition, the optimum empirical water quality interpretation algorithms employing reflectance ratios were investigated for the needs of remote sensing. Estimations of the optical properties were based on simple optical models and measured concentrations of optically active substances (the sum of chlorophyll a and phaeophytin a, total suspended solids and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM)) at 1670 monitoring stations representing 1113 lakes. The models were parameterized using optical data from 10 lakes. The mean diffuse attenuation coefficient in PAR was 3.5 m(-1) and the location of the maximum attenuation depth was in the range 564-714nm. The simulated reflectance spectra showed a shift of the maximum value to longer wavelengths as trophic status changed from oligotrophic to hyper-eutrophic. High CDOM concentrations decrease the estimation accuracy of chlorophyll a from reflectance spectra using empirical algorithms, particularly in oligotrophic lakes. The models described can be used in studying light availability for photosynthesis at different depths, in the simulation of water temperatures, in estimating how different management alternatives affect light attenuation and Secchi depth, and in various remote sensing applications.

Between June and August, the geochemical content of rock glacier outflow does not appear to differ substantially from that of other surface waters in the Green Lakes Valley. Thus, for this alpine ecosystem at this time of year there does not appear to be large differences in water quality among rock glacier outflow, glacier and blockslope discharge, and discharge from small alpine catchments. However, in September concentrations of Mg2+ in the outflow of the rock glacier increased to more than 900 mu eq L-1 compared to values of less than 40 mu eq L-1 at all the other sites, concentrations of Ca2+ were greater than 4,000 mu eq L-1 compared to maximum values of less than 200 mu eq L-1 at all other sites, and concentrations of SO42- reached 7,000 mu eq L-1, compared to maximum concentrations below 120 mu eq L-1 at the other sites. Inverse geochemical modelling suggests that dissolution of pyrite, epidote, chlorite and minor calcite as well as the precipitation of silica and goethite best explain these elevated concentrations of solutes in the outflow of the rock glacier. Three component hydrograph separation using end-member mixing analysis shows that melted snow comprised an average of 30% of RG5 outflow, soil water 32%, and base flow 38%. Snow was the dominant source water in June, soil water was the dominant water source in July, and base flow was the dominant source in September. Enrichment of 6180 from -10 parts per thousand in the outflow of the rock glacier compared to -20 parts per thousand. in snow and enrichment of deuterium excess from + 17.5 parts per thousand. in rock glacier outflow compared to +11 parts per thousand in snow, suggests that melt of internal ice that had undergone multiple melt/freeze episodes was the dominant source of base flow.

J	Baresel, C; Destouni, G				Baresel, Christian; Destouni, Georgia			Estimating subsurface nitrogen accumulation-depletion in catchments by input-output flow analysis	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	EGU General Assembly	APR 24-29, 2005	Vienna, AUSTRIA	IAHS, ICWRS, HELP		input-output analysis; nitrogen accumulation-depletion; water quality; transport pathways	TRANSPORT; SWEDEN	We use input-output analysis of nitrogen flows between various sources-sectors and natural waters in the Swedish Norrstrom drainage basin for investigating and bounding the implication range of some uncertainty sources for results of subsurface nitrogen accumulation-depletion in this basin. We quantify different possible base and extreme assumptions of nitrogen discharges and transport pathways from agriculture to surface and groundwater in the basin. The results are robust in showing considerable nitrogen accumulation-depletion flow interactions taking place between the basin's mobile water and accumulated nitrogen pools in soils, sediments and/or relatively immobile subsurface water zones for all different scenario assumptions. Similar scenario robustness is also found in resulting relative contributions of different active nitrogen source-sectors to nitrogen flows in natural water systems. In the Norrstrom basin, and possibly more generally, nitrogen accumulation-depletion flows to and from accumulated legacies for the future or from the past appear therefore to be more important for water quality than current nitrogen discharges from active source-sectors.

In addition, it is possible to predict the degree of contamination and establish planning strategies in the management of the water resources for the river basin in issue. The used methodology was based in the quantitative expression of water quality. Three samplings were made (2005-2006) and Dissolved Oxygen, Coliform in feaces, pH. Oxygen Biochemical Demand, Nitrates, Total Phosphorus, Turbidity and Dissolved Total Solids were determined. To predict integral water quality (IWQ), a Multiple regression analysis between IWQ and the eight parameters was made. Later on, behavior patterns were identified and mathematical models were developed for each variable. Results indicate that water quality for urban, the drinking water, fishtank and agricultural uses was of medium quality (WQI = 50-69) in 29% of the sampling sites within the hydrologic basin of the Amajac River. At the same time, 59% of the locations were of bad quality (IWQ = 30-49). Finally, 12% of the sites were highly contaminated (lWQ < 30). The best fit for the analyzed parameters was obtained with the cubic models.

It can be used for prediction and improve the water quality. The WAHMO numerical water quality model was applied to simulate the behavior of phosphate, predicted the effects of different nonpoint loadings and point discharges on water quality. Simulation results indicated that phosphate is the limiting nutrient for algal production and the phosphate concentration accumulated in tip pollutant discharge area of the Bay. This indicated that the phosphate concentration in the tip area of this Bay provided an index for clean up. The simulation results also indicated that the quality of the Bay could reach the standard if the discharge load to the Bay be reduced by 15%. The same goal might be accomplished by move the discharge point from the existing Area # 15 to Area #1 due to the increase of water circulation and exchange. Simulation result could be a basis for coastal management in Dalian Bay.

Phosphorous is often bound to iron, aluminum and calcium compounds or to clay mineral surfaces in different inorganic forms. The organic P is found in a more labile form or in a refractory form Which is difficult to release during mineralization and thus, permanently buried in the sediment. Aluminum sulphate (Alum) is an effective reagent used to bind and precipitate P in hardwater lakes. It was found that the frequency and severity of phytoplankton blooms decreased with alum-induced reductions in hypolimnetic P where the effectiveness of treatment can last up to 14 years. Iron salts are also effective in hindering P releases. Fe (III) was found to be more effective in binding and stabilizing P in the sediment than Fe (II). However, vivianite (ferrous phosphate) is more prevalent in many lake bottoms due to the redox conditions. This leads to a simple technique where aeration can be applied simultaneously during the immobilization process with iron addition to increase hypolimnetic DO concentrations and decrease sediment P release. Lime is also one of best reagents in the immobilization of P for economical purpose in hard water lakes. Adding Lime into the lake can cause over saturation of Ca2+ in the water column and make P precipitate into the sediment as hydroxyapatite. The hydroxyapatite in sediments will continue to adsorb P and prevent the release of phosphate into the upper layer water. Internal release may occur by the potentially mobilization of particularly loosely sorbed organic and inorganic fractions, as well as the iron-bound and redox-sensitive sorption of P.

Thus, the Korean government tries to solve these problems through policies that prevent water pollution; however, it is still difficult to mention whether such measures are lowering pollution to an acceptable level. In this paper, we simulated the rates of dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (T-N), and total-phosphorous (T-P) using the ecosystem model which is a combination of the 3-dimension hydrodynamic model and the material cycle model, we did simulations using a specific set of parameters and did comparative analysis to determine those most appropriate for the actual environmental characteristics of Ulsan Bay. Through the simulation was successful, making it now possible to predict the likelihood of coastal construction projects causing ecological damage, such as eutrophication and red tide. Our model can also be used in the environmental impact assessment (EIA) of future development projects in the ocean.

A study was conducted to characterise DOP in water extracts and soil P fractions of lysimeter soils (pasture before and after, and cultivated soil after leaching to simulate a wet winter-autumn) from a field trial. Data on DOP in drainage waters from the field trial were also generated. In water extracts, used as a surrogate for soil solution and drainage water, 70-90% of the total dissolved P (TDP) concentration was made up of DOP, of which 40% was hydrolysable by phosphatase enzymes. Proportions of hydrolysable DOP to TDP in drainage waters of the field trial were less than in water extracts due to enhanced DRP loss via dung inputs, but still large at 35% of DOP. Analysis of lysimeter soils by sequential fractionation indicated that several organic P fractions changed with land use and due to leaching. Further investigation using NaOH-EDTA extracts and P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated that the greatest changes were a decrease in the concentrations of orthophosphate diester P and an increase in orthophosphate monoester P. This was attributed to mineralization by cultivation and plant roots and also to the leaching of mobile diester P. This study suggests that in such soils with a dynamic soil organic P pool, the concentration of readily bioavailable P in soil solution and drainage waters and the potential to impair surface water quality cannot be determined from the DRP concentration alone.

This practice may lead to P buildup in soils, hence, increased P runoff potential, making soil P management of concern in continuous wheat production. At present, there is also debate over the nature of P loss trends, particularly whether soil P release to runoff can be described generally, across a broad range of soils, or is soil-specific. Paired I m by 2 in runoff plots were established on three existing long-term continuous winter wheat fertility experiments. Two experiments have received annual fertilizer P application at different rates since 1970 (0-44 kg P ha(-1)), and the third received a one-time P application at much higher rates in 1977 (0-587 kg P ha(-1)). Rainfall-runoff experiments were conducted following the National P Research Project protocol. Simulated rain (75 mm h(-1)) produced 30 min of runoff front plots with different soil test P levels. Soil Mehlich-3 P (M3P) ranged from 11.5 to 130 mg kg(-1) and water-soluble P (WSP) ranged front 0.70 to 15.7 mg kg(-1). Runoff total P and dissolved reactive P (DRP) concentrations ranged front 0.47 to 1.5 and 0.03 to 0.70 mg L-1, respectively. Dissolved reactive P in runoff was significantly related to M3P, WSP, and ammonium oxalate P saturation index (PSI..) for combined soils as well as for individual soil series. Significant differences (p < 0.05) among the slopes of the regressions for the DRP-M3P, DRP-WSP, and DRP-PSIox relationships indicate that the relationships are soil specific. This study highlights the need for soil specific management to protect water quality.

Evaluation of epic for assessing crop yield, runoff, sediment and nutrient losses from watersheds with poultry litter fertilization	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE			English	Article						animal manure; crop yield; EPIC model; nutrient loss; runoff; sediment loss; water quality	IMPACTS; EROSION; MODEL; FLOW; PRODUCTIVITY; UNCERTAINTY; MANAGEMENT; VERTISOL; MANURE	Faced with limited comprehensive data on the economic, agronomic, and environment effects of land-applying animal wastes, water quality models are increasingly used to explore management and policy alternatives. However, thorough evaluation of these models is needed to assess their predictive ability for this resource issue. The EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate) model version 3060 was evaluated using data collected from six cultivated small watersheds (4.0 to 8.4 ha) near Riesel, Texas. The study watersheds were fallow in 2001, cropped with corn (Zea mays L.) in 2002 and 2003, and planted to winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in 2004. A target poultry litter application rate from 0 to 13.4 Mg ha(-1) was randomly assigned to each of the watersheds. Monthly data of runoff, sediment, and soluble P for 2001-2002 from one watershed (Y13) were used to calibrate the initial CN2, erosion control practice factor, RUSLE C factor coefficient, and phosphorus sorption ratio. The modeling efficiency (EF) for the calibrated period was 0.90 for runoff, 0.65 for sediment, and 0.94 for soluble P. EPIC was validated using the 2001-2004 measured data for the other five watersheds and the remaining data for Y13. It successfully predicted surface runoff on an annual, monthly, and daily basis for all watersheds, with EF values larger than 0.5 and R-2 larger than 0.7. The sediment, organic N and P, soluble P, and NO3-N losses simulated by EPIC were satisfactory, with EF values ranging from 0.59 to 0.87 based on annual comparisons and larger than 0.4 (in 25 out of 30 tests) based on monthly comparisons. EF was 0.96 for crop yields. Paired t-tests based on monthly comparisons of runoff, sediment and nutrient losses, and annual crop yields indicated that the differences between predicted and observed values were not significantly different from zero at the significance level of a = 0.05, except for soluble P losses for the control watershed. Both parametric and nonparametric statistical tests for EF values of monthly comparisons of runoff, sediment and nutrient losses, and percent errors of crop yields indicated that the reliability of the model was not significantly different among the poultry litter application watersheds and the control watershed, with the exception of soluble P losses for the control watershed. These statistical tests indicate that EPIC was able to replicate the runoff, water quality, and crop yield impacts of poultry litter application.

Cathryn			Chloride as an indicator of non-point source contaminant migration in a shallow alluvial aquifer	WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA			English	Article						hyporheic zone; chloride; alluvial aquifer; water quality	SUBSURFACE WATER EXCHANGE; STREAM; DISCHARGE; SEEPAGE; VARIABILITY; TRANSPORT; NITROGEN; QUALITY; ONTARIO; AREA	Non-point source (NPS) contamination in the context of surface and ground water interaction was investigated in the Elbow River, Alberta, Canada. Groundwater flow direction, water table elevation, baseflow recession, chloride, nitrate and microbiological measurements were made to determine the interaction of several small tributaries and a small hamlet with Elbow River-associated groundwater. Groundwater flow in the alluvial aquifer adjacent to the Elbow River is predominantly sub-parallel to the river, but can vary seasonally by as much as 30 degrees. Bedrock constricts the alluvial aquifer downgradient of the tributaries and the hamlet, causing groundwater to emerge into the Elbow River at this point. Chloride mass flux estimates suggest that septic effluent from the hamlet enters the groundwater immediately downgradient of the hamlet and discharges to the river from 5 to 12 km downgradient. A tributary creek which joins the Elbow River just above the bedrock constriction also contributes significant chloride to the river, and had significantly higher bacterial loads than the Elbow River, suggesting that land uses on this creek are also a significant source of contamination. Geologic sources, cattle grazing on the alluvial aquifer, road salting, golf course fertilizer use and wildlife are also potential contaminant sources.

J	Hart, RC				Hart, RC			Phytoplankton dynamics and periodicity in two cascading warm-water reservoirs from 1989 to 1997 - taxonomic and functional (C-S-R) patterns, and determining factors	WATER SA			English	Article						algae; plankton; dynamics; community assemblage; reservoir limnology; water quality; biomonitoring	HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS; TROPODIAPTOMUS-SPECTABILIS; METADIAPTOMUS-MERIDIANUS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; TURBID RESERVOIR; SOUTH-AFRICA; AUSTRALIA; CYANOBACTERIA; LAKES; CYLINDROSPERMOPSIN	The composition and abundance of distinctive planktonic autotrophs ( ca 60 taxa) were examined at roughly fortnightly intervals in two sizeable reservoirs ( Midmar and Albert Falls) on the uMngeni River, KwaZulu- Natal, between 1989 and 1997. The dynamics of community structure and abundance were examined in both taxonomic and functional ( C- S- R) terms in relation to physical abiotic variables ( thermal stratification, light climate, water level) and biotic influences of predation (zooplankton abundance). Annual periodicity was exhibited by most taxa apart from Cryptomonas, although patterns tended to be indistinct and inter-annual repeatability was generally weak - in line with year-to- year and between-system environmental variability. Water level fluctuation, with concomitant change in stratification intensity and hydraulic mixing and accompanying changes in water clarity associated with suspended sediment levels was clearly a major ( direct and indirect) determinant of phytoplankton composition and abundance. The influence of top-down controls as inferred from phytoplankton- zooplankton relationships was fundamentally different in the two reservoirs - potentially stimulatory in Midmar, but clearly regulatory in Albert Falls, where episodic collapses of Daphnia populations resulted in chlorophyll values well into the eutrophic level range. In addition to annual patterns, changes in chlorophyll content implied progressive long-term changes in trophic status, especially in Albert Falls, with the emergence of various 'new' taxa (and/ or higher peak densities of others). Consideration of phytoplankton dynamics in terms of functional groups offers certain advantages over conventional phyletic taxonomic analyses, although algal response forecasting by either approach appears potentially constrained by hydrological variability. Site-specific bio-monitoring, possibly using new rapid technologies, is likely to be necessary for ongoing management purposes until predictive capabilities under regionally characteristic conditions improve. Despite limitations, functional classification proffers faster advances to this end than conventional taxonomic appraisal.

Estimation of solids loadings to rainfall-runoff unit operations using a unit pollutograph concept for source area watersheds	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Urban Drainage	AUG 21-26, 2005	Copenhagen, DENMARK	IWA IAHR Joint Comm Urban Drainage		hydrograph; pluviograph; pollutograph; solids; source area; urban drainage; urban runoff	STORM-WATER; HYDROGRAPH	Source area watershed in the built environment deliver significant loads of solids and constituents such as metals, organics and phosphorus associated with solids. The ability to model the mass delivery process of solids in small urban watersheds is essential for advancement of rainfall-runoff quantity and quality control design in the built environment. In this study the hydrologic concepts of the unit hydrograph (UH) and instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH) were used to support the concepts of a unit pollutograph (UP) and an instantaneous unit pollutograph (IUP). These latter two concepts were developed as analogous concepts for estimation of solids mass transport loading as a pollutograph from source area watersheds. Relationships between solids mass and hydrologic volume were based on relationships that expressed either a first-order or zero-order relationship between solids mass and volumetric transport. The resulting concepts were applied to historical rainfall-runoff events where the hydrologic and water quality measurements had been conducted. From this development a site mean IUH and IUP determined from the rainfall-runoff record and water quality data, the corresponding site mean UH and UP were developed for solids. The hydrographs and solid pollutographs generated by convolution of the UH and UP compared well with measurements, indicating the feasibility of the concept.

The study site is the largest polder project area in Korea and its environmental quality has been debated for the last five years. BASINS was found to be a convenient and powerful tool for assessment of watershed characteristics, and provided various tools to delineate the watershed into land segments and river reaches, reclassify land use, and parameterize for WinHSPF simulation. Calibration results were satisfactory showing model efficiency over 0.80 for stream flow, temperature, and dissolved oxygen simulation, and model output for water quality constituents also reasonably matched the observed data. It was demonstrated that calibration with dry-day data for a relatively long period might be adequate to simulate hydrologic characteristics and water quality of the watershed with WinHSPF, and using parameters generated with BASINS for nonpoint source pollution simulation is suggested when enough wet-day monitoring data are not available. The unit-area load of biochemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus was 27.8, 48.2, and 4.3 kg/ha/yr, respectively. These values are within the expected range but on the high side of the reported values, which implies that effective control measures are required to protect water quality of the downstream reservoir. Overall, BASINS/WinHSPF was applicable and found to be a powerful tool in pollutant loading estimation from the watershed, and its use in Korea is recommended.

Using a GIS transfer model to evaluate pollutant loads in the Lake Kinneret watershed, Israel	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th IWA Specialist Conference on Watershed and River Basin Management	SEP 13-18, 2005	Calgary, CANADA	IWA		BMP; diffuse pollution; GIS; watershed		Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee) is the only large surface water body in Israel, encompassing an area of 167km(2) and supplying some 30% of the country's fresh water. Pollution from anthropogenic sources and water abstraction for domestic and agricultural uses has long been threatening the water quality of the lake. Point-source pollution in the watershed has decreased drastically with the development of wastewater treatment. However, diffuse pollution from agricultural activities is still an unresolved issue. In this paper we present an application of AVGWLF (a GIS-based watershed load model) to the Lake Kinneret watershed. The model allows one to simulate daily stream flows and monthly sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loads discharged to the lake from the surrounding watershed. Results from simulations yield a satisfactory correspondence between simulated and measured daily water volume. Partition by source of total phosphorus delivered to the lake in the period of 2000-04 confirms the reduction in point source nutrient contribution due to improvement of wastewater treatment facilities in the area. Future management should focus on reduction of nutrients originating from septic systems (point sources) and pasture and cropland areas (diffuse sources). Results from simulations will enable watershed managers to prioritize effective management alternatives for protecting the water quality in the lake.

The recycling ratio of outflow water (proportion of outflow reused) was 13.5%. The nitrogen (N) outflow load was reduced by about 45 kg ha(-1) by the N removal function of the paddy field and by about 39 kg ha(-1) by the recycling irrigation facility. The paddy field equipped with a recycling irrigation facility as an N removal facility was valued at 32.6 million Japanese yen (JPY) ha(-1) and 0.72 million JPY ha(-1) per year, which compare it with the construction and maintenance costs, respectively, of a water quality improvement facility. The recycling irrigation facility was costed at 17.3 million JPY ha(-1) for construction and 0.21 million JPY ha(-1) for maintenance per year. The cost for constructing and maintaining a recycling irrigation facility was 53% of the value of the paddy field area equipped with a recycling irrigation facility as an N removal facility.

The model approaches used for this article are based on work of Rauch et al. and the River Water Quality Model No. 1; they allow the simulation of the nitrogen conversion in the River Wupper. They are compatible with the activated sludge models and can thus be used also for integrated approaches. The calibration and validation of the model was realized using actual data of the River Wupper over a length of 60 km with one dam, 10 weirs, three wastewater treatment plants and 11 tributaries. The model considers the nitrogen conversion and COD removal and has a strong focus on biofilm processes in the benthic zone. Additional information is given about the sedimentation processes, the physical oxygen input processes, biofilm detachment processes, molecular diffusion, the influence of the laminar border layer and the changing of COD fractions and biofilm densities.

Surplus N leaches during lengthy periods where annual crop systems are used in temperate regions. This paper presents a model to estimate the surplus N available for leaching to ground water beneath agricultural systems and applies the model to watersheds in an intensive maize and soybean production system. The model utilizes commonly available georeferenced data on soils, crops, and livestock, making it applicable to watersheds in many regions. The model links stocks of N in soil, crops, livestock, fertilizer and the atmosphere. Nitrogen flow centers on exchange between the soil N stocks. Nitrogen mineralization rates are defined for three soil organic matter pools, crop residue, and manure based on carbon:N ratios. Nitrogen exports from the system are harvested crops, livestock and losses to the atmosphere. Application of the model in 26 Iowa watersheds finds surpluses of 18 to 43 kg-N/ha. Surpluses exceeded measured annual nitrate-N loads in regional streams by amounts equivalent to denitrification rates in groundwater. Deficits in soil N were sufficiently small to suggest that the system is in equilibrium with soils of the region.

J	Nakajima, J; Murata, Y; Sakamoto, M				Nakajima, J; Murata, Y; Sakamoto, M			Comparison of several methods for BAP measurement	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th IWA International Conference on Diffuse/Nonpoint Pollution	OCT 25-29, 2004	Kyoto, JAPAN	IWA		bacterial respiration; bioavailable phosphorus; eutrophication; lake water management; oxygen uptake rate; phosphate analysis	ALGAL-AVAILABLE PHOSPHORUS; BIOAVAILABLE PHOSPHORUS; AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF; SOIL; BIODEGRADATION; WATER	It has been more important for management of water quality to estimate the amount of bioavailable phosphorus (BAP) in suspended solids (SS) entering lakes and estuaries. AGP test or extraction by 0.1 mol l(-1) NaOH (C-BOD) is widely used. Recently, highly bioavailable phosphorus (HBAP) was introduced to indicate a more easily soluble and bioavailable fraction using successive extraction by 0.1 mol l(-1) HCI and 0.1 mol l(-1) NaOH. New biologically measured BAP (B-BAP) using bacterial respiration activity was introduced in this paper. B-BAP was estimated from oxygen uptake rate (OUR), which was measured by a respiratory meter for BOD measurement using a pressure sensor. B-BAP is useful for a rapid and direct measurement of phosphorus bioavailability. B-BAP, HBAP and C-BAP in river SS were measured and compared with each other. The percentages of HBAP and B-BAP to PP were large in the urban river, while the percentage of NaOH-P or C-BAP was large in the rivers flowing in agricultural areas. By comparison with phosphorus fractions in paddy soil and activated sludge it was suggested that SS in the rivers flowing in agricultural areas mainly consisted of clay, silt or sand, while the SS in the urban river consisted of a large percentage of organic particles as well. Phosphorus in SS was suggested to be more easily bioavailable in the urban river than the rivers in agricultural areas. The ratio of C-BAP/B-BAP was large in the rivers in agricultural areas and small in the urban river. As HBAP contents were almost similar to B-BAP contents in the river SS, HBAP can be a suitable index of phosphorus indicating easily and rapidly the bioavailable fraction in SS.

Through the atmospheric dispersion process, air pollutants move from the Taipei metropolitan to the Feitsui reservoir and enter the water body through dry and wet depositions. ISCST3 (industrial Source Complex Short Term Model), an air quality model, was used to simulate dispersion, dry deposition and wet deposition of the air pollutants. Then the nitrogen loadings to the Feitsui Reservoir were evaluated. The results indicate that wet deposition places a greater burden than dry deposition does on the water body. Wet and dry deposition of NH4+ together make up a rather large proportion of the total pollution. The ratio ranged from 21.9 to 25.2%. Those of nitrate make up a smaller proportion, ranged from 2.0 to 2.3%. If we take indirect deposition into account and calculate the NO3- and NH4+ together, the proportion is 15.9-17.6%.

The RZWQM model is a one-dimensional dual porosity model that allows flow in macropores. It integrates the physical, biological and chemical processes occurring in the root zone, allowing the simulation of a wide spectrum of agricultural management practices. This study involved the evaluation of the soil, hydrologic and crop development sub-models within the RZWQM for two distinct agricultural systems, one consisting of a grain corn planted in a silty loam soil, irrigated by level basins and the other a forage corn planted in a sandy soil, irrigated by sprinklers. Evaluation was performed at two distinct levels. At the first level the model capability to fit the measured data was analyzed (calibration). At the second level the model's capability to extrapolate and predict the system behavior for conditions different than those used when fitting the model was assessed (validation). In a subsequent paper the same type of evaluation is presented for the nitrogen transformation and transport model. At the first level a change in the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) formulation was introduced, based upon the definition of the effective leaf area, resulting in a 51% decrease in the root mean square error of the ETc simulations. As a result the simulation of the root water uptake was greatly improved. A new bottom boundary condition was implemented to account for the presence of a shallow water table. This improved the simulation of the water table depths and consequently the soil water evolution within the root zone. The soil hydraulic parameters and the crop variety specific parameters were calibrated in order to minimize the simulation errors of soil water and crop development. At the second level crop yield was predicted with an error of 1.1 and 2.8% for grain and forage corn, respectively. Soil water was predicted with an efficiency ranging from 50 to 95% for the silty loam soil and between 56 and 72% for the sandy soil. The purposed calibration procedure allowed the model to predict crop development, yield and the water balance terms, with accuracy that is acceptable in practical applications for complex and spatially variable field conditions. An iterative method was required to account for the strong interaction between the different model components, based upon detailed experimental data on soils and crops. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

However, insufficient attention has been given to evaluating the uncertainties inherent to this type of model, especially those associated with the spatial disaggregation of the catchment. The Integrated Nitrogen in Catchments model (INCA) is subjected to an extensive regionalised sensitivity analysis in application to the River Kennet, part of the groundwater-dominated upper Thames catchment, UK The main results are: (1) model output was generally insensitive to land-phase parameters, very sensitive to groundwater parameters, including initial conditions, and significantly sensitive to in-river parameters; (2) INCA was able to produce good fits simultaneously to the available flow, nitrate and ammonium in-river data sets; (3) representing parameters as heterogeneous over the catchment (206 calibrated parameters) rather than homogeneous (24 calibrated parameters) produced a significant improvement in fit to nitrate but no significant improvement to flow and caused a deterioration in ammonium performance; (4) the analysis indicated that calibrating the flow-related parameters first, then calibrating the remaining parameters (as opposed to calibrating all parameters together) was not a sensible strategy in this case; (5) even the parameters to which the model output was most sensitive suffered from high uncertainty due to spatial inconsistencies in the estimated optimum values, parameter equifinality and the sampling error associated with the calibration method; (6) soil and groundwater nutrient and flow data are needed to reduce. uncertainty in initial conditions, residence times and nitrogen transformation parameters, and long-term historic data are needed so that key responses to changes in land-use management can be assimilated. The results indicate the general, difficulty of reconciling the questions which catchment nutrient models are expected to answer with typically limited data sets and limited knowledge about suitable model structures. The results demonstrate the importance of analysing semi-distributed model uncertainties prior to model application, and illustrate the value and limitations of using Monte Carlo-based methods for doing so.

The interactions among these two landscape-scale factors on streams are, however, poorly understood. To determine the effects of these factors on stream flow, sediment, and nutrients, we analyzed 72 ungaged, agricultural watersheds in Minnesota and Michigan using the hydrologic model SWAT (the Soil Water Assessment Tool). The watersheds differed in surficial geology (landform) and land use, but were of similar size, with streams ranging from 2(nd) to 3(rd) stop order. SWAT was developed for use on ungaged basins, but to improve the outputs we used US Geological Survey discharge data from sites near our study watersheds for calibration. We found seasonal and annual differences in flow and nutrient and sediment loading across different land forms and land use types. Watersheds with greater amounts of row-crop agriculture and watersheds dominated by morainal landforms were associated with more sediment and nutrients and greater flow volumes and flashiness. Multivariate analyses identified at least nine landscape variables which were related to nutrients, sediment, and flow, although the responses varied between Minnesota and Michigan. Results also indicated the possibility of a threshold effect for row crop agricultural. Increases in this land use had little additional effect on nutrients or flow when percent row crop exceeds the threshold value. At moderate to high levels of row crop agriculture, watersheds appeared to show greater sensitivity to differences in landform.

J	Liu, WC				Liu, WC			Water column light attenuation estimation to simulate phytoplankton population in tidal estuary	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY			English	Article						light attenuation; phytoplankton; Danshuei River-Keelung River estuary; secchi depth; salinity; suspended sediment; Taiwan	TANSHUI RIVER; QUALITY	The penetration of sunlight into the water column plays a critical role in the aquatic ecosystem. The irradiance available for primary production in a water body depends on the incident light at the water surface, light extinction in the water column, and depth. In this study, the light attenuation through the water column of the Danshuei River-Keelung River estuary was estimated. The measurement of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) indicates that the conventional exponential attenuation of light with depth is a very good model. A light attenuation coefficient may be derived from the PAR measurements at each location. The regression with salinity yields a good correlation, indicating that the fraction of seawater should be a good parameter for estimating the water column light attenuation coefficient (K-d ). A laterally averaged two-dimensional finite difference model for hydrodynamic and water quality model was performed and applied to simulate the phytoplankton population at the lower reach of the Danshuei River estuary. In the process of phytoplankton population simulation, the regression model of K-d and salinity was incorporated in the water quality model. The simulated results show that the modeled concentration of chlorophyll a matched the measured values at the lower reach of the Danshuei River estuary.

This study introduces delayed fluorescence (DF) excitation spectroscopy as an on-line tool for in situ monitoring of the composition and biomass of various colour classes of phytoplankton when they are photosynthetically active (cyanobacteria, chlorophytes, chromophytes and cryptophytes). The DF data are validated by comparison with those from conventional methods (weekly microscopic counts and the measurement of chlorophyll concentration). 2. The composition of phytoplankton as assessed by DF agreed reasonably well with the results from microscopic counts, particularly when differences in chlorophyll-specific DF integrals of the various colour classes were taken into account. 3. Integrals of DF spectra were converted into concentration of chlorophyll a using empirical factors derived from field data. The value of the conversion factor was nearly twice as high when the relative abundance of cyanobacteria was low (< 15%) than when it was high. The converted DF-chl time series agreed well with chlorophyll measurements particularly when blooms were developing. As the DF method is inherently free of the interference caused by pigment degradation products, the discrepancy between the two data sets increased during the collapse of blooms and when sediment resuspension was intense. 4. Fourier spectrum analysis of the time series of DF-chl indicated that samples must be taken, at a minimum, every 2-3 days to capture the dynamics of phytoplankton. As a consequence, the dynamics of various algal blooms, including their timing, duration and net growth rate, could be estimated with greater confidence than by using conventional methods alone. 5. On-line DF spectroscopy is an advanced technique for monitoring daily the biomass and composition of the photosynthetically active phytoplankton in aquatic environments, including turbid shallow lakes. At present, the detection limit is around 1 mg DF-chl a m(-3) in terms of total biomass but confidence in estimates of phytoplankton composition declines sharply below about 5 mg chl a m(-3). 6. On-line DF spectroscopy represents a promising approach for monitoring phytoplankton. It will be useful in water management where it can act as an early-warning system of declines in water quality. In basic ecological research it can supplement manual methods. While default calibration spectra may be acceptable for routine monitoring, we suggest a careful individual calibration of the DF spectrometer for basic research. The statistical methods developed here help to assess the adequacy of various calibration sets.

Three of the golf courses were fresh water courses, three were courses scheduled to transition to reuse water during the study period and three were long term users of reuse water. Salinity [electrical conductivity (EC)], NO3 (-)-N, PO4-P, pH, algal chlorophyll concentration, clarity, temperature, oxygen, and all major cations and anions were analyzed on a monthly basis. A selected fairway on each course was equipped with water meters to assess irrigation volumes on a bimonthly basis. Estimates of salt and NO 3 --N loading on fairways were made by weighting irrigation volumes with concentrations of salt (assuming 700 mg-L-1 per dS-m(-1)) and NO3--N measured in the irrigation ponds. Pond spectral reflectance measurements were obtained on a single monitoring day and correlated with water quality parameters. EC, temperature, NO3--N, PO4-P,algal chlorophyll concentration and clarity all demonstrated significant changes in all irrigation ponds that transitioned to reuse water (p < 0.05). Multiple regression analysis revealed that as much as 75% of the variability in pH in some irrigation ponds could be accounted for based on water quality parameters measured, with higher R-2 values associated with elevated HCO-(3), concentrations. Spectral reflectance (individual wave bands and spectral indices) was shown to be correlated with pH, clarity and algal chlorophyll concentration (R-2 = 0.66** to 0.82***) with a well defined threshold relationship between clarity and the spectral index R705/R670. Average yearly NO3- -N loads on fairways averaged 8.5 kg-ha(-1)-yr(-1) on fresh water courses, 86.5 kg-ha(-1)-yr(-1) on transition courses and 209.8 kg-ha(-1)-yr(-1) on long term reuse courses (all significantly different at p = 0.05). Average yearly salt loads on fairways averaged 11,959 kg-ha(-1)-yr(-1) on fresh water courses, 14,675 kg-ha(-1)-yr(-1) on transition courses and 27,445 kg-ha(-1)-yr(-1) on long term reuse courses (long term significantly different atp = 0.05). Such results indicate that significant attention must be given to irrigation strategies used on reuse irrigated golf courses to properly manage for higher nitrogen and salt loads.

In the present work, extensive water quality surveys were done to estimate the nutrient outflow from three small agricultural watershed of the Kali Basin, Uttar Pradesh, India. A total of 576 field data sets have been collected during March 1999-February 2000 from four sampling stations. During the monsoon period the nutrient outflow from these agricultural watersheds were found to be orders of magnitude higher than during the nonmonsoon period. The percentage of nutrients outflow from each watershed was estimated on a monthly basis by obtaining periodical cropping patterns and the amounts of fertilizer applied for each watershed. A maximum of 85% of total nitrate and 70% of total orthophosphate applied in the field was found to be lost during the month of July from the third agricultural watershed having maximum slope and minimum watershed area. Using the data sets generated during field surveys, commonly used modeling approaches based on mass balance differential loading and decay fraction were tested for their applicability to estimate nonpoint source (NPS) pollution in the River Kali. The NPS concentration and load values computed from these approaches were compared with the NPS values measured in the field and the performances of different equations have been evaluated using error estimations such as standard error, normal mean error, mean multiplicative error, and correlation statistics. Further, a refined model based on reaction kinetics and mass balance differential loading has been proposed for the River Kali that minimizes error estimates and improves correlation between observed and computed nonpoint source loads.

J	Intarapapong, W; Hite, D; Isik, M				Intarapapong, W; Hite, D; Isik, M			Optimal profits under environmental constraints: Implications of nutrient and sediment standards	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						economics; nonpoint source pollution; water quality; nitrate; sediment; phosphorus	QUALITY	To reduce nonpoint source pollution from nutrient, chemical, and sediment runoff, a number of environmental policy standards have been proposed. Such standards could be used to reduce nonpoint source pollution from nutrient, chemical, and sediment runoff to impaired water bodies. State governments can use voluntary approaches to meet nonpoint source pollution reduction goals. However, the practices that lower net returns will not be voluntarily adopted by farmers. Crop rotations and tillage practices may help producers to comply with the environmental standards while minimizing losses in farm profits. This study compares runoff from crop rotation practices and conventional continuous row cropping systems in Mississippi. The results are compared for different tillage systems in order to examine robustness of results. Nutrient runoff and sediment runoff are simulated using the Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC). Sensitivity analysis of the sediment and nitrate reductions at 15 percent, 25 percent, and 35 percent are conducted. Under these scenarios, net returns are optimized under environmental constraints, and the marginal cost of sediment reduction ranges from US$1.61 to US$9.63 per ton depending on soil conditions, while the corresponding nitrate and phosphorus reductions costs range from US$1.21 to US$7.08 per kg and from US$0.09 to US$31.91, respectively. The empirical results from this study indicate that a nitrate reduction policy is relatively less costly than a sediment reduction policy. The results also demonstrate the importance of geophysical conditions and policy costs, which vary across regions.

This alteration has prompted the need for better understanding of C and N pathways through stream food webs. We added stable N-15-NH4, and C-13-acetate isotopes as tracers to experimental stream channels containing I of 4 key basal food resources: autotrophic epilithon, heterotrophic epilithon, fine particulate organic matter (FPOM), and coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM). Our goal was to evaluate the importance of these foods to 2 scrapers (Deleatidium sp. [mayfly] and Potamopyrgus antipodaruni [snail]) and a facultative shredder (Olinga feredayi [caddisfly]). A 511, potential food source, new heterotrophic biofilm, grew on all surfaces during the course of the experiment. Isotope levels in the food resources and the invertebrates were measured weekly during the 3-wk isotope addition and for 2 wk after the addition. Changes in nutrient concentrations between the channel inflows and outflows provided measures of instream net uptake. Net uptake of P by autotrophic epilithon (mean = 0.09-0.24 mg dissolved reactive P [DRP] m(-2) h(-1)) was 3X higher than uptake by other basal resources. Autotrophic epilithon removed substantial quantities of dissolved N, predominantly as NO3-N (2.1-9.3 mg NO3-N m(-2) h(-1)), whereas the other basal resource types removed only NH4-N at a rate that was 2 orders of magnitude slower (mean = 0.04-0.08 mg NH4-N m(-2) h(-1)) than uptake by autotrophic epilithon. NH4-N and dissolved organic C isotope tracers were taken up predominantly by heterotrophic epilithon and new biofilms. We developed a dynamic mixing model to separate the contribution to the invertebrates of each treatment food source relative to the new heterotrophic biolfilm. Mayflies obtained almost 100% of their body C and N from new biofilm except when offered autotrophic epilithon, which contributed > 50% to their diets. Olinga and Potamopyrgus obtained most of their C and N from the treatment food sources, but in the particulate organic matter treatments (FPOM and CPCM) the contribution of new biofilm was much larger (similar to 10-60%). Our results suggest that heterotrophic biofilms are a significant component of stream food webs.

J	Lopes, JF; Dias, JM; Cardoso, AC; Silva, CIV				Lopes, JF; Dias, JM; Cardoso, AC; Silva, CIV			The water quality of the Ria de Aveiro lagoon, Portugal: From the observations to the implementation of a numerical model	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						water quality; biochemical oxygen demand; dissolved oxygen; nutrients; numerical model; Ria de Aveiro lagoon		Ria de Aveiro is a very important area of the Portuguese coast, which has been under an increasing anthropogenic pressure for several decades and, contributes to the degradation of the lagoon's water quality. This work presents both a characterisation of the water quality of the Ria de Aveiro lagoon, using physical, chemical and biological experimental data, and an implementation of a numerical model for the water quality of the lagoon. The ultimate goal is to obtain an accurate numerical model able to simulate major water quality features of the lagoon under the influence of different forcing conditions. Data analysis reveals good correlations between the salinity and almost all the water quality variables as well as between the different variables. The maximum biochemical oxygen demand concentration (BOD) depends on the light intensity, the temperature and the river inputs. The main vulnerable areas of the lagoon, from the water quality point of view, seem to be the far end of the main channels, where low dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) and high BOD concentrations are observed. The numerical model of the Ria de Aveiro has reproduced both winter-spring and spring-summer events related to the lagoon water quality as well as its main pattern. Both data and modelling results show that the BOD5 concentrations (where the subscript '5' means that the BOD measurements were conducted for five days, without inhibitor of nitrification) are driven by the river influence, during the winter spring period, and by the biological activity during the spring summer period. The DO concentrations show high values in the spring-summer period and smaller concentrations in the winter-spring period at the far end of the lagoon. The application of the model to the study of scenarios has demonstrated the role of nutrients and light in the phytoplankton growth, the relationship between DO and phytoplankton concentrations, as well as the effect of the BOD degradation in the ammonia (NH4) regeneration.

J	Sheriff, G				Sheriff, G			Efficient waste? Why farmers over-apply nutrients and the implications for policy design	REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS			English	Article							SPLIT NITROGEN APPLICATION; WATER-QUALITY; MORAL HAZARD; POLLUTION; CORN; FERTILIZATION; UNCERTAINTY; INSURANCE; COSTS; YIELD	Understanding why farmers over-apply fertilizer is essential to designing effective agro-environmental policy. If farmers are simply inefficient, possibilities exist for simultaneously improving farm profits and the environment. If not, costly trade-offs are necessary This article examines why farmer perceptions of agronomic advice, input substitutability, hidden opportunity costs, uncertainty, and risk aversion can make it economically rational to "waste" fertilizer by applying it above agronomically recommended rates. I use this information to evaluate the relative merits of policy responses such as insurance, education, cost-shares, regulation, taxes, and land retirement.

Scientists (NRCS) developed a technique to estimate the impact of agricultural watersheds on natural water resources. The objectives were to apply the technique on Wagon Train (WT) watershed in Nebraska to predict: (i) loss of water by surface runoff and subsurface leaching, (ii) loss of nitrate-N from soils by runoff and leaching, and (iii) nitrate-N loading for WT reservoir. The annual loss of water was estimated at 4.32 million m(3) for runoff and 0.98 million m(3) for leaching. The observed annual inflow for WT reservoir was 4.25 million m(3). The predicted annual nitrate-N loss by runoff was about 7.0 Mg and could be considered the annual loading for the reservoir. The predicted nitrate-N loss by leaching was 7.73 Mg, however, the fate was not clear. The estimated average nitrate-N concentration in runoff and leaching water at field sites was 1.63 and 7.88 mg/L, respectively. The observed nitrate-N concentration in water samples taken from 12 major streams ranged between 0.37 and 1.56 mg/L with an average of 0.90 mg/L. Nitrogen uptake by algae, weeds, and aquatic plants and emission of gaseous nitrogen oxides from fresh water under reducing conditions might explain the lower nitrate-N concentration. No attempt was made to monitor the nitrate-N concentration in soil leachate or groundwater. When factors affecting N concentration in streams are considered, the technique could provide a reasonable estimation of N concentration in stream water. We concluded that the technique could be applied to estimate the loss of nitrate-N by runoff and leaching from soils and the impact on surface waters.

A nutrient budget box model was used to estimate the annual capacity of Kavala Gulf to store and transform dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, aiming at understanding the biogeochemical processes taking place in the area of interest. Point sources of nutrients from two municipal wastewater treatment plants (Kavala and Palio Seawage Treatment Works) and a phosphoric fertilizer producing industrial facility (PFP), as well as non-point sources from agricultural activities, seem responsible for the increased concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus. Seasonal N:P-ratios suggest that nitrogen is the limiting nutrient during the summer, autumn and winter and phosphorus during the spring. The annual nutrient budget model revealed that Kavala Gulf is presently slightly autotrophic with nitrogen fixation exceeding denitrification.

The conceptual ecological model presented here is a qualitative and minimal depiction of those ecosystem components and linkages that are considered essential for understanding historic changes in the bay ecosystem, the role of human activities as drivers of these changes, and how restoration efforts are likely to affect the ecosystem in the future. The conceptual model serves as a guide for monitoring and research within an adaptive management framework. Historic changes in Florida Bay that are of primary concern are the occurrence of seagrass mass mortality and subsequent phytoplankton blooms in the 1980s and 1990s. These changes are hypothesized to have been caused by long-term changes in the salinity regime of the bay that were driven by water management. However, historic ecological changes also may have been influenced by other human activities, including occlusion of passes between the Florida Keys and increased nutrient loading. The key to Florida Bay restoration is hypothesized to be seagrass community restoration. This community is the central ecosystem element, providing habitat for upper trophic level species and strongly influencing productivity patterns, sediment resuspension, light penetration, nutrient availability, and phytoplankton dynamics. An expectation of Everglades restoration is that changing patterns of freshwater flow toward more natural patterns will drive Florida Bay's structure and function toward its pre-drainage condition. However, considerable uncertainty exists regarding the indirect effects of changing freshwater flow, particularly with regard to the potential for changing the export of dissolved organic matter from the Everglades and the fate and effects of this nutrient source. Adaptive management of Florida Bay, as an integral part of Everglades restoration, requires an integrated program of monitoring, research to decrease uncertainties, and development of quantitative models (especially hydrodynamic and water quality) to synthesize data, develop and test hypotheses, and improve predictive capabilities. Understanding and quantitatively predicting changes in the nature of watershed-estuarine linkages is the highest priority scientific need for Florida Bay restoration.

To quantify more fully ecosystem dynamics in southern Kaneohe Bay, the Kaneohe Bay ECOsystem Model (KECOM) was developed. This model is a nine-compartment nitrogen cycle biogeochemical box model of the pelagic and benthic systems of the southern bay. The baseline quasi-steady state of the model produces a comparable net denitrification flux to that obtained by Hoover [Hoover, D., 2002. Fluvial nitrogen and phosphorus in Hawaii: storm runoff, land use, and impacts on coastal waters. Ph.D. Dissertation. University of Hawaii at Manoa, Oceanography] for the present-day N budget of southern Kaneohe Bay. The model describing solely the N cycle captured the general trends of changes in water quality parameters in response to a particular storm perturbation as observed by Ringuet and Mackenzie [Ringuet, S., Mackenzie, FT. Controls on nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics during normal flow and storm runoff conditions, southern Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. Estuaries, in press]; however, it did not entirely reproduce the timing and magnitude of the biological blooms that occurred along with the bay's recovery. The results point to the possible emergence of P-limitation as a factor influencing the bay's recovery from a large storm perturbation, as suggested by observations [Ringuet, S., Mackenzie, F.T. Controls on nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics during normal flow and storm runoff conditions, southern Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. Estuaries, in press]. The stability analysis of KECOM using a community matrix approach indicated that the instability of the benthic autotrophic biomass is caused by low grazing and/or high nutrient uptake rates due to high irradiance and potential growth rate. These two possible causes reinforce two competing hypotheses that were put forward from observational work to account for the causes of the currently observed spread of nuisance benthic macroalgae in Kaneohe Bay. Finally, the eigenanalysis of the community matrices of KECOM showed that the use of an unconventional, high power Michaelis-Menten function to describe biological assimilation and grazing kinetics was needed to stabilize the system, suggesting a future research direction involving quantification of the strength of assimilation and grazing feedbacks. In addition as anticipated, such a finding also indicates that the N cycle alone does not provide sufficient feedbacks within the Kaneohe Bay ecosystem, necessitating an ecosystem model describing all the feedbacks involving the coupled C, N and P cycles.

The impact of human development on stream water quality was evident as both agricultural area and population density predicted TSS loading in a linear mixed effects model. In contrast to the TSS model, the nitrate-N loading model was more complex with agriculture, grassland, and the presence or absence of waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) all contributing. The lack of correlation between population density and nitrate-N loading indicates that human habitation of the landscape does not impact stream nitrate levels until a WWTP is built within the sub-basin. During dry water years the models predict a linear reduction in TSS loading but the correlations to agriculture and population density remain positive. In contrast, nitrate is positively correlated to grasslands during average water years and negatively correlated during dry water years. Analysis of constituent fluxes from the upper watershed versus the lower watershed indicates that silica is derived primarily from the uplands and that during dry water years the upper watershed is an important source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate. The lower watershed contributes the majority of the sediment and nutrients during both dry and average water years, the one caveat being that during dry years the lower basin becomes a nitrate sink.

J	Feng, GL; Letey, J; Chang, AC; Mathews, MC				Feng, GL; Letey, J; Chang, AC; Mathews, MC			Simulating dairy liquid waste management options as a nitrogen source for crops	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						nitrate; manure; groundwater; organic nitrogen; mineralization; leaching	SOIL NITROGEN; WATER; MINERALIZATION	Large scale dairy operations are common. In many cases the manure is deposited on a paved surface and then removed with a flushing system, after which the solids are separated, the liquid stored in ponds, and eventually the liquid applied on adjacent crop land. Management of liquid manure to maximize the fertilizer value and minimize water quality degradation requires knowledge of the interactive effects of mineralization of organic N (ON) to NH4+, crop uptake of mineral N, and leaching of NO3- on a temporal basis. The purpose of the research was to use the ENVIRO-GRO model to simulate how the amount of applied N, timing of N application, ON mineralization rates, chemical form of N applied, and irrigation uniformity affected (1) yields of corn (Zea mays) in summer and a forage grass in winter in a Mediterranean climate and (2) the amount of NO3- leached below the root zone. This management practice is typical for dairies in the San Joaquin Valley of California. The simulations were conducted for a 10-year period. Steady state conditions, whereby an equivalent amount of N applied in the organic form will be mineralized in a given year, are achieved more rapidly for materials with high mineralization rates. Both timing and total quantity of N application are important in affecting crop yield and potential N leaching. Major conclusions from the simulations are as follows. Frequent low applications are preferred to less frequent higher applications. Increasing the amount of N application increased both the crop yield and the amount of NO3- leached. Increasing irrigation uniformity increased crop yields but had variable effects on the amount of NO3- leached. A winter forage crop following a summer corn crop effectively reduced the leaching of residual soil N following the corn crop. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A comprehensive description of the process and parameters used for calibrating the Root Zone Water Quality Model, v. 1.3.2004.213, is presented in this article. The model was calibrated to simulate tile drainage and leached nitrate under conventional tillage management practices for maize (Zea mays L.) production followed by a rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop in Cecil soils (kaolinitic, thermic, Typic Kanhapludults), and for cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) development in the Georgia Piedmont. Tile drainage and nitrate leaching were simulated within 15% of the observed values in the calibrated maize scenarios with and without the soil macroporosity option. Simulated and observed tile drainage and leached nitrate were not significantly different, and the simulated values were not significantly different with and without the macroporosity option. Simulated cotton biomass and leaf area index were well correlated with observed biomass and leaf area index until the last 21 d of the reproductive stage. Simulated and observed cotton water use were different by < 1 mm d(-1) based on A soil water in a 60-cm, profile during the critical peak bloom period. A detailed analysis of the calibration procedure and parameters used in this study will aid subsequent users of the model as well as aid in a subsequent evaluation of the model's performance for simulations of tile drainage and nitrate leaching in Georgia Piedmont cotton production systems.

J	Lindstrom, G; Rosberg, J; Arheimer, B				Lindstrom, G; Rosberg, J; Arheimer, B			Parameter precision in the HBV-NP model and impacts on nitrogen scenario simulations in the Ronnea River, Southern Sweden	AMBIO			English	Article							AUTOMATIC CALIBRATION; UNCERTAINTY; RUNOFF; CATCHMENTS; RETENTION; DYNAMICS; LOSSES; FIELDS	The HBV-NP model is a newly developed water quality model that describes the turnover and fluxes of both nitrogen and phosphorous. It is based on the conceptual precipitation/runoff HBV model. The HBV-NP model was applied for simulation of nitrogen for the Ronnea catchment in southern Sweden. The catchment was divided into 64 subcatchments in the model. Discharge measurements from six stations and nitrogen measurements from 12 stations were used in the calibration of parameters in the model. Eight automatic calibrations were performed with different combinations of time periods, objective functions, and levels of the nitrogen load in the model. A regionally extended interpretation of the Nash-Sutcliffe R-2 criterion was used in the calibration. In the evaluation of the criterion, the errors were summed over both time steps and sampling points. Scenario simulations of combined measures for reduction of nitrogen load into the sea by 30% were thereafter performed with the eight sets of parameters established by calibration. The model parameters were not uniquely defined by the calibration. However, the simulated relative reduction of nitrogen load into the sea was relatively insensitive to the choice of parameter set, given the available input sources, variables, and data.

J	Pers, BC				Pers, BC			Modeling the response of eutrophication control measures in a Swedish lake	AMBIO			English	Article							NUTRIENT LOAD; RINGSJON; PHOSPHORUS; PHYTOPLANKTON; SWEDEN; BIOMANIPULATION; VALIDATION; SIMULATION; SEDIMENT	The response of a biogeochemical lake model (BIOLA) to different eutrophication management actions has been studied in a eutrophic lake. Management actions included in the study were nutrient load reduction, sediment manipulation, biomanipulation, and herbicide application. The model was used to simulate nutrient and biomass concentrations in the lake during the 1990s. During the same period, management scenarios were also simulated. Several ecological parameters were calibrated to better simulate the behavior of the chosen lake, but there were still some difficulties with phosphate. This indicated that further model development is necessary. The most favorable development within the lake was found for scenarios with nutrient load reduction and biomanipulation through planktivorous fish reduction. Reducing both the nitrogen and phosphorus loads had a greater effect on the lake's water quality than simply reducing just one of the nutrients.

Additionally, biological response was modeled in the eutrophic Lake Ringsjon. The results are compared with similar studies on other catchments. All scenarios gave similar impact on water quality but varied in quantities. However, one scenario resulted in a different transport pattern due to less-pronounced seasonal variations in the hydrology. On average, the study shows that, in a future climate, we might expect: i) increased concentrations of nitrogen in the arable root zone (+50%) and in the river (+13%); ii) increased annual load of nitrogen from land to sea (+22%) due to more pronounced winter high flow; moreover, remote areas in the catchment may start to contribute to the outlet load; iii) radical changes in lake biochemistry with increased concentrations of total phosphorus (+50%), total nitrogen (+20%), and planktonic algae such as cyanobacteria (+80%).

Three consecutive 24-h cycles of measurements were performed with 8-14 samplings per day. Water samples were collected at the inlet and outlet of the pond and budgets were estimated from differences between inlet and outlet loadings. The first cycle was started when Ulva biomass was 8 kg m(-2), as wet weight. The second cycle was performed after the harvest of similar to 20% of the macroalgal biomass and the third after the harvest of another similar to 20% of the remaining biomass. Ulva removal was very fast (< 1 h) and samplings for cycles 2 and 3 were started two hours after harvesting, so that the whole experiment lasted similar to 80 h. When Ulva biomass was at its maximum, the aquatic system was heterotrophic with an O-2 demand of 519 mol d(-1) and a net regeneration of DIC (2686 mol d(-1)), NH4+ (49 mol d(-1)) and SRP (2.5 mol d(-1)). The DIC to O-2 ratio was an indicator of persistent anaerobic metabolism. Following the first harvest intervention, this system displayed a prompt response and shifted toward a lower Q, demand (from -519 to -13 mol d(-1)), with a lesser regeneration degree of NH4+ (11.4 mol d(-1)) and DIC (1066 mol d(-1)). After the second Ulva removal the net budget of SRP became negative (-1.0 mol d(-1)). By integrating these results over the three days cycle we estimated that in order to operate an efficient nutrient control and maintain macroalgal mats in a healthy status the optimal Ulva biomass should be well below similar to 4 kg m(-2) as wet weight. Above this threshold, self-limitation would render most of the algal mat unable to exploit light and nutrients. An efficient removal of nitrogen and phosphorus could be attained through the management of macroalgal biomass only with an optimisation of recipient surface to nutrient loading ratio.

J	Jana, BB; Sarkar, D				Jana, BB; Sarkar, D			Water quality in aquaculture - Impact and management: A review	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES			English	Review						aquaculture; physical-chemical factors; pond ecosystem; water quality	SEDIMENT; PHOSPHORUS; EFFICIENCY; PHOSPHATE; PONDS; LAKES	Water quality determines to a great extent the success or failure of a fish cultural operation Water is an inevitable medium for aqua farming, hence its quality has assumed a key role in aquaculture operations owing to its various interacting effects on the productivity of cultured animals. Effective management is of great significance in determining the success of aquaculture operation. This is particularly true for tropical ponds where deterioration of water quality is often encountered due to increasingly high rates of accumulation of organic matter in the pond bottom and its temperature induced decomposition in tropical ponds. As the pond ecosystems are basically cybernetic in nature, the stability of the system is achieved by the interplay of different subsystems of the ecosystem. In the present review, the role of physicalchemical factors such as temperature, dissolved gases, the CO2-CO3-HCO3 system, hardness, ammonium, nitrite, nitrate phosphate and other parameters, which that act on the biological production has been discussed. Different management strategies such as mechanical, chemical and biological treatments required to maintain desired water quality in aquaculture ponds for improved fish production as well as to the ecosystem health have also been highlighted. Some models used for water quality management have been reviewed.	Univ Kalyani, Kalyani 741235, W Bengal, India	Jana, BB (corresponding author), Univ Kalyani, Kalyani 741235, W Bengal, India.

The objective of this study was to develop a computer package called "IFAS" that allows steady-state simulation of IFAS wastewater treatment processes based on the International Association Water Quality general model for activated sludge and empirical equations for chemical oxygen demand (COD) uptake and nitrification on integrated fixed film developed at Virginia Tech. The current version of the IFAS program supports only sponge-type media; however, the model could be modified for other media if the appropriate equations and required parameters values are known. Data obtained from IFAS sponge media pilot scale plants treating a weak municipal wastewater supplemented by sodium acetate, urea, sodium bicarbonate, and potassium phosphates and operated at different aerobic mean cells residence times were used to evaluate the model with parameter values for nitrification and COD uptake rates developed in batch studies. The model-generated ammonia and soluble COD profiles were insignificantly different statistically from the experimental data. The IFAS model satisfactorily predicts carbonaceous removal and nitrification, and has the potential to be a useful tool for scientists and engineers seeking to design and optimize either IFAS or conventional biological nutrient removal activated sludge systems.

J	Nelson, NO; Parsons, JE; Mikkelsen, RL				Nelson, NO; Parsons, JE; Mikkelsen, RL			Field-scale evaluation of phosphorus leaching in acid sandy soils receiving swine waste	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; DRAINAGE WATER; LOSSES; BERMUDAGRASS; FORMS; SATURATION; PHOSPHATE; MOVEMENT; KINETICS; SORPTION	Accurate descriptions of P leaching are important because excess P applied to soils can enter surface water via leaching and subsurface transport, thereby negatively impacting water quality. The objectives of this study were to monitor P leaching in soils with a long-term history of waste application, relate soil solution P concentrations to soil P status, and quantify P leaching losses. Soil solution was monitored for 20 mo with samplers installed at 45-, 90-, and 135-cm depths in two pits (1 x 3 x 1.5 m) in Autryville (loamy, siliceous, thermic Arenic Paleudults) and Blanton (loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Grossarenic Paleudults) soils located in a grazed pasture in Sampson County, NC, which had received swine waste for > 20 yr. Maximum soil solution P concentrations at 45 cm exceeded 18 mg L-1 in both soils. Soil solution P concentrations at 90 cm in the Blanton soil were similar to that at 45 cm indicating low P sorption. Soil solution P concentrations at 90 cm in the Autryville soil averaged 0.05 mg L-1 compared to 10 mg L-1 at 45 cm. A split-line model related soil solution P concentration to the degree of phosphorus saturation (DPS), identifying a change point at 45% DPS. Phosphorus movement past 45 cm equaled or exceeded surplus P additions for both soils. Longterm waste applications resulted in DPS > 90%, high soil solution P concentrations, and substantial vertical P movement. Phosphorus leaching should be considered when assessing long-term risk of P loss from waste-amended soils.

J	Whitmire, SL; Hamilton, SK				Whitmire, SL; Hamilton, SK			Rapid removal of nitrate and sulfate in freshwater wetland sediments	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							IN-SITU DETERMINATION; FRINGING MARSH; NITROGEN; REDUCTION; DENITRIFICATION; AMMONIUM; TRACER; RATES; MICROORGANISMS; PERFORMANCE	Anaerobic microbial processes play particularly important roles in the biogeochemical functions of wetlands, affecting water quality, nutrient transport, and greenhouse gas fluxes. This study simultaneously examined nitrate and sulfate removal rates in sediments of five southwestern Michigan wetlands varying in their predominant water sources from ground water to precipitation. Rates were estimated using in situ push-pull experiments, in which 500 mL of anoxic local ground water containing ambient nitrate and sulfate and amended with bromide was injected into the near-surface sediments and subsequently withdrawn over time. All wetlands rapidly depleted nitrate added at ambient ground water concentrations within 5 to 20 h, with the rate dependent on concentration. Sulfate, which was variably present in porewaters, was also removed from injected ground water in all wetlands, but only after nitrate was depleted. The sulfate removal rate in ground water-fed wetlands was independent of concentration, in contrast to rates in precipitation-fed wetlands. Sulfate production was observed in some sites during the period of nitrate removal, suggesting that the added nitrate either stimulated sulfur oxidation, possibly by bacteria that can utilize nitrate as an oxidant, or inhibited sulfate reduction by stimulating denitrification. All wetland sediments examined were consistently capable of removing nitrate and sulfate at concentrations found in ground water and precipitation inputs, over short time and space scales. These results demonstrate how a remarkably small area of wetland sediment can strongly influence water quality, such as in the cases of narrow riparian zones or small isolated wetlands, which may be excluded from legal protection.

The objectives of this paper are twofold: (i) investigating the soil P status, distribution, and variability, both spatially and with soil depth, of two different first-order catchments; and (ii) determining variation in soil P concentration in relation to catchment topography (quantified as the "topographic index") and critical source areas (CSAs). The soil P measurements showed large spatial variability, not only between fields and land uses, but also within individual fields and in part was thought to be strongly influenced by areas where cattle tended to congregate and areas where manure was most commonly spread. Topographic index alone was not related to the distribution of soil P, and does not seem to provide an adequate indicator for CSAs in the study catchments. However, CSAs may be used in conjunction with soil P data for help in determining a more "effective" catchment soil P status. The difficulties in defining CSAs a priori, particularly for modeling and prediction purposes, however, suggest that other more "integrated" measures of catchment soil P status, such as baseflow P concentrations or streambed sediment P concentrations, might be more useful. Since observed soil P distribution is variable and is also difficult to relate to nationally available soil P data, any assessment of soil P status for determining risk of P loss is uncertain and problematic, given other catchment physicochemical characteristics and the sampling strategy employed.

The simultaneous corn and cover crop system was developed by U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) for dairy farms in the northeastern United States, where short growing seasons have limited fall seeding of cover crops. The simultaneous corn and cover crop system uses post-emergence imidazolinone herbicides to allow for simultaneous seeding of cover crops with silage corn. Trials were established at two locations in the Cannonsvitte Reservoir watershed, New York, part of New York City's drinking water supply system, to assess the effects of this cover cropping system on water quality. Rain simulations (60 mm hr(-1)) were conducted to evaluate the initial 30 minutes of runoff from small (1 X 2 m; 3 ft x 7 ft) plots before and after surface application of dairy manure (50 or 100 kg total P ha(-1); 45 or 89 lb P ac(-1)). Corn yields from plots interseeded with red clover compared most favorably with the conventionally cropped controls, with no significant differences in yields noted between the two treatments at either location. Prior to dairy manure application, losses of P in runoff were primarily a function of erosion. Because at[ cover crops increased ground cover (up to 81 percent greater than the control), total P loads in runoff were significantly lower from cover cropped plots (averaging 10 mg per plot) than from conventionally cropped controls (averaging 39 mg per plot). At the same time, suspended solids loads averaged 25.3 g (1 oz) from the control plots and 5.9 g (0.2 oz) from the cover crop plots. Despite concern that release of soluble P from the cover crops could enrich dissolved reactive P in runoff, dissolved reactive P losses from the simultaneous corn and cover crop system were generally not different from conventionally-cropped silage corn losses. Application of manure obscured cover crop/conventional silage corn treatment differences with regard to P runoff, with dissolved reactive P becoming the dominant form of P in runoff due to contributions of readily soluble P in manure. Because runoff P tosses were already high from unmanured conventional silage corn plots, application of manure did not significantly increase P losses from some of the conventional silage corn treatments. Results highlight the agronomic and water quality benefits of the simultaneous corn and cover crop system, particularly when implemented with red clover.

Yet, no standard, protocol, or method is available for guiding the selection of a water quality sampling strategy for runoff from fields and small watersheds. The objective of this study was to develop a methodology that provides guidance in the selection of a water quality sampling strategy for headwater streams (drainage areas less than 2500 ha; 6,177 ac). The developed method is based on the dimensionless unit hydrograph and relationships of measured pollutant concentrations to discharge hydrographs. The methodology was designed for storm events with a specific return interval and a selected acceptable level of error in pollutant load. Nine input parameters (hydraulic length, watershed slope, curve number, drainage area, runoff coefficient, 10-year, one hour precipitation amount, loo-year, one hour precipitation amount, 10 year, 24 hour precipitation amount, and recurrence interval) were used to develop the design hydrograph. Both time- and flow-paced sampling techniques were considered. A global sensitivity analysis of the method indicated that time-paced sampling was primarily sensitive to parameters included in the time of concentration calculation (hydraulic length, watershed slope, and curve number). Flow-paced sampling showed some sensitivity to all nine input parameters. An example application illustrates the utility of the method. Use of the method should facilitate the selection of water quality sampling strategies for field and small watershed scale studies and aid in budgetary planning for sample collection and analysis. The measurements taken based on the recommended sampling strategy will provide more confidence in the pollutant storm load estimates.

J	Gu, ZS; Yang, TX; Xu, Q				Gu, ZS; Yang, TX; Xu, Q			Application of element-free method to water quality analysis of Miyun reservoir	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES D-EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Miyun reservoir; water wuality analysis; element-free method		This paper presents a 3D mathematical model for transfer and transform of water contaminants in reservoir, describes the discrete methods and the compute process of using an element-free collocation method. By these models and methods, the water quality conditions of Miyun reservoir area, the quantified description of three dimensions concerning the distribution and change of diversified contaminants are obtained within the assigned time. The distributions of total nitrogen and total phosphorus of the reservoir area in 2003, 2004 and 2005 are simulated and forecasted by the boundary conditions in 2003, so the main development trend is shown. It is found through calculation that: The contribution of the bed mud with regard to total phosphorus is comparatively marked. On the whole, the influence factor of the bed mud in the reservoir area and other comprehensive factors to total phosphorus are quite great. The influence of the living things or other function in the surface water of the Chaohe River valley in the east of the reservoir on the total phosphorus is comparatively conspicuous. Within the reservoir area in spring, summer and autumn, the concentration distribution of total nitrogen is basically in the trend of a slow progressive decrease, but the concentration of total phosphorus increases progressively. It is just contrary in autumn, winter and spring, the concentration of total nitrogen increases and the concentration of total phosphorus decreases. On the whole of the year's development, the total nitrogen is basically in a steady state, and the total phosphorus is in the increasing trend with years, but the kind of the trend is not conspicuous.

Although there have been only a few field studies of the effect of drain depth and spacing on N loss to surface waters, the data that exist indicate that N loss increases as subsurface drains are placed closer together Some simulation model studies agree with these trends, others do not. Published field data from Indiana and North Carolina were plotted as a function of drainage intensity (DI), which was defined as the steady-state drainage rate when the water table at a point midway between the drains is coincident with the surface. Trends for NO3-N loss as a function of DI were similar for soils in the two states in spite of large differences in weather and soil conditions. These data indicated that the magnitude of NO3-N loss in drainage waters is strongly dependent on DI. Simulations were conducted to examine effects of drain depth, spacing, and soil properties on processes that affect NO3-N loss from drained soils. The use of DI explained or normalized the effect of these variables on some of the processes but not others. Results showed that, in addition to its effect on DI, drain depth appears to have a significant impact on NO3-N losses.

J	Larssen, T				Larssen, T			Model prognoses for future acidification recovery of surface waters in Norway using long-term monitoring data	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							ACID DEPOSITION; NITROGEN DYNAMICS; CATCHMENT; LAKES; RECONSTRUCTIONS; EUROPE; SOIL	During the past 20 years, acid deposition in Europe has decreased by more than 60%, yet still a large number of lakes and streams in southern Norway have not recovered to a water quality sufficient to support sustainable populations of trout or salmon. Long-term (30 years) monitoring data were used here to constrain the calibration of the acidification model MAGIC to three Norwegian calibrated catchments. The model accounted for 60-80% of the variance in the year-to-year variations in concentrations of most of the major ions in streamwater. The results support the use of the lumped parameter acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) to link chemical parameters to biological response, as the calibration efficiency for ANC is considerably higher than for other biologically important parameters such as inorganic aluminum (Aln+) and pH. Three different scenarios for future deposition of sulfur were run: current legislation, maximum feasible reductions, and an illustrative scenario removing all anthropogenic deposition. These analyses show that much of the potential improvement in water quality has already occurred and that only limited further improvement can be expected from the current legislation. The current legislation is unlikely to produce ANC values sufficiently high to allow self-reproducing populations of trout at two of the three sites. Most of the response in water chemistry to reduced acid deposition has been rapid; the water chemical responses largely occur the same year or a few years after reduction in the input. The soil pool of exchangeable base cations depleted during 150 years of acid deposition, however, requires several centuries for replenishment. The uncertainties in future predictions come from several factors, such as future nitrogen dynamics and impacts from changes in seasalt and precipitation events. The differences in future water chemistry predicted from changed seasalt deposition or nitrogen dynamics are larger that the differences between different deposition scenarios. Hence, these factors must be included in future assessments of recovery from acidification.

J	Chaplot, V				Chaplot, V			Impact of DEM mesh size and soil map scale on SWAT runoff, sediment, and NO3-N loads predictions	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						hydrologic modeling; SWAT; spatial input data; DEM; soil map	WATER-QUALITY; MODEL; RESOLUTION; AGGREGATION	The accuracy of agricultural nonpoint source pollution models depends to a great extent on how well model input spatial parameters describe the relevant characteristics of the watershed. It is assumed that reducing the precision of spatial input parameters affects the simulation results of runoff and sediment yield from the entire watershed. However, there may be no significant increase in the accuracy of models, as a result of more precise topographic or soil information, which increase the input data collection and preparation. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of the mesh size of the digital elevation model, DEM (from 20 to 500 m) and the soil map scale (1/25,000; 1/250,000 and; 1/500,000 scale) within the Soil and Water Analysis Tool (SWAT) to simulate runoff, sediment, and NO3-N loads at the outlet of an agricultural watershed. Results of the Lower Walnut Creek (21.8 km(2), central Iowa) showed that an upper limit to DEM mesh size of 50 m is required to simulate watershed loads. Decreasing the mesh size beyond this threshold does not substantially affect the computed runoff flux but generated prediction errors for nitrogen and sediment yields. Whatever the DEM mesh size considered, a detailed soil map has to be considered to accurately estimate the loads. Finally, the impacts of DEM mesh size and soil map scale on the modeling results are discussed in respect of the relevant characteristics of the watershed and included in SWAT. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Ebeling, JM; Rishel, KL; Sibrell, PL				Ebeling, JM; Rishel, KL; Sibrell, PL			Screening and evaluation of polymers as flocculation aids for the treatment of aquacultural effluents	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						waste management; polymers; flocculant aids	SUSPENDED-SOLIDS; REMOVAL; PHOSPHORUS	As environmental regulations become more stringent, environmentally sound waste management and disposal are becoming increasingly more important in all aquaculture operations. One of the primary water quality parameters of concern is the suspended solids concentration in the discharged effluent. For example, EPA initially considered the establishment of numerical limitations for only one single pollutant: total suspended solids (TSS). For recirculation systems, the proposed TSS limitations would have applied to solids polishing or secondary solids removal technology. The new rules and regulations from EPA (August 23, 2004) require only qualitative TSS limits, in the form of solids control best management practices (BMP), allowing individual regional and site specific conditions to be addressed by existing state or regional programs through NPDES permits. In recirculation systems, microscreen filters are commonly used to remove the suspended solids from the process water. Further concentration of suspended solids from the backwash water of the microscreen filter could significantly reduce quantity of discharge water. And in some cases, the backwash water from microscreen filters needs to be further concentrated to minimize storage volume during over wintering for land disposal or other final disposal options. In addition, this may be required to meet local, state, and regional discharge water quality. The objective of this research was an initial screening of several commercially available polymers routinely used as coagulation-flocculation aids in the drinking and wastewater treatment industry and determination of their effectiveness for the treatment of aquaculture wastewater. Based on the results of the initial screening, a further evaluation of six polymers was conducted to estimate the optimum polymer dosage for flocculation of aquaculture microscreen effluent and overall solids removal efficiency. Results of these evaluations show TSS removal was close to 99%r via settling, with final TSS values ranging from as low as 10-17 mg/L. Although not intended to be used for reactive phosphorus (RP) removal, RP was reduced by 92-95% by removing most of the TSS in the wastewater to approximately 1 mg/ L-P.

J	Branco, AB; Kremer, JN				Branco, AB; Kremer, JN			The relative importance of chlorophyll and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) to the prediction of the diffuse attenuation coefficient in shallow estuaries	ESTUARIES			English	Article							OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; SPECTRAL ABSORPTION; WATER-QUALITY; RIVER PLUME; IN-SITU; COASTAL; PHYTOPLANKTON; NITROGEN; MARINE; OCEAN	The availability of underwater tight is a critical factor in the growth and abundance of primary producers in shallow embayments. The goal of this study was to examine the relative importance of factors influencing tight availability in this type of water body. Many simulation models of aquatic ecosystems predict tight attenuation from chlorophyll or phytoplankton stock. In the three southern New England sites studied here, no useful relationship was found to exist between chlorophyll and K-PAR (the diffuse attenuation coefficient of photosynthetically active radiation; Kirk 1994; Mobley 1994). In 40 of 53 cases, a regression of chlorophyll versus K-PAR was not statisticatly significant. Variation in K-PAR did demonstrate a correlation to salinity, implicating a freshwater source of light attenuating material. This was true even in a system with little freshwater inflow. Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is one such terrestrial input that enters estuaries from their watersheds and can strongly influence the availability of light to aquatic primary producers. This study demonstrated that over 70% of the variability in the K-PAR coefficient can be attributed to CDOM in the shallow estuaries studied. This illustrates the need for improved model formulations that include CDOM in the prediction of light attenuation in shallow coastal systems. A new equation has been developed to predict K-PAR with CDOM.

These harmful algal blooms (HABs) have led to massive fish kills, hypoxia, and beach closures. However, to date the causality and mechanism of coastal algal blooms are still poorly understood. A remotely controlled autonomous real time field monitoring system has been developed to continuously track the changes in chlorophyll fluorescence, dissolved oxygen and other hydro-meteorological variables at two representative mariculture zones. The system can give an alarm when a bloom is detected, so that timely manual water quality sampling can be carried out to supplement the telemetric data. During 2000-2003, the system has successfully tracked 19 algal blooms. In the shallow weakly flushed coastal water (depth 7-10 m, tidal current 5-19 cm s(-1)), the bloom is short-lived, typically lasting a few days to over a week, with chlorophyll and DO concentrations in the range of 20-40 mg m(-3) and 2-15 g m(-3), respectively. It is found that: (1) the chlorophyll concentration is strongly correlated with its past values in the previous week, suggesting an auto-regressive type of algal dynamics; (2) the dissolved oxygen can reach highly super-saturated levels (12 g m(-3)) during a diatom bloom, and decreases to below 4 g m(-3) at the tail of the growth phase; (3) in contrast, a dinoflagellate bloom is characterized by a much more pronounced vertical structure. Diel vertical migration and aggregation to dense layers are clearly observed. Significant dissolved oxygen consumption is associated with the migration, resulting in DO drops by as much as 6 g m(-3) during the bloom; (4) the predominance of diatoms and dinoflagellates at the two sites can be explained in terms of the different hydrographic and nutrient conditions (the N:P ratio). Net algal growth rate, sinking and swimming velocities are derived from the in situ bloom data. The 4-year high frequency data set provides a basis for development of models for forecast of harmful algal blooms. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We compared the baseline phosphorus (P) concentrations inferred by diatom-P transfer functions and export coefficient models at 62 lakes in Great Britain to assess whether the techniques produce similar estimates of historical nutrient status. 2. There was a strong linear relationship between the two sets of values over the whole total P (TP) gradient (2-200 mu g TP L-1). However, a systematic bias was observed with the diatom model producing the higher values in 46 lakes (of which values differed by more than 10 mu g TP L-1 in 21). The export coefficient model gave the higher values in 10 lakes (of which the values differed by more than 10 mu g TP L-1 in only 4). 3. The difference between baseline and present-day TP concentrations was calculated to compare the extent of eutrophication inferred by the two sets of model output. There was generally poor agreement between the amounts of change estimated by the two approaches. The discrepancy in both the baseline values and the degree of change inferred by the models was greatest in the shallow and more productive sites. 4. Both approaches were applied to two lakes in the English Lake District where long-term P data exist, to assess how well the models track measured P concentrations since approximately 1850. There was good agreement between the pre-enrichment TP concentrations generated by the models. The diatom model paralleled the steeper rise in maximum soluble reactive P (SRP) more closely than the gradual increase in annual mean TP in both lakes. The export coefficient model produced a closer fit to observed annual mean TP concentrations for both sites, tracking the changes in total external nutrient loading. 5. A combined approach is recommended, with the diatom model employed to reflect the nature and timing of the in-lake response to changes in nutrient loading, and the export coefficient model used to establish the origins and extent of changes in the external load and to assess potential reduction in loading under different management scenarios. 6. However, caution must be exercised when applying these models to shallow lakes where the export coefficient model TP estimate will not include internal P loading from lake sediments and where the diatom TP inferences may over-estimate TP concentrations because of the high abundance of benthic taxa, many of which are poor indicators of trophic state.

Lake Apopka (FL, U.S.A.) was subjected to decades of high nutrient loading from farms developed in the 1940s on converted riparian wetlands. Consequences included perennially high densities of cyanobacteria, low water transparency, elimination of submerged vegetation, modified fish community, and deposition of nutrient-rich, flocculent sediments. 2. Initial steps were taken to reduce phosphorus (P) loading. Through strengthened regulation and purchase of farms for restoration, external P loading was reduced on average from 0.56 to 0.25 g P m(-2) year(-1) (55%) starting in 1993. The P loading target for the lake is 0.13 g P m(-2) year(-1). 3. For the first 6 years of P loading reduction the annual sedimentation coefficient (sigma) averaged 13% less than the prior long-term value (0.97 versus 1.11 year(-1)). The sedimentation coefficient, sigma, was lower in the last 3 years of the study, but this period included extreme low-water conditions and may not be representative. Annual sigma was negative (net P flux to the water column) only 1 year. 4. Wind velocity explained 43% of the variation in sigma during the period before reductions in total phosphorus (TP) concentration of lake water, but this proportion dropped to 6% after TP reductions. 5. Annual mean TP concentrations differed considerably from values predicted from external loading and hydraulic retention time using the Vollenweider-Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development relationship. Reductions in lake water TP concentration fit model predictions better when multiyear (3-year) mean values were used. 6. Evidence available to date indicates that this shallow, eutrophic lake responded to the decrease in external P loading. Neither recycling of sediment P nor wind-driven resuspension of sediments prevented improvements in water quality. Reductions in TP concentration were evident about two TP-resident times (2 x 0.9 year) after programmes began to reduce P loading. Improvements in concentrations of chlorophyll a and total suspended solids as well as in Secchi transparency lagged changes in lake-water TP concentration but reached similar magnitudes during the study.

J	Yaro, I; Lamai, SL; Oladimeji, AA				Yaro, I; Lamai, SL; Oladimeji, AA			The effect of different fertilizer treatments on water quality parameters in rice-cum-fish culture systems	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY			English	Article							SEMI-DEEP WATERS; MEKONG DELTA; GROWTH-PERFORMANCE; GONIONOTUS BLEEKER; SEEDING RATE; VIETNAM; ECOLOGY; FIELDS	A rice-fish culture experiment was conducted to determine the effects of different fertilizer treatments on water quality parameters, i.e. dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH and conductivity, as well as the nutrients nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus. Data gathered were subjected to analysis of variance. Dissolved oxygen, nitrogen and potassium concentrations showed significant differences (P < 0.5) among the various rice-cum-fish management systems, with the highest mean concentration in the fish-only management system. The insignificant difference (P > 0.05) in the oxygen concentration between rice-only and rice-cum-fish management systems was probably due to the narrow spacing of rice cultivars (20 x 20 cm). Under different fertilizer treatments, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen and potassium concentrations were not significantly different (P > 0.05), indicating that different fertilizer treatments had no effect on their concentrations. Mean temperature, pH, conductivity and phosphorus concentrations in all rice-cum-fish management systems and fertilizer treatments did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) from each other. This might possibly be due to the hydrogeology and climatic conditions of the area. However, all levels of studied water quality parameters were tolerable to the fish (Oreochromis niloticus) in the rice-fish ecosystem. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in rice yield between the rice-fish management system and the rice-only management system. However, there was a significant difference (P < 0.05) under different fertilizer treatments, with nitrogen/phosphorus/potassium (NPK) (20 : 10 : 10) giving the highest production of an estimated 14.36 kg ha(-1) year(-1), indicating that fertilizer treatments had an effect on the rice yield. Fish growth was not significantly different (P > 0.05) under different rice-fish management systems, but was significant (P < 0.05) under different fertilizer treatments. Chicken manure gave the best growth with 17.7 +/- 5.97 g; estimated fish yields were 343 and 602 kg ha(-1) year(-1) in fish monoculture and rice-fish culture respectively. It is recommended that farmers who are more inclined to fish or rice production in integrated rice-cum-fish management systems could use chicken manure and NPK (20 : 10 : 10) respectively.

The Bayesian network analysis includes a graphical Canyon watershed in Northern Utah, model of the key variables in the system and conditional and marginal probability distributions derived from a variety of data and information sources. The resulting model is used to 1) estimate the probability of meeting legal water quality requirements for phosphorus in East Canyon Creek under several management scenarios and 2) estimate the probability of increased recreational use of East Canyon Reservoir and subsequent revenue under these scenarios.

J	White, KL; Chaubey, I				White, KL; Chaubey, I			Sensitivity analysis, calibration, and validations for a multisite and multivariable SWAT model	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						modeling; water quality; nonpoint source pollution; nutrients; SWAT model; sensitivity analysis; agriculture	RIVER-BASIN; MANAGEMENT; UNCERTAINTY; WATERSHEDS; EVALUATE; RECHARGE; POINT	The ability of a watershed model to mimic specified watershed processes is assessed through the calibration and validation process. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) watershed model was implemented in the Beaver Reservoir Watershed of Northwest Arkansas. The objectives were to: (1) provide detailed information on calibrating and applying a multisite and multivariable SWAT model; (2) conduct sensitivity analysis; and (3) perform calibration and validation at three different sites for flow, sediment, total phosphorus (TP), and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) plus nitrite-nitrogen (NO2-N). Relative sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify parameters that most influenced predicted flow, sediment, and nutrient model outputs. A multiobjective function was defined that consisted of optimizing three statistics: percent relative error (RE), Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient (R-NS(2)), and coefficient of determination (R-2). This function was used to successfully calibrate and validate a SWAT model of Beaver Reservoir Watershed at multisites while considering multivariables. Calibration and validation of the model is a key factor in reducing uncertainty and increasing user confidence in its predictive abilities, which makes the application of the model effective. Information on calibration and validation of multisite, multivariable SWAT models has been provided to assist watershed modelers in developing their models to achieve watershed management goals.

J	Kent, R; Belitz, K; Burton, CA				Kent, R; Belitz, K; Burton, CA			Algal productivity and nitrate assimilation in an effluent dominated concrete lined stream	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Review						aquatic ecosystems; algae; effluent dominated streams; nutrient assimilation; productivity; periphyton; wastewater; water quality	WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; NITROGEN REMOVAL; PERIPHYTON BIOMASS; PHOSPHORUS REMOVAL; NUTRIENT REMOVAL; TREATMENT SYSTEM; DESERT STREAM; POND SYSTEMS; CLADOPHORA; WETLANDS	This study examined algal productivity and nitrate assimilation in a 2.85 km. reach of Cucamonga Creek, California, a concrete lined channel receiving treated municipal wastewater. Stream nitrate concentrations observed at two stations indicated nearly continuous loss throughout the diel study. Nitrate loss in the reach was approximately 11 mg/L/d or 1.0 g/m(2)/d as N, most of which occurred during daylight. The peak rate of nitrate loss (1.13 mg/l/hr) occurred just prior to an afternoon total CO2 depletion. Gross primary productivity, as estimated by a model using the observed differences in dissolved oxygen between the two stations, was 228 mg/L/d, or 21 g/m(2)/d as O-2. The observed diel variations in productivity, nitrate loss, pH, dissolved oxygen, and CO2 indicate that nitrate loss was primarily due to algal assimilation. The observed levels of productivity and nitrate assimilation were exceptionally high on a mass per volume basis compared to studies on other streams; these rates occurred because of the shallow stream depth. This study suggests that concrete-lined channels can provide an important environmental service: lowering of nitrate concentrations similar to rates observed in biological treatment systems.

Field observations and sample collection have been made at one-hour intervals during a 24-hour day in different seasons within a year, and taken place in different sections along the river body. The measurement in site was performed by using the multi-probe (W-23XD series, Horiba, Ltd., Kyoto-Japan). Collected samples have been analyzed in laboratory for total nitrogen (T-N) and total phosphorus (T-P) by using absorptiometry method. As a result of the research, new important information on water quality of the Tatara river were obtained and analyzed below. Besides, the result of this research would play an important part as inputs for modeling water quality of the Tatara river which would be studied in further researches.

A thermal optimum was observed in the peat where maximum carbon-cycling enzyme activities (phenol oxidase and beta-glucosidase), phenolic compound concentrations, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations and microbial respiration (CO(2) efflux) were all found in a given season. The thermal optimum for these carbon-cycling processes coincided with the highest ambient soil temperature recorded at the time of peat collection, suggesting microbial acclimation to the external conditions. Under the waterlogged conditions of this experiment, phenol oxidase activites correlated positively with phenolic compounds (winter 0.96, P < 0.01; spring 0.92, P < 0.001; summer 0.94, P < 0.001; autumn 0.88, P < 0.001) and (beta-glucosidase activities with DOC (winter 0.91, P < 0.01; spring 0.85, P < 0.01; summer 0.92, P < 0.001; autumn 0.72, P < 0.05). We propose, therefore, that the relative activities of these enzymes is crucial in mobilising DOC from the peat matrix, with implications for carbon exports to the receiving waters (magnitude and molecular weight distribution) and CO(2) efflux to the atmosphere. The pronounced seasonality in carbon processing found here, must be taken into account when modelling carbon flux in and from these systems, if responses to climate change are to be predicted satisfactorily. Furthermore, because the optimum activity of these carbon-cycling enzymes shifted with seasonal changes in temperature, it is essential to perform enzyme assays in soil ecological investigations at field temperatures (rather than standardised temperatures), when information on natural process rates is required.

J	Arhonditsis, GB; Brett, MT				Arhonditsis, GB; Brett, MT			Eutrophication model for Lake Washington (USA) Part II - model calibration and system dynamics analysis	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						lake management; eutrophication modeling; scenarios analysis; algal food quality	DATA ASSIMILATION; WATER-QUALITY; ECOSYSTEM MODELS; ZOOPLANKTON; COMPETITION; VALIDATION; PHOSPHORUS; PREDICTION; NITRIFICATION; STOICHIOMETRY	We developed a complex eutrophication model to simulate the current chemical and biological properties of Lake Washington (USA). The model reproduces the key epilimnetic and hypolimnetic temporal patterns of the system and results in a good fit between simulated and observed monthly values. The relative error of model estimates was below 20% for most of the water quality parameters (phytoplankton, phosphate, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, dissolved oxygen). Discrepancies between simulated and observed ammonium levels were mainly due to the explicitly modeled egestion of excess nitrogen during zooplankton feeding. This indicates that the relation between secondary production and nutrient recycling has significant effects on the fractionation of the major elements (C, N and P) and regulates their distribution between the particulate/dissolved and inorganic/organic pools. The model was forced by 1962 nutrient loadings, when the lake received large quantities of treated wastewater treatment effluent, and accurately predicted the phytoplankton community responses (phytoplankton biomass and cyanobacteria dominance) and the nitrogen and phosphorus annual cycles for these conditions. We used Monte Carlo simulations to reproduce the meteorological forcing (air temperature, solar radiation, precipitation and subsequent river inflows) that in large part regulates phytoplankton interannual variability for the last 25 years in the lake. We found three seasonal components (modes of variability). The first component (January, May, November, December) is associated with the conditions that determine the abundance of the herbivorous cladocerans; the second component (June-September) coincides with the summer-stratified period, and the third component (February-April) is associated with the initiation and peak of the spring bloom. Finally, an illustrative application of two scenarios of nutrient loading increase at 25% of the 1962 levels indicated that both phytoplankton and cyanobacteria growth are likely to be stimulated. The three seasonal components still characterize phytoplankton dynamics, but changes in the relationships between summer phytoplankton/cyanobacteria biomass and total phosphorus/phosphate concentrations indicate the likelihood of structural shifts towards relaxation of the present phosphorus-limiting conditions and promotion of cyanobacteria dominance.

MOHID water quality model is driven by a physical transport model and simulates the dynamics and productivity of the two main primary producers (phytoplankton and macroalgae) as well as the cycling of nitrogen, carbon and oxygen in interaction with sediment and hydrodynamics. The integrated model is forced by exchanges with the Atlantic Ocean (tide), atmosphere, and by sediment and nutrient inputs from the upstream rivers and other discharges. Focus is given to the light parameterization of primary production, influence of hydro and sediment dynamics and to the prediction of seaweed beds distribution. The results obtained show that the model is better adjusted to field data with macroalgae's simulation and that macroalgae can have an important role in primary production. Hydrodynamic conditions can be significant in the competition between the two primary producers, determining the predominant groups as well as their limiting factors. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Bagheri, S; Peters, S; Yu, T				Bagheri, S; Peters, S; Yu, T			Retrieval of marine water constituents from AVIRIS data in the Hudson/Raritan Estuary	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; CHLOROPHYLL-A; TELEDETECTION; INHERENT; OCEAN; MODEL	This paper reports on the validation of bio-optical models in estuarine and nearshore (case 2) waters of New Jersey-New York to retrieve accurate water leaving radiance spectra and chlorophyll concentration from the NASA Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data complemented with in situ measurements. The study area-Hudson/Raritan Estuary-is a complex estuarine system where tidal and wind-driven currents are modified by freshwater discharges from the Hudson, Raritan, Hackensack, and Passaic rivers. Over the last century the estuarine water quality has degraded, in part due to eutrophication, which has disrupted the pre-existing natural balance, resulting in phytoplankton blooms of both increased frequency and intensity, increasing oxygen demand and leading to episodes of hypoxia. During 1999-2001 data acquisitions by NASA AVIRIS field measurements were obtained to establish hydrological optical properties of the Hudson/Raritan Estuary: (1) concurrent above- and below-surface spectral irradiance; (2) sampling for laboratory determination of inherent optical properties; and (3) concentrations of optically-important water quality parameters. We used a bio-optical model based on Gordon et al. to predict the sub-surface irradiance reflectance from optically important water constituents. Modelling of reflectance is a prerequisite for processing remote sensing data to desired thematic maps for input into the geographical information system (GIS) for use as a management too] in water quality assessment. A Radiative Transfer Code-MODTRAN-4-was applied to remove the effects of the atmosphere so as to infer the water leaving radiance from the AVIRS data. The results of this procedure were not satisfactory, therefore an alternative approach was tested to directly correct the AVIRIS image using modelled spectra based on measured optical characteristics. The atmospherically corrected AVIRIS ratio image was used to calculate a thematic map of water quality parameters (i.e. chlorophyll-a) concentration, which subsequently were integrated into a GIS for management of water quality purposes.

The main task of the article is to estimate long-term changes and find the best method for the restoration of good ecological status. Lake Verevi (surface 12.6 ha, mean depth 3.6 m, maximum depth 11 m, drainage area 1.1 km(2), water exchange 0.63-times per year) is a hypertrophic hard-water lake located in town Elva (6400 inhabitants). Long-term complex limnological investigations have taken place since 1929. The lake has been contaminated by irregular discharge of urban wastewaters from oxidation ponds since 1978, flood from streets, and infiltrated waters from the surrounding farms. The so-called spring meromixis occurred due to extremely warm springs in recent years. The index value of buffer capacity of Lake Verevi calculated from natural conditions is on the medium level. Water properties were analysed according to the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive. According to the classification, water quality as a long-term average of surface layers is moderate-good, but the water quality of bottom layers is bad. Values in deeper layers usually exceed 20-30 times the calculated reference values by Vighi and Chiaudani's model. Naturally, at the beginning of the 20th century the limnological type of the lake was moderately eutrophic. During the 1980s and 1990s the ecosystem was out of balance by abiotic characteristics as well as by plankton indicators. Rapid fluctuations of species composition and abundance can be found in recent years. Seasonal variations are considerable and species composition differs remarkably also in the water column. The dominating macrophyte species vary from year to year. Since the annual amount of precipitation from the atmosphere onto the lake surface is several times higher, the impact of swimmers could be considered irrelevant. Some restoration methods were discussed. The first step, stopping external pollution, was completed by damming the inlet. Drainage (siphoning) of the hypolimnetic water is discussed. Secondary pollution occurs because Fe:P values are below the threshold. The authors propose to use phosphorus precipitation and hypolinmetic aeration instead of siphoning.

J	Reinart, A; Arst, H; Pierson, DC				Reinart, A; Arst, H; Pierson, DC			Optical properties and light climate in Lake Verevi	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						light climate; optical properties; stratified lake	CALCULATING IRRADIANCE PENETRATION; WATER-QUALITY; SECCHI DISK; PHYTOPLANKTON; SEDIMENTATION; REFLECTANCE; BODIES	The optical properties and light climate during the ice-free period in the highly stratified Lake Verevi (Estonia) have been studied together with other lakes in same region since 1994. The upper water layer above the thermoctine belongs to class "moderate" by optical classification of Estonian lakes but can turn "turbid" (concentration of chlorophyll a up to 73 mg m(-3) and total suspended matter up to 13.2 g m(-3)) during late summer blooms. In the blue part of the spectrum, light is mainly attenuated by dissolved organic matter and in red part notably scattering but also absorption by phytoplanktonic pigments effect the spectral distribution of underwater light. Consequently, the underwater light is of greenish-yellow color (550-650 nm). Rapid change in optical properties occurs with an increase of all optically active substances close to thermocline (2.5-6 m). Optical measurements are often hampered beneath this layer so that modeling of the depth distribution of the diffuse attenuation coefficient is an useful compliment to field measurements. K-d,K-PAR ranges from 0.8 to 2.9 m(-1) in the surface layer, and model results suggest that it may be up to 5.8 m(-1) in the optically dense layer. This forms a barrier for light penetration into the hypolimnion.

Phosphorus and nitrogen enrichment are seen as the two most common causes of such eutrophication, with both elements being transported in streamflow and with concentrations strongly dependent upon land-use in the catchment. Many of the efforts to prevent and control eutrophication in the estuary are focused on managing land-use within the catchment. In this paper, the large-scale catchment model (LASCAM) is applied to Ellen Brook, a rural catchment located within the Swan River catchment, to simulate catchment exports of phosphorus and nitrogen, under a range of land cover scenarios that are designed to control the eutrophication. The scenarios, which are related to different management options for the catchment, are: (i) reforestation of agricultural land; (ii) reduction in fertiliser application; and (iii) urbanisation following a highway development. The model results show that: (i) full reforestation of agricultural land is expected to reduce phosphorus and nitrogen export by 50 and 85%, respectively; (ii) a proportionally greater reduction of phosphorus and nitrogen export occurs for smaller areas of reforestation than for larger areas; (iii) reduction in phosphorus fertiliser application produces a linear response with respect to phosphorus export; (iv) urbanisation increases runoff due to the larger impermeable areas causing an increase of overland flow during storms; and (v) phosphorus and nitrogen loads are expected to increase about 4 and 12%, respectively, during the 10 years following urbanisation.

J	Hobbs, W; Irvine, K; Donohue, I				Hobbs, W; Irvine, K; Donohue, I			Using sediments to assess the resistance of a calcareous lake to diffuse nutrient loading	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE			English	Article						marl lakes; phosphorus; stable states; sorption; sediments	PHOSPHORUS RELEASE; AEROBIC SEDIMENTS; PHOSPHATE RELEASE; SHALLOW; DIAGENESIS; PROFILES; WATER	The capacity of lake sediments to retain phosphorus can provide an important buffer to eutrophication. Concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) in the surface sediment of a shallow calcareous lake (Lough Carta, Ireland) varied significantly across three basins and were correlated strongly with iron and manganese, but correlated inversely with calcium carbonate. The concentrations of phosphorus in the surficial sediments of each basin were observed to reflect the mean annual TP of overlying waters, such that the North Basin > South Basin > Mid Basin. Phosphorus sorption experiments on the most TP-enriched sediments predicted a saturation concentration of 0.15 mg P g(-1). Geochemically similar sediments from the northern basin had slightly lower measured TP concentrations (0.10 mg P g(-1)), while those sediments with higher Fe concentrations had up to 0.54 mg P g(-1). Decreasing Fe:P in the upper sections of sediment cores taken from each lake basin show clearly a reduction in the ability of the lake sediments to bind P, reducing the resistance of the lake to eutrophication. The reduced capacity of the sediments to adsorb P should be viewed as a warning signal that indicates increasing risk to water quality and cur-rent high conservation status of Lough Carra. The risk that the lake could "flip" to an alternative state, with high concentrations of phytoplankton and a loss of extensive charophyte beds, requires that measures are effected that will prevent or reduce nutrient loads to the lake. This will necessitate a reversal of the current trend of increasing catchment pressures from intensification of agriculture and increased rural housing.

Limited soil specific data exist on the relationship between runoff P and soil P. This study investigated the relationship between runoff dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) and soil P for three Oklahoma benchmark soils: Richfield (fine, smectitic, mesic Aridic Argiustoll), Dennis (fine, mixed, active, thermic Aquic Argiudoll), and Kirkland (fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Udertic Paleustoll) series. These soils were selected to represent the most important agricultural soils in Oklahoma across three major land resource areas. Surface soil (0-15 cm) was collected from three designated locations, treated with diammonium phosphate (1846-0) to establish a wide range of water-soluble phosphorus (WSP) (3.15-230 mg kg(-1)) and Mehlich-3 phosphorus (M3P) (27.8-925 mg kg(-1)). Amended soils were allowed to reach a steady state 210 d before simulated rainfall (75 mm h(-1)). Runoff was collected for 30 min from bare soil boxes (1.0 X 0.42 rn and 5% slope) and analyzed for DRP and total P. Soil samples collected immediately before rainfall simulation were analyzed for the following: M3P, WSP, ammonium oxalate P saturation index (PSI..), water-soluble phosphorus saturation index (PSIWSP), and phosphorus saturation index calculated from M3P and phosphorus sorption maxima (P,.,). The DRP in runoff was highly related (p < 0.001) to M3P for individual soil series (r(2) > 0.92). Highly significant relationships (P < 0.001) were found between runoff DRP and soil WSP for the individual soil series (r(2) > 0.88). Highly significant relationships (P < 0.001) existed between DRP and different P saturation indexes. Significant differences (p < 0.05) among the slopes of the regressions for the DRP-M3P, DRP-WSP, DRP-PSIox, DRP-PSIWSP, and DRP-P-sat relationships indicate that the relationships are soil specific and phosphorus management decisions should consider soil characteristics.

J	Lowrance, R; Sheridan, JM				Lowrance, R; Sheridan, JM			Surface runoff water quality in a. managed three zone riparian buffer	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							NITROGEN INPUT; SOIL RESPONSE; MODEL REMM; NUTRIENT; SEDIMENT; TRANSPORT; REMOVAL; NITRATE; DENITRIFICATION; COMPONENT	Managed riparian forest buffers are an important conservation practice but there are little data on the water quality effects of buffer management. We measured surface runoff volumes and nutrient concentrations and loads in a riparian buffer system consisting of (moving down slope from the field) a grass strip, a managed forest, and an unmanaged forest. The managed forest consisted of sections of clear-cut, thinned, and mature forest. The mature forest had significantly lower flow-weighted concentrations of nitrate, ammonium, total Kjeldahl N (TKN), sediment TKN, total N (nitrate + TKN), dissolved molybdate reactive P (DMRP), total P, and chloride. The average buffer represented the conditions along a stream reach with a buffer system in different stages of growth. Compared with the field output, flow-weighted concentrations of nitrate, ammonium, DMRP, and total P decreased significantly within the buffer and flow-weighted concentrations of TKN, total N, and chloride increased significantly within the buffer. All loads decreased significantly from the field to the middle of the buffer, but most loads increased from the middle of the buffer to the sampling point nearest the stream because surface runoff volume increased near the stream. The largest percentage reduction of the incoming nutrient load (at least 65% for all nutrient forms) took place in the grass buffer zone because of the large decrease (68%) in flow. The average buffer reduced loadings for all nutrient species, from 27% for TKN to 63% for sediment P. The managed forest and grass buffer combined was an effective buffer system.

J	Little, JL; Bennett, DR; Miller, JJ				Little, JL; Bennett, DR; Miller, JJ			Nutrient and sediment losses under simulated rainfall following manure incorporation by different methods	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							SOIL TEST PHOSPHORUS; CORN PRODUCTION SYSTEMS; LIQUID SWINE MANURE; RUNOFF PHOSPHORUS; CALCAREOUS SOILS; TILLAGE SYSTEMS; POULTRY LITTER; SURFACE RUNOFF; WATER-QUALITY; NITROGEN	Incorporation of manure into cultivated soils is generally recommended to minimize nutrient losses. A 3-yr study was conducted to evaluate sediment and nutrient losses with different tillage methods (moldboard plow, heavy-duty cultivator, double disk, and no-incorporation) for incorporation of beef cattle manure in a silage barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cropping system. Runoff depths, sediment losses, and surface and subsurface nutrient transfers were determined from manured and unmanured field plots at Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada. A Guelph rainfall simulator was used to generate 30 min of runoff. Sediment losses among our tillage treatments (137.4-203.6 kg ha(-1)) were not significantly different due to compensating differences in runoff depths. Mass losses of total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) in surface runoff were greatest from the no-incorporation (NI) treatments, with reductions in TP loads of 14% for double disk (DD), 43% for cultivator (CU), and 79% for moldboard plow (MP) treatments. Total N load reductions in 2002 were 26% for DD, 70% for CU, and 95% for MP treatments compared to the NI treatments. Nutrient losses following incorporation of manure with the DD or CU methods were not significantly different from the NI treatments. Manure treatments generally had lower runoff depths and sediment losses, and higher phosphorus and nitrogen losses than the control treatments. Subsurface concentrations of NH4-N, NO3-N, and TN were greatest from the MP treatments, whereas subsurface phosphoros concentrations were not affected by tillage method. Tillage with a cultivator or double disk minimized combined surface and subsurface nutrient losses immediately after annual manure applications.

Our goals were to evaluate the effects of dietary modification, using phytase and reduced non-phytate phosphorus (NPP) supplementation, on P speciation in broiler litters, changes in litter P forms during long-term storage, and subsequent impacts of diets on P in runoff from litter-amended soils. Four diets containing two levels of NPP with and without phytase were fed to broilers in a three-flock floor pen study. After removal of the third flock, litters were stored for 440 d at their initial moisture content (MC; 24%) and at a MC of 40%. Litter P fractions and orthophosphate and phytate P concentrations were determined before and after storage. After storage, litters were incorporated with a sandy and silt loam and simulated rainfall was applied. Phytase and reduced dietary NPP significantly reduced litter total P. Reducing dietary NPP decreased water-extractable inorganic phosphorus (IP) and the addition of dietary phytase reduced NaOH- and HCl-extractable organic P in litter, which correlated well with orthophosphate and phytic acid measured by P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), respectively. Although dry storage caused little change in P speciation, wet storage increased concentrations of water-soluble IP, which increased reactive P in runoff from litter-amended soils. Therefore, diet modification with phytase and reduced NPP could be effective in reducing P additions on a watershed scale. Moreover, efforts to minimize litter MC during storage may reduce the potential for dissolved P losses in runoff.

The model was calibrated and validated to observed water column nutrient data, sediment nutrient measurements and biovolume data for cyanobacteria, diatoms, and green algae. Model predictions were consistent with experimental observations and indicated that net sediment inorganic P (IP) loads were twice the external TP loads and net sediment inorganic nitrogen (IN) loads were 0.64 times the external total N loads. However, because of organic nutrient and algal settling the lake sediments are an overall nutrient sink. Sensitivity analysis indicated that total algal carbon, algal groups and chlorophyll a were very sensitive to changing algal parameters, parameters affecting light, temperature and supply of IP to the water column. Nutrients were less sensitive for two reasons: 1) algae represent a small fraction of the total nutrient mass, 2) the large pools of sediment nutrients, with long turnover times, buffer changes in the water column. Sensitivity analysis pointed to three potential management options to improve lake water quality: dredging, chemical treatment of sediments and external load reduction. These options were previously considered in a large sediment management feasibility study, which concluded that the last option-load reduction-was the most viable.

For most of the year emissions were close to zero and 60% of the emissions occurred in eight major events of 2-20 days' duration. Two hundred and seven kg ha(-1) of synthetic N and 130 kg ha(-1) organic N were applied over the year and the total measured annual N2O emission was 11.6 kg N ha(-1). The flux data were used to test the prediction of N2O emissions by the DNDC ( DeNitrification-DeComposition) model. The model predicted total emissions of 15.4 kg N ha(-1), 32 % more than the observed emissions. On this basis the model was further used to simulate ( a) background ( non-anthropogenic) N2O emissions and ( b) the effect on N2O emissions of future climate perturbations based on the Hadley Center model output of the IS92a scenario for Ireland. DNDC predicts 1.7 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) of background N2O emissions, accounting for 15% of the observed emissions. Climate shifts will increase total annual modeled N2O emissions from 15.4 kg N ha(-1) to 22.4 kg N ha(-1) if current levels of N applications are maintained, or to 21.2 kg N ha(-1) if synthetic N applications are reduced to 170 kg N ha(-1) to comply with recent EU water quality legislation. Thus the projected increase in N2O emissions due to climate change is far larger than the decrease expected from reduced fertilizer applications.

J	Giardino, C; Candiani, G; Zilioli, E				Giardino, C; Candiani, G; Zilioli, E			Detecting chlorophyll-a in Lake Garda using TOA MERIS radiances	PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							WATER-QUALITY; PHYTOPLANKTON; FLUORESCENCE; SPECTROMETER; SWEDEN; OCEAN; MODEL	The performance of MERIS as a tool for mapping chlorophyll-a concentrations in lake waters has been evaluated using simulated and measured top of atmosphere radiances for Lake Garda (Italy). MERIS observations were simulated using hyperspectral data collected by the MIVIS imaging spectrometer in July 2000. MIVIS data were radiometrically corrected at the sensor altitude using the 6S radiative transfer code. The MERIS simulation process was verified using ETM+ measurements acquired at the same time of the MIVIS flight and differences between simulated and actual radiance measurements in ETM+ bands 1, 2, and 3 were about 10 percent. In July 2003, a cloud free MERIS image was available. MERIS radiances of both dates were used to describe the variation of chlorophyll-a content in the lake that was estimated synchronously to remote observations using continuous track fluorometer data. In 2000, when the mean value of chlorophyll-a was about 6 mg/m(3) the best performing algorithm (RMSE = 0.58 mg/m(3)) was a ratio of band differences using vis and NIR wavelengths. In 2003, when the chlorophyll-a concentration in the lake was very low (mean < 1 mg/m(3)), a single channel centered at 490 nm was the best index in describing spatial variations of chlorophyll-a (RMSE = 0.10 mg/m(3)). The results suggest that MERIS observations are providing useful information for assessing and monitoring chlorophyll-a distribution in lacustrine ecosystems.

The present study was conducted to develop a more reliable soil-P test for these soils by regressing P fractions removed from soil by various chemical extractants against herbage P indices calculated from plant tissue test data using a diagnosis and recommendation integrated system. The degree of P saturation of the soil P sorption capacity, based on ammonium oxalate extractable P, Al and Fe, provided a better prediction of P available to swards on basaltic soils than either the Olsen test or a number of other well-known soil-P test procedures. The superiority of the degree of P saturation test on basaltic soils was attributed to the fact that it simultaneously takes account of both P quantity and P buffering capacity factors in predicting P availability. The Olsen-P test, which accounts for the P quantity factor alone, was only reliable for non-basaltic soils. Re-classifying the P fertility status of basaltic soils according to the degree of P saturation test could result in considerably less P being recommended for these soils with possible consequential benefits to water quality.

J	Harmel, RD; King, KW				Harmel, RD; King, KW			Uncertainty in measured sediment and nutrient flux in runoff from small agricultural watersheds	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						nitrogen; nonpoint-source pollution; phosphorus; sampling error; water quality sampling	SAMPLING STRATEGIES; ACCURACY; LOADS; GRAB	Storm water quality sampling techniques vary considerably in the resources required for sample collection and analysis, and potentially in the resulting constituent flux estimates. However quantitative information on sampling error is rarely available for use in selecting appropriate sampling techniques and for evaluating the effects of various techniques on measured results. In an effort to quantify, uncertainty in constituent flux measurement for flow-interval sampling techniques,water quality data were collected from two small watersheds in central Texas. Each watershed was instrumented with two automated samplers. One sampler was programmed to take high-frequency composite samples to determine the actual load for each runoff event. The other sampler collected discrete samples, from which 15 strategies with 1.32 to 5.28 mm, volumetric depth sampling intervals with discrete and composite sampling were produced. Absolute errors were consistently larger for suspended sediment than for NO3-N and PO4-P for both individual event and cumulative loads, which is attributed to differences in the variability of within-event constituent concentrations. The mean event-specific coefficient of variation (CV) ranged from 0.53 to 0.69 for sediment, from 0.38 to 0.39 for NO3-N, and from 0.18 to 0.21 for PO4-P. Event-specific CV values were correlated with the magnitude of absolute errors for individual event loads, with mean r values of 0.52 and 0.57 for the two sites. Cumulative errors were less than +/- 10% for all sampling strategies evaluated. Significant differences in load estimate error resulted from changes in sampling interval, but increasing the number of composited samples had no effect; therefore, composite sampling is recommended if necessary to manage the number of samples collected.

Engineered wood products (EWP) are estimated to comprise about 30% of residential construction wood waste. Due to the presence of various adhesives, there is concern about the, beneficial reuse of these materials. We evaluated potential environmental impacts of mulches with a ground EWP component. No hazardous levels of constituents were found using a toxicity, characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP). Changes in runoff water quality and soil chemistry below the mulch were evaluated through rainfall simulation on 0.9 X 4.6 in test plots using four treatments: bare soil control, 100% dimension lumber, typical residential mix of wood wastes, and 100% structural EWPs. A companion study evaluated the effect of the 100% EWP and the typical residential mix mulches on the growth of common landscaping plants. No purgeable halocarbons, benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, xylene, or phenols were detected in runoff. Nutrient concentrations in runoff from the freshly ground wood treatments ranged from 0.5 to 8.19 mg L-1 for total nitrogen and 0.13 to 0.21 mg L-1 for total phosphorus. The freshly ground 100% EWP treatment had the highest total nitrogen concentrations in runoff (8.19 mg L-1). Biochemical oxygen demand was similar for all freshly ground wood treatments, ranging from 155 to 273 mg L-1. These concentrations decreased by an order of magnitude after one year. There were no significant impacts on the growth of three common landscaping plants. Results indicate that these wood wastes can be beneficially reused rather than landfilled.

J	Jesiek, JB; Wolfe, ML				Jesiek, JB; Wolfe, ML			Sensitivity analysis of the Virginia phosphorus index management tool	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Agricultural-Engineers	JUL 27-30, 2003	Las Vegas, NV	Amer Soc Agr Engineers		nutrient management; phosphorus management; sensitivity analysis	RUNOFF; MODEL; TRANSPORT; SITE	The phosphorus index (P-Index) is a risk assessment and management tool to aid in reducing the risk to water quality due to movement of excess phosphorus (P) from fields. An allowable P application rate is specified based on the computed risk. This study focused on the Virginia P-Index. The objectives were to determine the factors to which the P-Index is most sensitive and to determine the factors to which the resulting P application rate recommendations are most sensitive. A differential analysis was used to calculate relative sensitivity for nine baseline scenarios: a low, medium, and high baseline within three different regions of Virginia. Impact of user variability in estimating factor values was evaluated using a probability distribution analysis. The P-Index was most sensitive in the low and medium baseline scenarios to P management factors, including annual application rate, method of fertilizer application, and source availability factor In high-risk baseline scenarios, the P-Index was most sensitive to transport factors (erosion, runoff, or leaching). User variability had a greater impact on the P-Index and on P application rate recommendations as P risk increased over each of the three regions. The closer afield's P-Index value is to a threshold between P recommendation rate categories, the higher the probability that alternate P application rates will be recommended due to user variability The results highlight the need for consistent estimation of factor values, particularly the factors to which the P-Index is most sensitive and particularly in the higher-risk situations.

The process consists of spraying poor quality river water onto the river floodplains and thus allowing soil filtration to treat water before it gets back again into the main river stream. This technique can be readily employed in Korea because it exploits the characteristics of the climate and rivers in the country, as described in an experimental study of Chung et al. ( 2004). The model was analyzed by numerical methods and validated by comparing the simulated values with experimental data. A scenario analysis of the model was also performed in order to have a better understanding of the. oodplain filtration process. Our results show that the model was able to predict the reduction in organic matter and NO3- in river water through the. oodplain filtration. Furthermore, it was found that only a few decimeters of top soil profile were enough to degrade most of the organic matter under wider operational conditions than those reported in the literature. Also, it was found that significant infiltration of atmospheric oxygen took place near the soil surface. The N2O emission and the NO3- leaching increased with the increase in the influent NO3- concentration. However, the N2O emission due to. oodplain filtration was not expected to exceed 0.1 mL/m(2)-day.

Efforts to control diffuse pollution have been confined mainly to agricultural land and forests. Little attention has been paid to sources of diffuse pollution from urban areas. A diffuse nitrate modelling tool (DNMT) has been developed for modelling the fate of nitrate in urban areas. This tool works at the catchment scale and has a modular structure that consists of three components: the hydrological module, the nitrogen cycle module and the nitrate transport module. The hydrological model describes the possible flow pathways. The nitrogen cycle model accounts for the mass balance of nitrate and calculates the amount of nitrate for potential loss. The nitrate transport module simulates the movement of nitrate within and from the soil to the receiving water. This paper demonstrates the development of the tool and its application in the White Cart Water catchment. This implementation of the tool shows that it has a good capability for simulating the fate of nitrate in urban catchments. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Robson, B				Robson, B			Representing the effects of diurnal variations in light on primary production on a seasonal time-scale	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						analytic light function; diurnal light variations; phytoplankton model; photosynthesis	WATER-QUALITY; PHOTOSYNTHESIS MODEL; ECOSYSTEM MODEL; CANOPY; GROWTH; COMMUNITIES; SIMULATION; RADIATION; BIOMASS; RZWQM	Rates of production by primary producers are strongly affected by light. Diurnal variations in irradiance produce characteristic diurnal patterns in primary production and respiration. In cases in which the processes of interest occur on a longer time-scale, it is not uncommon to ignore diurnal variations and use mean daily irradiance to force models of primary producers. This simplification reduces the computer processing time and input data requirements of models. However, this approach results in an error which may be significant if irradiance during part of the day is higher than that needed for growth at the maximum possible rate. Here, an alternative approach is presented and applied to a simulation of phytoplankton in a shallow lake. The model uses a semi-analytical calculation of mean daily growth rates that takes into account periods of supersaturation with respect to light to deliver results that conform closely to those of a model using hourly time-steps and irradiance forcing, but with a substantially smaller computational cost.

J	Robinson, TH; Leydecker, A; Keller, AA; Melack, JM				Robinson, TH; Leydecker, A; Keller, AA; Melack, JM			Steps towards modeling nutrient export in coastal Californian streams with a Mediterranean climate	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Environment and Water	2003	Albacete, SPAIN			nutrient export; stream loading; coastal watersheds; Mediterranean climate	WATER-QUALITY; LAND-USE; HYDROCHEMICAL RESPONSE; PHOSPHORUS; FLOW; PATTERNS; HYDROLOGY; CATCHMENT; NITROGEN	Along the southern California coast, near Santa Barbara, California, we are measuring nutrient export from specific land uses and developing relationships to predict nutrient export at a watershed scale. The area is characterized by a Mediterranean-like climate and short steep catchments producing flashy runoff. Land uses include chaparral, avocado orchards, greenhouse agriculture, open-field nurseries, and residential and commercial development. Sampling sites are located on defined drainages or storm drains that collect runoff from relatively homogeneous areas representing each land use. Stream water samples are taken once a week during the rainy season, every two weeks during the dry season and every 1-4 h during storms; samples are analyzed for nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate. We determine discharge from measurements of stage derived from pressure transducers at all sampling sites. This information is then converted to flux at a high temporal resolution. Several parameters are presented in an initial effort to build relationships for simulating nutrient export based on land use, precipitation and antecedent soil moisture conditions. The objective is to create robust relationships, using parameters in a simple and cost efficient manner, which can be extended to other coastal watersheds with similar land uses and climate. The effort focuses on nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). The relationship of volume-weighted mean nutrient concentration and runoff/rainfall ratios shows promise as a means of predicting nutrient export in flashy streams experiencing a Mediterranean climate.

J	Horppila, J; Nurminen, L				Horppila, J; Nurminen, L			Effects of different macrophyte growth forms on sediment and P resuspension in a shallow lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						sediment resuspension; macrophyte growth forms; internal phosphorus loading	EMERGENT VEGETATION; EMPIRICAL-MODEL; EUTROPHIC LAKE; WATER-QUALITY; HIIDENVESI; FINLAND; BIOMASS; DEPTH; BEDS; FLOW	The effects of floating-leaved, submerged and emergent macrophytes on sediment resuspension and internal phosphorus loading were studied in the shallow Kirkkojarvi basin by placing sedimentation traps among different plant beds and adjacent open water and by sediment and water samples. All the three life forms considerably reduced sediment resuspension compared with non-vegetated areas. Both among submerged (Ceratophyllum demersum, Potamogeton obtusifolius, Ranunculus circinatus) and emergent (Typha angustifolia) plants, resuspension rate was on average 43% of that in the adjacent open water, while within floating-leaved plants (Nuphar lutea) the corresponding value was 87%. The effects of submerged and emergent vegetation increased in the course of the growing season together with increasing plant density. Among floating-leaved vegetation, such seasonal trend in resuspension effects was not observed. Compared with the non-vegetated area, floating-leaved, submerged and emergent plants reduced internal phosphorus loading on average by 21, 12 and 26 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively.

Ponds contained 0-465 kg ha(-1) of common carp. We measured limnological variables at weekly intervals for four weeks in early summer, after which ponds were drained and the biomass of fish and macrophytes was determined. Common carp biomass was significantly positively correlated with chlorophyll a, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and Keratella spp. density and negatively correlated to bushy pondweed (Najas guadalupensis) biomass. In addition, we combined our data with data from comparable studies to develop more robust regression models that predict the biomass-dependent effects of common carp on water quality variables across a wide range of systems.

It contains an array of neural networks providing input for the Levenberg -Marquardt multivariate optimization procedure as the final retrieval tool. With a given accuracy threshold, the developed algorithm is sufficiently robust for data with noise up to 15% for certain hydro-optical conditions. To avoid inadequate retrieval results, the algorithm identifies and eventually discards the pixels with inadequate atmospheric correction and/or water optical properties incompatible with the applied hydro-optical model. The validity of the developed algorithm was tested for Lake Michigan. Two dedicated field campaigns in the vicinity of the Kalamazoo River mouth have been conducted concurrently or quasi-concurrently with SeaWiFS and MODIS overpasses. In addition, some archival shipborne measurements of mostly chl and occasionally sm and doe were employed to validate the facility of the algorithm. Notwithstanding the aforementioned shipborne data limitations, the conducted comparison of the ground truth and retrieved data on the water quality parameters in Lake Michigan is strongly indicative of the algorithm's operational efficiency.

The regression uses the logarithms of runoff and human population as the independent variables and estimates the logarithms of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus loading with R-2 values near 0.8. This predictive capability is about the same as has been derived for total nutrient loading with process-based models requiring more detailed information on independent variables. We conclude that population and runoff are robust proxies for the more detailed application, landscape modification, and in-stream processing estimated by more process-based models. The regression model has then been applied to a demonstration data set of 1353 river catchments draining to the sea from the North American continent south of the Canadian border. The geographic extents of these basins were extracted from a 1-km digital elevation model for North America, and both runoff and population were estimated for each basin. Most of the basins (72% of the total) are smaller than 10(3) km(2), and both runoff and population density are higher and more variable among small basins than among larger ones. While total load to the ocean can probably be adequately estimated from large systems only, analysis of the geographic distribution of nutrient loading requires consideration of the small basins, which can exhibit significant hydrologic and demographic heterogeneity between systems over their range even within the same geographic region. High-resolution regional and local analysis is necessary for environmental assessment and management.

The simulated policy scenario considers GHG mitigation incentive payments of $25 and $50 per tonne, carbon equivalent to landowners for reducing emissions or enhancing the sequestration of GHG through agricultural and land-use practices. ASMGHG projects that these GHG price incentives could induce widespread conversion of agricultural to forested lands, along with alteration of tillage practices, crop mix on land remaining in agriculture, and livestock management. This study focuses on changes in cropland use and management. The results indicate that through agricultural cropland about 60 to 70 million tonnes of carbon equivalent (MMTCE) emissions can be mitigated annually in the U.S. These responses also lead to a 2% increase in aggregate national water quality, with substantial variation across regions. Such GHG mitigation activities are found to reduce annual nitrogen loadings into the Gulf of Mexico by up to one half of the reduction goals established by the national Watershed Nutrient Task Force for addressing the hypoxia problem.

Two sources of uncertainty were taken into account and compared: (1) uncertainty concerning the parameters of the governing equation; (2) uncertainty concerning the forcing functions. The mean annual concentrations of Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) was regarded as the model output, as it represents the largest fraction of the Total Dissolved Nitrogen, TDN, for which the current Italian legislation sets a quality target in the lagoon of Venice. A local sensitivity analysis was initially used, so as to rank the parameters and provide an initial estimation of the uncertainty, which is a result of an imperfect knowledge of the dynamic of the system. This uncertainty was compared with that induced by an imperfect knowledge of the loads of Nitrogen, which represent the main forcing functions. On the basis of the results of the local analysis, the most important parameters and loads were then taken as the sources of uncertainty, in an attempt to assess their relative contributions. The global uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were carried out by means of a sampling-based Monte Carlo method. The results of the subsequent input-output regression analysis suggest that the variance in the model output could be partitioned among the sources of uncertainty, in accordance with a linear model. Based on this model, 79% of the variance in the mean annual concentration of DIN was accounted for by the uncertainty in the parameters which specify the dynamics of the phytoplankton and zooplankton, and only 5% by the uncertainties in the three main Nitrogen sources.

The City has implemented a series of watershed protection measures, including land acquisition, aimed at preserving water quality in the Catskill/Delaware watersheds. The objective of this study was to examine how relationships between landscape and surface water measurements change between years. Thirty-two drainage areas delineated from surface water sample points (total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and fecal coliform bacteria concentrations) were used in step-wise regression analyses to test landscape and surface-water quality relationships. Two measurements of land use, percent agriculture and percent urban development, were positively related to water quality and consistently present in all regression models. Together these two land uses explained 25 to 75% of the regression model variation. However, the contribution of agriculture to water quality condition showed a decreasing trend with time as overall agricultural land cover decreased. Results from this study demonstrate that relationships between land cover and surface water concentrations of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and fecal coliform bacteria counts over a large area can be evaluated using a relatively simple geographic information system method. Land managers may find this method useful for targeting resources in relation to a particular water quality concern, focusing best management efforts, and maximizing benefits to water quality with minimal costs.

In Florida Bay, the importance of understanding the present light environment has heightened as major upstream water management restoration projects have been proposed and some are already being implemented. We analyzed a 2-yr (2001-2003) data set of the light attenuation coefficient (Kt) and its principal components (water, chromophoric dissolved organic matter [CDOM], tripton, phytoplankton) obtained at 40 stations within Florida Bay, calibrated synoptic underway data to produce high spatial resolution maps, examined the potential for light limitation, and quantified the individual effect of each component upon tight attenuation. Tripton was the dominant component controlling tight attenuation throughout Florida Bay, whereas the contribution of chlorophyll a and CDOM to Kt was much smaller in all regions of Florida Bay. It was possible to accurately estimate the light attenuation coefficient from component concentrations, using either a mechanistic or a statistical model with root mean square errors of 0.252 or 0.193 m(-1), respectively. Compared to other estuaries, Florida Bay had the lowest overall Kt and the greatest relative contribution from tripton. Comparing the recent data to a study of Florida Bay's light environment conducted in 1993-1994, we found that overall water clarity in the Bay increased significantly, indicated by a nearly 3-fold decrease in Kt, as a result of lower tripton concentrations, although the percent contribution of each of the components to K, is unchanged. Only the northwest corner of Florida Bay, an area comprised of approximately 8% of the Bay's total area, was found on average to have sufficient light attenuation to limit the growth of seagrasses.

Modeling the light field in estuaries is a particularly complicated problem due to the significant influence of high concentrations of dissolved and particulate matter that are derived from both terrestrial and estuarine sources. The goal of this study was to develop a relatively simple but effective way to model tight attenuation variability in a turbid estuary (Chesapeake Bay, United States) in a coupled physical-biological model. We adopted a simple, nonspectral empirical approach. Surface water quality data (salinity was used as a proxy of chromophoric dissolved organic matter [CDOM]) and light measurements from the Chesapeake Bay Program were used to determine the absorption coefficients in a linear attenuation model using regression methods. This model predicts K-c (specific attenuation due to phytoplankton/chlorophyll a [chl a]), K-t (specific attenuation due to total suspended solids), and K-s (a function of specific attenuation coefficients of CDOM in relation to salinity). The Bay-wide fitted relation between the tight attenuation coefficient and water quality concentrations gives generally good estimates of total light attenuation, K-d. The direct inclusion of salinity in the relationship has one disadvantage: it can yield negative values for K-d at high salinities. We developed two separate models for two different salinity regimes. This approach, in addition to solving the negative K-d problem, also accounts for some changes in specific light absorption by chl a, seston (nonphytoplankton particulate matter), and CDOM that apparently occur in different salinity regimes in Chesapeake Bay. The resulting model predicts the statistical characteristics (i.e., the mean and variance) of K-d quite accurately in most regions of Chesapeake Bay. We also discuss in this paper the feasibility and caveats of using K-d converted from Secchi depth in the empirical method.

Exotic invasive species modify natural food webs in a way frequently hard to predict. In several aquatic environments in Brazil the introduction of Oreochromis niloticus (tilapia) was followed by changes in water quality. Yet, because of its rapid and easy growth, this fish has been used in many aquaculture programmes around the country. 2. To measure the effects of tilapia on the phytoplankton community and on water conditions of a large tropical reservoir in south-eastern Brazil (Furnas Reservoir), we performed two in situ experiments using three controls (no fish) and three tilapia enclosures (high fish density). Abiotic and biotic parameters were measured at 4 day intervals for 28 days. 3. Fish presence increased nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability (ammonium 260 and 70% mean increase - first and second experiment; and total phosphorus 540 and 270% mean increase) via excretion. Nutrient recycling by fish can thus be significant in the nutrient dynamics of the reservoir. The higher chlorophyll a concentration in the experimental fish tanks (86 and 34 mu g L-1, first and second experiment, respectively) was the result of a positive bottom-up effect on the phytoplankton community (approximately 2 mu g L-1 in the reservoir and control tank). 4. Because tilapia feed selectively on large algae (mainly cyanobacteria and diatoms), several small-sized or mucilaginous colonial chlorophyceans proliferated at the end of the experiments. Thus, the trophic cascade revealed strong influences on algal composition as well as on biomass. 5. Tilapia can contribute to the eutrophication of a waterbody by both top-down and bottom-up forces. In particular, by supplying considerable amount of nutrients it promotes the increase of fast growing algae. Tilapia must be used cautiously in aquaculture to avoid unexpected environmental degradation.

The lake water CO2 was measured three times a year in the study lakes in 1998 and 1999 and for the rest of the years the CO2 was modeled by measured alkalinity. The median annual CO2 emission to the atmosphere ranged between 1.49 and 2.29 mol m(-2) a(-1). The annual CO2 emission followed closely the annual precipitation pattern with the highest emission during the years when the precipitation was highest (r(2)=0.81-0.97, P < 0.05). There was a strong negative correlation (r(2)=0.50-0.82, P < 0.001) between O-2 and CO2 saturation in the lake water during stratification suggesting effective decomposition of organic matter in the lakes.

J	Kelderman, P; Wei, Z; Maessen, M				Kelderman, P; Wei, Z; Maessen, M			Water and mass budgets for estimating phosphorus sediment-water exchange in Lake Taihu (China P. R.)	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Lake Taihu; mass budgets; phosphorus; sediments; water budgets	NETHERLANDS; GREVELINGEN; RELEASE	Since a few decades, Lake Taihu, one of the largest fresh water lakes in China, has suffered from eutrophication problems, with total P and N level values up to 0.15 mg P/1 and 2.5 mg N/1. To show the evident role of P sediment-water exchange in the take, annual P budgets of Lake Taihu were set up for the period 1998-2000. Reliable water budgets could be derived as a basis for the subsequent P mass budgets. For the latter, the P accumulation rates by the sediment, as a 'fitting term' of the P mass budgets, were found to be between 1000 and 1060 x 10(3) kg P/yr (= 1.2 mg P/m(2) day). This P accumulation amounts to around 65% of the total P inputs into the lake; it represents both physico-chemical processes (adsorption/precipitation, etc.) as well as physical sedimentation of particulate matter. No significant seasonal trends in the P sediment-water exchange were observed here. The particulate P profiles in the upper sediment layers of the lake indicate that, especially for the relatively-polluted north-western sub-lakes, the sediment P uptake capacity has now gradually been depleted. Restoration measures, such as sediment dredging in the NW sub-lakes, will be necessary to improve the Lake Taihu water quality in the coming years.

J	Feller, MC				Feller, MC			Forest harvesting and streamwater inorganic chemistry in western North America: A review	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Review						aquatic ecology; biogeochemistry; forest harvesting; nutrients; stream water chemistry; water quality	BROOK-EXPERIMENTAL-FOREST; TRACE-METAL CONCENTRATIONS; WHOLE-TREE HARVEST; OREGON COAST RANGE; WATER CHEMISTRY; HUBBARD-BROOK; SIERRA-NEVADA; NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS; NITROGEN-FIXATION; MOUNTAIN STREAM	The solution chemistry of forested streams primarily in western North America is explained by considering the major factors that influence this chemistry-geological weathering; atmospheric precipitation and climate; precipitation acidity; terrestrial biological processes; physical/chemical reactions in the soil; and physical, chemical, and biological processes within streams. Due to the complexity of all these processes and their varying importance for different chemicals, stream water chemistry has exhibited considerable geographic and temporal variation and is difficult to model accurately. The impacts of forest harvesting on stream water chemistry were reviewed by considering the effects of harvesting on each of the important factors controlling this chemistry, as well as other factors influencing these impacts - extent of the watershed harvested, presence of buffer strips between streams and harvested areas, nature of post-harvesting site preparation, revegetation rate following harvesting, pre-harvesting soil fertility, and soil buffering capacity. These effects have sometimes reinforced one another but have sometimes been counterbalancing or slight so that harvesting impacts on stream water chemistry have been highly variable. Eight major knowledge gaps were identified, two of which - a scarcity of detailed stream chemical budgets and knowledge of longitudinal variation in stream chemistry - relate to undisturbed streams, while the remainder relate to forest harvesting effects.

The importance of wet weather flow (WWF) pollutant loads is well known, but in semi-arid regions where urbanization is significant the pollutant load in dry weather flow (DWF) may also be important. This research compares the relative contributions of potential contaminants discharged in DWF and WWF from the Ballona Creek Watershed in Los Angeles, California. Models to predict DWF and WWF loads of total suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand, nitrate-nitrogen, nitrite-nitrogen, ammonia-nitrogen, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and total phosphorus from the Ballona Creek Watershed for six water years dating from 1991 to 1996 were developed. The contaminants studied were selected based on data availability and their potential importance in the degradation of Ballona Creek and Santa Monica Bay beneficial uses. Wet weather flow was found to contribute approximately 75 percent to 90 percent of the total annual flow volume discharged by the Ballona Creek Watershed. Pollutant loads are also predominantly due to WWF, but during the dry season, DWF is a more significant contributor. Wet weather flow accounts for 67 to 98 percent of the annual load of the constituents studied. During the dry season, however, the portion attributable to DWF increases to greater than 40 percent for all constituents except biochemical oxygen demand and total suspended solids. When individual catchments within the watershed are considered, the DWF pollutant load from the largest catchment is similar to the WWF pollutant load in two other major catchments. This research indicates WWF is the most significant source of nonpoint source pollution load on an annual basis, but management of the effects of the nonpoint source pollutant load should consider the seasonal importance of DWF.

The model is consistent with optical theory, partitioning the magnitudes of the light attenuating processes of absorption and scattering according to the contributions of attenuating constituents as simple summations. The probabilistic framework accommodates variations in the character and concentrations of these constituents and ambient conditions during measurements, and recognizes a linear relationship between the magnitudes of absorption and scattering by tripton. The model is tested and applied for a 21 kin reach of the Seneca River, New York, that features optical gradients caused by an intervening hypereutrophic lake and dam, and a severe infestation of the exotic zebra mussel. The model is applied to resolve the roles of phytoplankton and tripton in regulating measured longitudinal patterns of SD along the study reach of the river and increases in SD since the zebra mussel invasion, and to predict decreases in Kd since the invasion.

We used stable isotopes to trace spatial and seasonal responses of the downstream food web to winter and spring introductions of river water. Analysis of delta(13)C, delta(15)N, and delta(34)S in the common local consumers such as grass shrimp (Palaemonetes sp.), barnacles (Balanus sp.), and small plankton-feeding fish (bay anchovies, Anchoa mitchilli) showed that the diversion was associated with two of the five major source regimes that were supporting food webs: a river regime near the diversion and a river-influenced productive marsh regime farther away from the diversion. Mixing models identified a third river-influenced source regime at the marine end of the estuary where major natural discharge from the Bird's Foot Delta wraps around into estuarine waters. The remaining two source regimes represented typical estuarine conditions: local freshwater sources especially from precipitation and a brackish source regime representing higher salinity marine influences. Overall. the Mississippi River diversion accounted for 75% of food web support in the upper estuary and 25% in the middle estuary, with influence strongest along known flow pathways and closest to the diversion. Isotopes also traced seasonal changes in river contributions, and indicated increased plant community productivity along the major flow path of diversion water. In the Breton Sound estuary, bottom-up forcing of food webs is strongly linked to river introductions and discharge, occurring in spatial and temporal patterns predictable from known river input regimes and known hydrologic circulation patterns.

Nine large mesocosms (92.2 m(3)) were suspended in the flooded DJX uranium pit at Cluff Lake (Saskatchewan, Canada), and filled with highly contaminated mine water. Each mesocosm was fertilized with a different amount of phosphorus throughout the 35 day experiment to stimulate phytoplankton growth, and to create a range in phosphorus load (g) to examine how contaminants may be affected by different nutrient regimes. Algal growth was rapid in fertilized mesocosms (as demonstrated by chlorophyll a profiles). As phosphorus loads increased there were significant declines (p < 0.05) in the surface water concentrations of As, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Zn. This decline was near significant for uranium (p = 0.065). The surface water concentrations of Ra-226, Mo, and Se showed no relationship to phosphorus load. Contaminant concentrations in sediment traps suspended at the bottom of each mesocosm generally showed the opposite trend to that observed in the surface water, with most contaminants (As, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Ra-226, U, and Zn) exhibiting a significant positive relationship (p < 0.05) with phosphorus load. Selenium and Mo did not respond to nutrient treatments. Our results suggest that phytoremediation has the potential to lower many surface water contaminants through the sedimentation of phytoplankton. Based on our results, we estimate that the Saskatchewan Surface Water Quality Objectives (SSWQO) for DJX pit would be met in approximately 45 weeks for Co, 65 weeks for Ni, 15 weeks for U, and 5 weeks for Zn.

J	Carpenter, SR				Carpenter, SR			Eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems: Bistability and soil phosphorus	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						lake; alternate states; recycling; regime shift	SURFACE WATERS; LAKE MENDOTA; PREDICTION	Eutrophication (the overenrichment of aquatic ecosystems with nutrients leading to algal blooms and anoxic events) is a persistent condition of surface waters and a widespread environmental problem. Some lakes have recovered after sources of nutrients were reduced. In others, recycling of phosphorus from sediments enriched by years of high nutrient inputs causes lakes to remain eutrophic even after external inputs of phosphorus are decreased. Slow flux of phosphorus from overfertilized soils may be even more important for maintaining eutrophication of lakes in agricultural regions. This type of eutrophication is not reversible unless there are substantial changes in soil management. Technologies for rapidly reducing phosphorus content of overenriched soils, or reducing erosion rates, are needed to improve water quality.

One of the main characteristics of the model is assigning an environmental weight for each variable (zeta(i)) according to threshold concentrations of nutrients capable of inducing water changes condition. The model validation demonstrated adequate sensitivity to different data arrangements; as observed in an and climate bay, showing annual stratification resulting in a variable content in nitrogen-forms and phosphorous.

J	Cohn, TA				Cohn, TA			Estimating contaminant loads in rivers: An application of adjusted maximum likelihood to type 1 censored data	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							SEDIMENT; TRANSPORT; BIAS	[1] This paper presents an adjusted maximum likelihood estimator (AMLE) that can be used to estimate fluvial transport of contaminants, like phosphorus, that are subject to censoring because of analytical detection limits. The AMLE is a generalization of the widely accepted minimum variance unbiased estimator (MVUE), and Monte Carlo experiments confirm that it shares essentially all of the MVUE's desirable properties, including high efficiency and negligible bias. In particular, the AMLE exhibits substantially less bias than alternative censored-data estimators such as the MLE (Tobit) or the MLE followed by a jackknife. As with the MLE and the MVUE the AMLE comes close to achieving the theoretical Frechet-Cramer-Rao bounds on its variance. This paper also presents a statistical framework, applicable to both censored and complete data, for understanding and estimating the components of uncertainty associated with load estimates. This can serve to lower the cost and improve the efficiency of both traditional and real-time water quality monitoring.

In this study, the CROPGRO plant growth model of Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT v3.5) was linked to the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) to provide RZWQM users an option of using CROPGRO. In the hybrid model, RZWQM supplied CROPGRO with daily soil water and N, soil temperature, and potential evapotranspiration (PET), whereas CROPGRO supplied RZWQM with daily water and N uptake and plant growth variables. The RZWQM-CROPGRO hybrid model was then evaluated against the original CROPGRO-soybean model using several data sets from the literature. These data sets represented various drought conditions. Results showed that the RZWQM-CROPGRO hybrid model simulated higher water stress than the original DSSAT-CROPGRO model because of higher PET simulated by RZWQM, especially under semiarid climate conditions. Therefore, it was necessary to make some adjustments in the hybrid model under dry and windy conditions, e.g., using a different lower limit of plant available water as DSSAT. The hybrid model with a more detailed soil water balance calculation only affected soil water prediction at the top 60-cm soil profile where soil water was more dynamic. This study demonstrated a successful linkage between RZWQM and CROPGRO, and the RZWQM-CROPGRO hybrid model provides users with a tool to conduct detailed simulation of crop production in addition to addressing water quality concerns. This study also demonstrated that, when building models from various sources, compatibility of the interacting modules should be ensured.

Our objective was to evaluate RZWQM for its ability to simulate a 2-yr winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow (WIT) rotation and a more complex wheat-corn (Zea mays L.)-fallow (WCF) rotation under tilled and no-till (NT) conditions on a Weld silt loam soil in semi-and northeastern Colorado. Measured data from all phases of both rotations were compared with simulated values using root mean square error (RMSE) values to quantify the agreement. Soil water in different layers, total soil profile (180 cm) water contents, and grain yield were accurately predicted with RMSEs ranging between 0.055 and 0.061 m(3) m(-1), 4.6 and 7.1 cm, and 244 and 867 kg ha(-1), respectively. Leaf area index (LAI), evapotranspiration, and biomass predictions were less accurate with RMSEs between 0.7 and 1.6 cm(2), 5.5 and 9.7 cm, and 1027 and 2714 kg ha-1, respectively. Greater soil water and crop yield measured for NT compared with conventional tillage (CT) were simulated reasonably well. Predicted soil organic C was greater in the surface 0.10 m for NT compared with CT after 11 yr. Although the crop growth component of RZWQM needs improvement, especially with regard to LAI, we conclude the model has potential for simulating alternative crop rotations in the central Great Plains. One potential application for RZWQM in this region may be to predict viable cropping opportunities for evolving conservation programs such as the Conservation Security Program (CSP).

Uneaten feed, senescent phytoplankton and faeces are the principal sources of accumulated material, but quantifications are scarce. The sedimented organic matter develops into a flocculent layer in which different processes transform the material into inorganic forms. A better understanding of factors influencing organic matter accumulation/decomposition in the sediment is needed to better understand and manage the dynamics of nitrogen in fish ponds. In this study, the rate of mineralization of organic nitrogen and the nitrogen flux between the sediment and the water column were measured. Organic matter accumulation in fish ponds was quantified, and the data were used to construct, calibrate and validate a dynamic simulation model of organic matter deposition/decomposition in fish ponds. The accumulating material consisted of dead phytoplankton, fish faeces and uneaten feed. Through model calibration, the proportion of these materials in the total accumulated organic matter was determined. In the model, gross photosynthetic rate was estimated from an empirical relationship with feed input. After calibration, the model was validated using independent data. The model simulated well the concentrations of organic carbon and nitrogen in the sediments but it may be developed further, especially by considering the effects of resuspension.

Surface and short-core sediments from the Lunawa Estuary were collected, and analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), nitrogen, sulfur and hydrocarbon contents, hydrogen index and other related sediment properties. Water quality and surface sediment data indicate that the Lunawa Estuary is presently an anoxic water body. The upper part of the sediment cores, characterized by very high TOC values of more than 10%, and absence of bioturbation along with strong laminations indicate anoxic water since 1970 AD, determined by C-14 dating. However, before 1970 AD, lower TOC content and presence of bioturbation and homogenous sediments with animal traces suggest the presence of oxic bottom water and thus a much better physicochemical condition. The lower part of the cores may also suggest the influence of gradual global warming. Regular laminations in the upper portions of the cores probably resulted from monsoon pulses with material preserved under anoxic condition.

This model will keep us abreast of the yearly development of the main parameters that characterize these ecosystems while integrating all the data that have so far been acquired. Within this framework, a simulation model of the thermal system and a model of the water quality have been elaborated. These models, which have been simulated on the lagoon of Oualidia (North of Morocco) and validated on the lagoon of Nador (North West Mediterranean), permit to foresee the cycles of temperature of the surface and the parameters of the water quality (dissolved oxygen and biomass phytoplankton) by using meteorological information, specific features and in situ measurements in the studied sites. The elaborated model, called Zero-Dimensional, simulates the average conduct of the site during the time of variable states that are representatives of the studied ecosystem. This model will provide answers for the studied phenomena and is a work tool adequate for numerical simplicity.

J	Cao, WZ; Hong, HS; Yue, SP				Cao, WZ; Hong, HS; Yue, SP			Modelling agricultural nitrogen contributions to the Jiulong River estuary and coastal water	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Young Scientists Global Change Conference	NOV 16-19, 2003	Trieste, ITALY			agricultural catchment; nitrogen balance; land-ocean interactions in the coastal zone; estuary	BUDGETS; BIOGEOCHEMISTRY; NUTRIENTS; FLUXES; ZONE; SOIL; BAY	The geographical setting of the Jiulong River estuary determines that the estuary receives wastes from both riverine input and adjacent urban sewage. However, the dominant nitrogen (N) source remains unclear. A nutrient mass-balance model and a preliminary LOICZ (Land-Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone) biogeochemical model were linked to evaluate agricultural N contributions from the Jiulong River catchment to the estuary and coastal water. Results showed that agricultural N surplus was the largest N source in the catchment, contributing 60.87% of the total Nitrogen (N) and 68.63% of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). Household wastes and other sources followed. Riverine DIN fluxes were about 20.3% of exportable DIN and 14.4% of exportable total N, but approximately 9.7% of DIN inputs, and 7.3% of total N inputs to the Jiulong River catchment. The model system clearly showed that agricultural and anthropogenic activities in the catchment were the major N sources of the estuary and coastal water, and riverine N fluxes from these sources substantially impacted the estuary and coastal water quality and biogeochemical processes.

Fluridone (1-methyl-3-phenyl-5-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-4(1H)-pyridinone), a systemic whole-lake herbicide, is selective for Eurasian watermilfoil within a narrow low concentration range. Because fluridone applications have the potential for large effects on plant assemblages and lake food webs, they should be evaluated at the whole-lake scale. We examined effects of low-dose (5 to 8 ppb) fluridone applications by comparing submersed plant assemblages, water quality and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) growth rates and diets between three reference lakes and three treatment lakes one- and two-years post treatment. In the treatment lakes, fluridone reduced Eurasian watermilfoil cover without reducing native plant cover, although the duration of Eurasian watermilfoil reduction varied among treatment lakes. Large pre-treatment differences among lakes in plant cover persisted, reflecting morphometric differences. We detected no treatment effects on water quality, and estimated the probability of treatment converting a lake to eutrophic conditions as being <= 0.10. Growth of largemouth bass > 200 mm total length did not change in treatment lakes and we detected few treatment effects on their diet. However, in two treatment lakes, growth of smaller largemouth bass increased modestly following treatment. Overall, the extent of effects of low-dose fluridone treatment differed among lakes, apparently reflecting differences in initial conditions that, in part, were driven by lake morphometry. Therefore, future evaluations should include more lakes, chosen to represent a range of morphometry, allowing extrapolation of findings to regions containing many diverse lakes.

These two variables are modeled using modified advection-diffusion equations within a two-dimensional, laterally-averaged hydrodynamic model. The model includes sources of salt, BOD and DIN from shrimp mariculture ponds in the region surrounding the estuary. The model was successful in simulating seasonal concentrations in DIN and BOD over a range in source concentrations. Seasonal BOD measurements along the length of the estuary were coincident with dissolved oxygen concentrations in the estuary (high BOD generally corresponding to low dissolved oxygen). Results suggest that the citing of shrimp ponds near the head of the estuary should be avoided in order maintain estuarine water quality and to maximize production.

The ratio psi of flagellate chlorophyll to total chlorophyll is used as a measure of the balance. The PROVESS Water Quality Model (PROWQM) was used to investigate the control of psi by simulating changes during 1999 in water-column layering and the abundance of diatom-or flagellate-dominated microplankton communities at 59 N, 01 E, in the northern North Sea, This was the site of a study by the PROVESS project in autumn 1998 and near that of the FLEX investigation in spring 1976. Although not considered to be at risk of eutrophication, these waters have a high natural N:Si ratio and provide a good Subject for numerical experiment,,; concerning the control of the balance of organisms. PROWQM is a I-D physical-biological model, its 2 microplankton compartments parameterise the microbial loop and take account of the metabolism of pelagic bacteria and protozoa as well as the photosynthesis, respiration and nutrient uptake of micro-algae. The effect of an initialisation with the long-term mean observed winter concentrations of nutrients in the northern North Sea (10 mu M nitrate and 5 mu M silicate) was compared with an initialisation with the Same amount of nitrate but only 3 mu M silicate. Simulations were run with the standard value of the surface drag coefficient and a doubled value, The latter resulted in a more accurate representation of the surface mixed layer, but did not show a midwater maximum of flagellate chlorophyll during summer. The simulation with doubled drag and initial N:Si of 10:5 was in good agreement with the long-term observed seasonal cycle of chlorophyll. Simulations with initial N:Si of 10:3 had substantially more flagellates during summer,as it result of diatom limitation by silica exhaustion. The model results support suggestions that the winter N:Si ratio must be perturbed to greater than 3:1 before the balance of organisms is much changed, if the balance is quantified by peak biomass or annual production. However, annual mean psi was more influenced by physical conditions than by nutrient initialisation, showing that how data are analysed can have an influence on conclusions about whether the balance is disturbed, The simulated removal of nutrient up to the time of maximum chlorophyll was used to estimate values Cot diatoms and flagellates of the yield, q, of chlorophyll from nitrate or silicate. The silicate value (0.77 g chl (mol Si)(-1) in the best simulation) is novel. The yields from nitrate were 0.23-0.75 g chi (mol N) 1, the range including both groups and all simulations. These less than yields reported for inshore waters. Finally, the need for detailed study of the distributions of pelagic microflora and microfauna in late summer in the northern North Sea is pointed out. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Barkoh, A; Hamby, S; Kurten, G; Schlechte, JW				Barkoh, A; Hamby, S; Kurten, G; Schlechte, JW			Effects of rice bran, cottonseed meal, and alfalfa meal on pH and zooplankton	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE			English	Article							ORGANIC FERTILIZERS; STRIPED BASS; PONDS	Rice bran (RB), cottonseed meal (CSM), and alfalfa meal (ALF) were compared as organic fertilizers for their effects on pH and zooplankton abundance in limnocorrals that-lacked fish. The weight (W) and nitrogen (N) content of CSM, which served as the control, were used to determine the other applications (RB-N, RB-W, ALF-N and ALF-W). Temperature, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, ammonia nitrogen, and zooplankton densities were monitored for 8 weeks to simulate the average period for phase I production of striped bass Morone saxatilis (38-50 mm). Rice bran promoted better water quality than ALF or CSM when application rates were based on nitrogen content. The pH was lowest for RB-N, intermediate for ALF-N, and highest for CSM. Chlorophyll a was a function of nitrogen input, and the high-nitrogen applications (CSM, ALF-N, and RB-N) supported similar phytoplankton standing crops that were 38-62% greater than the corresponding low-nitrogen applications (ALF-W and RBW). Water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations were similar among applications, and total ammonia nitrogen was below detectable levels for all applications. Overall mean densities of rotifers, nauplii, adult copepods, adult crustaceans, and total zooplankton did not differ significantly among applications. However, the mean density of cladocerans was significantly higher for RB-N and ALF-N than for ALF-W The densities of cladocerans, adult copepods, adult crustaceans, and total zooplankton correlated strongly with chlorophyll a but not with the quantities of fertilizers applied, indicating that phytoplankton probably was the primary food for these zooplankters. Based on pH, RB was better than CSM or ALF, but all had similar effects on zooplankton when application rates were based on nitrogen.

J	Kato, T				Kato, Tasuku			Simulation of water quality with the application of system dynamics model for population and land-use changes	PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Mitigation measures; Unit effluent loads; Watershed management; Watershed model		Water quality is degraded due to urbanization because it causes population growth and land-use changes in a watershed. These changes are usually simulated using a linear equation; however, in reality, population and land use are very closely related. A watershed system dynamics model (WSD model) was developed in the simulation of the relation among population, land use (paddy fields, upland fields, forest, and household), and runoff. The model comprised of three sectors: the agricultural sector, nature sector, and urban sector. The elements in the WSD model were selected based on interviews with local government officers and references. The WSD model simulated population, land use, and runoff with an average relative error of about 5%. Total nitrogen (T-N) and total phosphorus (T-P) were simulated using the results of the WSD model and unit effluent loads. Field surveys were conducted to determine the rate of mitigation in paddy fields. In addition, correction equations for runoff and phosphate-containing detergent were introduced. The model simulated T-N with an average relative error of 9%, and T-P with 27%; a sensitivity analysis for the principal elements in the WSD model showed reasonable results.

Scientists (NRCS) developed a technique to estimate the impact of agricultural watersheds on natural water resources. The objectives of this study were to apply this technique on the Wagon Train (WT) watershed to predict (1) loss of water by surface runoff, (2) loss of phosphorus (P) from soils by runoff and P loading for WT reservoir. The annual loss of water by runoff was estimated at 4.32 million m(3). The USGS data for a 50-year period (1951 to 2000) indicated that the average annual inflow for WT reservoir was 4.25 million m(3). The predicted annual P loss by runoff was 844 kg and could be considered as the annual loading for WT reservoir. The predicted P concentration in the runoff water at field sites was 196 mu g/L. Phosphorus concentration observed in major streams at the beginning of spring (March) ranged from 99 mu g/L to 240 mu g/L with an average of 162 mu g/L (S.D. = 40 mu g/L), and the average P concentration in water samples taken from different locations in the reservoir was 140 mu g/L. Phosphorus uptake by algae, weeds and aquatic plants, as well as high pH in the reservoir and streams might explain the slight drop of P concentration in waters. Further, the average P concentration observed in the main stream samples for the entire rainy season (March through October), ranged between 157 and 346 mu g/L with an average of 267 mu g/L (S.D. = 65 mu g/L). Application of P fertilizers (April/May) for summer crops might explain the increase in P concentration.

BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH			English	Article							SOUTHERN FINLAND; ORGANIC-CARBON; WATER-QUALITY; PHOSPHORUS; TRANSFORMATION; NUTRIENTS; PEATLANDS; WETLANDS; SOILS	Riparian buffer zone areas (BZAs) effectively reduce sediment transport and are considered as the most important water protection method in forest drainage sites in Finland. However, it has been questioned whether BZAs are a significant source of nutrients and other dissolved constituents to water-courses. At seven locations in south-central Finland a buffer zone was created below a drainage site and the effects on the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved P, Fe and Al in through-flow were studied for 4-7 years. The effect of the two smallest BZAs (< 0.1% of watershed area) on through-flow quality was negligible. The three medium-sized BZAs (0.15%-0.23% of watershed area) either had no effect on through-flow quality or slightly increased solute concentrations (3%-30%). At the two largest BZAs (> 1% of watershed area) the concentrations of Fe either increased or decreased and the concentrations of DOC, Al and P were either unaffected or decreased (15%-27%). It was concluded that, although increased leaching may occur from some individual sites, BZAs are unlikely to act as a general source of P, Al, Fe, or DOC to water courses.

While there is much to be said in favor of such an approach, it is also clear that implementation requires information that is often lacking. Given that information acquisition is costly, decisions are required about the types and amounts of information that should be sought. We examine the expected value of different types of information for price and quantity instruments for agricultural nitrogen pollution control in the Susquehanna River Basin. We also compare the ex ante economic efficiency of price and quantity instruments. The analysis explicitly accounts for public sector uncertainty about the benefits and costs of pollution reductions, with economic efficiency measured as the expected benefits less the expected costs of pollution reductions. We find optimized price controls to outperform optimized quantity controls under a range of possible information structures. For both instruments, information collection improves policy performance, with information about the benefits of pollution reductions having the greatest impact. The performance of the quantity instrument is more sensitive to information than is the price instrument. In consequence, the value of information to reduce benefit and cost uncertainty is greater for the quantity control.

J	Djodjic, F; Bergstrom, L				Djodjic, F; Bergstrom, L			Conditional phosphorus index as an educational tool for risk assessment and phosphorus management	AMBIO			English	Article							LONG-TERM TRENDS; WATERSHED SCALE; SOIL; SWEDEN; MODEL	Phosphorus index (PI) is a risk-assessment tool that combines phosphorus (P) source factors and transport factors to rank the vulnerability of fields to P losses. Here we present the structure and concepts of conditional PI, developed as an educational and P-management tool adjusted for Swedish conditions. Because the significance of certain factors for P losses depends on their interplay with other factors, conditional rules are needed for a more accurate process description and quantification. Accounting for P losses through the soil profile, separate calculations for reactive and unreactive P and a changed approach to P loss assessment from erosion losses are some of the new features included in the tool presented here. The performance of the tool was tested by comparing the calculated PI values with measured annual P transport from seven observation fields included in a Swedish water quality monitoring program. This first test indicated that the tool could be used successfully for P loss risk assessment.

J	Carr, GM; Chambers, PA; Morin, A				Carr, GM; Chambers, PA; Morin, A			Periphyton, water quality, and land use at multiple spatial scales in Alberta rivers	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article							CHLOROPHYLL RELATIONSHIPS; BENTHIC ALGAE; PHOSPHORUS; BIOMASS; STREAMS; MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN; MODELS	The ability of land use to replace water quality variables in predictive models of periphyton chlorophyll a was tested with a 21-year data set for Alberta rivers. Nutrients (total dissolved P and NO2 + NO3) explained 23%-24% of the variability in seasonal chlorophyll a, whereas land use (human population density) explained 25%-28% of the variability. The best models included the combination of total dissolved P and population density, explaining 32%-34% of periphyton chlorophyll a variability. However, analysis of variance of chlorophyll a by ecoregions and ecozones explained about as much variability (28%-30%), and the inclusion of an ecoregion term into the regression models showed a diminished importance of land use as a predictor of chlorophyll a, with best models based on the combination of nutrients and ecoregion and explaining up to 43%-44% of periphyton chlorophyll a variability. Within ecoregions, land use was sometimes a good surrogate for nutrient data in predicting chlorophyll a concentrations. Overall, land use is a suitable surrogate for nutrients in regression models for chlorophyll a, but its inclusion in general models may reflect regional differences in nutrient-chlorophyll relationships rather than true land use effects on chlorophyll a.

Catchment properties can be used to estimate the acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) of lakes. Conceptual and general linear models were developed to predict the ANC of lakes in high-elevation (>= 2170 m) Wilderness Areas in California's Sierra Nevada mountains. Catchment-to-lake area ratio, lake perimeter-to-area ratio, bedrock lithology, vegetation cover, and lake headwater location are significant variables explaining ANC. The general linear models were validated against independently collected water chemistry data and were used as part of a first stage screen to identify Wilderness lakes with low ANC. Expanded monitoring of atmospheric deposition is essential for improving the predictability of lake ANC.

J	Hembre, LK; Megard, RO				Hembre, LK; Megard, RO			Timing of predation by rainbow trout controls Daphnia demography and the trophic status of a Minnesota lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY			English	Article						acoustic sampling; Daphnia; fisheries management; trophic cascade; water quality	CLEAR-WATER PHASE; ZOOPLANKTON; BIOMANIPULATION; POPULATION; FISH	1. Stocking of lakes with rainbow trout is a common practice that presents a potential conflict for lake managers who must balance the interests of anglers with those concerned that zooplanktivory by trout may trigger a trophic cascade and result in decreased water clarity. 2. This study examined how the timing of trout stocking (autumn versus spring) in a Minnesota (U.S.A.) lake affected (i) the population dynamics of their zooplankton food supply (Daphnia pulicaria), (ii) phytoplankton biomass and water clarity and (iii) trout survival. Sizes of both Daphnia and trout populations were estimated acoustically with high-frequency (192 kHz) sonar. 3. Daphnia were nearly eliminated from the lake during winters after trout were stocked in autumn. In both of these years (1996 and 1997), the Daphnia population was small in the spring, and grew during the summer and into the autumn as the trout population diminished. 4. The lake was then stocked in spring for 2 years (1998 and 1999). This fisheries manipulation alleviated predation over the winter, but increased predation on D. pulicaria during the spring, summer and autumn. However, the high mortality caused by the spring-stocked trout was offset by even higher rates of reproduction by the relatively large populations of fecund Daphnia that survived the winter in 1998 and 1999. 5. Grazing by these dense populations of Daphnia produced clear-water phases during May and June that were inhibited in autumn stocking years. In addition, the large Daphnia populations present during the spring and early summer of 1998 and 1999 provided abundant forage for trout. 6. This fisheries manipulation achieved seemingly mutually exclusive management objectives: a robust planktivorous sport fishery, and clear water for other forms of recreation.

As the largest estuary in the US, the Chesapeake Bay has been the focus of one of the most high-profile restoration programs ever undertaken in North America. While the primary emphasis has been on tidal waters, freshwater tributary clean-up strategies have recently been developed. We have compiled the first comprehensive database of over 4700 existing river and stream restoration projects in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed (CBW) to examine where dollars are being spent, what issues motivate restoration, and what approaches are used. By conservative estimates, in excess of $400 million has been invested in restoration projects since 1990. The majority of projects were implemented to restore forest vegetation in riparian areas and improve water quality. Although the CBW has an extremely high density of restoration activities relative to other regions of the US, only 5.4% of the project records indicated that related monitoring of project performance has occurred. To provide cost-effective management solutions, we recommend that a centralized tracking system be developed that includes restoration projects associated with both tidal and non-tidal waterways, along with a substantial increase in investment in the comprehensive monitoring of individual projects following implementation.

Modeling Water Quality Management Alternatives for a Nutrient Impaired Stream Using System Dynamics Simulation	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Eutrophication; nutrients; object-oriented modeling; simulation; STELLA; system dynamics; total maximum daily load (TMDL); Kentucky		A system dynamics (SD) simulation model is developed using an object-oriented modeling environment to simulate and analyze water quality management strategies for a nutrient impaired stream. An object-oriented simulation environment. STELLA, conceived on the principles of system dynamics (SD) is used for the development of the model. The modeling process consists of developing stock-flow diagrams and carrying out computer simulations using difference equations to integrate stocks and flows. The model structure and behavior of the system is validated using dimensionality, replication and sensitivity tests; and calibration along with validation is carried out using an appropriate model performance measure. The model helps the user to separate policy questions from the data and provides the facility to generate "what-if" scenarios while keeping the modeling process transparent. Case study application of this model is illustrated by developing a total maximum daily load (TMDL) allocation strategy for a nutrient impaired stream in the southeastern region of Kentucky, USA. Results suggest that the fate and transport process of total phosphorus in a river system can be simulated using a conceptually simple object-oriented simulation model.	[Teegavarapu, R. S.

J	Fang, F; Easter, KW; Brezonik, PL				Fang, F; Easter, KW; Brezonik, PL			Point nonpoint source water quality trading: A case study in the Minnesota River Basin	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						nonpoint source pollution; cost effectiveness; phosphorus pollution; erosion; load offsetting; transaction costs; water quality trading	COSTS	Contrary to the general trend of only a few actual trades occurring within point-nonpoint source water quality trading programs in the United States, two trading projects in the Minnesota River Basin, created under the provisions of National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits, have generated five major trades and numerous smaller ones. In this paper, these two projects are described to illustrate their origins, implementation, and results. It was found that several factors contributed to the relatively high number of trades in these projects, including the offsetting nature of the projects (hence a fixed number of credits that the point sources were required to obtain), readily available information on potential nonpoint source trading partners, and an effectively internal trading scheme used by one of the two projects. It was also found that long term structural pollution control measures, such as streambank stabilization, offered substantial cost savings over point source controls. Estimates of transaction costs showed that the total costs of the trading projects were increased by at least 35 percent after transaction costs were taken into account. Evidence also showed that in addition to pollution reduction, these two trading projects brought other benefits to the watershed, such as helping balance environmental protection and regional economic growth.

J	Carle, MV; Halpin, PN; Stow, CA				Carle, MV; Halpin, PN; Stow, CA			Patterns of watershed urbanization and impacts on water quality	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						urban water management; watershed management; water quality; land use planning; nonpoint source pollution; nutrients; runoff	LAND-USE; SURFACE WATERS; NORTH-CAROLINA; UNITED-STATES; LANDSCAPE; STREAMS; PHOSPHORUS; MODEL; STORMWATER; INDICATORS	Urban runoff contributes to nonpoint source pollution, but there is little understanding of the way that pattern and extent of urbanization contributes to this problem. Indicators of type and density of urbanization and access to municipal services were examined in six urban watersheds in Durham, North Carolina. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to identify patterns in the distribution of these variables across the urban landscape. While spatial variation in urban environments is not perfectly captured by any one variable, the results suggest that most of the variation can be explained using several variables related to the extent and distribution of urban development. Multiple linear regression models were fit to relate these urbanization indicators to total phosphorus, total kjeldahl nitrogen, total suspended solids, and fecal coliforms. Development density was correlated to decreased water quality in each of the models. Indicators of urbanization type such as the house age, amount of contiguous impervious surface, and stormwater connectivity explained additional variation. In the nutrient models, access to city services was also an important factor. The results indicate that while urbanization density is important in predicting water quality, indicators of urbanization type and access to city services help explain additional variation in the models.

J	Kennedy, RH				Kennedy, RH			Toward integration in reservoir management	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						reservoir; water quality; reservoir management; reservoir operation	WATER-QUALITY; PHYTOPLANKTON; LAKES; SUCCESSION; RETENTION; DYNAMICS; MODELS; RIVER	Reservoirs are engineered features of hydrologic landscapes with characteristics defined by engineering design criteria. Many of these characteristics impact water quality. Reservoir management has historically been dictated by water control requirements; environment and water quality have been secondary considerations. Management approaches that address inputs of nutrients, sediment and organic material as root causes of eutrophication have been difficult to implement due to the location of reservoirs in large, complex watersheds. Costly engineering solutions that reduce symptoms of problems rather than address their cause are favored over watershed-based approaches applied to smaller natural lakes. To be successful, future management initiatives will require more integrative approaches that recognize reservoirs as integral components of watersheds and river basins. Understanding interactions between engineering practice and water quality fosters the development and implementation of effective management approaches that address environmental and water quality concerns as well as water quantity.

High pH and high un-ionized ammonia concentrations are associated with the blooms when algae are actively growing, followed by low dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions when the blooms decline in mid- to late summer. Over a 12-year study period, algal biomass was strongly related to total phosphorus concentration (TP) and pH. Minimum water column DO was strongly related to net negative changes (i.e., declines) in algal biomass during July and August. The severity of both low DO and high ammonia was positively related to water column stability, which was dependent on wind speed. Bloom dynamics, coupled with climate, dominated year-to-year variability in water quality dynamics in Upper Klamath Lake. These data provide the empirical basis for previous research linking high mortalities of endangered sucker species with years of low wind and high water column stability.

Differences in water quality and thermal regime were also observed among sites with contrasting geology. Conductivity, pH, and minimum winter temperatures were highest at sites draining marble terrain. In contrast, longitudinal patterns in water quality and temperature regime along the 120-km length of the river were relatively weak, although longitudinal patterns in amplitude of daily temperature fluctuation matched theoretical predictions. In this study, differences in land use appeared to have the strongest influence on most water quality and thermal variables examined. However, geology was an important factor explaining variation in certain variables (e.g., pH and conductivity). Longitudinal patterns in water quality and temperature were relatively weak and in many instances were linked with longitudinal patterns in land use and geology rather than catchment location alone.

A vital key to the development of a reservoir management strategy is to identify nutrient loading that describes associated water quality conditions in reservoirs. This study integrated AnnAGNPS watershed and BATHTUB lake models to simulate actual lake water quality conditions of Cheney Reservoir, KS, and demonstrated the use of the coupled model for simulating lake response to changes in different watershed land use and management scenarios. The calibrated current-conditions model simulated in-lake reductions as much as 52% for TN, 48% for TP, and 70% for chlorophyll a due to conversion to native grass, and increases as much as 4% for TN, 9% for TP and 6% for chlorophyll a due to conversion of land from the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to cropland (15.5% of watershed). This model also demonstrated an increase in chlorophyll a (19%) as the lake sediment capacity was reached over the next century.

This information asymmetry may lead to strategic behavior which can lead to different outcomes under different policies. This paper estimates a Nash payoff of a two-period strategic game using econometrically estimated abatement costs for point and nonpoint source phosphorus discharges in the Minnesota River Basin. Results show that when dischargers of pollutants are strategic, discharge permits may yield lower deadweight losses than discharge fees.

Most basin drainage moves through the riparian zones of first- and second-order headwaters streams. It is important to have continuous buffers on both sides of these streams. For larger streams, protect the flood plains. Several zones of buffer vegetation are most effective. A narrow grass strip at the upland edge traps suspended particulates and phosphorus. A wider zone of woody vegetation traps nitrate, and both cools and provides natural organic matter to the receiving waters. Contour the buffer surface to avoid concentrated storm flows and periodically remove sediment berms that develop. For a completely degraded riparian zone, it is essential to provide soils of the right porosity and organic carbon content. Sub-soils need to be permeable and to have a reasonable groundwater retention time. High organic carbon is required to develop a low redox potential. Provide short-term protection from erosion.

This study was conducted to determine the impact of farm N budgets on stream water quality. In 1999-2000, we investigated an experimental livestock farm of 457ha in the Kepau River watershed in Shizunai,Southern Hokkaido, Japan, where grasslands and maize fields account for 33% of the farm's total area. Annual N flow was calculated on the basis of the farm's land management records. Livestock was supplied with 15.2 t N yr(-1) from agricultural lands, which made the farm 81% self-sufficient. Livestock excreta produced 17.2tNyr(-1), of which 4tNyr(-1) was lost, probably by ammonia volatilization during decomposition. Apart from manure, the major N inputs were 9.1 tNyr(-1) of chemical fertilizers, 6.4tNyr(-1) of atmospheric deposition, and 12.6tNyr(-1) biological N fixation. The major outputs were uptake by forest vegetation of 11.0 t N yr(-1), denitrification of 1.5 t N yr(-1), and livestock feed production. Consequently, the annual surplus N on the whole farm was estimated to be 12.7 t N yr(-1), which corresponds to 28 kg N ha(-1) of agricultural land. The annual N load from the farm to the Kepau River was measured, at 14.4 t N yr(-1). Ninety percent of this load, however, occurred during rainfall and spring snowmelt. Within one 2-week snowmelt period, 5.0 t N was discharged, which corresponds to 35 % of the annual load. Although the average N concentration of stream water below the farm was 2.8 mg N L-1, the maximum concentration recorded during the snowmelt season was 13.5 mg N L-1. The N concentration of the stream water increased and the silica (Si) concentration decreased as the stream flow rate increased. Consequently, the molar ratio of SUN frequently dropped below 2.7, the critical level for the occurrence of eutrophication. The large N load during rainfall and snowmelt could be ascribed to open ditches, which collect tile drainage and surface runoff from the fields, discharging it directly to the river, bypassing the forested riparian zone.

The four sub-basins differ widely in population density ( from 101 inhabitants km(-2) in the upstream basins to more than 1000 inhabitants km(-2) in the delta), land use, and agricultural practices. In terms of agricultural production, on the one hand, and consumption of food and feed on the other, the upstream sub-basins are autotrophic systems, exporting agricultural goods, while the delta is a heterotrophic system, depending on agricultural goods imports. The budget of the agricultural soils reveals great losses of nitrogen, mostly attributable to denitrification in rice paddy fields and of phosphorus, mostly caused by erosion. The budget of the drainage network shows high retention/elimination of nitrogen ( from 62 to 77% in the upstream basins and 59% in the delta), and of phosphorus, with retention rates as high as 80% in the Da and Lo sub-basins which have large reservoirs in their downstream course (Hoa Binh on the Da and Thac Ba on the Lo). The total specific delivery estimated at the outlet of the whole Red River System is 855 kg km(-2) yr(-1) total N and 325 kg km(-2) yr(-1) total P. Nitrogen rather than phosphorus seems to be the potential limiting factor of algal growth in the plume of the Red River in Tonkin Bay.

J	Artioli, Y; Bendoricchio, G; Palmeri, L				Artioli, Y; Bendoricchio, G; Palmeri, L			Defining and modelling the coastal zone affected by the Po river (Italy)	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						coastal zone; eutrophication; water quality; water quality model	ADRIATIC SEA	One of the most important sources of pollution in coastal zones (CZ) is certainly that one produced by human activities in the associated river basin. Understanding the linkage between water quality in CZ and river catchments is important in order to better assess CZ processes and to evaluate different management options aimed at improving the coastal ecosystem state. CZ water quality targets as identified by the Water Framework Directive (EC 2000/60) require an accurate study of the effects of pollutant loads coming from river discharge. In order to evaluate the impacts of human activities in river catchments on the associated coastal zone, a sound definition for this geographic area is needed. Many definitions for this area have been proposed in different contexts. The definition is generally built upon a particular goal, and is henceforth highly variable according to the different purposes. In this paper a general methodology allowing to discern those areas of the sea that are directly influenced by fluvial discharge is presented. The methodology is based on the variation pattern of sea water characteristics, and provides a numerical evaluation of this influence. In particular an analysis based on salinity as tracer, results in a sound definition of this area. The methodology has been applied on the case study of the Po river. Due to the significant nutrient loads discharged by the river, the CZ associated with Po is affected by severe eutrophication phenomena that have important consequences on the ecosystem and on the socio-economy of the area. In order to study the impacts of nutrients loads carried by the river, a water quality model (WASP6) has been implemented. The model simulates the seasonal variability of nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton biomass and dissolved oxygen. Using the CZ model is possible to compare the effects of variations of nutrient loads on the biochemical (short term) and ecological (long term) quality of the coastal environment. This is accomplished by feeding nutrients loads forecasted for different scenarios by the catchment model (MONERIS) as forcing functions to the CZ model. This way the effect of the different catchment management scenarios are propagated to the CZ model, and the trophic conditions of the coastal ecosystem evaluated using TRIX. This study has been developed in the context of the European project EUROCAT. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Bendoricchio, G; De Boni, G				Bendoricchio, G; De Boni, G			A water-quality model for the Lagoon of Venice, Italy	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Lagoon of Venice; water quality; statistical model		A water-quality model for the Lagoon of Venice is proposed. The model is based on the results of an existing, deterministic, hydraulic-dispersive model of the Lagoon to provide the distribution of salinity and residence time in the Lagoon of Venice. This model has been implemented by Magistrato alle Acque di Venezia and Consorzio Venezia Nuova to evaluate the environmental impact of the MOSE Project, that has the aim to defend the city of Venice from extraordinary high tides [CVN, 1997. Allegato allo studio di impatto ambientale del progetto di massima delle opere mobili per la difesa dei centri abitati lagunari dagli allagamenti, vol. 2., CVN, 2002. Studio di nuove configurazioni dei canali di bocca e del relativo adeguamento progettuale delle opere mobili alle bocche di porto]. The water-quality is simulated by statistic analysis on water-quality data, monthly collected in 30 stations. The data-set covers a period of 2 years, and has been collected in the framework of MELa1, the institutional water-quality monitoring program (Magistrato alle Acque di Venezia, Consorzio Venezia Nuova). The Spearman correlation index of salinity and residence time versus the water-quality variables (nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorophyll-a and the trophic index TRIX) has been studied on a yearly average basis and for the spring-summer periods. The spatial distribution of the water-quality variables, based on the yearly average of nutrients, is mostly driven by the dispersive processes and is well correlated to salinity [Bianchi, F., Acri, R, Alberghi, M., Bastianini, M., Boldrin, A., Cavalloni, B., Cioce, F., Comaschi, A., Rabitti, S., Socal, G., Turchetto M.M., 1999. Biologocal variability in the Venice Lagoon. In: Lasserre, P., Marzollo, A. (Eds.), The Venice Lagoon Ecosystem. Input Interaction between Land and Sea, UNESCO, Man and Biosphere Series, vol. 25, pp. 97-125]. The model has been applied to simulate the variation of nutrients and trophic index distribution in the Lagoon as a consequence of an increase of hydraulic dissipation at the Lagoon outlets. The work presented in this paper shows that, coupling a deterministic, distributed-parameters, dynamic, hydraulic-dispersive model to a statistic one that accounts for the correlation between hydraulic related forcing functions (salinity, residence time) and water-quality data is a promising and simple way to evaluate the water-quality of the Lagoon of Venice. Of course, this methodology is applicable because a very large data-set is now available. The usual limitations of the statistical model methodology are present in this application too. E.g., it cannot precisely estimate the values of the water-quality variables, but it can indicate how they react when the system hydrological features change. Besides, the outcomes depend strongly on site characteristics and on the actual ecosystem state. The model has not been validated yet, due to the short data time lag, but the aim of this work is to suggest a simple simulation tool whose reliability is at least the same of that obtained by complex, deterministic, dynamic water-quality models. These models, accounting for several processes and hence including a lot of parameters, require for calibration a much more detailed data-set not yet available. The increase of dissipation is altering nutrient concentrations in the Lagoon of an average +3.2%, while the average variation for TRIX is +0.4%, and for chlorophyll-a is +3.0%. These variations are small enough to confirm a posteriori the validity of the adopted statistical approach. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Solidoro, C; Pastres, R; Cossarini, G				Solidoro, C; Pastres, R; Cossarini, G			Nitrogen and plankton dynamics in the lagoon of Venice	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						nitrogen cycle; coupled model; lagoon Venice; nitrogen budget; fluxes	WATER-QUALITY; TAPES-PHILIPPINARUM; TERM SIMULATIONS; PHYTOPLANKTON; IMPACT; PARAMETERS; EXCHANGES; ECOSYSTEM; MODEL; AREA	The nitrogen cycle in the lagoon of Venice, which is the largest Italian lagoon, was investigated by means of a 3D fully coupled transport - water quality model, which had been validated against a substantial amount of real-world data. Nitrogen fluxes among different ecosystem compartments were computed for each month of a reference year, and for each one of the three sub-basins into which the lagoon is conventionally subdivided. The computation included the loads of nitrogen discharged by the tributaries, the direct inputs from the industrial area and the city of Venice, the atmospheric loads, the fluxes at the three lagoon inlets and the internal fluxes between sediment and water compartments and among the three sub-basins. The results of the analysis show that the lagoon, as a whole, exports nitrogen towards the sea. Approximately 4000 tN/year are recycled by the system, while 4640 tN/year is the net input from the drainage basin and the other sources, thus leading to about 8640 tN/year of dissolved inorganic nitrogen that enter the water compartment. Around half of the this amount is used by primary producers, one fourth is exported towards the sea, and one fourth is transferred into the sediment compartment, or lost to atmosphere. These findings suggest that the exchanges through the inlets play an important role in keeping nitrogen concentration at an acceptable level. A more detailed analysis of the model results shows that the non-homogeneous spatial distribution of tributary discharges and point sources is the main cause of the differences in the ecosystem response and water quality among the three sub-basins. Nutrient poorer sub-basins fix a ration of available inorganic nutrient higher than nutrient rich ones. However, they are more efficient in transferring the biomass to the highest trophic levels. Results also include estimates of fluxes that were not quantified so far (such as grazing and recycling), and a validated model, which could have a practical use, for example for assessing implications of reduction of nutrient loads.

The combination of two datasets resulted in a full description of the estuaries water quality parameters from the mouth to the upper boundary, including an extended fresh water tidal part. A synthesis of the monitoring results and all relevant ecological knowledge on the Scheldt allowed to identify opportunities to optimize its management. The results show that the effect of discharge on salinity has a distinct maximum in the polyhaline to mesohaline transition area. Oxygen conditions, nitrogen removal and phytoplankton regulation can be enhanced and improved through management measures within the estuary. To lower carbon and phosphorous loads however measures should be taken within the catchment. To restore most of its ecological functions the estuary needs more space. Optimal locations to address specific functions can be derived from the monitoring results.

J	Billen, G; Garnier, J; Rousseau, V				Billen, G; Garnier, J; Rousseau, V			Nutrient fluxes and water quality in the drainage network of the Scheldt basin over the last 50 years	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Scheldt river; nutrient; eutrophication; oxygen; modelling	SEINE RIVER; ESTUARY	Land use and urban activity in the catchment of the Scheldt river system have deeply changed during the last 50 years, modifying in turn the water quality of the drainage network and the fluxes of nutrient transferred to the estuary and to the sea. Based on the RIVERSTRAHLER model, developed for establishing the link between the biogeochemical functioning of large river systems and the constraints set by the meteorology, the morphology of the drainage network and the human activity in the watershed, we reassembled the data available to document these constraints in the Scheldt basin since the last half of the XXth century and we used them to reconstruct the variations of nutrient and oxygen concentrations at the outlet of the Scheldt drainage network. We compared the results with the water quality data at the entrance of the estuarine zone available since the 1960s. Both model results and observational data show a very severe deterioration of water quality (with deep oxygen depletion) in the beginning of the 1960s, while a clear trend to improvement is apparent since the late 1980s. The budget of nutrient loadings from the watershed, retention within the drainage network and delivery to the estuarine zone is established on an annual basis for the 50 last years. The yearly fluxes of nutrient delivered by the river to the estuary and the sea show a severe depletion of silica with respect to nitrogen compared with the requirements of diatoms, and a clear shift from the early 1990s from nitrogen to phosphorus potential limitation. Seasonal variations of nutrient delivery are however much more pronounced for nitrogen, with much less inputs during the dry seasons, while phosphorus inputs, mainly from point sources are more constant, so that nitrogen limitation can still occur during summer. Compared with similar budget estimations carried out for the Seine river system, the Scheldt basin, in spite of its much higher population density, does not deliver higher specific fluxes of nutrient (presently about 2000 kgN/km(2)/yr, 80 kgP/km(2)/yr and 1000 kgSi/km(2)/yr), owing to very efficient processes of nutrient retention.

It therefore serves as a key introductory paper in this special issue. The entire process is described in terms of a 'P transfer continuum' to emphasise the interdisciplinary and inter-scale nature of the problem. Most knowledge to date is derived from mechanistic studies on the sources and mobilisation of P using controlled experiments that have formed the basis for mitigation strategies aimed at minimising transfer from agricultural fields. However, our ability to extrapolate this information to larger scales is limited by a poor knowledge base while new conceptual advances in the areas of complex systems and fractal dynamics indicate the limitations of past theoretical frameworks. This is compounded by the conceptual and physical separation of scientists working at different scales within the terrestrial and aquatic sciences. Multi-scaled approaches are urgently required to integrate different disciplines and provide a platform to develop mechanistic modelling frameworks, collect new data and identify critical research questions.

J	Bowes, MJ; Hilton, J; Irons, GP; Hornby, DD				Bowes, MJ; Hilton, J; Irons, GP; Hornby, DD			The relative contribution of sewage and diffuse phosphorus sources in the River Avon catchment, southern England: Implications for nutrient management	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						export coefficients; phosphorus; nitrogen; nutrient reduction; GIS; urban waste water treatment directive	SURFACE WATERS; LAND-USE; POLLUTION; DYNAMICS; NITROGEN	In order to effectively manage nutrient river load reductions and target remediation strategies, it is important to determine the relative contributions of diffuse and point sources across the river catchment. This study used a geographical in formation system (GIS) to apply phosphorus (P) export coefficients (obtained from the literature) to 58 water quality monitoring sites across a large, urbanised, mixed land use catchment, typical of southern lowland England (the River Avon, Warwickshire, UK). These coefficients were used to estimate the annual P load at each monitoring site, and also the relative contribution of point source: (from sewage treatment works (STW)) and diffuse input (from both livestock and agricultural land use). The estimated annual P loads showed very close agreement (r(2) = 0.98)with the measured total phosphorus (TP) loads. Sites with the highest proportion of P derived from STW had the highest TP concentrations. and loads, and also had greater variations between seasons, with elevated P concentrations occurring during the summer months. The GIS model was re-run to determine the effect of an 80% reduction in P output from STW serving over 10000. people, thereby assessing the effect of implementing the European Union's Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (UWWTD). The exported TP load was reduced by 52%, but the sites with the highest TP concentrations were still those with the highest proportion of P derived from STW. The GIs model was re-run to estimate the impact of 80% P reductions at a further 11 STW of varying sizes. This reduced the total TP load by only 29 tonnes year(-1), but greatly reduced the P concentrations in many highly nutrient contaminated tributaries. The number of sites with P concentrations' greater than 1 mg l(-1) was cut from 15 (before UWWTD implementation) 1 to 2. These findings suggest that after UWWTD implementation, resources should focus on introducing tertiary sew age treatment at the remaining large STW, before targeting diffuse inputs. This conclusion is also likely to apply to other lowland river catchments in southern England, most of which have similar population densities to the River Avon.

Previous research has shown that this model worked well in simulating the average annual P lost from two catchments: Windermere and Windrush, but it was not known which drivers in the model had the greatest control on predicted P delivery to water from agricultural land. In order to simulate the P export from each catchment source via each hydrological pathway specified individually, 108 coefficients are used in the model code. A univariate sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate which coefficient exerted the greatest control on the model output. Results from the univariate analysis suggest that the model is sensitive to a number of coefficients, but importantly, not all of the coefficients that were varied in the sensitivity analysis, altered the model output. The PIT model has been calibrated by optimizing results from the univariate analysis against observed data in the Windermere catchment. The simulated results from model calibration fit the observed data well, at the 95% level. This paper describes the methodology developed for the univariate analysis and evaluates the model calibration procedure against observed data from the Windermere catchment.

Artificial neural networks ( ANN), support vector machines ( SVM), locally weighted projection regression ( LWPR), and relevance vector machines ( RVM) are utilized as surrogates for a relatively complex and time- consuming mathematical model to simulate nitrate concentration in groundwater at specified receptors. Nitrates in the application reported in this paper are due to on- ground nitrogen loadings from fertilizers and manures. The practicability of the four learning machines in this work is demonstrated for an agriculture- dominated watershed where nitrate contamination of groundwater resources exceeds the maximum allowable contaminant level at many locations. Cross- validation and bootstrapping techniques are used for both training and performance evaluation. Prediction results of the four learning machines are rigorously assessed using different efficiency measures to ensure their generalization ability. Prediction results show the ability of learning machines to build accurate models with strong predictive capabilities and hence constitute a valuable means for saving effort in groundwater contamination modeling and improving model performance.
