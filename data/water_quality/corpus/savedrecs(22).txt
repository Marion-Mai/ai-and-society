J	Brandt, SB; Mason, DM				Brandt, SB; Mason, DM			Effect of nutrient loading on Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus) growth rate potential in the Patuxent River	ESTUARIES			English	Article							SPATIALLY-EXPLICIT MODELS; CHESAPEAKE BAY; FISH GROWTH; BIOENERGETICS MODELS; CLUPEIDAE; PISCES; FOOD; EUTROPHICATION; TEMPERATURE; DYNAMICS	We linked a 2-dimensional water quality model of the Patuxent River with a spatially-explicit model of fish growth to simulate how changes in land use in the Patuxent River Basin would affect the growth rate potential (GRP) of Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus). Simulations of three land-use patterns that reflected current nutrient loadings, increased nutrient loadings, and decreased nutrient loadings were used to drive the water quality model. Changes in nutrient loadings caused changes in the timing and intensity of phytoplankton concentrations and the region of hypoxia increased during summer with increased nutrient loading. The spatial distribution of menhaden GRP was highly correlated with phytoplankton concentrations and localized in the middle one third of the Patuxent River. Menhaden growth rate was highest in early June and late summer. During June, menhaden GRP (and phytoplankton concentration) was lowest at the lower nutrient loading simulation. During late summer, mean menhaden growth rates were inversely proportional to nutrient loading rates and menhaden grew best when nutrient loadings were the lowest. Upriver to mid-river phytoplankton patches drove overall mean calculations. Model results suggest that more research is needed on water quality model predictions of phytoplankton levels at a high level of spatial and temporal resolution, menhaden foraging, and menhaden habitat selection.

J	Sigua, GC; Tweedale, WA				Sigua, GC; Tweedale, WA			Watershed scale assessment of nitrogen and phosphorus loadings in the Indian River Lagoon basin, Florida	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						atmospheric deposition; estuarine ecosystem; eutrophication; groundwater; nutrient flux; water quality	ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION; BIOLOGICAL INTEGRITY; SEEPAGE	There is a growing evidence that the ecological and biological integrity of the lagoon has declined during the last 50 years, probably due to the decline in water quality. Establishment of a watershed scale seagrass-based nutrient load assessment is the major aim of water. quality management in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL). Best estimate loadings incorporate wet and dry deposition, surface water, groundwater, sediment nutrient flux, and point source effluent discharge data. On the average, the IRL is receiving annual external loadings of 832, 645 and 94,476 kg of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), respectively, from stormwater discharges and agricultural runoff. The average internal cycling of TN and TP from sediment deposits in the IRL was about 42,640 kg TN and 1050 kg TP yr(-1). Indirect evidence suggests that atmospheric deposition has played a role in the ongoing nutrient enrichment in the IRL. The estimated total atmospheric deposition of TN and TP was about 32,940 and 824 kg yr(-1), while groundwater contribution was about 84,920 and 24,275 kg yr(-1) respectively,,to-the surface waters of the IRL. The estimated annual contribution of point effluent discharge was about 60,408 kg TN and 7248 kg TP. In total, the IRL basin is receiving an annual loading of about 1,053,553 kg TN and 127,873 kg TP. With these results, it is clear that the current rate of nutrient loadings is causing a shift in the primary producers of the IRL from macrophyte to phytoplankton-or algal-based system. The goal is to reverse that shift, to attain and maintain a macrophyte-based estuarine system in the IRL. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	McIntyre, NR; Wagener, T; Wheater, HS; Chapra, SC				McIntyre, NR; Wagener, T; Wheater, HS; Chapra, SC			Risk-based modelling of surface water quality: a case study of the Charles River, Massachusetts	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						water quality; risk; Monte Carlo; sensitivity analysis; eutrophication	SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS; PEEL INLET; UNCERTAINTY; EUTROPHICATION; INFERENCE; BEHAVIOR	A model of phytoplankton, dissolved oxygen and nutrients is presented and applied to the Charles River, Massachusetts within a framework of Monte Carlo simulation. The model parameters are conditioned using data from eight sampling stations along a 40 km stretch of the Charles River, during a (supposed) steady-state period in the summer of 1996, and the conditioned model is evaluated using data from later in the same year. Regional multi-objective sensitivity analysis is used to identify the parameters and pollution sources most affecting the various model outputs under the conditions observed during that summer. The effects of Monte Carlo sampling error are included in this analysis, and the observations which have least contributed to model conditioning are indicated. It is shown that the sensitivity analysis can be used to speculate about the factors responsible for undesirable levels of eutrophication, and to speculate about the risk of failure of nutrient reduction interventions at a number of strategic control sections. The analysis indicates that phosphorus stripping at the CRPCD wastewater treatment plant on the Charles River would be a high-risk intervention, especially for controlling eutrophication at the control sections further downstream. However, as the risk reflects the perceived scope for model error, it can only be recommended that more resources are invested in data collection and model evaluation. Furthermore, as the risk is based solely on water quality criteria, rather than broader environmental and economic objectives, the results need to be supported by detailed and extensive knowledge of the Charles River problem.

This research examined spatial and temporal patterns of nutrient concentrations in streams from 10 small watersheds (< 4 km(2)) that drain into Murrells Inlet (impacted) and North Inlet (pristine), two high salinity estuaries along the South Carolina coast. Monthly grab samples were collected during baseflow during 1999 and analyzed for total and dissolved inorganic and organic forms of nitrogen and phosphorus. Data were grouped into forested wetland creeks (representing predevelopment reference sites), urban creeks, and urban ponds. DON and NH4 concentrations were greater in forested streams than in urban streams. NO3 and TP concentrations were greatest in urban streams. Seasonally, concentrations were highest during summer for TN, NH4, DON, and TP, while NO3 concentrations were greatest during winter. Nutrient ratios clearly highlighted the reduction in organic nitrogen due to coastal development. Multiple regression models to predict instream. nutrient concentrations from land use in Murrells Inlet suggest that effects are not significant (small r(2)).

J	Yuan, YP; Bingner, RL; Rebich, RA				Yuan, YP; Bingner, RL; Rebich, RA			Evaluation of AnnAGNPS nitrogen loading in an agricultural watershed	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						AnnAGNPS 2.0; modeling; water quality; nonpoint source pollution; nitrogen loading; watershed management	MODEL; MISSISSIPPI; AGNPS	Pollutants entering a water system can be very destructive to the health of that system. Best Management Practices (BMPs) are used to reduce these pollutants, but understanding the most effective practices is very difficult. Watershed models are an effective tool to aid in the decision-making process of selecting the BMPs that are most effective in reducing the pollutant loading and are also the most cost effective. The Annualized Agricultural Nonpoint Source Pollution model (AnnAGNPS 2.0) is a technological tool that can be used to estimate watershed response to agricultural management practices. The main purpose of this paper is to test the performance of AnnAGNPS 2.0 on nitrogen loading using comparisons with measurements from the Deep Hollow watershed of the Mississippi Delta Management Systems Evaluation Area (MDMSEA) project. Previous work has demonstrated the capability of the model to simulate runoff and sediment. From sensitivity analyses in this study, initial nitrogen concentration in the soil and crop nitrogen uptake had the most impact on the nitrogen loadings. AnnAGNPS simulations of monthly nitrogen loadings are poor. However, statistical test (t-test) showed that the predicted nitrogen loading is not significantly different from observed nitrogen loading at the 95 percent level of confidence.

J	Deksissa, T; Ashton, PJ; Vanrolleghem, PA				Deksissa, T; Ashton, PJ; Vanrolleghem, PA			Control options for river water quality improvement: A case study of TDS and inorganic nitrogen in the Crocodile River (South Africa)	WATER SA			English	Article						dynamic model; flow regulation; water quality management; tank in series model	MANAGEMENT	Using a simple conceptual dynamic river water quality model, the effects of different basin-wide water quality management options on downstream water quality improvements in a semi-arid river, the Crocodile River (South Africa) were investigated. When a river is impacted by high rates of freshwater withdrawal (in its upstream reaches), and receives polluted side-stream inflows and wastewater effluent discharges (in the middle reaches), river water quality can deteriorate seriously over time. This study focused on two water quality problems: Progressive increases in the concentrations of total dissolved solids (TDS) as a measure of salinity, and the concentrations of nitrate-plus-nitrite and ammonia (as inorganic nitrogen) as a measure of eutrophication. Based on a low-flow analysis for the period prior to construction of the Kwena Darn (1960 to 1979), the 7d low flows that could be expected to occur every 10years (7Q10) are generally very low (<0.5 m(3.)s(-1)), both in the upstream (Montrose Weir) and the downstream (Kruger National Park) sections of the Crocodile River. During such critical periods of low river flow, very low effluent standard limits would be required to prevent adverse river water quality. However, these options are not economically feasible. Furthermore, inflows from the highly polluted tributary stream, the Kaap River, which drains an area where considerable gold mining takes place, govern water quality in the Crocodile River downstream of the Crocodile-Kaap confluence. Subsequently, two additional water quality control options (setting limits for maximum water withdrawal and low-flow augmentation) were analysed. The results show that a decrease in maximum water withdrawal could reduce the TDS concentration. Furthermore, controlling water release patterns from a darn at the Montrose Weir can have a remarkably positive effect on the downstream river water quality. On the basis of the 1989/90 monitoring data, a minimum flow of 5 m(3.)s(-1) at the Montrose Weir can reduce concentrations of TDS and ammonia nitrogen by about 20% and 60%, respectively, in the Kruger National Park (at the downstream point of the considered river). However, this management option does not reduce nitrate nitrogen concentrations. The proposed model used in this study is relatively simple and can be used as a tool for the evaluation of short-term (monthly) basin-wide water quality management options.

Most methods for NPS mitigation focus on source reductions; few have been developed to mitigate NPS once nutrients have entered streams. One system that has been shown to be effective in reducing stream nitrogen is by using in-stream wetlands (ISW). The objective of this research was to determine if design approaches used in constructed wetlands could be applied to predict ISW effectiveness in treating NPS. The 3.3-ha ISW studied was located in a 425-ha watershed in eastern North Carolina. We analyzed the data from the ISW to calculate the first-order rate constants (K-20 and dimensionless temperature coefficient, 0) for the k-C* model used in constructed wetland design. We found that our calculated rate constants were in close agreement with literature estimates with TN K-20 = 19-20 m/y and theta = 1.0-1.03. NO3-N rate constants were K-20 = 38-54 m/y and theta = 1.07-1.13. The design equations used for constructed wetlands can be successfully used to predict the performance of the ISW prior to their implementation.

J	Haggard, BE; Soerens, TS; Green, WR; Richards, RP				Haggard, BE; Soerens, TS; Green, WR; Richards, RP			Using regression methods to estimate stream phosphorus loads at the Illinois River, Arkansas	APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						streams; phosphorus loads; phosphorus transport; water quality monitoring	SAMPLING STRATEGIES; CONSTITUENT LOADS; SEDIMENT	The development of total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) requires evaluating existing constituent loads in streams. Accurate estimates of constituent loads are needed to calibrate watershed and reservoir models for TMDL development. The best approach to estimate constituent loads is high frequency sampling, particularly during storm events, and mass integration of constituents passing a point in a stream. Most often, resources are limited and discrete water quality samples are collected on fixed intervals and sometimes supplemented with directed sampling during storm events. When resources are limited, mass integration is not an accurate means to determine constituent loads and other load estimation techniques such as regression models are used. The objective of this work was to determine a minimum number of water-quality samples needed to provide constituent concentration data adequate to estimate constituent loads at a large stream. Twenty sets of water quality samples with and without supplemental storm samples were randomly selected at various fixed intervals from a database at the Illinois River, northwest Arkansas. The random sets were used to estimate total phosphorus (TP) loads using regression models. The regression-based annual TP loads were compared to the integrated annual TP load estimated using all the data. At a minimum, monthly sampling plus supplemental storm samples (six samples per year) was needed to produce a root mean square error of less than 15%. Water quality samples should be collected at least semi-monthly (every 15 days) in studies less than two years if seasonal time factors are to be used in the regression models. Annual TP loads estimated from independently collected discrete water quality samples further demonstrated the utility of using regression models to estimate annual TP loads in this stream system.

J	Thakur, DP; Lin, CK				Thakur, DP; Lin, CK			Water quality and nutrient budget in closed shrimp (Penaeus monodon) culture systems	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						shrimp culture; closed system; water quality; growth; nutrient budget	INTENSIVE FISH PONDS; MODEL FARMING PONDS; STOCKING DENSITY; AQUACULTURE; FABRICIUS; AMMONIA	An experiment was conducted for intensive culture of shrimp (Penaeus monodon) in concrete tanks for a period of 90 days without water exchange (closed system) to determine the effects of stocking density (25 and 50 juveniles per in 2) and bottom substrate (soil and concrete) on water quality, shrimp growth performance, and nutrient distribution and budget. Total ammonia and nitrite-nitrogen concentrations in all the treatments remained low in the safe range for shrimp during the study period. Shrimp weight gain and production was higher in the treatment with higher stocking density. Shrimp survival and FCR were not significantly different among the treatments. Nutrient budget revealed that shrimp could assimilate only 23-31% nitrogen and 10-13% phosphorus of the total inputs. The major source of nutrient input was feed, shrimp feed accounted for 76-92% nitrogen and 70-91% phosphorus of the total inputs. The major sinks of nutrients were in the sediment, which accounted for 14-53% nitrogen and 39-67% phosphorus of the total inputs. The drained water at harvest contained 14-28% nitrogen and 12-29% phosphorus of the total inputs.

J	Marion, L; Paillisson, JM				Marion, L; Paillisson, JM			A mass balance assessment of the contribution of floating-leaved macrophytes in nutrient stocks in an eutrophic macrophyte-dominated lake	AQUATIC BOTANY			English	Article						nutrients; floating-leaved macrophytes; shallow lakes; biomass	SUBMERGED MACROPHYTES; AQUATIC MACROPHYTES; SEDIMENT PHOSPHORUS; BIOMASS PRODUCTION; WATER-QUALITY; NITROGEN; GROWTH; DECOMPOSITION; ACCUMULATION; MOBILIZATION	In this study we examine the contribution of three floating-leaved macrophyte species, Nymphaea alba, Trapa natans and Nymphoides peltata (covering about 700-750 ha), in the N and P stocks in a shallow eutrophic lake (4000-6300 ha) during a 3-year period (1995-1997). The monthly nutrient standing stocks in the above-ground structures of the plants were derived from biomass, nutrient content and area covered by each plant species during the growth period. These N and P quantities were compared to the net nutrient inputs of the lake waters from the catchment area recorded in the winter (water discharging phase), preceding the vegetation period. N and P contents reached high values for the three species (2.16-3.23% N and 0.29-0.68% P) showing the ability of the plants to accumulate large nutrient contents. Despite significant annual fluctuations in nutrient contents and biomass, not always in the same way for each floating-leaved macrophyte, and changes in the area they covered, the maximum monthly P stocks in the plants were globally uniform between the 3 years (7.10-8.85 tonnes). Maximum values for N ranged from 40.85 to 54.55 tonnes in summer. The vast beds of N. alba (until 75% of the total area in 1997), contributed largely to these annual nutrient stocks (50-72% and 46-70%, respectively, for N and P). Whereas the nutrient stocks estimated in the plants during the biomass peak represented little proportions of the annual net flux of N in the lake waters (3.35-5.00%), they reached high proportions for P sometimes exceeding the annual net loading of P in the lake according to years (16.80-156.25%). These results suggest that the nutrient-enriched sediments of the lake (6-53 and 2-6 times the net annual P and N inputs) probably compensate for annual variations in the external nutrient loading, notably for P, and floating-leaved macrophytes are likely not limited when the inputs from the catchment area are small.

J	Meixner, T; Bales, RC				Meixner, T; Bales, RC			Hydrochemical modeling of coupled C and N cycling in high-elevation catchments: Importance of snow cover	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							SIERRA-NEVADA; NITROGEN SATURATION; FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; ROCKY-MOUNTAINS; GENERAL-MODEL; UNITED-STATES; CALIFORNIA; EXPORT; TEMPERATE; TRANSFORMATIONS	Several ecosystems in the western US are already undergoing nitrogen (N) saturation, a condition where previously N limited ecosystems are no longer N limited. This state of N saturation leads to adverse impacts on terrestrial ecology and water quality. Due to the complexities of terrestrial carbon-nitrogen cycling, integrated hydrologic-biogeochemical modeling provides a tool to improve our understanding and discern between the impacts of changes in N deposition from changes in other ecosystem processes. A model of biogeochemical processing in alpine watersheds was developed and applied to the Emerald Lake watershed. Simulations of major terrestrial carbon and nitrogen pools and fluxes were adequate. The use of snow cover information to estimate soil temperatures improved model simulations indicating that snow cover processes need to be incorporated into biogeochemical models of seasonally snow covered areas. The model simulated mineral nitrogen processes well but significant changes in denitrification and dissolved organic nitrogen export processes appear to be necessary. Our results also showed that variations in snow cover duration have more of an impact on mineral N export, plant uptake and mineralization than appears possible due to changes in atmospheric deposition.

Also bacterial water quality enhancement was measured. The system had a Phragmites australis vegetation and comprised four parallel compartments of 0.25 ha each, which were loaded sequentially with sewage from recreational facilities. Annual loading rates were moderate and were estimated to be 16 700 kg COD ha(-1); 6700 kg BOD(5) ha(-1); 2400 kg N ha(-1); and 335 kg P ha(-1). The removal efficiencies for COD (81%) and BOD5 (96%) were high. Almost all Escherichia coli and F-specific RNA bacteriophages (>99%) were removed from the wastewater during transport. The removal efficiencies for nitrogen (30%) and phosphorus (24%) were much lower. Nutrient removal was the result of plant uptake and harvesting (15% of total N input, 10% of total P input), denitrification (8% of total N input), sedimentation and accumulation of organic matter in the soil (7% of N total input, 14% of total P input). Removal efficiencies for N and P could be increased by harvesting the Phragmites vegetation in October, rather than the current harvesting practice in December. This vertical-flow wetland appeared to be P-saturated after 15 years of operation. The use of sandy sediments with better P-adsorbing properties is advocated as a critical issue for the design of these systems. Further, the groundwater eutrophication resulting from the poor functioning of the drainage systems has shown that a good hydraulic separation of vertical-flow systems from the subsurface is an important prerequisite for their proper functioning.

The POTAMON model [Everbecq E. et al. (2001) Water Research, 35, 901] has been used to simulate the effect of benthic bivalves (mainly Dreissena polymorpha ) on the phytoplankton and zooplankton in a lowland Western European river (the Moselle). Here we use a modified version of the POTAMON model with five categories of phytoplankton (Stephanodiscus, Cyclotella -like, large diatoms, Skeletonema and non-siliceous algae) to model filter-feeding effects of benthic bivalves in the Moselle. Zooplankton has been represented in the model by two categories, Brachionus -like and Keratella -like rotifers. 2. According to density estimates from field surveys (Bachmann V. et al. (1995) Hydroecologie Appliquee, 7, 185, Bachmann V. & Usseglio-Polatera P. (1999) Hydrobiologia, 410, 39), zebra mussel density varied among river stretches, and increased through the year to a maximum in summer. Dreissena filtration rates from the literature were used, and mussels have been assumed to feed on different phytoplankton categories (but less on large and filamentous diatoms) as well as on rotifers. 3. The simulations suggest a significant impact of benthic filter-feeders on potamoplankton and water quality in those stretches where the mussels are abundant, their impact being maximal in summer. Consequently, different plankton groups were not affected to the same extent, depending on their period of development and on indirect effects, such as predation by mussels on herbivorous zooplankton. 4. A daily carbon balance for a typical summer shows the effect of benthic filter-feeders on planktonic and benthic processes: the flux of organic matter to the bottom is greatly enhanced at high mussel density; conversely, production and breakdown of organic carbon in the water column are reduced. Mussel removal would drive the carbon balance of the river toward autotrophy only in the downstream stretches.

S. water bodies. Because of their feeding habits and abundance, shad have the potential to affect primary productivity (and hence water quality) directly through phytoplankton grazing and indirectly through zooplankton grazing and nutrient recycling. To test the ability of shad to influence primary productivity, we conducted a 16-day enclosure study (in 2.36-m(3) mesocosms) and a 3-year whole-pond manipulation in 2-5 ha earthen ponds. In the mesocosm experiment, shad reduced zooplankton density and indirectly enhanced chlorophyll a concentration, primary productivity, and photosynthetic efficiency (assimilation number). While shad did not affect total phytoplankton density in the mesocosms, the density of large phytoplankton was directly reduced with shad. Results from the pond study were not consistent as predicted. There were few changes in the zooplankton and phytoplankton communities in ponds with versus ponds without gizzard shad. One apparent difference from systems in which previous work had been conducted was the presence of high densities of a potential competitor (i.e., larval bluegill) in our ponds. We suggest that the presence of these extremely high larval bluegill densities (20-350 larval bluegill m(-3); 3-700 times higher density than that of larval gizzard shad) led to the lack of differences between ponds with versus ponds without gizzard shad. That is, the influence of gizzard shad on zooplankton or phytoplankton was less than the influence of abundant bluegill larvae. Differences in systems across regions must be incorporated into our understanding of factors affecting trophic interactions in aquatic systems if we are to be able to manage these systems for both water quality and fisheries.

During the monitoring period, surface-water total phosphorus (TP) concentrations have typically varied between 20 and 25 mug P l(-1). However, elevated total phosphorus concentrations were measured in 1987, 1991, and 1999. Diatom-based reconstruction of the historical lake-water TP concentrations was therefore employed to study the recent development of the lake. However, the diatom-TP model did not predict the high measured phosphorus concentrations despite the changes observable in diatom assemblages. In addition, the ratio of sedimentary diatom remains to chrysophycean stomatocysts declined towards the top of the sediment core, indicating decreasing trophy rather than eutrophication. Analysis of sedimentary pigments and phosphorus fractions, used to examine further the changes, also produced results that contradicted the simple eutrophication hypothesis. In particular, the proportion of chlorophyll derivatives instead of carotenoids increased and there was a rise in the concentration of refractory instead of NaOH-extracted phosphorus. These features appear to be related to the extensive littoral areas of the lake since enhanced littoral production can explain both the observed changes in sediment chemistry and the low diatom-inferred TP (DI-TP). Littoral primary producers are suggested to have benefited from the increased phosphorus inputs to the lake, transferring some of the phosphorus to the detrital pool and contributing to the increased pigment concentrations of sedimentary organic matter. High proportions of non-planktonic diatoms in the samples lower DI-TP because periphytic taxa are assigned low TP optima in the inference models used. Abundant aquatic macrophytes may also have made the lake resistant to eutrophication by assimilating nutrients, providing refuge for zooplankton, and having an allelopathic effect on phytoplankton. Since similar to1980, however, the sedimentary diatom assemblages also indicate increasingly eutrophic conditions. Additional loading from numerous cottages during the last 20 years seems to have caused observable changes in the phytoplankton communities.

In this paper we couple changes in suspended particulate inorganic material (SPIM) resulting from wind driven sediment resuspension, and variations in the discharge and sediment load, to spectral variations in subsurface light and estimates of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). To accomplish this we use a semi-analytical model which predicts the spectral variations in downwelling irradiance (E-d(lambda)) and the attenuation coefficient of downwelling irradiance (K-d(lambda)), as a function of the concentrations of chlorophyll, dissolved yellow substances, and suspended inorganic and organic particulate material. Unusually high river discharge, led to large inputs of yellow substances and large in lake yellow substance concentrations (a(ys)(420)approximate to20 m(-1)), causing variations in yellow substance concentration to have the greatest role in influencing temporal trends in the attenuation of PAR and variations in the depth of the euphotic zone (Z(eup)). In spite of this, variations in SPIM could account for approximately 60% of the variation in Z(eup) attributed to changes in yellow substances alone. Our results show that changes in suspended sediment concentration leads to both long-term and short-term changes in the attenuation of PAR, even in the presence of high concentrations of dissolved yellow substances.

Environmental impacts of coastal-plain activities on sandy beach systems: Hazards, perception and mitigation	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						coastal hazards; coastal pollution; nutrient loading; seepage meter; submarine groundwater discharge; water quality	SUBMARINE GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE; SEEPAGE FLUX; FLORIDA; WATER; NUTRIENT; PATTERNS; SEA; EUTROPHICATION; VARIABILITY; EVERGLADES	Managed sandy beach environments along developed shores often appear safe and healthy because obvious hazards such as beach erosion and flooding are considered within the purview of various mitigation programs. A range of insidious and generally unseen hazards, mostly related to pollution, often pose greater threats to the wellbeing of beach systems than do the highly visible, well publicized shoreline retreat and inundation events. Some unseen hazards, such as submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) laden with nutrients from. agro-urban activities on adjacent coastal plains,,are pervasive, processes of environmental degradation that occur so gradually that sequential impacts escape public attention. The contribution of SGDs to the coastal hydrologic regime is occasionally recognized in association with crescendo events associated with marine algal blooms that degrade water quality, bottom habitats, and coral reef ecology. Because the real dangers of SGD are probably unknown at this time, it is essential to initiate seepage meter studies of the already known high levels of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) that are discharged to beach and nearshore environments. Locations of some of the larger submarine freshwater springs along the southeast Florida inner continental shelf are generally known, although volumes of flow have historically been reduced by reduction of head on the coastal plain. Submarine. groundwater provides, on a continual basis, the most direct nutrient linkage to nearshore environments. The insidious nature of the problem requires specialized detection techniques that incorporate site inspection of rock outcrop and reef morphology (for submarine springs and seeps), satellite and airborne remote sensing (coastal morphology, turbidity plumes), physical seepage measurement in situ, monitoring wells, and mini-piezometers to measure hydraulic flow. Discharges of surface water into estuaries exacerbate SGD-related pollution, as do sewage spills and outfall. pipes that discharge in the open ocean fronting beaches. Groundwater discharges for Palm Beach County are, for example, estimated at 1,659 x 10(6) m(3) a(-1). Total N in groundwater below the coastal plain adjacent to remnant Everglades averages about 1.3 mg l(-1). Groundwater nutrient fluxes to the coast are 5727 and 414 metric tons per year for N and P, respectively. Surface water contributions for N and P are respectively 2,473 and 197 metric tons per year. Nutrient delivery to beach and nearshore environments is a serious problem that threatens coastal water quality which in turn will impact beach-related activities. The full impact of the problem has yet to surface because it takes about 5 to 8 decades for groundwater from the interior parts of the coastal plain to reach the nearshore zone. Pollution of groundwaters has increased over the past five decades due to higher doses of fertilizers on croplands and runoff from expanding urban areas. The environmental quality of beach systems along this developed shore is clearly at risk from continuous pollution via nutrient-laden SGD.

We evaluated discharge and NO3-N fluxes passing the outlet of an Iowa watershed (5134 ha) and two of its the-drained subbasins (493 and 863 ha) from mid-1992 through 2000. The cumulative NO3-N load from the catchment was 168 kg ha(-1), and 176 and 229 kg ha(-1) from the subbasins. The outlet had greater total discharge (1831 mm) and smaller flow-weighted mean NO3-N concentration (9.2 mg L-1) than the subbasins, while the larger subbasins had greater (1712 vs. 1559 mm) and mean NO3-N concentration (13.4 vs. 11.3mg L-1) than the smaler subbasin. Concentrations exceeding 10 mg L-1 were common, but least frequent at the outlet. Nitrate N kyas generally not diluted by large flows, except during 1993 flooding. The outlet showed smaller NO3-N concentrations at low flows. Relationships between discharge and NO3-N. flux showed log-log slopes near 1.0 for the subbasins, and 1.2 for the outlet, considering autocorrelation and measurement-error effects. We estimated denitrification of subbasin NO3-N fluxes in a hypothetical wetland using published data. Assuming that temperature and NO3-N supply could limit denitrification, then about 20% of the NO3-N would have been denitrifled criteria. The low by a wetland constructed to meet USDA approved efficiency results from the seasonal timing and NO3-N content of large flows. Therefore, agricultural and wetland best management practices (BMPs) are needed to achieve water quality goals in the-drained watersheds.

Durinta) in a controlled greenhouse were compared with potassium nitrate (KNO3)-the conventional K source for vegetable fertigation. The treatments consisted of four levels of KCl: (1) 0% KCl (100% KNO3) (2) 40% KCl (40% KCl and 60% KNO3) (3) 60% KCl (60% KCl and 40% KNO3) and (4) 100% KCl (0% KNO3) in fertigation solution in the season 1999-2000. In 2000-2001, early (12 days after planting) and late (47 days after planting) applications of 100% KCl and 0% KCl were tested. The concentrations of K and other major nutrients were similar in all the treatments. Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) calcium nitrate [Ca(NO3)(2)] and nitric acid (HNO3) were used as nitrogen (N) sources in KCl treatments. Electrical conductivity (EC) of all solutions ranged from 1.8 to 2.1 dS m(-1); pH range was from 6.6 to 7.1. Perlite was used as a neutral growing medium. Plant height, time to anthesis, time to harvest, and leaf nutrient content were monitored. Total yield, average fruit weight and number, and fruit size were measured after harvest. The appearance and quality of the fruits were rated following cold storage simulation for export conditions. None of the plants showed chloride (Cl) toxicity symptoms. No significant differences in yield components and plant growth were recorded among the treatments. Fruit dry matter, total soluble solids (TSS), glucose, fitrable acidity (TA), pH, and EC of juice after simulation storage were not affected by the K source. Interestingly, fruit firmness, and freshness of calyx were significantly improved, while the number of rotten and blotchy fruits was significantly decreased in KCl treatments. The fruit nitrate (NO3) content was decreased whereas iron (Fe) content was significantly increased in KCl treatments. The results show that KCl can be used as a substitute for KNO3 without detrimental effects on plant development and yield, while significantly improving some important quality parameters. It is concluded that KNO3 can be replaced fully or partially (depending on water quality) by KCl in tomato production while improving the quality of fruits.

In the sludge cultivation phase, the applied ranges of total chemical oxygen demand (COD,), total phosphorus (T-P) and total nitrogen (T-N) concentration in synthetic wastewater were 100.0similar to300.0, 1.7similar to5.0 and 13.3similar to40.0 mg/L, respectively. Empirical results indicated effluent nutrient concentrations of T-N and T-P were less than 8.1 mg/L and 0.5 mg/L when a three step-feeding mode was applied, and water quality data was collected to train and pre-test the ANNs. Further simulation was finished when the step-feeding ratio was Q(1):Q(2):Q(3)= 0.8:0.2:0.0 (recycling sludge ratio = 0.25). Statistical coefficients of correlation between simulated and experimental values were 0.58, 0.95, 0.89, and 0.90 for soluble COD (CODs), phosphate (PO4-P), ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) and nitrate/nitrite (NOx-N), respectively. Due to low root mean squared error and high correlation coefficient between simulated and experimental data, artificial intelligence technology offered an alternative approach to simulating nutrient removal in an EBNR system.

In our study, we considered an exponential equation from an aqua-environmental perspective with the goal of obtaining good growth of rice plants in order to estimate the concentrations and integrated volume of ammonia nitrogen accompanying paddy percolation. Using this exponential equation, we were able to derive a relation between time and concentrations of paddy percolation water, and hypothesized that if percolation rates were less than 10 mm/day, percolation would have no effect on rice growth, while simultaneously helping to maintain the good water quality of the extra-paddy environment. We also clarified the differences between the potential ammonia nitrogen adsorption volume derived from the CEC value and the integrated amount of ammonia nitrogen water in soil, and considered the causes from the perspectives of solute movement and water movement.

The paddy field lots were irrigated by the ponds and several mountain streams. In the study watershed, there were two ponds located on the upper and lower sides of a paddy area. Water could be pumped up from the lower pond to the upper pond as necessary. At the ponds, the total amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the inflow loads including the sediment release was larger than those in the outflow loads. In SS, the effect of load reduction in the ponds was high. It is assumed that organic load reduction was not expected in the ponds. The study result indicates that it is possible to remove the nutrients in the ponds when a larger amount of water is pumped up than when the ponds are only in irrigation use. Moreover, the removal capacities of the nutrients could probably be increased in both ponds by controlling the amount of sediment releases.

The Tool provides a framework that may be applied across the UK to estimate P loss, which is sensitive not only to land use and management but also to environmental factors such as climate, soil type and topography. The model complexity incorporated in the P Indicators Tool has been adapted to the level of detail in the available data and the need to reflect the impact of changes in agriculture. Currently, the Tool runs on an annual timestep and at a 1 km(2) grid scale. We demonstrate that the P Indicators Tool works in principle and that its modular structure provides a means of accounting for P loss from one layer to the next, and ultimately to receiving waters. Trial runs of the Tool suggest that modelled P delivery to water approximates measured water quality records. The transparency of the structure of the P Indicators Tool means that identification of poorly performing coefficients is possible, and further refinements of the Tool can be made to ensure it is better calibrated and subsequently validated against empirical data, as it becomes available.

J	Webster, CP; Conway, JS; Crew, AP; Goulding, KWT				Webster, CP; Conway, JS; Crew, AP; Goulding, KWT			Nitrogen leaching losses under a less intensive farming and environment (LIFE) integrated system	SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						nitrate; leaching; farming systems; arable farming; water quality	CROP HUSBANDRY; NITRATE; FERTILIZER	Less Intensive Farming and Environment (LIFE) management is a form of integrated farming which aims to meet farming's economic and environmental requirements. We used a farm-scale LIFE demonstration to measure nitrogen (N) leaching losses over a 6 year period (1995-2001) using ceramic suction cups and a meteorological model to give estimates of drainage volumes. Losses from the system averaged 49 kg N ha(-1), with an average drainage nitrate concentration of 15.5 mg N L-1. Rainfall and its distribution strongly influenced the loss, and drainage N concentration only fell below the nominal target of 11.3 mg N L-1 (the EU limit for potable water) in the two wettest seasons. Crop type did not have a significant effect on either postharvest mineral N (PHMN) in soil or the leaching loss in the subsequent winter. However PHMN and overwinter N leaching declined with increasing crop yield. Overwinter crop N uptake increased with early sowing: leaching loss was only 5 kg N ha(-1) under grass sown in early September. Measurements of PHMN, crop sowing date and drainage data were used to construct simple equations to predict average drainage N concentration under various scenarios. The large N loss from our site is partially attributable to soil type (shallow over limestone), indeed on similar soil the loss from a conventional farm nearby was greater. The LIFE practices of postharvest harrowing and late cereal sowing will minimize the need for agrochemical use but they stimulate mineralization and reduce plant N uptake in autumn, leaving more N at risk to leaching. Some assessment of all environmental impacts is needed if the benefits of integrated practices such as those used in LIFE are to be quantified.

A wide range of drain spacing was considered for each depth. Corn yields were predicted and an economic analysis was conducted to determine the drain spacing giving maximum predicted profit for each depth. Results showed that nitrogen losses from subsurface drains can be reduced by placing the drains at shallow depths. In order to satisfy agricultural production requirements, shallow drains must be placed closer together than deeper drains. While predicted agricultural profits for the shallow drains are reduced somewhat compared to the deeper drains, overall profits are substantially increased when the cost of removing N from drainage water is considered.

J	Agouridis, CT; Edwards, DR				Agouridis, CT; Edwards, DR			The development of relationships between constituent concentrations andgeneric hydrological variables	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						cost benefit; flow; flow-weighted mean concentration; loads; model; water quality	BROILER LITTER; QUALITY; RUNOFF; FERTILIZER; WATER; SOILS	The collection and analysis of samples from storm events constitutes a large portion of the effort associated with water quality research. Estimating concentrations or loads from these events is often difficult. The equipment necessary to analyze the samples and the required laboratory resources are typically significant expenses incurred by the researcher. One potential method to reduce these costs is through the development of generic relationships between concentrations and easily measured variables such as dimensionless flow rate or time. The benefits recognized from such an effort include a reduction in the number of required samples, resulting in a reduction in cost. Using data collected from an Arkansas stream near Fayetteville, relationships between the generic variables (time and flow) and several constituents (nitrate-N, orthophosphate, total phosphorus, ammonia-N, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, chemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids, fecal coliforms, and fecal streptococci) were examined. Results of the analyses indicated that a form of the gamma function could be used to estimate the flow-weighted mean concentrations and loads of the constituents at a significant cost savings to the user, assuming that single-peak hydrograph data were readily available. By using a single sample collected at the peak of the storm along with information pertaining to the time of sample collection, time of the peak of the storm hydrograph, and the constituent concentration of the sample, the flow-weighted mean concentration or load could be determined. Results of the analysis indicate that the method performed reasonably well. Since the analysis of only one sample is required to determine the flow-weighted mean concentration or load, instead of several samples, this method is quite appealing to users on a limited budget.

J	Arauzo, M				Arauzo, M			Harmful effects of un-ionised ammonia on the zooplankton community in a deep waste treatment pond	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						phytoplankton; pH; NH3; zooplankton; deep waste treatment pond	TOXICITY; ROTIFER; ALGAE	The harmful effects of NH3 on the zooplankton community in a deep waste treatment pond were evaluated under natural conditions. The pond, supplied with secondary effluent from a conventional urban wastewater treatment plant, was designed to improve water quality for agricultural reuse. The aim of the study was to verify the hypothesis suggested in Arauzo et al. (Water Environ. Res. 34(14), 3666) that during phytoplankton blooms in the stratification periods high un-ionised ammonia content values, due to an intense photosynthetic activity and high related pH, lead to a decrease in zooplankton biomass and, thus, to a collapse of the treatment process efficiency. Empirical models were developed to determine relationships between phytoplankton biomass, pH and NH3 levels. They provided an easy and quick method of detecting when the system was liable to collapse due to the NH3 effect on the zooplankton community and offered the possibility of adopting measures to guarantee water quality at the effluent. A significant decrease in zooplankton community biomass was observed at un-ionised ammonia levels over 2.5 mg L-1 (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Results of this intensive monitoring programme presented in this paper are related to the surveys on atmospheric deposition and soil solution chemistry, focusing on data for 1997. Both bulk deposition and throughfall of N was higher than that of S at nearly all the plots, especially in Western Europe. The average calculated total N deposition was approximately twice as large as S. Approximately, 55% of the considered plots received an N input above 1000 mol(c) ha(-1) yr(-1) (14 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)), being a deposition level above which the species diversity of the,ground vegetation may decrease. The total input of acidity ranged mostly between 200 and 4000 mol(c) ha(-1) yr(-1). The deposition of SO4, NO, and Ca was significantly higher in the central/eastern part of Europe, but NH4 was slightly higher in western Europe. A highly significant positive correlation of atmospheric deposition and rainfall was observed for most ions. The concentrations of NO3 in soil solution exceeded the EU ground water quality criterion of 800 mmol(c) m(-3) in the subsoil at 9% of the plots. Al/ (Ca + Mg + K) ratios exceeded a critical ratio of 1.0 in approximately 30-39% of the plots, depending on the layer considered. The concentration of potentially toxic At in the subsoil was strongly related to the concentration of SO4 and NO3 in soils with a base saturation below 25% or a pH below 4.5, indicating that Al release is the dominant buffering process in acid soils. Above a base saturation of 25% and a pH level of 4.5, there was a strong relationship between Ca and strong acid anions, indicating that the acidity is mainly neutralised by the release of base cations in less acidified soils. The variation in concentrations of major ions in the soil solution could be, to a large extent, explained by differences in atmospheric deposition and meteorological conditions.

Likely sources for N and P are industries, dwellings and agriculture. A GIS based model is proposed to analyse which of these sources cause the main problems. Simulated concentrations were compared with standards for TN and TP representing natural conditions in running water. The model was applied on the strongly disturbed catchment of the river Dommel (Belgium/The Netherlands). It was taken into account that river sediments may act as a sink for nutrients. Flows from point sources and dwellings were taken from databases. Diffuse sources were assumed to be a percentage of the anthropogenic input, defined as the nutrient input on the soil minus crop yield. A regression analysis on ten headwaters without point sources suggests that 5.5% of anthropogenic N and 0.02% of anthropogenic P has leached to the river network. Applying the model for all tributaries of the Dommel yielded a good fit between observed and simulated TN and TP loads (R-2 of 0.88 and 0.95, respectively). All analysed tributaries exceed the standards for TN and TP. Analysis suggests that point sources are-overall-the main contributor to nutrient fluxes, although they affect few tributaries only. Most intermediate and small tributaries are affected by diffuse flows from agricultural pastures (24.2 kg TN ha(-1) yr(-1); 0.82 kg TP ha(-1) yr(-1)). It can be argued that reduction of point sources may help to minimise the magnitude of the nutrient fluxes on the catchment scale, reduction of diffuse sources may help to restore a good water quality on the scale of individual tributaries.

The objective of the study was to determine P concentration in tile-drainage water and its relationship to P status in surface soils (A horizons) from an intensively cultivated area in the Montreal Lowlands. The profiles of 43 soil units were characterized for their P contents and pedogenic properties. Tile-drainage water P concentrations were monitored over a 3-yr period on a weekly basis on 10 soil units, and four times during each growing season for the other 33 units. The soil units were grouped into lower and higher P sorbing soils using multiple discriminant equations developed in an earlier related study. The A horizons of the lower P sorbing soils had an elevated P saturation degree [mean Mehlich(III) P/Al = 17%] associated with total P concentrations in tile-drainage water consistently greater than the surface water quality standard of 0.03 mg total P L-1. Conversely, low P concentrations in tile-drainage waters (<0.03 mg L-1) and a moderate mean Mehlich(HI) P/Al ratio of 8% were observed in the higher P sorbing soil group. Total P concentrations in drainage systems were significantly related to soil P status in surface soils. Grouping soils according to their P sorption capacities increased the power of prediction based on only one soil variable. However, accurate predictions in terms of drain P concentration can hardly be obtained unless large dataset and other factors related to field management practices and hydrology of the sites are also considered. Therefore, a better alternative to predict the risk of P leaching is to work in terms of risk classes and rely on a multiple factor index.

J	Koskiaho, J				Koskiaho, J			Flow velocity retardation and sediment retention in two constructed wetland-ponds	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						hydrodynamic modeling; constructed wetlands; hydraulic efficiency; flow patterns; sediment retention	PHOSPHORUS	Hydraulic properties of two constructed wetland-ponds in agricultural watersheds in southern Finland were examined by simulations with two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality transport models. Hydraulic efficiency was determined for the existing and hypothetical layouts of both wetlands to find out the effects of different design options. Suspended sediment retention in the wetlands was simulated with a two-dimensional model for sediment transport. Hydraulic efficiency was found to be highly improved by baffles that direct the main flow to optimally exploit the wetland acreage. Also, an elongated shape of wetland appeared beneficial; hydraulic efficiency was high regardless of the size or position of the inlet. As for suspended sediment retention, the wetland area in relation to its watershed proved to be an essential factor. According to water quality observations, the wetland which occupied 5% of its watershed area was capable of reducing the inflow of total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations during flood events by 43-72%, whereas the reduction varied between -7 and 5% in the other wetland with a corresponding ratio of 0.5%. Model simulations of the same flood events plausibly predicted the output TSS concentrations, even though with wider ranges of the reductions (26 to 74 and -13 to 43%, respectively).

J	Legovic, T				Legovic, T			Prediction of seawater quality around Island Rab (Adriatic Sea)	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						modeling; management; seawater quality; Island Rab; Adriatic Sea; prediction; total coliform bacteria; total phosphorus	COASTAL SEA; BAY; SIMULATIONS; VENICE	One of the consequences of the anticipated growth of tourist industry on the island Rab (Adriatic Sea) is that the, source of wastewater will increase. If present practice of releasing wastewaters into the sea were to continue, sea water quality in recreational zones would worsen. This forced Rab municipality to consider options for expansion of canalization, waste treatment and submarine outfalls. Three options were put forth. Analysis and modeling reported here were used to choose the most acceptable among proposed options. Based on estimates of wastewater sources and oceanographic properties, water quality around island Rab is predicted. It is concluded that in principle each. option could satisfy water quality criteria specified by the lawmaker. The option, which is chosen as the best solution, satisfies additional ecological as-well as socially acceptable conditions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Walsh, SE; Soranno, PA; Rutledge, DT				Walsh, SE; Soranno, PA; Rutledge, DT			Lakes, wetlands, and streams as predictors of land use/cover distribution	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						lakes; streams; wetlands; land use/cover; land use change; riparian	LANDSCAPE CHANGE; RIPARIAN FOREST; WATER-QUALITY; COVER CHANGE; VALUES; USA; PHOSPHORUS; WISCONSIN; MODEL	The importance of the surrounding landscape to aquatic ecosystems has been well established. Most research linking aquatic ecosystems to landscapes has focused on the one-way effect of land on water. However, to understand fully the complex interactions between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, aquatic ecosystems must be seen not only as receptors of human modification of the landscape, but also as potential drivers of these modifications. We hypothesized that the presence of aquatic ecosystems influences the spatial distribution of human land use/cover of the nearby landscape (less than or equal to 1 km) and that this influence has changed through time from the 1930s to the 1990s. To test this hypothesis, we compared the distribution of residential, agricultural, and forested land use/cover around aquatic ecosystems (lakes, wetlands, and streams) to the overall regional land use/cover proportion in an area in southeast Michigan, USA; we also compared the distribution of land use/cover around county roads/highway and towns (known determinants of many land use/cover patterns) to the regional proportion. We found that lakes, wetlands, and streams were strongly associated with the distribution of land use/cover, that each ecosystem type showed different patterns, and that the magnitude of the association was at least as strong as the association with human features. We also found that the area closest to aquatic ecosystems (<500 m) was more strongly associated with land use/cover distribution than areas further away. Finally, we found that the strength of the association between aquatic ecosystems and land use/cover increased from 1938 to 1995, although the overall patterns were similar through time. Our results show that a more complete understanding is needed of the role of aquatic ecosystems on the distribution of land use/cover.

The effects of catchment urbanisation on water quality were examined for 30 streams (stratified into 15, 50 and 100 km(2) +/- 25% catchments) in the Etowah River basin, Georgia, U.S.A. We examined relationships between land cover (implying cover and use) in these catchments (e.g. urban, forest and agriculture) and macroinvertebrate assemblage attributes using several previously published indices to summarise macroinvertebrate response. Based on a priori predictions as to mechanisms of biotic impairment under changing land cover, additional measurements were made to assess geomorphology, hydrology and chemistry in each stream. 2. We found strong relationships between catchment land cover and stream biota. Taxon richness and other biotic indices that reflected good water quality were negatively related to urban land cover and positively related to forest land cover. Urban land cover alone explained 29-38% of the variation in some macroinvertebrate indices. Reduced water quality was detectable at c . >15% urban land cover. 3. Urban land cover correlated with a number of geomorphic variables such as stream bed sediment size (-) and total suspended solids (+) as well as a number of water chemistry variables including nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations (+), specific conductance (+) and turbidity (+). Biotic indices were better predicted by these reach scale variables than single, catchment scale land cover variables. Multiple regression models explained 69% of variation in total taxon richness and 78% of the variation in the Invertebrate Community Index (ICI) using phi variability, specific conductance and depth, and riffle phi , specific conductance and phi variability, respectively. 4. Indirect ordination analysis was used to describe assemblage and functional group changes among sites and corroborate which environmental variables were most important in driving differences in macroinvertebrate assemblages. The first axis in a non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination was highly related to environmental variables (slope, specific conductance, phi variability; adj. R (2) =0.83) that were also important in our multiple regression models. 5. Catchment urbanisation resulted in less diverse and more tolerant stream macroinvertebrate assemblages via increased sediment transport, reduced stream bed sediment size and increased solutes.

The method is applied to the estimation of the Maximum Permissible Load of inorganic nitrogen in the lagoon of Venice, that is of the maximum load of nitrogen which keeps its average yearly concentration below a prescribed threshold. The use of the spatial distributions of sensitivity coefficients in order to rank the sources of pollution and to forecast the effect of a reduction in the pollution is also discussed.

J	Schauser, I; Lewandowski, J; Hupfer, M				Schauser, I; Lewandowski, J; Hupfer, M			Decision support for the selection of an appropriate in-lake measure to influence the phosphorus retention in sediments	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						decision support; lake management; eutrophication; lake restoration; sediment phosphorus	WATER-QUALITY; RELEASE	Many in-lake measures which aimed to influence the phosphorus retention in lake sediments have failed to improve the-trophic state of the lakes. The present paper introduces a systematic approach to select an appropriate in-lake measure. Before selecting an in-lake measure the goal of the measure should be defined, the problems,of the lake must be identified, and the probability of success must be estimated. The proposed decision support consists of two parts. Part A, pre-selection, excludes inappropriate measures. It uses six criteria, which are mainly based on-a simple mass-balance model, and the targets of restoration. The criteria describe the magnitude of the external versus the internal phosphorus loading, the dynamics of the internal load, and. the lake morphometry. Each measure is weighted differently with respect to importance and suitability by specific quantified limits.. Part B, selection, uses qualitative criteria, which are, specific to the measure in question. Checking these criteria will help to select a measure with a low risk of failure. The suggested decision support is illustrated in flow charts and exemplified by Lake Arendsee in Germany. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study investigates the dynamic load of TOC from the deep creek watershed into the lower St. Johns River (LSJR), FL, USA, using numerical simulations and field measurements. An existing St. Johns River watershed assessment model for simultaneous loading of nutrients from watersheds into rivers is modified to include the TOC component for the purpose of this study. Three simulation scenarios (i.e., daily, monthly, and annually) are performed to estimate the dynamic load of TOC in response to rainfall events. Simulations show that rainfall events have decisive effects on TOC loads from the Deep Creek watershed into the LSJR. In general, the highly frequent the rainfall events occur, the higher the TOC loads into the river. Simulations also illustrate that effects of rainfall events on daily changes of TOC are minimal in winter, but are profound in late summer. Results suggest that TOC load into the river is not only a rainfall-driven but also a temperature-driven biological process. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lee, JHW; Huang, Y; Dickman, M; Jayawardena, AW				Lee, JHW; Huang, Y; Dickman, M; Jayawardena, AW			Neural network modelling of coastal algal blooms	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						algal blooms; red tides; coastal eutrophication; knowledge-based models; data driven methods; artificial neural networks; real time prediction; water quality modelling; environmental engineering; Hong Kong; Tolo Harbour	DISSOLVED-OXYGEN	An artificial neural network (ANN), a data driven modelling approach, is proposed to predict the algal bloom dynamics of the coastal waters of Hong Kong. The commonly used back-propagation learning algorithm is employed for training the ANN. The modeling is based on (a) comprehensive biweekly water quality data at Tolo Harbour (1982-2000); and (b) 4-year set of weekly phytoplankton abundance data at Lamina Island (1996-2000). Algal biomass is represented as chlorophyll-a and cell concentration of Skeletonema at the two locations, respectively. Analysis of a large number of scenarios shows that the best agreement with observations is obtained by using merely the time-lagged algal dynamics as the network input. In contrast to previous findings with more complicated neural networks of algal blooms in freshwater systems, the present work suggests the algal concentration in the eutrophic sub-tropical coastal water is mainly dependent on the antecedent algal concentrations in the previous 1-2 weeks. This finding is also supported by an interpretation of the neural networks' weights. Through a systematic analysis of network performance, it is shown that previous reports of predictability of algal dynamics by ANN are erroneous in that 'future data' have been used to drive the network prediction. In addition, a novel real time forecast of coastal algal blooms based on weekly data at Lamina is presented. Our study shows that an ANN model with a small number of input variables is able to capture trends of algal dynamics, but data with a minimum sampling interval of 1 week is necessary. However, the sufficiency of the weekly sampling for real time predictions using ANN models needs to be further evaluated against longer weekly data sets as they become available.

We developed a new framework of cost categories that assess both social and ecological damage costs and policy response costs. These findings indicate the severe effects of nutrient enrichment and eutrophication on many sectors of the economy. We estimate the damage costs of freshwater eutrophication in England and Wales to be $105-160 million yr(-1) (pounds 75.0-114.3 m). The policy response costs are a measure of how much is being spent to address this damage, and these amount to $77 million yr(-l) pounds 54.8 m). The damage costs are dominated by seven items each with costs of $15 million yr(-l) or more: reduced value of waterfront dwellings, drinking water treatment costs for nitrogen removal, reduced recreational and amenity value of water bodies, drinking water treatment costs for removal of algal toxins and decomposition products, reduced value of nonpolluted atmosphere, negative ecological effects on biota, and net economic losses from the tourist industry. In common with other environmental problems, it would represent net value (or cost reduction) if damage was prevented at source. A variety of effective economic, regulatory, and administrative policy instruments are available for internalizing these costs.

Grazing management treatments included an ungrazed control, summer hay harvest with winter stockpiled grazing, continuous stocking to a residual height of 5 cm, rotational stocking to a residual height of 5 cm, and rotational stocking to a residual height of 10 cm. At four times (late spring, mid-summer, autumn and early the subsequent spring) in each year, rainfall simulations were conducted at 6 sites within each paddock and 6 sites in a buffer zone down slope from each paddock. Rainfall simulators dripped at a rate of 7.1 cm/hour over a 0.5-m(2) area for a period of 1.5 hours. Runoff was collected and analyzed for total sediment, total phosphorus, and dissolved phosphorus. Simultaneous to each rainfall simulation, measurement was taken of ground cover, penetration resistance, surface roughness, slope, the contents of phosphorus and moisture of the soil, and the sward height and mass of forage. Losses of sediment, total P, and soluble P were greater from grazed paddocks than ungrazed paddocks in year 1. However, in year 2, losses of sediment, total P, and soluble P from paddocks grazed by rotational stocking to a sward height of 10 cm or harvested as hay during the summer and gazed during winter did not differ from ungrazed paddocks. In both years total P losses from the: buffer area immediately or 10 m below the paddocks were lower than within the paddocks. Of the physical measurements, the proportion of ground cover was most highly related to sediment loss. Soil Bray-1 P concentrations did not differ between treatments, but are related to the losses of total and soluble P. Results imply that sediment and phosphorus losses in pasture runoff may be reduced by managing rotational stocking to maintain adequate sward height and/or using vegetative buffer strips along pasture streams. Such management practices are particularly important in pastures on soils with high Bray-1 P concentrations.

To evaluate the impact of wastewater land application on groundwater resources, groundwater samples must be collected and analyzed. Suction lysimeters are a low-cost alternative to monitoring wells for measuring groundwater quality. Lysimeters can be used to collect groundwater from the unsaturated vadose zone, before the application area percolate mixes with groundwater from the upper aquifer. Land application is used to dispose of wastewater generated at a truckwash facility in northern California, where tanker trucks hauling food-grade products (e.g., wine, molasses, vegetable oil) are rinsed and sanitized. Three lysimeters (two in walnut orchards and one in pasture) are used to monitor groundwater conditions at the truckwash land application facility. Lysimeter data collected from 1999 to 2001 were used to evaluate the impact of wastewater land application on groundwater quality, and to determine the effectiveness of the lysimeters in monitoring vadose zone groundwater quality. Based on daily flow records and local meteorological data, a water balance was conducted to estimate the monthly volume of percolate leaching from each field. Using water quality data for the applied wastewater and supplementary irrigation well water, the monthly total nitrogen (TN) load for each field was calculated. Crop nitrogen uptake values were then used to estimate percolate TN concentrations for each field (annual averages of 0.0 to 3.0 mg/L). Lysimeter samples were collected and analyzed quarterly for TN (annual averages of 0.1 to 8.2 mg/L). The annual average lysimeter TN values compared well to the estimated TN values. Based on the results of the study, suction lysimeters may be relied upon to provide representative vadose zone groundwater quality data.								*CA FERT ASS, 1995, W FERT HDB; Reed S.C., 1995, NATURAL SYSTEMS WAST	2	0	0	0	2	AMER SOC AGR ENGINEERS	ST JOSEPH	2950 NILES RD, ST JOSEPH, MI 49085-9659 USA			1-892769-32-8	ASAE PUBL			2003							504	511					8	Agricultural Engineering	Agriculture	BBB33	WOS:000224513200063					2021-01-11

The objective of this study was to measure and simulate how swine manure management affects P export from a row crop watershed. Stream water sampling was conducted for one year at :14 locations within the Tipton Creek watershed in central Iowa. Data on soil P concentrations and manure production were also collected. Geographic Information System (GIS) data layers (topography, soils, land use, and land cover) were prepared to facilitate simulations using the Agricultural Non-Point Source model (AGNPS). The average dissolved reactive (DRP) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in stream water from 41 sampling dates were 0.14 and 0.21 mg L-1, respectively. Total P export from the Tipton Creek watershed from April 1, 2000 to April 1, 2001 was estimated at 10.6 metric tons (Mg) for an average loss of 0.52 kg P ha(-1) Y-1. This loss represents approximately 2.8% of the estimated applied P (swine manure and commercial fertilizer). Four rainfall events during the 2000 growing season and snowmelt in March 2001 were responsible for 91% of the P transport from the watershed. Using animal inventory numbers and standard P excretion values swine manure was estimated to supply approximately 35% of the land-applied P. AGNPS simulations of the 4 major storm events from 2000 were used to predict future P transport from an assumed 5% annual increase in swine production and subsequent increase in P application to soils of the watershed. These simulations indicated that, without any changes in current management, a 40% increase in P transport in such runoff events could occur in the next 5 years. However, a combination of diet manipulation and use of high available-P feedstuffs and/or phytase enzyme has been shown to reduce P excretion by as much as 50%. Broad adoption of these practices would likely prevent any increase in P production from swine facilities and potentially reduce overall manure P production.

J	Aherne, J; Curtis, CJ				Aherne, J; Curtis, CJ			Critical loads of acidity for Irish lakes	AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article						Steady-State Water Chemistry (SSWC) model; acid sensitivity; sulphate deposition; nitrogen leaching; exceedance; uncertainty	SURFACE WATERS; ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; MAJOR IONS; SSWC-MODEL; IRELAND; ACIDIFICATION; SENSITIVITY; CHEMISTRY; NITROGEN	Critical loads of acidity have been estimated for Irish lakes (277) using survey data from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and compatible inputs and methods across both regions. This is the first trans-region application of the Steady-State Water Chemistry model for the island of Ireland. Results indicate that a small percentage of lakes (10.8 %, 30 lakes) have low critical loads of acidity (<50.0 mmol(c) m(-2) yr(-1)). Based on bulk sulphate deposition, exceedance of critical load was observed in 6.9% of the sampled lakes (19 lakes). Inferences relating to the whole lake population cannot be made, as statistical lake surveys were not carried out. However, as the surveys were weighted towards acid-sensitive lakes, the current study suggests that Irish lakes are not under a significant threat from anthropogenic acidification. The acidifying impact of nitrogen was incorporated into the exceedance calculation by superimposing the present leaching of nitrogen onto sulphate deposition. This increased exceedance by similar to40% (i.e., from 11 to 19 lakes). Despite the potential uncertainties associated with using default values and relationships in the Steady-State Water Chemistry model, uncertainty analysis indicated that the critical loads were relatively stable. The critical acid neutralising capacity limit (specified water quality criterion) had the greatest effect on the critical load. In the current study, a catchment dependent limit was employed (ranged: 0-50 mumol(c) L(-1); mean: 35 mumol(c) L(-1)) rather than a single fixed value.

The assessment used soil coring data, modelling and runoff nutrient concentration data. Soil acidification rates were estimated from the simulated nitrate leaching and product removal estimated from the stocking rates at each site. Much higher acidification rates were estimated at sites in Victoria and southern Western Australia than in northern New South Wales. This was because of a lower level of nitrate leaching in summer-dominant rainfall environments coupled with lower stocking rates. Simulations showed highest nitrate leaching on annual pastures, but that a phalaris pasture could reduce this, and a kikuyu pasture could almost fully control leaching. The concentration of P in surface runoff was related to soil P status at the 4 southern sites, indicating that greater use of P fertiliser would increase P movement into waterways. There was no relationship between soil P status and P in surface runoff at the northern New South Wales sites, and across all sites there were no relationships between P fertility and runoff N levels. Concentrations of P and N in runoff greatly exceeded stream water quality guidelines, even on treatments where only minimal P had been applied as fertiliser. There was also evidence of high spatial variation in surface runoff generation, with surface runoff from some plots less than 5% of the streamflow in nearby reference streams. There is therefore scope to control P concentrations in streams by retiring from production the parts of the landscape that generate high quantities of surface flow, but to intensify production on areas that produce little runoff.

We examined the sources of P and N that could contribute to these elevated nutrient concentrations in runoff. The first experiment compared P and N losses in runoff from pasture cut to different residual pasture masses. Flow-weighted P and N concentrations and loads were about 100% higher from pasture cut to 47 mm above ground than from pasture standing at 155 mm. These results indicated that severely defoliated pasture may be a significant source of nutrients when flood irrigated. In the second experiment, pastures were defoliated at a single grazing with different stocking intensities and the flow-weighted P and N concentrations in runoff were determined during 4 successive flood irrigation events. Nitrogen and P concentrations in runoff after the first irrigation following defoliation were higher at the highest stocking intensity. However, the effect of the grazing on nutrient concentrations in runoff declined in subsequent irrigation events. A regression model fitted to the P data indicated that there was a significant linear increase in P concentrations with stocking density and a significant non-linear decline in concentrations with successive irrigations. A similar relationship for TKN concentrations in runoff at each stocking density over the 4 irrigation events was not found. An inconsistency of the TKN concentrations of the supply water between irrigation events possibly helped to mask a similar relationship between N concentrations in runoff and stocking density over the 4 irrigation events. We postulate that both animal excreta and the pasture itself can contribute to elevated nutrient concentrations in flood-irrigation runoff.

All combinations of inputs were simulated and the effects of each input were estimated with sensitivity analysis software (SimLab). Soil type, climate, and sowing date explained about equal amounts of the variance in nitrate leaching, whereas fertiliser application explained only about one-third of the variance of the other inputs. The 2 most significant results were: ( 1) the importance of having plant uptake of nitrogen during autumn and winter to limit nitrate availability for leaching, and ( 2) the recognition that leaching of nitrate becomes increasingly sensitive to farm management practices with decreasing soil depth. The risk of nitrate leaching was found to be very low on deep soils when the crop was sowed in the autumn or winter. These results help with identifying areas where management changes might be effective in reducing the long-term risk of nitrate leaching. Crop growth over winter and judicious use of fertiliser are particularly recommended for cropping on shallow soils.

J	Nahm, KH				Nahm, KH			Bioavailability of phosphorus in poultry manure	AVIAN AND POULTRY BIOLOGY REVIEWS			English	Article						BPP; DP; DRP; p; Redfield ratio; SEP; SP; TP; water contamination	BIOLOGICALLY AVAILABLE PHOSPHORUS; AGRICULTURAL PHOSPHORUS; WATER-QUALITY; INORGANIC PHOSPHORUS; ORGANIC PHOSPHORUS; LEG ABNORMALITIES; PLANKTONIC ALGAE; SURFACE RUNOFF; SOILS; EUTROPHICATION	Phosphorus (P) is a critical nutrient for both animals and plants. P is provided in the diet to poultry as a natural constituent of ingredients and by inorganic salts as supplemental materials. It has been suggested that the P in poultry manure may be a potential source of soil and water hypermineralization. Almost all strategies to control P inputs are based on total P (TP) although most of the P (80-90%) in the runoff is in the soluble form, which is the form of most available for algae uptake. Bioavailable P may be changed from TP to bioavailable P (BAP) and grouped into soluble P (SP) or dissolved P (DP) or dissolved reactive P (DRP), total particulate P (PP) and sediment P (SEP). Particulate P is transported into bioavailable PP (BPP). Poultry manures contain significant amount of P composed of inorganic and organic P, which are changed from inorganic P to dissolved inorganic P and from organic P to dissolved organic P when they are in the soluble forms of the runoff. Most of the P in all manures and composts is inorganic (60-90% of TP) with smaller amounts of organic and residual forms. Water extractable P in poultry manure may be used to estimate the potential for land-applied poultry manures or composts to enrich leachate and surface runoff. The Redfield ratio can be used for obtaining reasonable standards for total P concentration. The proper Redfield ratio for N to P is about 15 to 16:1 when receiving water to the water lab is acceptable. The Redfield ratio of poultry manure is generally two or less. Manure analysis is needed to control the positive and negative long-term effects of manure use in order to minimize P loss into receiving waters.

J	Kim, LH; Choi, E; Stenstrom, MK				Kim, LH; Choi, E; Stenstrom, MK			Sediment characteristics, phosphorus types and phosphorus release rates between river and lake sediments	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Chungpyung Lake; Han river; non-point sources; phosphorus release rate; Jamsil submerged dam; Korea	IMPACTS; FORMS	The Han river is 469.7 km long with 26 219-km(2) area watershed, and is the primary drinking water source for the 20 million people that live in Seoul, Kangwon-Do and Kyunggi-Do, Korea. Phosphorus release from sediments impacts water quality, and is endangering the beneficial use of the river. This research measures phosphorus release and predicts future releases from bottom sediments of two tributary areas (Chungpyung Lake (CPL) and Jamsil submerged dam (JSD) area in the Han river). Sediment samples were taken over a 4-year period from four points in the Jamsil dam area and from 92 points in CPL. The sediments were analyzed for total phosphorus, the form of the phosphorus and release rates under different conditions to the water column. Sediment phosphorus distribution from CPL was 3-5% adsorbed-P (Ads-P), 15-20% non-apatite-P (NAI-P), 25-30% apatite-P (A-P) and 45-57% residual-P (R-P). In the JSD area, the phosphorus distribution ranges were 1-3% Ads-P, 22-39% NAI-P, 26-40% A-P and 30-39% R-P. Laboratory experiments showed that phosphorus release rates from 60 to 80 mg/m(2) week in JSD area and ranged from 25 to 40 mg/m(2) week in CPL sediments. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Evanylo, GK				Evanylo, GK			Effects of biosolids application timing and soil texture on nitrogen availability for corn	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS			English	Article							SEWAGE-SLUDGE; DECOMPOSITION; TRANSFORMATIONS; TEMPERATURE	Empirical data comparing the effects of different off-season application timings of biosolids are needed to develop recommendations that protect water quality and ensure an accurate estimate of plant-available nitrogen (N) for crop production. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of biosolids application timing and soil texture on the availability of N for corn. Field experiments were conducted on coarse- and fine-textured soil types on each of two farms in the Coastal Plain Physiographic Province of Virginia, in 1996-97 and 1997-98. Factorial combinations of three N source-application timing combinations (winter-applied biosolids, and spring-applied applied biosolids, spring ammonium nitrate fertilizer) and three N rates (0.5X, 1.0X, and 1.5X agronomic rate), plus a non-N fertilized control, were arranged in a randomized complete block design for each soil type. The biosolids applied were anaerobically digested and dewatered from the Chesterfield, VA wastewater treatment facility. Soil samples were collected and analyzed for NO(3)(-) and NH(4)(-)N in March and May of each year. Corn was harvested from a randomly selected 6 m section of row in each plot and yields were expressed on a 15.5% moisture basis after weighing the shelled grain. Loss of nitrogen by leaching was greater and plant available N and crop yields were lower: 1) when biosolids were applied in mid-December to early January than in March, 2) in coarse- than fine-textured soils, and 3) during years with high amounts of precipitation regardless of soil texture. Coarse-textured soils are better suited than fine-textured soils for the land application of biosolids in winter because vehicular traffic and incorporation practices are less likely to destroy soil aggregation of well-drained coarse-textured soils; however, the properties that enable these soils to drain readily also facilitates greater leaching losses of nitrate nitrogen during the winter.

J	McDowell, RW				McDowell, RW			Identification of phosphorus species in extracts of soils with contrasting management histories	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS			English	Article							P-31 NMR-SPECTROSCOPY; NUCLEAR-MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; ORGANIC PHOSPHORUS; FRACTIONS; FORMS	A study was conducted to characterize the relative quantity of phosphorus (P) forms and potential P loss from a series of grassland soils with a range of Olsen P concentrations (14 to 120 mg kg(-1)), liming and fertilization histories (e.g., pH 4.1 to 6.6). Soils were extracted with 0.1 M NaOH (measure of P quantity, Q) and 0.01 M CaCl2 (measure of P intensity, I and potentially mobile P) and analyzed by P-31 NMR. Together, a Q/I relationship can be used to indicate when P becomes excessively mobile. Extraction efficiencies ranged from 0.9 to 1.7% of total P for 0.01 M CaCl2 and 55 to 87% of total P for 0.1 M NaOH. A much wider range, and generally greater proportion of P as organic P, was extracted by 0.01 M CaCl2 (phosphonate, orthophosphate, phosphate monoesters and diesters, aromatic phosphate diesters, pyrophosphate and polyphosphate) compared to 0.1 M NaOH (no aromatic phosphate diesters extracted). Forms and concentrations of P species such as the distribution of monoester- and diester-P were a function of soil management (e.g., greater concentrations of these species were noted at lower soil pH). The enhanced solubility in 0.01 M CaCl2 relative to 0.1 M NaOH and wider range of organic P compounds of medium to high bioavailability and movement potential, shows that these species must also be considered in addition to orthophosphate when estimating a soil's potential for P loss and water quality impairment.

J	Lee, DJ; Bowman, DC; Cassel, DK; Peacock, CH; Rufty, TW				Lee, DJ; Bowman, DC; Cassel, DK; Peacock, CH; Rufty, TW			Soil inorganic nitrogen under fertilized bermudagrass turf	CROP SCIENCE			English	Article							SEASON TURFGRASSES; TEMPERATURE; NITRATE	Managed turfgrass acreage in the southeastern USA is steadily increasing. There is public concern that fertilization of turfgrass systems, particularly additions of N on golf courses, might be adversely affecting groundwater quality due to nitrate leaching. This study was conducted to measure soil nitrate levels in situ under continuously managed bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.) and to evaluate influences from fertilization and mineralization. Two experimental sites were established on 50- and 75-yr-old golf course fairways in the Neuse and Cape Fear River basins in eastern North Carolina. Soil sampling was done seasonally. Results indicate that nitrate-N levels were consistently low (I to 4 mg kg(-1) soil) and similar to adjacent natural areas throughout the 120-cm sampling depths during the 2-yr experiment at both sites. Levels were relatively uniform with depth and across several landscape positions. The soil nitrate levels under fertilized fairways were similar to those in adjacent nonfertilized natural areas, indicating minimal influence from turf management practices. From laboratory mineralization studies and soil temperature data, it was estimated that 60 to 154 kg N ha(-1) would be released from organic N pools during the bermudagrass growing season (May to October). Because of similar temperature responses, it appeared that N release from mineralization would be synchronized with bermudagrass growth. Substantial bermudagrass growth in nonfertilized plots provided direct evidence that mineralization was a significant contributor to turf nutrition. There was no evidence that N fertilization or the ecology of the bermudagrass system posed inherent risks to water quality and the environment.

The population of Asia is predicted to grow in the first half of the 21st century. An increase in unit yield and expansion of irrigated fields are solutions to feed the growing population of Asia. At present, it is suggested that agricultural activities sustain an ecosystem. Is such sustainable development possible? Here focused on major river basins with rice-cropping zones from East to South Asia. The amount of available water for cultivating rice and the potential irrigation land area under the present climatic conditions were estimated. Then possible changes in water quality in the future were discussed. The data include those on the course of a river, land-use/land-cover classification, population, climate, nitrous oxide (NOX) emission, and country boundary. Statistical data on rice yield, harvested area, fertilizer consumption, food production, food consumption and food trade were also used. The present water resources almost balance the water demand for the present rice cultivation. The water resources are seasonally in excess. To increase rice production, it is necessary to extend a paddy field or an irrigated area in the dry season. Nitrogen load maps were constructed. The nitrogen load changes seasonally depending on the cropping systems used and precipitation. Denitrification is similar to the nitrogen load and the water quality which is satisfactory at present. In the future, the nitrogen concentration in river water will increase probably because nitrogen discharge from humans and fertilization will increase according to an increase in the population and cultivation intensity, and because fertilization and deposition of NOX will increase according to economic growth. Excessive irrigation and fertilization in the dry season will aggravate the water quality. They will result in a nonsustainable ecosystem in river basins.

We assume that the water quality of such a coastal system, which is known to present dynamics with threshold values resulting from complex interactions between ecological processes and anthropic forcings, play the major role of regulator of all the related economic activities. This unusual concept highlights the central position of the ecosystem dynamics in controlling the evolutive human activities. This paper proposes an optimal control in closed-loop method, which allows a specific human activity, considered as a "polluter", to control, monthly, its contribution to the nitrogen enrichment of the Thau Lagoon, in order to respect a fixed nitrogen target-concentration. In order to set up the method, we formalize the dynamics of total nitrogen concentrations in the lagoon by using a dynamic linear stochastic model, in which variables under control, called control instruments, are distinguished from variables out of control. Two implementations of the method considering one polluter, computed respectively with and without constraint on the instrument control of the polluter, emphasize the adaptability of the economic actor considered to optimize, in real time, his strategy according to both concentration dynamics in the lagoon and the fixed environmental target. Therefore, the interest and the efficiency of the optimal control in closed-loop method was demonstrated, and further improvements with data monitoring or ecological modelling are suggested.

Little attention has been given to diffuse inputs and research into diffuse pollution has been largely confined to agriculture sources. This paper reports on new research that is aimed at integrating diffuse inputs into an urban water quality model. An integrated model is introduced that is made up of four modules: hydrology, contaminant point sources, nutrient cycling and leaching. The hydrology module, T&T consists of a TOPMODEL (a TOPography-based hydrological MODEL), which simulates runoff from pervious areas and a two-tank model, which simulates runoff from impervious urban areas. Linked into the two-tank model, the contaminant point source module simulates the overflow from the sewerage system in heavy rain. The widely known SOILN (SOIL Nitrate model) is the basis of nitrogen cycle module. Finally, the leaching module consists of two functions: the production function and the transfer function. The production function is based on SLIM (Solute Leaching Intermediate Model) while the transfer function is based on the 'flushing hypothesis' which postulates a relationship between contaminant concentrations in the receiving water course and the extent to which the catchment is saturated. This paper outlines the modelling methodology and the model structures that have been developed. An application of this model in the White Cart catchment (Glasgow) is also included.

Changes of mineralization, pH, mineral forms of phosphorus and nitrogen, heavy metals and humic substances in water of main river basins were shown. It was found, that in basins of Zapadny Bug, Dnieper, Danube and Seversky Donets the tendency of pH increase is being observed for the long time. It also should be mentioned that almost for all studied river basins of Ukraine decreasing of phosphorus mineral forms concentrations were identified. That finding allows concluding about obvious discontinuance of global process of surface water eutrophication by phosphorus compounds. Also the comparative analysis of data sets obtained in early 60-s and for period of 1995-2000 indicated the tendency of N-min and NH4+ decreasing almost in 2 times. Relatively high concentrations of dissolved organic matter would be considered as a positive factor of water selfpurification from toxic forms of heavy metals. From another hand, results of field observation as well as computer thermodynamic modeling data have shown that under physicochemical conditions of Ukrainian surface waters trace metals are thermodynamically unstable in a phase of solution. Summarizing results of a long-term data processing concerning distribution of different classes of chemical substances in water, suspended matter, biological materials and sediments we would conclude, that despite significant man-caused impact Ukrainian surface water still possesses the self-purification ability.

The model simulated phytoplankton and nutrient concentrations in the lake from July to November. Most of the water quality parameters are found to be the same as for Lake Calhoun. To predict probable lake water quality deterioration from algal blooming due to increased nutrient influx from river inflow, the model was run for several inflow water conditions. Effects of inflow nutrient concentration, inflow volume, inflow water temperatures are presented separately. The effect of each factor is considered in isolation although in reality more than one factor can change simultaneously. From the results it is clear that inflow nutrient concentration, inflow volume and inflow water temperature show very regular and reasonable impacts on lake water quality.

The A Agricultural Nonpoint Source Pollution (AGNPS)-ARC INFO interface was used to extract input parameters from various Geographic Information System (GIS) layers, including a landcover layer prepared from Landsat TM image. for the AGNPS model during selected storm events. The curve numbers (CNs) were adjusted depending on the antecedent moisture condition (AMC) of the sub-watershed before each storm. The storm energy intensity (EI) values were computed using a probability method front a rainfall-EI relationship for the location of the study area. Several sensitive parameters of the AGNPS model were then calibrated to match the model-estimated total nitrogen (total-N) and total phosphorous (total-P) with the measured data on a sub-watershed basis during various runoff events. This process was validated by running the calibrated AGNPS model on each subwatershed of the Cheney Reservoir watershed. This integrated modeling process was found to be effective for smaller watersheds that had adequate rainfall data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

While numerous site-specific field studies have quantified the potential export of nutrients in agricultural runoff, it is clear that to meet the requirements of end-users, the research effort needs to shift towards developing generic models of diffuse source pollutant export from land that are based on expert knowledge but remains simple to use and easy to apply. Data-hungry process-based models, while elegant and all-encompassing, may not be suitable for the simple decision support frameworks required by end-users such as government agencies, water utilities and farmers.

In this paper, we present a neural net-based method for finding good approximations to solutions of this problem. This method is capable of 'inverting' a hydrological model to identify land use scenarios that match best the leaching criteria defined for establishing a certain water quality level in the stream. The method not only allows simulation land use scenarios like hydrologic models do, but can search systematically for land use scenarios that fulfill specified criteria without worrying about the complexity of combinatorial optimisation.

J	Sivertun, A; Prange, L				Sivertun, A; Prange, L			Non-point source critical area analysis in the Gisselo watershed using GIS	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd Conference of the Association-of-Geographic-Information-Laboratories (AGILE)	1999	ROME, ITALY	Assoc Geographic Info Lab Europe		GIS USLE; GIS based hydrology; river basin; non-point source pollution; validated transport model; enhanced spatial resolution; enhanced attribute		In the southeast in Noffkoping, Sweden, is a small fjord-like bay called Slatbaken. The water quality in Slatbaken-with its narrow outlet to the Baltic Sea-depends highly on the water quality of the streams that flow in it. While point pollution sources can be identified easily in general, the non-point sources are harder to find. The most important sources for non-point pollution are agricultural areas, and the pollutants are mostly nutrients like phosphorus, which come from the fertilisation of the fields. One important catchment area for Slatbaken is the 57.7 km(2) Gisselo river basin (part of the topographic map 8GNO), which contains large agricultural areas. The transport of water pollutants is based on the same hydrological processes as erosion and sediment transport. The implementation of such a model in a GIS allows the analysis of a large area with a high resolution. When choosing the model, special attention was paid to the possibility of using a verified model that is easy to implement in a commercial GIS without the need of too much expert knowledge. This may allow its widespread use in many administrative applications that need non-point source information. A feasibility test for an enhanced GIS USLE model was done in the Gisselo drainage basin before it was implemented for all river basins in the whole administrative area of Norrkopings kommun. It is possible to use the suggested simplified USLE model to estimate the load of both pollutants and sediments, and it is able to show the areas that are critical for the water quality at the outlet of the water basin. The model has been evaluated in three studies [Int. J. Geogr. Inf. Syst. 2 (4) (1988) 365; A GIS to target critical areas for non point source management, in: Proceedings of the International Non Point Source Management Symposium, Austin, TX, November 7, 1989; Vatten 48 (1992) 117]. Then, implemented in a very simple GIS that allowed only rough estimates of terrain models and distances, the model was able to estimate the total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP) loads in the Svarta river basin of 1539 km(2) in the same region as Gisselo and the Bornsjo river basin outside Stockholm. Besides an estimated R-2 of 0.91-0.98 (verified by a more than one year measurement from manual and automated sampling stations in the whole river basin), the benefit with the GIS implemented USLE was the possibility to identify the risk areas with high spatial accuracy. During the last decade, both available databases and software have changed the possibilities to identify areas at risk of nutrient leakage. Schein [GIS Methods for Monitoring Sustainable Development by Analysis of Land-use and Land Cover Changes in the Surroundings of Linkoping (Sweden), Institut fur Photogrammetrie und Fernerkundung, Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany] and Schein and Sivertun [Method and models for sustainable development monitoring and analyses in GIS, in: Proceedings of the International Workshop on Geo-Spatial Knowledge Processing for Natural Resource Management, University of Insubria, Varese, Italy, June 28-29, 2001] show that the enhanced land use data available through the European Union agricultural support program can be used together with remote sensing data to fine tune the modified GIS USLE model. The problems with the new 50 x 50 m digital elevation data now available are also pointed out here. Obvious errors in the data and possibilities to enhance the model by introducing a better terrain model were two important suggestions in these works. In this article, two modifications to the original model are suggested. One is enhancement of the digital terrain model by using height curves from the digital 1:50 000 scale topographic map, and the other is a smooth distance function that better reflects the impact of nutrients on water bodies. Because of its easy implementation on standard low cost systems, the GIS USLE model is suitable for analysing huge areas for critical places. The results can lead to more detailed studies in the risk areas thus identified or to investigations on the effect of land use changes, or can be used simply for taking care in the use of fertilisers and other chemicals in the critical agricultural areas.

Up to 20 inches of added rain fell between December 1997 and March 1998, triggering widespread and persistent phytoplankton blooms along the west coast of Florida. Water-column chlorophyll concentrations estimated from serial SeaWiFS imagery were much higher during the El Nino event than in the previous or following years, although the timing and magnitude of phytoplankton blooms varied among sites. Seagrass samples collected in 1997, 1998, and 1999 provided an excellent opportunity to test the responsiveness of Thalassia to decline and subsequent improvement of water quality and clarity in four estuaries. Using a scoring technique based on temporal responsiveness, spatial consistency, and statistical strength of indicators, we found that several morphological parameters (Thalassia shoot density, blade width, blade number, and shoot-specific leaf area) were responsive and consistent measures of light stress. Some morphological parameters, such as rhizome apex density, responded to declines and subsequent improvement in water clarity, but lacked the statistical discriminating power necessary to be useful indicators. However, rhizome sugar, starch, and total carbohydrate concentrations also exhibited spatially and temporally consistent variation as well as statistical strength. Because changes in shoot density, as well as water clarity, affect rhizome carbohydrate levels, a composite metric based on Thalassia shoot density and rhizome carbohydrate levels together is probably more useful than either parameter alone as an indicator of seagrass health.

Greenhouse and field lysimeter experiments were carried out to determine the effects of eight fertilizer sources on P and N leaching from simulated golf greens. Phosphorus appeared in the leachate later than nitrate-N, and the highest concentrations were for the soluble 20-20-20 and the 16-25-12 starter fertilizers. The other six sources resulted in lower P concentrations. The soluble 20-20-20 and the 16-25-12 sources each resulted in 43% of the added P eluting in the leachate, whereas the others varied from 15 to 25%. For nitrate-N the lowest cumulative mass was for the control led-release 13-13-13 and sulfur-coated urea. A higher percentage of applied P than applied N leached from both field and greenhouse lysimeters. However, the amounts of P leached for the field lysimeters were lower than for the greenhouse columns. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lin, YF; Jing, SR; Lee, DY				Lin, YF; Jing, SR; Lee, DY			The potential use of constructed wetlands in a recirculating aquaculture system for shrimp culture	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION			English	Article						constructed wetland; recirculating aquaculture system; Litopenaeus vannamei; pacific white shrimp; aquaculture wastewater	DAIRY FARM WASTEWATERS; WASTE-WATER; OXYGEN-DEMAND; LOADING RATE; REMOVAL; SOLIDS; RATES	A pilot-scale constructed wetland unit, consisting of free water surface (FWS) and subsurface flow (SF) constructed wetlands arranged in series, was integrated into an outdoor recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) for culturing Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). This study evaluated the performance of the wetland unit in treating the recirculating wastewater and examined the effect of improvement in water quality of the culture tank on the growth and survival of shrimp postlarvae. During an 80-day culture period, the wetland unit operated at a mean hydraulic loading rate of 0.3 m/day and effectively reduced the influent concentrations of 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5, 24%), suspended solids (SS, 71%), chlorophyll a (chl-a, 88%), total ammonium (TAN, 57%), nitrite nitrogen (NO2-N, 90%) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N, 68%). Phosphate (PO4-P) reduction was the least efficient (5.4%). The concentrations of SS, Chl-a, turbidity and NO3-N in the culture tank water in RAS were significantly (Pless than or equal to0.05) lower than those in a control aquaculture system (CAS) that simulated static pond culture without wetland treatment. However, no significant difference (Pless than or equal to0.05) in BOD5, TAN and NO2-N was found between the two systems. At the end of the study, the harvest results showed that shrimp weight and survival rate in the RAS (3.8 +/- 1.8 g/shrimp and 90%) significantly (Pless than or equal to0.01) exceeded those in the CAS (2.3 +/- 1.5 g/shrimp and 71%). This study concludes that constructed wetlands can improve the water quality and provide a good culture environment, consequently increasing the shrimp growth and survival without water exchange, in a recirculating system.

Specific focus was placed on results at the Huntington Forest (HFS), Pancake-Hall Creek (PHC), Woods Lake (WL), Ampersand (AMO), Catlin Lake (CLO) and Hennessy Mountain (HM). Nitrogen deposition generally decreased from west to east in the Adirondacks, and there have been no marked temporal changes in N deposition from 1978 through 1998. Second-growth western sites (WL, PHC) had higher soil solution NO3- concentrations and fluxes than the HFS site in the central Adirondacks. Of the two old-growth sites (AMO and CLO), AMO had substantially higher NO3- concentrations due to the relative dominance of sugar maple that produced litter with high N mineralization and nitrification rates. The importance of vegetation in affecting N losses was also shown for N-fixing alders in wetlands. The Adirondack Manipulation and Modeling Project (AMMP) included separate experimental N additions of (NH4)(2)SO4 at WL, PHC and HFS and HNO3 at WL and HFS. Patterns of N loss varied with site and form of N addition and most of the N input was retained. For 16 lake/watersheds no consistent changes in NO3- concentrations were found from 1982 to 1997. Simulations suggested that marked NO3- loss will only be manifested over extended periods. Studies at the Arbutus Watershed provided information on the role of biogeochemical and hydrological factors in affecting the spatial and temporal patterns of NO3- concentrations. The heterogeneous topography in the Adirondacks has generated diverse landscape features and patterns of connectivity that are especially important in regulating the temporal and spatial patterns of NO3- concentrations in surface waters.

Humans now strongly influence almost every major aquatic ecosystem, and their activities have dramatically altered the fluxes of growth-limiting nutrients from the landscape to receiving waters. Unfortunately, these nutrient inputs have had profound negative effects upon the quality of surface waters worldwide. This review examines how eutrophication influences the biomass and species composition of algae in both freshwater and costal marine systems. Main Features. An overview of recent advances in algae-related eutrophication research is presented. In freshwater systems, a summary is presented for lakes and reservoirs; streams and rivers; and wetlands. A brief summary is also presented for estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems. Results. Eutrophication causes predictable increases in the biomass of algae in lakes and reservoirs; streams and rivers; wetlands; and coastal marine ecosystems. As in lakes, the response of suspended algae in large rivers to changes in nutrient loading may be hysteretic in some cases. The inhibitory effects of high concentrations of inorganic suspended solids on algal growth, which can be very evident in many reservoirs receiving high inputs of suspended soils, also potentially may occur in turbid rivers. Consistent and predictable eutrophication-caused increases in cyanobacterial dominance of phytoplankton have been reported worldwide for natural lakes, and similar trends are reported here both for phytoplankton in turbid reservoirs, and for suspended algae in a large river. Conclusions. A remarkable unity is evident in the global response of algal biomass to nitrogen and phosphorus availability in lakes and reservoirs; wetlands; streams and rivers; and coastal marine waters. The species composition of algal communities inhabiting the water column appears to respond similarly to nutrient loading, whether in lakes, reservoirs, or rivers. As is true of freshwater ecosystems, the recent literature suggests that coastal marine ecosystems will respond positively to nutrient loading control efforts. Recommendations and Outlook. Our understanding of freshwater eutrophication and its effects on algal-related water quality is strong and is advancing rapidly. However, our understanding of the effects of eutrophication on estuarine and coastal marine ecosystems is much more limited, and this gap represents an important future research need. Although coastal systems can be hydrologically complex, the biomass of marine phytoplankton nonetheless appears to respond sensitively and predictably to changes in the external supplies of nitrogen and phosphorus. These responses suggest that efforts to manage nutrient inputs to the seas will result in significant improvements in coastal zone water quality. Additional new efforts should be made to develop models that quantitatively link ecosystem-level responses to nutrient loading in both freshwater and marine systems.

Such conclusions could be derived from the observed loads. But the measurements regarding the analysis were not sufficient to determine what the reasons for this report were, what has to be done to fulfil this agreement and to evaluate the time at which the targets can be reached [2]. This contribution presents the current state of Polish surface water quality as well as results of modelling nutrient and heavy metal emissions into the two biggest Polish river basins: Vistula and Odra, which both cover approximately 90% of Poland's territory.

J	Akkoyunlu, A				Akkoyunlu, A			Evaluation of eutrophication process in Lake Iznik	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN			English	Article						eutrophication; pollution; lake; nutrient; trophic state; model		Lakes are sometimes subjected to wastewater discharges originating from different sources. Chemicals like nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon in certain concentrations can distort and disrupt aquatic ecosystems by overfeeding. Eutrophication of inland bodies of water has become synonymous with the deterioration of water quality which interferes with most of its beneficial uses. Lake lznik which is located in the southern part of Marmara region of Turkey is the subject of this paper. The eutrophication process was evaluated in terms of limiting element, comparison of the nutrient point loading contribution and diffuse sources with the permissible loading, as well as the trophic status of the lake. Also with a scenario, lake Iznik was subjected to three different rates of nutrient P. loading to see its response. This study indicated that lake 1znik has not yet reached the eutrophic stage. The conditions show that it is between the mesotrophic and eutrophic levels. Additionally three different loading scenarios have shown that if measurements are taken by the local government in the watershed, the nutrient concentrations would drop down in the lake water.

Global climate change is likely to exacerbate these pressures through changes in the hydrological balance; influences on stratification, algal blooms and deep water re-oxygenation; and for high altitude sites such as lakes on the Mongolian Plateau, accelerated permafrost melting and desertification. Eutrophication and other processes of water quality degradation are especially severe in many parts of China. At Lake Taihu, a drinking water supply for 40 million people in central China, toxic cyanobacterial blooms now occur throughout the year. In the Province of Yunnan, many of the shallow lake waters are highly polluted and are of human health concern. Lake Biwa, Japan's largest freshwater body, has experienced many environmental problems over the last 50 years including loss of species habitat, changes in oxygen content, and blooms of noxious cyanobacteria. Two multi-disciplinary research programs involving specialists in hydrodynamics, bio-optics, biogeochemistry and freshwater ecology have generated new insights into the structure and functioning of the Lake Biwa ecosystem, and have contributed an improved understanding of the processes affecting water quality. The Biwako Transport Experiment (BITEX'93) provided new information about physical-biotic coupling in the lake, and revealed the stimulatory effects of typhoons on south basin populations of phytoplankton. Measurements of water currents also showed that toxic cyanobacteria can be transported via a reverse surface flow from the South to North Basins during typhoon events. A subsequent program, Cyanobacterial Risk Assessment at Biwako (CRAB), resulted in predictive bio-optical models and elucidated the importance of stratification and advection processes for cyanobacterial bloom development. The algal bloom populations are favored by diurnally stratified, nutrient-rich conditions inshore and are then advected via a gyre into the main basin of the lake where the cells can continue their growth on stored reserves. The successful management of Lake Biwa, and lakes elsewhere, will especially depend on an improved scientific understanding of the limnological controls on water quality.

Although ecological models cannot necessarily incorporate all significant processes, they should integrate the biomass and metabolic characteristics of the dominant primary producers, as well as the key secondary producers which directly graze upon them. In deep water systems, phytoplankton dominates the primary production, and zooplankton represents the secondary producer level. The biomass and metabolism of these two components are often described as a function of environmental variables based on the previous studies elsewhere. However, in shallow water lakes and even the inshore areas of deeper lakes, benthic organisms such as filter-feeding bivalves can play an important role as grazers on the phytoplankton. This type of local, site-specific effect is essential to incorporate within whole-lake models. This additional component may complicate the model, although can sometimes lead to useful simplifications. The development of models for specific sites requires a clear formulation of the objectives, and the acquisition of appropriate, site-specific data. Field observations are therefore essential to guide the modeling effort, to identify critical, site-specific mechanisms and to obtain realistic estimates of the input parameters for the model.

A major research topic of the programme PIREN-Seine consists in developing a software for the basin-scale modelling of the transport of nitrogen from soil to surface water, accounting for its retardation due to the residence time in soil and aquifer systems, which can be very long. Prior to software development, an original, work of data processing has been performed at INRA, in space and time, concerning pedological characteristics, land use and agricultural practices, in order to determine the spatial units to be included into the model. These data are input data for the STICS software (INRA) which simulates the functioning of the soil-water-vegetation system at a daily time-step, taking into account the growth of the crops and the nitrogen and water balances. A procedure for the spatialisation of STICS at the basin scale has been developed to compute the water and nitrate fluxes at the bottom of the root zone. These fluxes are integrated into the surface and groundwater coupled model MODCOU (ENSMP), which calculates, at a daily time-step, the water balance in the hydrological system, the flow in the rivers and the piezometric variations in the aquifers, as a function of climatic data (rainfall, PET). Then, the transport of nitrates and the resulting evolution of nitric contamination in groundwater and rivers is computed owing to the compatible software NEWSAM (ENSMP). Nitrogen fluxes reaching the rivers can be used by the SENEQUE software, which simulates the water quality and the ecological functioning in the hydrographical network. In a close future, this research will be used to simulate the response of nitric contamination to various scenarios, accounting for the modification of agricultural practices or anthropogenic climate change.

Issues concerning the integrated application of the United Kingdom national databases for river flows and water quality for calculating river mass loads are discussed. The paper focuses on the range and nature of error sources in river mass load estimates and warns against assigning unrealistically high precision to river loads estimated from the national datasets. Annual mass loads from the freshwater monitored area of Great Britain, 1974 to 1994, are presented for suspended solids, "total" nitrogen (NO3-N + NO2-N + NH4-N) and zinc (dissolved and suspended).

The impacts of varying patterns and intensities of fire and logging are being evaluated for 16 streams in the Swan Hills, Alberta, with the intention to extend the approach to the eastern portion of the Boreal Plain and into the Boreal Shield. The study uses two comparative approaches: treatment versus reference stream and before versus after disturbance. Models generated will be applied to designated multi-user watersheds in selected forest areas. In addition to yielding transferable technology for forest product industries, the FORWARD study tests hypotheses related to effects of watershed disturbance on soils, hydrology, and water quality on the phosphorus-rich and fire-prone Boreal Forest in western Canada.

J	Jiang, JG; Shen, YF				Jiang, JG; Shen, YF			Application and validation of a new biotic index using data from several water systems	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING			English	Article							QUALITY; PHOSPHORUS; DIVERSITY; NITROGEN; SHALLOW	Protozoans of Lake Donghu were collected from five stations using the PFU method. The sampling was conducted for one year and two times a month. The aim of this research was to test the applicability of a new protozoa biotic index, species pollution value (SPV) and community pollution value (CPV), established by the authors using data from the River Hanjiang. Each station's CPV was calculated from the SPV and the correlation analysis between the CPV and the comprehensive chemical index of stations I, II, III showed a significant correlation between them. The pollution status of the five stations was correctly evaluated by the CPV. These results suggested that the biotic index could be applied in water systems other than the River Hanjiang. The SPV of some protozoa species in Lake Donghu, not observed in the River Hanjiang were established. In order to further test the applicability of the biotic index, protozoan and chemistry data from the Rivers Torrente Stirone and Parma of Italy were used. The results showed that the CPV for the two rivers had a close relationship with the chemical water quality, which indicated that the biotic index could be applied in other parts of the world for the monitoring and estimating of water quality. Since the results of testing and verifying the biotic index in some other water systems in China were also satisfactory, this indicated that the biotic index has an extensive suitability for freshwater ecosystems. As long as more than 50% of the species in a sample have a SPV, the CPV calculated from the SPV is reliable for monitoring and evaluating water quality.

J	Andraski, TW; Bundy, LG				Andraski, TW; Bundy, LG			Relationships between phosphorus levels in soil and in runoff from corn production systems	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							SURFACE RUNOFF; BIOAVAILABLE PHOSPHORUS; AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF; RAINFALL SIMULATOR; MANURE APPLICATION; WATER-QUALITY; LOSSES; TILLAGE; EUTROPHICATION; MANAGEMENT	Phosphorus-enriched runoff from cropland can hasten eutrophication of surface waters. A soil P level exceeding crop needs due to long-term fertilizer and/or manure applications is one of several potential sources of increased P losses in runoff from agricultural systems. Field experiments were conducted at locations representative of three major soil regions in Wisconsin in corn (Zea mays L.) production systems to determine the effect of tillage, recent manure additions, soil P extraction method, and soil sampling depth (0-2, 0-5, and 0-15 cm) on the relationship between soil test P level and P concentrations in runoff. Runoff from simulated rainfall (75 mm h(-1)) was collected from 0.83-m(2) areas for 1 h after rainfall initiation and analyzed for dissolved phosphorus (DP), total phosphorus (TP), and sediment. The DP fraction of the TP concentration in runoff ranged from 5 to 17% among sites with most of the variation in TP due to varying sediment concentration on the well-drained silt loam soils and to soil test P level on the poorly drained silty clay loam soil. In 213 observations across a range of soils and managements, good relationships occurred between soil test P level and DP concentration in runoff for most of the tests and sampling depths used. Recent manure additions and high levels of surface cover from corn residue sometimes masked this relationship. The slope of DP relative to soil test P level was markedly higher on the silty clay loam soil than on the silt loam soils possibly due to soil permeability-infiltration rate differences. Agronomic soil P tests were as effective as environmentally oriented soil P tests for predicting DP concentrations in runoff.

The model predicted that both ponds will recover adequately given the average expected range of nutrient and BOD loading due to waste from surface runoff and migratory birds. The predicted dissolved oxygen levels in both ponds were greater than 5.0 mg/L, and were supported by DO levels in the field which were typically above 5.0 mg/L during the period of this study. The model predicted a steady-state NBOD concentration of 12.0-14.0 mg/L in the East Pond, compared to an average measured value of 3.73 mg/L in 1994 and an average measured value of 12.51 mg/L in a 1996-97 study. The model predicted that the NBOD concentration in the West Pond would be under 3.0 mg/L compared to the average measured values of 7.50 mg/L in 1997, and 8.51 mg/L in 1994. The model predicted that phosphorus ( pO(4)(3-)) as 4 concentration in the East Pond will approach 4.2 mg/L in 4 months, compared to measured average value of 2.01 mg/L in a 1994 study. The model predicted that phosphorus concentration in the West Pond will approach pO(4)(3-)) 1.00 mg/L, compared to a measured average phosphorus (as 4 concentration of 1.57 mg/L in a 1994 study.

The river basins ranged in size from 113 to 12,110 km(2), but maximum elevations above lake level were similar in all the catchments yielding quite different mean basin slopes. Flow was seasonally variable with low or no flow at the end of the prolonged dry season. Annual runoff varied from 37 to 617 mm with most rivers having below average discharges in 1997. The river basins were all affected to varying degrees by subsistence farming which is the dominant land use in Malawi. Sediment and nutrient (C, N, P, Si) concentrations, loads, and yields were sensitive to the degree of agricultural land use in the basins. Lowest sediment concentrations, loads, and yields were characteristic of the small, steep catchments with a high proportion of intact forest. Highest concentrations, loads, and yields of sediments were from densely settled catchments with extensive agricultural activity. Concentrations, loads, and yields of nutrients tended to follow the particulate fluxes as dissolved components were less responsive to basin disturbance. Increasing populations and associated agricultural development may already have increased nutrient loading to Lake Malawi by 50% as forests have been increasingly cleared for agriculture.

J	Lindenschmidt, KE; Ollesch, G; Kerzhentsev, AS; Hecky, RE				Lindenschmidt, KE; Ollesch, G; Kerzhentsev, AS; Hecky, RE			A comparative study of substance transport behavior in two Ugandan and one Russian catchment areas	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						integrated management; phosphorus dynamics; river catchment; Russia; Uganda	SOIL	Owing to the marginal success in abating pollution sources in water systems, integrated catchment management plans are being increasingly implemented in hopes of improving water quality. Transferring data and concepts between subbasins in the catchment is often used to fill knowledge and data gaps. Conducted here is a comparative study of three catchment areas of similar size, two neighboring stream basins in Uganda and one in central Russia, to investigate important prerequisites for transferability of data between basins. Compared were ions (Ca, Cl, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na), nutrients (NH4-N, NO3-N, dissolved and particulate P, SO4), discharge, suspended sediment, pH, and alkalinity with attention given also to the climatic, soil, and land-use characteristics of each catchment. Significant statistical differences were found in the parameters, even of the adjacent lying catchment areas in Uganda. The substance regime in the Russian stream is dominated by the snowmelt events whereas that in Uganda by the rainy season pattern. The phosphorus dynamics were markedly different between the two adjacent catchments in Uganda. Although the climates and the chemical composition of the soils of the two basins are quite similar, slight shifts in land-use distribution can alter the processes dominating in the transport of phosphorus. This is indicative of the sensitivity that parameters of individual basin characteristics (even small neighboring basins) can have on the outcome of the substance regimes and fluxes. These sensitivities highlight the precision required in defining the processes to make transferability of data and models across subbasins in a catchment management system as successful as possible. Keeping such systems flexible and modular (object-oriented approach) can alleviate these difficulties.

The lakes span three different ecoregions, as well as the Twin Cities metropolitan area, and differ in their history of settlement and land use, and in surficial geology, climate, and vegetation. Lakes in the Northern Lakes and Forest ecoregion are nearly pristine, whereas those in the other regions likely are strongly affected by urban or agricultural pollutants. Reconstructions of water-chemistry trends since 1970 suggest that recent human activities have had substantial impacts in both urban and rural areas. Chloride concentrations have increased in many Metro lakes, which may be due to road salts, and phosphorus levels have been steady or rising in agricultural regions. The majority of Metro lakes show some decline in TP, although many of the changes are not statistically significant based on our reconstruction techniques. There is no evidence that atmospheric deposition of sulfate or nitrate has caused acidification or changes in trophic state for remote lakes in the northeastern part of the state.

Macroinvertebrate survey data from the National River Health Program were used to set grade numbers between 1 and 10 to represent the water-quality sensitivities of 210 taxa. Grades were assigned at the taxonomic levels customarily used by government agencies (predominantly family level) and by community groups (mainly order). A new index version using these grades, SIGNAL2, was correlated with water temperature, turbidity, electrical conductivity, alkalinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen and total phosphorus. Because of natural spatial variation in water quality, index scores need to be interpreted in a local context or against site-specific predictions generated by the Australian River Assessment System (AUSRIVAS).

Data from these studies revealed considerable spatial and temporal variability. Concentrations of C, N, and P in the dwarf wetland showed seasonal trends, while water source was better at explaining concentrations in the fringe wetland. The total and dissolved organic carbon (TOC and DOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) content of both wetlands was higher during the wet season or when water was flowing to the south (Everglades source). Concentrations of nitrate plus nitrite (NOx-), ammonium (NH4+), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) in the fringe wetland were all highest during the dry season or northerly flow (bay source). Nutrient concentrations most effectively explained patterns of flux in both wetlands. Increased wetland uptake of a given constituent was usually a function of its availability in the Water column. However, the release of NOx- from the dwarf wetland was related to the NH4+ concentration, suggesting a nitrification signal. Nitrogen flux in the dwarf wetland was also related to surface water salinity and temperature. Our findings indicate that freshwater Everglades marshes are an important source of dissolved organic matter to these wetlands, while Florida Bay may be a source of dissolved inorganic nutrients. Our data also suggest that temperature, salinity, and nutrient concentrations (as driven by season and water source) influence patterns of materials flux in this mangrove wetland. Applying long-term water quality data to the relationships we extracted from these flux data, we estimated that TN and TP were imported by the dwarf wetland 87 +/- 10 and 48 +/- 17% of the year, respectively. With Everglades restoration, modifications in freshwater delivery may have considerable effects on the exchanges of nutrients and organic matter in these transitional mangrove wetlands.

J	Lee, JHW; Choi, KW; Arega, F				Lee, JHW; Choi, KW; Arega, F			Environmental management of marine fish culture in Hong Kong	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Environmental Management of Enclosed Coastal Seas	NOV 19, 2001	KOBE, JAPAN			mariculture; coastal inlets; eutrophication; hydrodynamics; carrying capacity; flushing time; water quality model; oxygen depletion; organic pollution; fish farm		Marine fish farming is an important commercial practice in Hong Kong. Marine fish farms located in eutrophic coastal waters often face the threat of severe dissolved oxygen depletion associated with algal blooms and red tides. On the other hand, mariculture activities also contribute to pollution. The sustainable management of mariculture requires proper siting of the fish farms and stocking density control. Both of these are related to the carrying capacity of the water body concerned, which is mainly governed by its flushing characteristics. A simple method to determine the carrying capacity of a fish farm has been developed by using three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic modelling and its effective coupling with a diagenetic water quality model. A systematic methodology using numerical tracer experiments has been developed to compute the tidal flushing in a fish farm. The flushing time is determined from the results of a numerical tracer experiment using robust 3D hydrodynamic and mass transport models. A unit tracer concentration is initially prescribed inside the region of interest and zero elsewhere; the subsequent mass transport and the mass removal process are then tracked. The fish farms are usually situated in well-sheltered shallow embayments and may not connect directly to the open water. It is found that it is necessary to define both "local" and "system-wide" flushing times to represent the effectiveness of the mass exchange with the surrounding water body and the open sea respectively. A diagenetic water quality model simulating the sediment-water-pollutant interaction is employed to address the response of the water column and the benthic layer to pollution discharges. With the flushing rate reliably computed, the carrying capacity of the fish farm can be determined in terms of key water quality parameters: chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, organic nitrogen and potential lowest dissolved oxygen level on a day of negligible photosynthetic production. The predictions are well-supported by field data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

To ensure the long-term use it is necessary to treat the influents or the water used for ground water charging. The current treatment process for phosphorus and turbidity removal is a combination of precipitation/coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation and sand filtration. By using this conventional method it is possible to reduce the dissolved ortho-phosphate and the turbidity (particulate phosphorus) as well as the amounts of algae and pathogenic organisms to very low concentrations. The high degree of reduction in this process is only achieved by a relatively high dosage of coagulants and flocculants. Such a process has been used for nearly 20 years by the Berliner Wasserbetriebe. In this study a comparison will be made between this process, which represents the state-of-the-art, and the combination of precipitation/coagulation with dead-end membrane filtration (micro-/ultrafiltration) concerning water quality and costs. The results show that it is possible to reach similar levels of phosphorus removal as with floc filtration. However, floc filtration requires significantly higher amounts of chemicals (coagulants and flocculants). No flocculants are used for membrane filtration. But the estimated costs for the membrane based process are at 0.17 Euro/m(3) probably a little more expensive. However, the excellent permeate quality is much better at the values of suspended solids and micro-biological organisms.

The authority has suggested that sediment and phosphorus levels should be halved and nitrogen be reduced by a third by 2011. Under the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality initiative, Regional Strategy Groups need to establish targets to meet salinity and water quality objectives from priority catchments. The Fitzroy catchment is a one such priority catchment and it is estimated that 2.6 million tonnes of sediment on average is discharged annually from the basin into the GBR World Heritage Area. For targets to be met, they need to be translated to upstream catchments and associated properties where decisions on land management practices occur. However, there is little evidence to suggest that measurement and modelling conducted at a large basin scale can inform changes that need to be made in agricultural practices at farm scales to reach agreed targets. Two 'Focus Neighbourhood Catchments', Gordonstone and Spottswood Creek; have been instrumented to measure the impacts of land management practices on sediment and water quality in two key landscapes (Basalt Downs, Dawson River Downs) within the Fitzroy Basin. Preliminary data from the Gordonstone Creek Focus NC (predominately cropping) and a long-term erosion study were used to model a range of management scenarios using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool. Modelling scenarios show that improved cropping practices can reduce sediment loads within streams, but alone are insufficient to reduce loads to half of current levels. Community Neighbourhood Catchments established within similar biogeographical regions by the Fitzroy Basin Association are used to create ownership in Neighbourhood Catchment land management and water quality targets.

The water exchange estimate is a step in the process of developing a model capable of simulating management strategies for wetlands of the Lower River Murray and their effect on nutrient load in the river. An expanded wetland process model was used to find the water exchange between wetlands, where there is a lack of channel morphology data and no measured wetland water turnover. This paper describes the development of the wetland ecosystem model WETMOD to include spatial driving variables of the floodplain landscape. The added spatial driving variables for WETMOD are used to account for local variations and inflow into a wetland, particularly to reflect bi-directional water and nutrient exchange between the River Murray and the wetlands. The spatial driving variables are derived from a database containing site-specific flow and nutrient data from the river and wetlands. In order to simulate the water exchange between individual wetlands and the River Murray an ad hoc flux estimation technique was developed. This was based on a combination of the river flow volume and the wetland specific budget of phosphorus (PO4-P) Simulated by WETMOD. We demonstrate that it is possible to obtain the turnover volume of water in a wetland using nutrient modelling output.

Subsurface drainage systems are the main pathways of diffuse nitrogen input into rivers, apart from the groundwater fluxes. The abbreviated outflow via subsurface drainage systems and the lack of the denitrification of nitrogen in drained soils contribute to the high load of nitrogen in drainage water. The pathway via subsurface drainage systems is being investigated for the central Mulde river catchment (area 2700 km(2)) in Saxony/Germany. Variables used for this estimation are the area of drained arable land, the seepage water rate and the nitrogen concentration of the drainage water. The rate of drained arable land is about 25.2% of the total area differentiated in grasslands (19.0%) and fields (27.4%). This shows a strong correlation for drained arable land and soil forms in the catchment area. The seepage water rate is calculated as an average of 208 mm/a. The average nitrogen discharge via subsurface drainage water is 33 kg/ha(-1) a(-1) for the 1980s and 10 kg/ha(-1)a(-1) for the 1990s. The variation of nitrogen discharge differs from that of arable land with 34 kg/ha(-1)a(-1) for the 1980s (14 kg/ha(-1)a(-1) for the 1990s) in regions with sandy soils and 26 (9) kg/ha(-1)a(-1) in loess lessive soils. The reduction can be explained by the complete change of farming structures in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR).

J	Pers, BC; Persson, I				Pers, BC; Persson, I			Simulation of a biogeochemical model in different lakes	NORDIC HYDROLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Nordic Hydrological Conference	AUG 04-07, 2002	ROROS, NORWAY				WATER-QUALITY; PHYTOPLANKTON	Eutrophication, caused by nutrients leached from soil and emitted from point sources, is a well-known problem in many Swedish lakes. There are several countermeasures that can be used to reduce eutrophication. A model that can simulate the biogeochemical response to different management scenarios may help with nutrient reducing strategies. Results from applications with such a model to different types of lakes are presented in this paper. The most important variables simulated by the model are dissolved nutrient concentrations (nitrogen and phosphorus) and phytoplankton. Other variables include nitrogen fixating cyanobacteria, sediments, and zooplankton. In total, 14 state variables are simulated. Nutrients are supplied through tributaries, and the temperature and vertical mixing forced by meteorological input. The model is able to simulate effects of changing nutrients and plankton dynamics. It is promising as an instrument for evaluating various measures to improve water quality in lakes. However, for the lakes the model has been applied to, the model has been calibrated to available observations. Non-monitored lakes could also be interesting to simulate, therefore the parameters of the model set-ups are discussed in this paper.

Therefore, samples of well, tap, and spring waters were collected from BEN and non-BEN areas in the Vratza region of Bulgaria. In the field, samples were 1) collected using clean techniques; 2) analyzed for alkalinity, pH, temperature, conductivity, redox, and nitrogen species; and 3) split into subsamples, filtered and preserved for further analyses. In the laboratory, major anions and nutrients were determined by ion chromatography and major, minor, and trace elements determined by either atomic absorption or HEX-ICP-MS. Graphical (e.g., x-y plots, Piper plots) and geochemical (thermodynamic models using PHREEQC) and general statistical techniques (e.g. Student t) were used to study the data. Selected results include: 1) the water for the region is a calcium-bicarbonate water, 2) most chemicals in both types of locations were not above recommended drinking water standards; 3) arsenic concentrations were typically higher in BEN samples than non-BEN samples; 4) uranium concentrations were above WHO suggested limits in many well and spring water samples, whether from a BEN or non-BEN village; 5) nitrate levels were very high in well water from both BEN and non-Ben villages, were higher in springs from BEN villages than non-BEN villages, and may indicate possible pathways for contaminants to enter the groundwater system; and 6) CI:Na ratios along with NO3 levels indicate possible human influences on the water supply The results show biogeochemical differences between BEN and non-BEN villages. However, these differences are not fully understood and therefore cannot be related to the cause or distribution of BEN at this time. This ambiguity is in part related to a lack of data on groundwater biogeochemistry and the hydrogeology of the area. More work needs to be done on water quality in the Balkans to address not only historical heath issues (e.g., BEN), but also new and immerging environmental and environmental health issues.

Results are compared to environmental targets and investment costs. The maximum achievable level of environmental investment would fail to meet a 0.1 mg/l P orthophosphate target in rivers with high upstream urban density and low baseflow. In contrast, significant benefits can be achieved in other parts of the catchment with lower population density and high baseflow. Targeted investment in P removal would be beneficial in maximising environmental gains.

Therefore, monitoring seagrass health is crucial for the existence of many marine aquatic plants and animals. The minimal light requirement of seagrasses is about 20-30% of the total light measured just below the surface. This is relatively high compared to terrestrial plants and phytoplankton, which underlines the importance of water transparency for these species. Hence, light penetration into estuarine waters is critical for seagrass survival. In this paper, an approach to estimate the light attenuation coefficient from water quality parameters using neural networks is proposed. The model is compared with linear regression models such as step-wise linear regression and linear least squares regression. The light attenuation model presented here can be used for monitoring water quality and thereby seagrass health.

The algorithm has previously been applied to CASI data from Lake Malaren and the result was promising, but the model needed further validation on data from other lakes in order to investigate its generality. CASI data was also collected over the nearby Lake Erken and in this paper the same algorithm was applied to that data set and evaluated using ground truth measurements. The estimated chlorophyll concentrations were in average twice as high as the ground truth measurements. The CASI spectra were therefore compared to the reflectance spectra measured at lake level at all sampling stations in Erken during the campaign, and the correspondence was good. The overestimation of chlorophyll by the model derived algorithm can be explained by the fact that ground truth samples were taken below the surface, while the CASI measurements reflect the state on the surface, where accumulations were evident in the whole lake.

Rice is the staple food of Asians. Are there sufficient water resources for cultivating crops? Will the water quality remain suitable for cultivating crops? To obtain basic data for these questions, we analyzed the land-use/land-cover in Asia and constructed nitrogen load maps. Rice is mainly cultivated from East to South Asia. We used 0.5degrees grid data to estimate the nitrogen load in these regions. These data include those on the course of a river, land-use/land-cover classification, population, climate, nitrous oxide (NOX) emission, and country boundary. We also used statistical data on fertilizer consumption, food production, food consumption and food trade. In East Asia, the area of grassland is larger than that of woodland due to a low precipitation. The area of cropland is almost the same as that of grassland. In Southeast Asia, woodland predominates grassland due to a high precipitation. The next predominant land-use is cropland. In South Asia, cropland is predominant for feeding the large population. There is no more space for extending the cropland area. The nitrogen load changes seasonally according to cropping systems used and precipitation. The rate of denitrification is similar to the nitrogen load and the water quality is good at present. In the future, the water quality would deteriorate due to an increase in the nitrogen level discharged from humans, fertilizer consumption and NOX emission.

WAM was set up and calibrated/validated for simulating both existing conditions and future watershed restoration strategies. WAM was used to simulate daily flows and constituents of interest, such as, nitrogen, phosphorus, total suspended solids, and BOD, for every watershed and each stream reach within the watersheds, as well as providing detailed spatial GIS maps of source loads throughout the watersheds. Florida watersheds for which WAM has been used include: Lower St. Johns River, Myakka River, North Lake Okeechobee, Suwannee River, Aucillia River, and Caloosahatchee River. The results of the WAM modeling program for TMDL development and other watershed restoration programs in Florida, as well as recent enhancements to the model, are described. The comparisons of measured and simulated values indicate that WAM has been reliably applied to new watersheds with little or no calibration. WAM's demonstrated ability to simulate the impacts of land use and management changes makes it a powerful tool in assisting planners and decision makers in the development of strategies to improve water quality.

The watershed consists of grazed or hayed pastures (89%) fertilized with poultry litter and commercial nitrogen and some wooded areas (11%). The cattle roam freely through the pastures year-round and we estimated that 25% of the pastures have direct access to the stream. Potential sources of bacterial contamination were determined through DNA source tracking technologies. The technology was used to quantify the bacteria contribution from poultry fitter spread on pastures, grazing cattle, wildlife, failing septic systems, and direct inputs such as cattle standing in the streams or pipes discharging wastewater into the streams. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool was used to simulate the flows in Shoal Creek as well as the fate and transport of nutrients in the watershed. The model was calibrated and validated using 3 years of daily flow data and 18 months of weekly nutrient data. The new bacteria equations in SWAT were then tested on this watershed. They include decay processes of bacteria in the streams as well as on the land and in the sod. The decay rates in soil water, in the soil, and in stream water are allowed to vary with water and air temperature. These equations were tested with 18 months of weekly fecal E. coli concentrations collected from grab samples. The model was used to develop and simulate alternative management practices that comply with the water quality criteria required for recreational uses of this strewn.

Water quality monitoring programs often form the basis from which related legislation is derived. Currently, a protocol or method is not available for selecting a sampling strategy when initiating a monitoring programs An analytical approach for selecting a sampling strategy was conceived and developed based on dimensionless unit hydrograph technology and documented correlation of measured pollutant concentrations to the hydrograph. Time-based sampling was most sensitive to those parameters used to derive the hydrograph time to peak with a primary sensitivity to curve number Similarly, flow-proportional sampling was most sensitive to those parameters used to obtain peak flow with a primary sensitivity to 10 yr 1 hr precipitation. Optimal mean predicted time and volumetric How depth increased with an increase in acceptable error while the mean predicted number of samples required to obtain a specified error decreased with an increase in error. Trends of these basic statistics suggest that the methodology is valid, however, statistical significance of the methodology could not be evaluated due to the absence of, and difficulty in obtaining, measured field data. The outcome of the method is the selection of a sampling strategy based on expected error and sampler constraints. Use of this method should facilitate the selection of water quality sampling strategies for field and watershed scale studies and enhance the findings from a sampling strategy by providing more confidence in the load estimates.

One control action considered for 2 TMDLs for segments of the N. Bosque River in 2001 was implementation of P controls at 6 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) designed to meet ending effluent standards of 1 mg/L total P P controls are a particular concern for small communities, where unit removal costs are typically much higher than for larger WWTPs. P removal was estimated to cost $5.19/person/yr for the largest community (population 15,000), while it ranged from $16/person/yr to $152/person/yr for the smaller communities (populations ranging from 360 to 3,500). Cost per unit P removal is also considerably lower at the Stephenville WWTP ($31/kg) versus the smaller plants, whose costs ranged from $101/kg to $729/kg P removed. High unit costs for the small WWTPs is due mainly to high capital costs in relation to their small size. The great disparity in unit costs suggests that P control obligations (or credits) could be traded among the six N. Bosque WWTPs to mutual advantage. The most optimal trading scenario would have the control obligations of the three smallest WWTPs transferred to the Stephenville plant thereby allowing the small WWTPs to operate without P control. This trading scenario results in estimated savings of $188,000 annually for the four trading WWTPs.

Initiatives focused on improving water quality have been implemented in several Maquoketa subwatersheds including the Mineral Creek Watershed (MCW), which covers over 12,000 ha in the west central portion of the Maquoketa River Watershed. A key component of the MCW water quality initiative was the application of an environmental and economic modeling system for over 20 different scenarios that include implementation of contouring, terracing, notill, and other practices on part or all of the MCW cropped acreage. Reductions in sediment, total N losses, and total P losses for 15 scenarios reported here were predicted to range from essentially zero to 52%, 0.3 to 26%, and 5 to 63%, respectively, relative to the baseline conditions. Aggregate impacts on producer net returns predicted across the entire watershed for the 15 scenarios as compared to the baseline ranged from an increase of $14/acre to a decline of $19/acre.

Major sources of pollution were poultry litter applications and sediment erosion. The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of implementation of WQMPs on nonpoint source pollution through a modeling approach. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to quantify the impacts of implementing WQMPs on sediment and nutrients. A pre-BMP scenario representing conditions of the watershed prior to the implementation of WQMPs, and a post-BMP scenario representing the conditions of the watershed after implementation of WQMPs were simulated to estimate the reductions in nonpoint source pollution due to WQMP implementation. Results are presented as percentage reductions in sediment and nutrient loadings. Estimated reductions were about 1% for sediment, about 2% for nitrogen and about 8 to 9% for phosphorus loadings at three locations along the Big Cypress Creek. Higher reductions in phosphorus at watershed level were due to poultry manure management. This study showed that a modeling approach could be used to evaluate the impacts of water quality management programs in large watersheds.

This paper describes a series of models developed for poorly drained watersheds. The models use DRAINMOD to predict hydrology at the field scale and a range of methods to predict channel hydraulics and nitrogen transport. In-stream changes of N load are estimated with a lumped parameter exponential decay function. The models were tested using data from a 10,000 ha eastern NC watershed. The models can be used in TMDL development and implementation procedures to target application of field scale management practices to maximize reduction in nitrogen load at the watershed scale.

This study was conducted to determine whether differences exist in subsurface runoff water quantity and quality between two cropping systems. The study examined the effect of conventional versus organic farming practices on nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment loss from glacial fill soils in southwest Minnesota. The conventional systems consisted mainly of row crops corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine mar L.), while the organic system contained corn, soybean, oat (Avena saliva L.), alfalfa (Medicago saliva L), and other perennial species. Subsurface drainage flow and nitrate-nitrogen, ammonium-nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment concentrations were collected from both cropping systems. The Agricultural Drainage and Pesticide Transport (ADAPT) model that incorporates weather, crop, soil, and drainage system input parameters was used to predict nutrient transport from these field-wale cropping systems. Model simulations from the different management systems were used to predict nutrient loadings from subsurface drainage to surface waters, Information from this project has potential implications on the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) process in the development of alternative management strategies for mitigating the effects of agricultural nonpoint source pollution. Data on cropping system history and water quality data from 2002 will be presented.

The export and import of manure P or N with sod and soil-test P concentration in sod were related to P loading and runoff water quality. Up to 274 kg ha(-1) of soil P and 72% of applied manure P were removed in a single sod harvest from a dairy waste application site. Total dissolved P (TDP) losses in runoff after import of manure-grown sod on an 8.5% slope were directly related to soil-test P of sod. Variation of soil-test P in samples of imported sod extracted in water, 10 mM CaCl2, and Olsen, Mehlich R and acidified ammonium acetate-EDTA solutions accounted for greater than or equal to 77% of variation of TDP concentration in runoff of simulated rain.

The second, Spavinaw Lake, is used as a water source by the City of Tulsa. Taste and odor problems made the water very expensive or impossible to treat in recent years. The source of these problems is thought to be algal blooms due to elevated nutrient concentrations in Lake Eucha. In a previous modeling study of the basin, we supported claims that the application of poultry manure was responsible for increased phosphorus load to Lake Eucha- We prepared a new model including more water quality and flow data, recent land cover data derived from Landsat TM+ imagery, high resolution (Next generation weather radar) NEXRAD precipitation data, and soil test phosphorus for both pastures and row crops. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) 2000 model was calibrated for flow at three gages and for phosphorus loads at eight locations. Phosphorus loads were estimated using the US Geologic Survey (USGS) program LOADEST2 using observed water quality measurements, and streamflow estimates provided by both the City of Tulsa and the USGS. The SWAT model predicts that the application of poultry litter and elevated soil test phosphorus in the basin is responsible for 49% of the current annual phosphorus load to the lakes.

The parameters studied include population, flow, type of treatment, biochemical oxygen demand, suspended solids, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus. This paper details a methodology for estimating historic loadings where data are lacking. The data show dramatic changes in wastewater loadings. There has been a continued increase in wastewater flow and population over the past century but a decrease in contaminant loading during the last 25 years. The reduction in effluent loads is directly related to state and federal water quality management programs and the substantial public and private investment made in upgrading point source water pollution control infrastructure. A comparison of point with nonpoint source loads shows that although nonpoint sources are now a significant contributor of contaminants to the river, point sources remain as major sources of total nitrogen and total phosphorus.

The simulation covered from April 1993 to March 1996. The daily change regimes of the observed sea-surface winds, tidal elevation at the open boundary, river discharges and meteorological parameters were incorporated into the forcing variables of the modelled estuary. Simulated distributions of temperature and salinity were compared favorably with the field measurements both in time and space, suggesting good reproducibility of the flow field by the hydrodynamic model. The numerical results were compared favorably with the field measurements of water quality indicating the validity and predictive capability of the model, and thus served for a detailed analysis of nutrient and oxygen cycles in the estuary. It turned out from the nutrient flux analysis that primary productivity varied considerably over the three years in relation to water temperature and that the most limiting nutrient to phytoplankton growth was nitrogen. The oxygen field in the bottom layer, on the contrary, did not show any clear year-to-year variation in that the oxygen-depleted water mass regularly appeared in the middle-upper basin from late June, developed to cover the whole middle-upper basin in midsummer, and dissipated by about mid-November.

The soils in the region are mainly crushed limestone with low water holding capacity, high permeability, low organic matter, and low fertility. The Everglades-Agro-Hydrology Model (EAHM) has been developed to evaluate the impact of agricultural practices on crop production, water balance and the fate and transport of nutrients and pesticides. Considering the poor soil quality, the model simulation test indicated that the application of 90 to 134 T.ha(-1) of compost annually will result in an increase in soil-water content, crop yield, and reduced water seepage below the root zone, thus reducing the potential for nitrogen and Atrazine to leach into groundwater.

The first phase is to eliminate salts and then, to distil a lot of compounds or fractions. The second phase includes three kinds of processes: to combine, to separate and to structure. Even if the petroleum refineries apply currently water treatments to eliminate the pollutant substances before the river dumping, in some countries, like Mexico, there are cities or towns near the petroleum refining installations and it is very important to develop monitoring programs to avoid human health problems related to industrial pollution. The Tula River is an important closed basin that flows to The Endho Dam and to several aqueducts. The aim of this paper was to establish pollutant emission factors from the refining industry to estimate the influence of the Miguel Hidalgo Refinery in the water quality of this river. Two sampling campaigns were carried out in the dry and the wet seasons, considering the industrial effluent after the treatment and in ten sampling stations in The Tula River. The levels of the main environmental parameters at this aquatic ecosystem, like pH, temperature, suspended matter, flow, grease and oil, total nitrogen, settled solids, suspended solids, Biochemical Oxygen Demand, fecal coliform bacteria, cyanide, arsenic, mercury, cadmium, copper, chromium, nickel, lead, zinc, phosphorus, contemplated by the Mexican legislation, were compared to the levels found in the effluent. According to the sampling results, the main kinds of wastewater treatments were analyzed and a numerical efficiency analysis was developed for the best option selection to be applied to diminish the pollution in the water column of The Tula River in the Mexican Hidalgo State, to reach a sustainable management.

Influent dissolved oxygen (DO) was lowered from ambient conditions to approximately 2.5 mg/L for all experiments using a nitrogen sparge. When influent nitrate concentration was 0-2.0 mg/L, 1.6-2.8 mg/L as carbon of acetate or ethanol was required to achieve and sustain the complete removal of 50 mug/L perchlorate in a BAC filter. Most or all of the exogenous acetate and ethanol was removed during biofiltration. When a 72-h electron donor feed failure was simulated, a maximum perchlorate breakthrough of 18 mug/L was observed and, once electron donor was reapplied, 9 days were required to reestablish complete perchlorate removal. During a 24-h electron donor feed failure simulation, the maximum effluent perchlorate concentration detected was 6.7 mug/L. Within 24h of reactivating the electron donor, the filter regained its capacity to consistently remove 50 mug/L perchlorate to below detection. Although biomass growth diminished the filter's ability to consistently remove perchlorate, a cleaning procedure immediately restored stable, complete perchlorate removal. This cleaning procedure was required approximately every 50 days (4800 bed volumes) when influent DO concentration was 2.5 mg/L. Empty-bed contact time (EBCT) experiments showed that 80% perchlorate removal was achieved using a 5-min EBCT, and complete perchlorate removal was observed for an EBCT of 9 min. It was also demonstrated that BAC filtration consistently removed perchlorate to below detection for influent perchlorate concentrations ranging from 10 to 300 mug/L, influent sulfate concentrations between 0 and 220 mg/L, influent pH values of 6.5-9.0, and operating temperatures of 5-22degreesC.

Loads were assessed at median and 90 percentile values for expected and worst-cases scenarios. The expected scenario in the Sydney drinking water catchments is that decentralised systems (servicing 32,800 people) provide similar total loads to centralised systems (serving 70% of the catchment population) for total phosphorus (37,090 kg.y(-1)), Cryptosporidium (10(11) oocysts.y(-1)) and enteric viruses (9.1 X 10(13) y(-1)), but higher loads of total nitrogen (237,610 vs. 136,740 kg.y(-1)). Decentralised systems, however, were predicted to have higher loads in the worst-case scenario with 620,620 kg.y(-1) TN, 82,040 kg.y(-1) TP, 7.3 x 10(13) Cryptosporidium oocysts.y(-1) and 9 X 10(15) enteric viruses per year. Greater load variability was experienced with decentralised systems, which presumably reflects less reliability in their current operation and maintenance. Overall, catchment water quality is therefore not only affected by sewage disposal methods, but also failure issues. Decentralised system disposal to land may afford a degree of mitigation that can be enhanced, if the degree of failure is reduced.

A mathematical model including the analytical solutions of the transport of the density current combined with a simple 2-layered water quality model has been established, describing the hydrodynamics and the water quality variation of the reservoir well. The continued sediment release of P in the anoxic state (from October to March) is an important P source and should be carefully assessed and controlled to reduce the impact of the internal loading of P incorporated with the density current on the water quality in future years.

J	Kao, JJ; Chen, WJ				Kao, JJ; Chen, WJ			A multiobjective model for non-point source pollution control for an off-stream reservoir catchment	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Specialized Conference on Watershed and River Basin Management	SEP 11-13, 2002	EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND			best management practices; environmental systems analysis; multiobjective model; non-point source pollution; optimization		Phosphorus loads from agricultural non-point source pollution (NPSP) significantly degrade reservoir water quality, making adequate control of agricultural NPSP necessary for improving the water quality. Controlling NPSP is generally accomplished using various Best Management Practices (BMPs). The present study applies the Agricultural Non-Point Source Pollution (AGNPS) model to simulate NPSP loading and BMP efficiencies and establishes an enhanced multiobjective mixed-integer programming model for NPSP control strategy analyses based on these results. Cost, phosphorus load, sediment load and equity are the four major objectives considered. A case study for the Posan reservoir is presented. Four commonly proposed and applicable BMPs are chosen. Non-inferior solutions obtained using the constraint method and trade-off relationships among different control objectives are described and discussed. Compared with a previously proposed fertilizer control model, results show that the model established herein is more cost-effective and achieves better phosphorus and sediment loading reduction and equity goals. Furthermore, the current model is expected to facilitate decision-making analysis for development of an appropriate cost-sharing program to encourage adoption of appropriate BMPs by farmers.

The hydrodynamic behavior of the reactor is described as completely mixed tanks in series with recirculation. The hydrodynamic pattern is combined with a subset of River Water Quality Model 1 (RWOM 1), including the main processes in liquid phase. Our aim is to develop models for WSPs and aerated lagoons, too, but we focused on HRAPs first for several reasons: Sediments are usually less abundant in HRAP and can be neglected, Stratification is not observed and state variables are constant in a reactor cross section, Due to the system's geometry, the reactor is quite similar to a plugflow type reactor with recirculation, with a simple advection term. The model is based on mass balances and includes the following processes: Phytoplankton growth with NO3(-), NO2(-) and death, Aerobic growth of heterotrophs with NO3(-), NH4(+) and respiration, Anoxic growth of heterotrophs with NO3(-), NO2(-) and anoxic respiration, Growth of nitrifiers (two stages) and respiration. The differences with regard to RWOM 1 are that we included a limiting term associated with inorganic carbon on the growth rate of algae and nitrifiers, gas transfers are taken into account by the familiar Adeney equation, and a subroutine calculates light intensity,at the water surface. This article presents our first simulations.	Fdn Univ Luxembourgeoise, B-6700 Arlon, Belgium	Vasel, JL (corresponding author), Fdn Univ Luxembourgeoise, 185 Av Longwy, B-6700 Arlon, Belgium.

J	Luyiga, S; Kiwanuka, S				Luyiga, S; Kiwanuka, S			Plankton composition, distribution and significance in a tropical integrated pilot constructed treatment wetland in Uganda	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Wetland Systems for Water Pollution Control	SEP 16-19, 2002	ARUSHA, TANZANIA			constructed wetlands; Cyperus; Phragmites; plankton community		The importance of the plankton community in wastewater treatment has been under-estimated for a long time, simply because of its biomass accumulation resulting in final release of organic matter back into the system after decomposition. In a two-year 3-month periodical study on a tropical integrated wastewater treatment constructed wetland, the phytoplankton role was tested and it has been shown that, through harvesting, the phytoplankton community plays a significant role in municipal wastewater treatment, The high phytobiomass, which was dominated by green algae (Chlorophyta), enhanced high levels of dissolved oxygen and high pH within the open ponds, and because of this, the system was found to be highly efficient in BOD5 (81%) and NH4+-N (93%) removal. The high pH enhanced ammonia volatilization within the open ponds. Regression statistics between the plankton community composition and some of the physicochemical parameters (BOD, NH4+-N, DO, pH) within the wetland system show a significant relationship. In conclusion, open treatment wetlands provide a wide variety of planktonic organisms as water quality improvement systems through the provision of oxygen and alteration of the pH for BOD5 and ammonium reduction respectively.

J	Earle, JR				Earle, JR			The Three Rivers Project - water quality monitoring and management systems in the Boyne, Liffey and Suir catchments in Ireland	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd World Water Congress of the International-Water-Association	APR 07-12, 2002	MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA	Int Water Assoc		catchment management; eutrophication; integrated monitoring; Geographical Information System (GIS); multi-sectoral participation; public awareness		The "Three Rivers Project" is a government initiative and one of a series of catchment based water quality monitoring and management systems being developed throughout Ireland since 1997. The establishment of these multi-sectoral, basin-wide and community based systems is a response to historically perceived disjointed, legalistic and non-participative approaches to water resource management and purports to transcend the restrictions of traditional local authority administrative boundaries. The new management model embodies the concepts and objectives contained in the European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive (WFD) enacted in December 2000. Ireland, in common with many EU countries, has failed to halt decades of increasing levels of eutrophication of surface waters due principally to phosphorus loading. The "Three Rivers Project" is promoting the benefits of an integrated and cooperative approach to the management of three important river systems in Ireland, namely, the Boyne, Liffey and Suir. The project objective is to protect and improve water quality to conform with "good ecological status". The implications of the Project findings for agricultural, municipal and industrial policy are grave and one of the greatest challenges now is to organise and fund Irish River Basin Management Systems as envisaged by the WFD to continue and build on the work which the "Three Rivers Project" has undertaken.

This first application of SPARROW outside of the United States included watersheds representative of a wide range of natural and cultural conditions and water-resources data that were well suited for calibrating and validating the models. We applied the spatially distributed model to a drainage network of nearly 5000 stream reaches and 75 lakes and reservoirs to empirically estimate the rates of nutrient delivery (and their levels of uncertainty) from point and diffuse sources to streams, lakes, and watershed outlets. The resulting models displayed relatively small errors; predictions of stream yield (kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) were typically within 30% or less of the observed values at the monitoring sites. There was strong evidence of the accuracy of the model estimates of nutrient sources and the natural rates of nutrient attenuation in surface waters. Estimated loss rates for streams, lakes, and reservoirs agreed closely with experimental measurements and empirical models from New Zealand, North America, and Europe as well as with previous U. S. SPARROW models. The results indicate that the SPARROW modeling technique provides a reliable method for relating experimental data and observations from small catchments to the transport of nutrients in the surface waters of large river basins.

The field site where these measurements were conducted was an agricultural soil amended with biosolids from a municipal wastewater treatment facility. These NO flux values were then used to assess the impact of including biosolid amended soils as a land-use class in an air quality model. The average NO flux from this biosolid amended soil was found to be exponentially dependent on soil temperature [NO Flux (ng N m(-2) s(-1)) = 1.07 exp(0.14 T-soil); R-2 = 0.81-NO Flux = 71.3 ng N m(-2) s(-1) at 30degreesC]. Comparing this relationship to results of the widely applied biogenic emissions inventory system (BEIS2) model revealed that for this field site, if the BEIS2 model was used, the NO emissions would have been underestimated by a factor of 26. Using this newly developed NO flux algorithm, combined with North Carolina Division of Water Quality statistics on how many biosolid amended acres are permitted per county, county-based NO inventories from these biosolid amended soils were calculated. Results from this study indicate that county-level biogenic NO emissions can increase by as much as 18% when biosolid amended soils are included as a land-use class. The multiscale air quality simulation platform (MAQSIP) was then used to determine differences in ozone (O-3) and odd-reactive nitrogen compounds (NO,) between models run with and without the biosolid amended acreages included in the inventory. Results showed that during the daytime, when atmospheric mixing heights are typically at their greatest, any increase in O-3 or NOy concentrations predicted by the model were small (< 3%). In some locations during late evening/early morning hours, ozone was found to be consumed by as much as 11%. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tappin, AD				Tappin, AD			An examination of the fluxes of nitrogen and phosphorus in temperate and tropical estuaries: Current estimates and uncertainties	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Review						nitrogen; phosphorus; catchment; river; estuary; coast; fluxes; models	LAND-USE; HUMBER ESTUARY; FLOW-INJECTION; COASTAL EUTROPHICATION; NUTRIENT FLUXES; SURFACE-WATER; CONTINENTAL SHELVES; NITRATE REDUCTION; SCHELDT ESTUARY; TRACE-METALS	In a number of regions of the world, enhanced flows of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from land to sea are of major concern because of the observable deterioration in the quality of many nearshore marine waters. Estuaries receive N and P from river and other runoff, from waste discharges, from the atmosphere and ocean and from exchange with coastal groundwaters (which in all likelihood results in a net input to the estuary). For rivers that do not discharge directly onto the continental shelf, seaward fluxes of N and P will be modified by within-estuary transformations of reactive species, the burial of particulate N and P in sediments (sub/intertidal, saltmarsh, mangrove) and the loss of gaseous N and P species by bacterial reduction. Driven by a desire to understand the effects of changing N and P loads on water quality, and to gain insights into the true modification of their fluxes within estuaries, much effort has been expended on providing quantitative estimates of the sources and sinks of these constituents. Yet, accurate and precise estimates on a global scale remain elusive. Riverine inputs of total N and P are calculated to be 35-64 and 22 Mt a(-1), respectively. These inputs are dominated by particulate species, and because of this, are likely to be imprecise as overall sediment fluxes are disproportionately influenced by infrequent, poorly sampled, high flow events. Direct aeolian inputs of N to estuaries (P inputs are minor), at a minimum of 1-4 Mt a(-1), are small but significant, although again good estimates are hampered by the apparent importance of infrequent, and thus under-sampled, deposition events. Indirect atmospheric inputs via deposition onto and runoff from catchments may be highly significant, at least in environments bounding the North Atlantic Ocean. Groundwater inputs are generally unknown, but, for N, may be 5-10 Mt a(-1) (no data on P). Information on the global inputs of N and P from waste discharges and mariculture do not appear to be available. Denitrification, estimated to be ca. 33 Mt a(-1), may account for 52-94% of the currently estimated total N inputs; in contrast, the loss of P via venting of gaseous phosphine is unknown. The burial of N and P in sediments is about 7% and 30% of their total inputs, respectively. Nevertheless, reliable information on the modifying role of estuarine sediments appears far from complete. Globally, the inputs of N and P to the marine environment from all sources are expected to increase over the next few decades. The resulting effects of these increases on the marine environment, including any influences due to estuarine processing, may be partly assessed through the use of dynamic transport and transformation estuarine models for N and P. A further important development in this respect will be the linking of complementary models (e.g. catchment/river/estuarine/ coastal zone) and their coupling to strategic large scale observations.

Following fish removal, the water quality in biomanipulated lakes often improves concomitant with decreased phosphorus (P) levels. Because the decrease in P concentrations derives most probably either directly or indirectly from fish, which are the main target of biomanipulation, this study examined the P release of 0+, 1+ and 2+ roach [Rutilus rutilus (L.)] and changes in the P release during summer in a shallow eutrophic lake in Finland. 2. The P release was separated into P derived from benthic and littoral food items and into recycled P derived from feeding on zooplankton, to estimate the contribution of net P additions to the water column by the fish to the increase in P concentrations of the lake water (75-110 mg P m(-3)) in summer 1991-96. . Individual P release of roach by both egestion and excretion was estimated with a bioenergetics model. The size of the roach population was estimated with a depletion method and the proportions of different age groups from catch samples, using a programme separating mixtures of normal distributions. The sensitivity of the release estimates to variation in the growth data was estimated with the jackknife technique. 4. The biomass-specific P release by 0+ roach (0.36-0.54 mg P g(-1) day(-1)) was higher than that by older roach (0.07-0.16 mg P g(-1) day(-1)) throughout the summer. The P release by the whole roach population deriving from benthic and littoral food items (0.7-2.7 mg m(-3) during July to August, representing a net addition to the water column) was 5-19 times lower in 1991-96 than the recycled P release deriving from zooplankton (8.9-25.7 mg m(-3)), and too low to explain the increase in the P concentration of the lake water during the summer. Because the biomass-specific P release and roach diet composition vary with fish age, it is important to consider the age structure of fish populations to obtain correct estimates of P release and net additions to the water column. 5. The removal of roach by fishing diminished the roach stock greatly, but the fish-mediated P release to the water column changed little. This effect was because of the high compensation capacity of the roach population, leading to high recruitment of young fish with higher biomass-specific P release rates. 6. External loading is very low during summer months and therefore it cannot explain the increase in the P concentration of water during that time. Internal loading from the sediment might be as high as 10.2 mg P m(-2) day(-1), i.e. 50 times higher than the maximum net P addition by the total roach population.

J	Masciopinto, C; Carrieri, C				Masciopinto, C; Carrieri, C			Assessment of water quality after 10 years of reclaimed water injection: The Nardo fractured aquifer (Southern Italy)	GROUND WATER MONITORING AND REMEDIATION			English	Article							WASTE-WATER; TRANSPORT; REMOVAL; REUSE; MODEL; FLOW	Experimental studies have been carried out in a fractured coastal aquifer of the Salento region (Nardo, Italy), which has been subjected to 12,000 m(3)/day of treated municipal waste water injected into a natural sinkhole since 1991, The analytical parameters of ground water sampled in 30 monitoring wells in the area downgradient from the sinkhole, taking into account the direction of ground water flow, have been compared before and after injection. The water table mound (1.5 m), the reduction of sea water extent (2 km), and the spreading of injected pollutants were evaluated by means of a mathematical model. The predicted values in the monitoring wells were adjusted to inorganic nitrogen biodegradation using transformation rates developed in laboratory tests. After 10 years, the injection has increased the volume of the available resource for agricultural and drinking water use, without any notable decrease in the preexisting ground water quality. Moreover, to preserve water resources from pollution, the mathematical model allowed the maximum constituent concentrations (standards) in waste water reclamation for recharge to be identified.

This bay is divided into two subecosystems by an artificial breakwater: the inner bay (polluted zone, P) is largely influenced by anthropogenic perturbations and the outer bay (less polluted, LP) is much less polluted. We found greater concentrations of DMS and chlorophyll a, of phytoplankton and zooplankton densities and biomasses in the polluted zone (P) than in the less polluted zone (LP) of the bay. The DMS concentration and phytoplankton biomass were strongly correlated, and a high degree of eutrophication may contribute, in connection with other factors, to a greater production of phytoplankton which in turn enhances the DMS production. The DMS concentration in coastal polluted zones is then greatly higher than in open sea (around three times) and this greater production should be taken into account for the global estimation, at least on a local scale, of DMS production in seawater, which is a key factor for the biogenic sulfur cycle.

Recently measured data were used to approximate flux rates of zebra mussel respiration, filtering, and phosphorus and ammonia mobilization. A model is developed that for the first time links dissolved oxygen, phytoplankton growth, and zebra mussel respiration and filtering. Good agreement is attained between the model calculations and longitudinal profiles of both dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll measured at low flow during 1997-1999. Flux rates derived from these analyses are consistent with results from other studies when normalized on the basis of zebra mussel number and tissue dry weight. Kinetic formulations for the zebra mussels are developed that describe respiration and filtering rates as a function of density, size distribution, and dissolved oxygen concentration. Several plausible test scenarios are examined using the model that indicate that both zebra mussel numbers and size distributions have a profound effect on the water quality of the Seneca River and therefore have important management and planning ramifications.

J	Tong, STY; Chen, WL				Tong, STY; Chen, WL			Modeling the relationship between land use and surface water quality	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						BASINS; ArcView; GIS; watershed hydrologic modeling; water quality; flow	CLIMATE-CHANGE; IMPACT; RUNOFF; FLUCTUATIONS; STREAMFLOW; SYSTEM	It is widely known that watershed hydrology is dependent on many factors, including land use, climate, and soil conditions. But the relative impacts of different types of land use on the surface water are yet to be ascertained and quantified. This research attempted to use a comprehensive approach to examine the hydrologic effects of land use at both a regional and a local scale. Statistical and spatial analyses were employed to examine the statistical and spatial relationships of land use and the flow and water quality in receiving waters on a regional scale in the State of Ohio. Besides, a widely accepted watershed-based water quality assessment tool, the Better Assessment Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint Sources (BASINS), was adopted to model the plausible effects of land use on water quality in a local watershed in the East Fork Little Miami River Basin. The results from the statistical analyses revealed that there was a significant relationship between land use and in-stream water quality, especially for nitrogen, phosphorus and Fecal coliform. The geographic information systems (GIS) spatial analyses identified the watersheds that have high levels of contaminants and percentages of agricultural and urban lands. Furthermore, the hydrologic and water quality modeling showed that agricultural and impervious urban lands produced a much higher level of nitrogen and phosphorus than other land surfaces. From this research, it seems that the approach adopted in this study is comprehensive, covering both the regional and local scales. It also reveals that BASINS is a very useful and reliable tool, capable of characterizing the flow and water quality conditions for the study area under different watershed scales. With little modification, these models should be able to adapt to other watersheds or to simulate other contaminants. They also can be used to study the plausible impacts of global environmental change. In addition, the information on the hydrologic effects of land use is very useful. It can provide guidelines not only for resource managers in restoring our aquatic ecosystems, but also for local planners in devising viable and ecologically-sound watershed development plans, as well as for policy makers in evaluating alternate land management decisions.

J	Zhang, J; Ray, SAF; Steinman, A				Zhang, J; Ray, SAF; Steinman, A			Potential phosphorus load reductions under the lake okeechobee regulatory program	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						modeling; runoff; water quality; phosphorus transport; watershed management; nonpoint source pollution; monitoring	FLORIDA; MODEL	Nutrient loading from beef pastures located within the northern Lake Okeechobee watershed in Florida, has been identified as a source of phosphorus contributing to the accelerated eutrophication of the lake. Since 1989 within the watershed, 557 agricultural drainage sites, mainly beef pasture, have been monitored for compliance under a regulatory program. Of those sites, 154 were actively monitored for phosphorus concentrations from October 1, 1998, to September 30, 1999. Of these 154 sites, 77 were considered to be out of compliance (OOC). An OOC site is defined as having runoff with a 12-month average phosphorus concentration exceeding the permitted discharge limit. The average annual phosphorous load from the 77 OOC sites for an eight-year study period from October 1, 1991, to September 30, 1999, was estimated using measured concentration values and simulated runoff obtained from an agricultural nonpoint source pollution model, CREAMS-WT. The 77 OOC sites produced an estimated average annual 46 metric tonnes of phosphorus load, of which an estimated 22 tonnes of phosphorus reached Lake Okeechobee on an average annual basis. The remaining estimated average annual 24 tonnes of phosphorus load was retained by streams and wetlands in the discharge transport system between the sites and the lake. The estimated average annual load reaching Lake Okeechobee from the OOC sites represented 11 percent of the phosphorus load above a five-year average annual target load for the lake. However, the OOC site drainage areas represented only 3 percent of the northern watershed that drains into the lake. Of the 77 OOC sites, 12 sites had an average annual phosphorus loading rate equal to or greater than 3.0 kg/ha and were placed on the priority list for the Critical Restoration Project in the Lake Okeechobee watershed. To estimate the possible phosphorus load reductions from the 77 sites, two scenarios were modeled. The first scenario reduced phosphorus concentrations in runoff to the permitted discharge limits under the Lake Okeechobee regulatory program. The second scenario changed current land uses to native rangeland with an estimated annual offsite total phosphorus areal loading rate of 0.114 kg/ha. These two scenarios are hypothetical with assumed concentration values and loading rate. Model results showed that the first management scenario reduced the average annual phosphorus load to the lake by an estimated 15 tonnes. The second scenario reduced the average annual phosphorus load to the lake by an estimated 21 tonnes.

Ibis large, shallow reservoir has a mean depth of 5.3 meters and a surface area of 40 km(2). Numerous reports of undesirable taste and odor in drinking water were received by the City of Wichita Water and Sewer Department in the early 1990's, and periodic episodes of objectionable tastes and odor have occurred up through fall 2001. An intensive limnological sampling program was carried out from August 1999-October 2000, and simultaneous measurements of two taste and odor-causing compounds (geosmin and methylisoborneol) in the lakewater were also performed. These data were used to construct empirical, phosphorus-based water quality management recommendations designed to help reduce the likelihood of objectionable taste and odor events in Cheney Reservoir. The general framework developed here should also be applicable to other waterbodies exhibiting taste and odor-related problems.

J	McDowell, RW; Monaghan, RM				McDowell, RW; Monaghan, RM			The potential for phosphorus loss in relation to nitrogen fertiliser application and cultivation	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						phosphorus; subsurface flow; cultivation; dissolved organic P; dissolved reactive P; nitrogen application	ORGANIC PHOSPHORUS; SOIL; GRASSLAND; MINERALIZATION; SURFACE; MANURE	The amounts and forms of dissolved phosphorus (P) leached from undisturbed and cultivated soil in lysimeters were measured from sites that had received N fertiliser at 0, 200 or 400 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for 4 years. Soil in mini-lysimeters, 18 cm i.d. by 25 cm depth, was leached at monthly intervals over autumn and winter (500 mm total drainage) to simulate a relatively wet autumn-winter for eastern Southland (typical drainage, c. 350 mm yr(-1)). The major form of P leached was dissolved organic P (DOP), which represented 67 and 80% of total dissolved P (TDP) losses in the undisturbed and cultivated soil treatments, respectively. Historical N inputs had little effect on the amounts of dissolved reactive P (DRP), DOP or TDP leached from the undisturbed soils. However, DRP, and to a lesser extent TDP, losses decreased as historical N fertiliser inputs increased in the cultivated soil treatment. Significantly greater losses of DRP were observed from undisturbed compared with cultivated soils. The lower DRP losses in cultivated soil were attributed to greater sorption of P during matrix flow. These results suggest that, although DRP losses are of little concern following cultivation of pastoral soils, the greater mobility and loss of DOP in drainage, in both undisturbed and cultivated soils, represents a potential risk to water quality and loss of P from the plant rooting zone. Further study to examine the bioavailability of DOP is warranted to determine its potential risk to surface water.

J	Di, HJ; Cameron, KC				Di, HJ; Cameron, KC			The use of a nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide (DCD), to decrease nitrate leaching and nitrous oxide emissions in a simulated grazed and irrigated grassland	SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						nitrogen; nitrate; leaching; nitrification inhibitors; dicyandiamide; nitrous oxide; grasslands; dairy farms; water quality	DAIRY SHED EFFLUENT; SANDY LOAM SOIL; AMMONIA VOLATILIZATION; AGRICULTURAL SOILS; FLOOD IRRIGATION; FERTILIZER; LOSSES; LYSIMETER; UREA; DENITRIFICATION	In grazed dairy pasture systems, a major source of NO3- leached and N2O emitted is the N returned in the urine from the grazing animal. The objective of this study was to use lysimeters to measure directly the effectiveness of a nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide (DCD), in decreasing NO3- leaching and N2O emissions from urine patches in a grazed dairy pasture under irrigation. The soil was a free-draining Lismore stony silt loam (Udic Haplustept loamy skeletal) and the pasture was a mixture of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and white clover (Trifolium repens). The use of DCD decreased NO3--N leaching by 76% for the urine N applied in the autumn, and by 42% for urine N applied in the spring, giving an annual average reduction of 59%. This would reduce the NO3--N leaching loss in a grazed paddock from 118 to 46 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). The NO3--N concentration in the drainage water would be reduced accordingly from 19.7 to 7.7 mg N L-1, with the latter being below the drinking water guideline of 11.3 mg NL-1. Total N2O emissions following two urine applications were reduced from 46 kg N2O-N ha(-1) without DCD to 8.5 kg N2O-N with DCD, representing an 82% reduction. In addition to the environmental benefits, the use of DCD also increased herbage production by more than 30%, from 11 to 15 t ha(-1) yr(-1). The use of DCD therefore has the potential to make dairy farming more environmentally sustainable by reducing NO3- leaching and N2O emissions.

Treatments simulated direct spraying of ponds and amounts of drift judged able to reach the pond at 1/10 and 1/100 direct rates. The study was conducted in 12, 500-1 outdoor pool mesocosms. Pond water from an adjacent baitfish rearing pond was used. Water quality measurements were made prior to application and at 24 and 48 h after application. Commercial compounds tested and direct rates in kg active ingredient ha(-1) were clomazone (0.6), thiobencarb (3.4), pendamethalin (1.1), propanil-dry, flowable (4.5), quinclorac (0.6), halosulfuron (0.07), bensulfuron methyl (0.07), triclopyr (0.4), 2,4-(D)-amine (1.7), and molinate (5.6). In addition, propanil was evaluated in a second application scenario at the same rates and to the same pond water sample as the initial application. Except for propanil, the rice herbicides produced no measurable effect on pond plankton or associated water quality. Following the first application at full rate for propanil, morning oxygen levels were reduced to critical levels (below 3 mg/l) for 2 days. After a second application of propanil at the full and 1/10 rates, oxygen levels were not decreased, although there were significant increases in chlorophyll a and zooplankton concentrations.

However, societal interest in agriculture is much broader than these issues. The objective of this paper is to analyze the potential impacts of climate change on an important negative externality from agriculture, water quality. We construct a simulation model of maize production in twelve watersheds within the U. S. Chesapeake Bay Region that has economic and watershed components linking climate to productivity, production decisions by maize farmers, and nitrogen loadings delivered to the Chesapeake Bay. Maize is an important crop to study because of its importance to the region's agriculture and because it is a major source of nutrient pollution. The model is run under alternative scenarios regarding the future climate, future baseline (without any climate change), whether farmers respond to climate change, whether there are carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment effects on maize production, and whether agricultural prices facing the region change due to climate change impacts on global agricultural commodity markets. The simulation results differ from one scenario to another on the magnitude and direction of change in nitrogen deliveries to the Chesapeake Bay. The results are highly sensitive to the choice of future baseline scenario and to whether there are CO2 enrichment effects. The results are also highly sensitive to assumptions about the impact of climate change on commodity prices facing farmers in the Chesapeake Bay region. The results indicate that economic responses by farmers to climate change definitely matter. Assuming that farmers do not respond to changes in temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric CO2 levels could lead to mistaken conclusions about the magnitude and direction of environmental impacts.

A numerical I D-vertical model of the phytoplanktonic succession has been developed. It allows us to simulate the temporal and spatial variations in concentration of the main phytoplanktonic species in relation to the vertical mixing processes in the reservoir. Our results show that the buoyancy regulation of M. aeruginosa is a major factor in its dominance in the lake, at least when the water column is well stratified. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Drolc, A; Koncan, JZ				Drolc, A; Koncan, JZ			Estimation of sources of total phosphorus in a river basin and assessment of alternatives for river pollution reduction	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						river basin; diffuse sources; eutrophication; phosphorus; water balance	MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN	The methodology of material flow analysis is presented and applied to developing a phosphorus balance in a river basin and evaluating different scenarios for pollution reduction. The method is based on the balance principle: inputs and outputs of each phosphorus-related subsystems were balanced. The application of the methodology strategies was illustrated by means of a case study of the Krka River, Slovenia. The results showed that besides effluents from wastewater treatment plants, agriculture contributed significantly to the total annual phosphorus load. After establishing the present levels of phosphor-us balance, different scenarios were considered: different stages of wastewater treatment as well as management of agricultural activities. The present emission of phosphorus is estimated to be 81.8 tons/year: after implementation of measures, it would be 48.6 tons/year, a total reduction of 40%. Besides reduction of point sources by means of wastewater collection and implementation of nutrient removal technology, managing agricultural phosphorus to protect water quality should become a major challenge in the Krka river basin.

J	Gin, KYH; Koh, ST; Lin, II; Chan, ES				Gin, KYH; Koh, ST; Lin, II; Chan, ES			Application of spectral signatures and colour ratios to estimate chlorophyll in Singapore's coastal waters	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE			English	Article						spectroscopy; chlorophyll; remote sensing; water quality; suspended matter; coastal	ALGAL-CHLOROPHYLL; RADIANCE SPECTRA; INLAND WATERS; PHYTOPLANKTON; FLUORESCENCE; REFLECTANCE; QUALITY; SPECTROMETER; ABSORPTION; OCEAN	In this paper, a study of the spectral signatures of coastal surface waters in the Johor and Singapore Straits and the application of colour ratios to estimate chlorophyll is presented. In general, the spectral signatures of coastal waters in Singapore could be represented by two profiles. The first was characterized by a high major reflectance peak at 577 nm which decreased toward the blue and near infra-red (NIR) bands. Such a profile was obtained when chlorophyll levels were low (less than 5 mug 1(-1)). The second profile, which was obtained during periods of high chlorophyll (greater than 10 mug 1(-1)), was characterized by an overall lower reflectance over the visible spectrum, with a distinct absorption trough at 672 nm and reflectance peak at 695 nm. In general, suspended solids (ranging from about 4 to 100 mg 1(-1)) increased reflectance in the green wavebands relative to the red/NIR region. The effect of dissolved organic carbon on the reflectance spectra was generally considered small due to its low concentration (<3 mg 1(-1)). Blue-Green and Red-Near Infrared colour ratios were correlated with chlorophyll a, with the latter generally producing better correlations (R-2=0.63). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

S. A.). Water quality measurements, discharge estimates, and literature values were used to establish the annual and seasonal variations in loading rates for total nitrogen and nitrate. The relatively stable annual loadings (million kg N) are about 10 x that of the pre-settlement nitrogen loading, and come from atmosphere (1.3), the watershed (7.8), pumped urban runoff from New Orleans (1.0), and leakage through the Bonnet Carre flood control structure (0.5-0.9). Relatively minor additional amounts come from nitrogen fixation in the Lake. Occasional openings of the Bonnet Carre Spillway ( for flood protection) could triple the annual average loading within 1-2 months. Proposed smaller diversions (for wetland restoration) could raise present N loadings by 50%. The results of water quality management, flood protection and wetland restoration may thus have conflicting effects on the Lake's phytoplankton community, which is primarily nitrogen limited. Lowering the total nitrogen loading, however, seems quite possible, especially given that the present loadings are almost all reducible through existing technology, especially sewerage treatment. The analysis demonstrates that the consequences of ecosystem restoration efforts, continued population growth and flood protection to estuarine nitrogen budgets are intertwined with each other, have a seasonal component, and are changing as policies evolve.

J	Kampas, A; Edwards, AC; Ferrier, RC				Kampas, A; Edwards, AC; Ferrier, RC			Joint pollution control at a catchment scale: compliance costs and policy implications	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						nitrogen; phosphorus; nutrient management; environmental taxes; water quality; water framework directive	LAND-USE CHANGE; WATER-QUALITY; EXPORT COEFFICIENT; AGRICULTURAL PHOSPHORUS; ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES; ECONOMIC INSTRUMENTS; NITROGEN MANAGEMENT; DIFFUSE POLLUTION; NITRATE POLLUTION; SURFACE WATERS	Agricultural activities are one of the major drivers of increased nutrient levels such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Elevated nutrient concentrations are associated with degraded water quality that can result in potential impacts for human health and the environment. A recent European study has identified elevated concentrations of N and P for many European river monitoring stations. In many cases the management of N and P has been considered separately here we address the multi-dimensional issue of water quality where the simultaneous management and control of both N and P is considered desirable. Using an integrated modelling approach various nutrient management scenarios are examined. It is found that although the control of N and P involve different farm adjustments and induce different land use changes there is a certain degree of complementarity between these two nutrient controls. The policy implication of ignoring such complementarity is that the appropriate environmental taxes to control the required nutrient losses are overestimated, resulting in unnecessary welfare losses to the society.

The effect of litter source (the Delmarva Peninsula and Moorefield, West Virginia) and composting of poultry litter on N mineralization and availability of P in two soil types (sandy loam and silt loam) was determined in a controlled environment for 120 d. Nitrogen mineralization (percent total organic N converted to inorganic nitrogen) rates were higher for fresh litter (range of 42 to 64%) than composted litter (range of 1 to 9%). The N mineralization rate of fresh litter from the Delmarva Peninsula was consistently lower than the fresh litter from Moorefield, WV. The N mineralization rate of composted litter from either source was not significantly different for each soil type (7 to 9% in sandy loam and 1 to 5% in silt loam) even though composting conditions were completely different at the two composting facilities. Litter source had a large effect on N mineralization rates of fresh but not composted poultry litter. Composting yielded a more predictable and reliable source of mineralizable N than fresh litter. Water-extractable phosphorus (WEP) was similar in soils amended with composted litter from WV and fresh litter from both sources (approximately 10 to 25 and 2 to 14 mg P kg(-1) for sandy loam and silt loam, respectively). Mehlich 1-extractable phosphorus (MEP) was similar in soils amended with WV fresh litter and composted litter from both sources (approximately 100 to 140 and 60 to 90 mg P kg(-1) for sandy loam and silt loam, respectively). These results suggest that the composting process did not consistently reduce WEP and MEP, and P can be as available in composted poultry litter as in fresh poultry litter.

Although best irrigation and N management practices have been used, increases in worldwide use of N fertilizers combined with average N use efficiencies of 50 percent have contributed to increased leakage from the N cycle (e.g., higher nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) leaching losses). Specific land use patterns have been correlated with higher NO3-N concentrations in underground water resources. There is a critical need to continue improving best management practices to reduce NO3-N leaching losses, increase the economic viability of farming operations, and conserve water quality. To help meet these objectives, this paper recommends the essentials for the development of a national NO3-N leaching assessment tool The resulting NO3-N leaching index (NLI) should be based on hydrological soil properties and climate, must consider management practices and associated crop rotations, and incorporate off-site effects. Development of the NO should include the use of simulation models and expert systems; databases for soils, climate, and management; and use of the Internet. The index also needs to allow input of local site-specific information from producers and field personnel. The index needs to be national in scope and yet flexible enough for use in specialized or difficult cases. Routine use of the index needs to be kept simple and quick with minimal input from the user so that field office personnel can apply the tool. on a regular basis. Application of the NLI should be linked to the phosphorus (P) index so that management of key nutrients-N and P-can be accomplished simultaneously. We recommend a 3-tier approach to developing the NLI that would provide a uniform index yet allow for refinement of accuracy in the index values as necessary to meet study needs. Tier 1 would involve the initial use of an expert system to separate medium, high, and very high NO3-N leaching potentials from low and very low potential levels by qualitatively screening non-numeric inputs obtained from users. This initial screening technique is similar to that used to develop the P index, but would be designed specifically for NO3-N leaching. Tier 2 would involve computation of the NO3-N leached (NL) index using application models or databases based on models, followed by introduction of off-site effects and local interpretation and normalization to produce the final NLI. In difficult cases, a tier 3 study involving detailed research models and field data would be needed along with the off-site effects, interpretation, and normalization. The NO could be used routinely in conjunction with the P index to allow alternative management scenarios that optimize both N and P for maximal economic return while protecting the environment.

In its inert form as elemental dinitrogen (N(2)) gas in the atmosphere (78%), nitrogen does not impact environmental quality. But the extensive use of N in agricultural systems and the associated transformations of N into various ions or gaseous forms contribute to leaks from the N cycle. These N losses may contribute to the degradation of water, air, and soil in many regions of the world. When N is in its nitrate (NO(3-)) form, it is one of the most mobile ions in agricultural systems, and NO(3-) leaching is a primary source of the contamination in drinking water. Soil erosion that transports soil particles and N also contributes to surface water contamination. The gaseous transport of ammonia (NH(3)) from manures and the denitrification of NO(3-) and nitrite (NO(2-)) ions and their transformation into gaseous forms of N such as nitrous oxide (N(2)O) and nitric oxide (NO) can contribute to air quality and greenhouse warming impacts. Since N inputs are necessary for maintaining the viability of intensive agricultural systems, we must understand how management impacts the transformations, transport, and fate of N. The discussion of the transport and fate of N through agricultural systems must take into account the N cycle. Mitigation strategies that reduce the primary and secondary flows of N through the environment and that benefit farming and livestock operations must be developed.

These models have been coupled with simulations of other related processes such as water and solute transport, crop growth, soil chemistry, temperature regimes, and management to make more complete models of cropping systems. At the core of these toots have been databases for soils, climate, model coefficients, and field/farm/watershed management scenarios. This paper reviews the basic types of N models, modeling techniques, and required databases. The accuracy of N models along with their strengths and limitations are discussed in a management context. Tips are provided on initializing N constituent pools, on using N models in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) applications, on developing confidence bands for N model output, and on using web-based N models. Finally, methods are described to analyze simulated NO3-N leached, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and N use efficiencies.

Scientists engaged in this endeavor struggle to represent processes controlling P transport at scales and time frames that are meaningful to farmers, resource managers, and policy makers. To help overcome these challenges, we reviewed salient issues facing scientists that model P transport, providing a conceptual framework from which process-based P transport models might be evaluated. Recent advances in quantifying the release of soil P to overland and subsurface flow show that extraction coefficients relating soil and flow P are variable but can be represented as a function of land cover or erosion. Existing information on best management effects on P export should be linked to watershed models to better represent changes in P transport. The main needs of P transport models are inclusion of flexible coefficients relating soil and overland flow P, fertilizer and manure management and P loss, stream channel effects on edge-of-field P losses prior to water body input, and linkage of watershed and water-body response models. However, it is essential that the most appropriate model be carefully selected, according to a user's needs in terms of available input data, level of predictive accuracy, and scale of simulation being considered.

We evaluated Mehlich 3 (M3) as an environmental soil P test using 465 soils typical to the Mid-Atlantic region and found M3-P accurately predicted water soluble P (WSP), desorbable P (Fe oxide strip P [FeO-P]), and total sorbed P (oxalate P). The M3-P saturation ratio (M3 [P/(Al+Fe)]) was linearly related to the well-established oxalate P saturation method (DPSox) and a M3 [P/(Al+Fe)] range of 0.10 to 0.15 corresponded to reported environmental limits for DPSox (25-40%). Rainfall simulation and column leaching studies showed M3 [P/(Al+Fe)] predicted runoff and leachate P concentrations better than M3-P. We suggest consideration of the following approach now used in Delaware for agri-environmental interpretation of M3-P and M3 [P/(Al+Fe)]: (i) Below optimum (crop response likely; M3-P less than or equal to 50 mg kg(-1); M3 [P/(Al+Fe)] < 0.06); (ii) Optimum (economic response to P unlikely, recommendations for P rarely made; M3-P = 51-100 mg kg(-1); M3 [P/(Al+Fe)] = 0.06-0.11); (iii) Above Optimum (soil P will not limit crop yields, no P recommended; M3-P > 100 mg kg(-1); M3 [P/(Al+Fe)] > 0.11); (iv) Environmental (implement improved P management to reduce potential for nonpoint P pollution-in Delaware M3-P > 150 mg kg(-1); M3 [P/(Al+Fe)] > 0.15 is now used). (v) Natural Resource Conservation (no P applied even if the potential water quality impact is low to conserve P, a finite natural resource).

Individual programs are ongoing to reduce phosphorus from point and nonpoint sources. However, a comprehensive phosphorus management approach may prove more cost effective and beneficial. To be successful, such an approach must take into consideration phosphorus from all sources and seek geographically targeted, cost-effective, and holistic solutions. This study utilized the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model to quantify phosphorus sources throughout the basin and quantify impacts from the application of basin-wide BMPs. Results of this study indicate that, under existing land use and management conditions, an average annual phosphorus load of approximately 764,000 kg enters the Rock River and it tributaries. Point sources account for 41% of this value, and nonpoint sources account for 59%. Model results show that, under existing conditions, approximately 160,000 tons of sediment is delivered to the streams and surface water bodies on an average annual basis. Modeling results indicate that implementation of improved tillage practices (predominantly conservation tillage) can reduce sediment yields by almost 20%.

J	Gilley, JE; Eghball, B				Gilley, JE; Eghball, B			Residual effects of compost and fertilizer applications on nutrients in runoff	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						eutrophication; manure management; nitrogen movement; nutrient losses; runoff; phosphorus; water quality	SIMULATED RAINFALL; PHOSPHORUS; MANURE; SOIL; NITROGEN; CORN; ADSORPTION	The application of compost or fertilizer at rates that exceed crop nutrient requirements can result in phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) accumulation in soil. This study was conducted to determine the influence of soil P and N contents on the concentrations and total amounts of P and N transported in runoff. Composted beef cattle feedlot manure or inorganic fertilizer were added from 1992 to 1995 to a Sharpsburg silty clay loam soil at rates sufficient to meet P or N requirements for corn and incorporated following application. After four years of corn production following the last compost application, P concentration, EC, and pH of the surface soils on the N-based compost treatments were significantly greater than the check plots. Simulated rainfall was applied to the experimental site in 2000. Concentrations and total amounts of P and N in runoff were similar on the compost and inorganic fertilizer plots. The application of corn residue at a rate of 6 Mg ha(-1) did not significantly affect the nutrient concentration of runoff or total nutrient transport when compared to a no-residue condition for a study site with a slope varying from 0.15% to 2.70%. On an adjoining field, compost or inorganic fertilizer were applied at rates in excess of crop P and N requirements to increase soil test P levels. For Bray and Kurtz No. I soil test P levels ranging from 42 to 267 mg kg(-1) and water-soluble soil test P values varying from 5 to 61 mg kg(-1), the dissolved P (DP) concentration of runoff did not correlate well with soil test R Thus, factors other than soil test P appear to influence P loss in runoff for the bare soil used in this investigation.

Bamboo poles, approximating a submerged surface area equal to the total pond surface area, were used as substrates for periphyton and were planted vertically into the pond bottom. Ponds were fertilized fortnightly with 4500 kg cow manure, 150 kg urea and 150 kg triple super phosphate (TSP) per hectare. Four stocking combinations were applied: 60% rohu plus 40% catla with a total stocking density of 10000 ha(-1) (treatment CR), CR plus 15% kalbaush (C15), CR plus 30% kalbaush (C30) and CR plus 45% kalbaush (C45). A treatment with 60% rohu plus 40% catla without bamboo substrate was used as control (CR0). Treatments differed significantly in some water quality parameters (Secchi depth, total alkalinity, orthophosphate, total ammonia and chlorophyll a) and periphyton biomass (dry matter (DM), ash-free dry matter (AFDM) and ash content). The ash (15-19%), protein (23-26%) and energy (19-20 kJ g(-1)) contents of the estimated periphyton can be considered as broadly appropriate to fish dietary needs. The relative contributions of algae to the periphytic biomass were 30-60% depending on the treatment. In total, 50 genera of algae, 13 genera of zooplankton and some macrobenthic invertebrates were identified from the periphyton samples. Survival of rohu and catla was higher in ponds with bamboo poles than in the controls. Net fish yields of the three species were found to be higher in treatment C15. Highest total fish yield, over a 90-day culture period, was recorded in treatment C15 (2306 kg ha(-1)) followed by treatment C45 (1914 kg ha(-1)), treatment CR (1652 kg ha(-1)), treatment C30 (1507 kg ha(-1)) and treatment CRO (577 kg ha(-1)). Fish production from the periphyton-based system was 2.8 times higher than that of the control. The addition of 15% kalbaush (i.e. a stocking ratio of 12:8:3 rohu-catla-kalbaush) at a total stocking density of 11 500 juveniles ha(-1) resulted in a further 40% increase in production and is an appropriate combination in a periphyton-based polyculture system. The stable nitrogen and carbon isotopes ratio indicated that rohu grazed on periphyton, whereas catla depended on planktonic food organisms. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

To meet the needs and constraints in river basin management, the nitrogen model was developed following the concept of minimum information requirement (MIR). The modelling concept uses only few calibration parameters and only easily accessible input data. Water balance, runoff generation and nitrogen transport were simulated on a 1-km(2) grid of sub-areas in which different land-use classes and soil characteristics were accounted. Temporal variability of the storage of mobile nitrogen were described using a monthly based mass balance. Nitrogen mobilization and transport was simulated using monthly values of different runoff components and data for soil properties, topography, hydrogeology and river network. The simulation was calibrated and validated using streamflow from two gauging stations and observed nitrogen concentrations at the catchment outlet, showing reasonable results for both streamflow and nitrogen dynamics. The results of the model application are discussed in the context of uncertainty problems and their implications for water management.

Therefore, it is important to analyze quantitatively the interaction of nutrients on the sediment in a clayey canal. In this paper, the COD, nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes as well as elution and removal rates across/on the sediment surface were estimated based on hydraulic model experiments. The experiments were carried out for water under aerobic conditions at 30-32degreesC (CASE 1) and 6-9degreesC (CASE 2). In CASE 1, the net COD elution rate and the net phosphorus elution rate were 8.2 mg.m(-2).day(-1) and 11.5 mg.m(-2).day(-1), respectively. Nitrogen was removed by nitrification on the sediment surface so that the net removal rate which is composed of the denitrification rate, the settling rate and the elution rate was 15.1 mg.m(-2).day(-1). The rate constant in which the nitrogen removal is expressed as a first-order kinetic was 0.010 m/day. In CASE 2, the net COD elution rate and the net phosphorus elution rate were 9.9 mg.m(-2).day(-1) and 5.4 mg.m(-2).day(-1), respectively. The net nitrogen removal rate and its rate constant were 9.0 mg.m(-2).day(-1) and 0.0023 m/day, respectively. The rates of elution and removal increased remarkably with the temperature.

J	Mathews, LG; Homans, FR; Easter, KW				Mathews, LG; Homans, FR; Easter, KW			Estimating the benefits of phosphorus pollution reductions: An application in the Minnesota River	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						economics; nonpoint source pollution; water policy/regulation/decision making; water quality	CONTINGENT BEHAVIOR DATA; NONMARKET GOODS; TRAVEL COST; VALUATION; DEMAND	In order to make economically efficient decisions about water quality improvements, data on both the costs and benefits of these improvements is needed. However, there has been little research on the benefits of reducing phosphorus pollution which implies that policy decisions are not able to make the comparison of costs and benefits that is essential for economic efficiency. This research attempts to ameliorate this situation by providing an estimate of the benefits of a 40 percent reduction in phosphorus pollution in the Minnesota River. A 1997 mail survey gathered information on Minnesota residents' use of a recreational site on the Minnesota River, the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge, and their willingness to pay for phosphorus reductions in the Minnesota River. The random effects probit model used in this research to investigate household willingness to pay for phosphorus pollution reductions in the Minnesota River incorporates recent innovations in nonmarket valuation methodology by using both revealed and stated preference data. This model estimated annual household willingness to pay for phosphorus reductions in the Minnesota River at $140. These results may be used in combination with cost estimates to determine the economic efficiency of phosphorus clean up.

Three agricultural uses and four alternative uses are evaluated. A net present value approach is used to compare economic impacts of uses of draws and APEX is used to evaluate the interaction between a woody draw and the contributing upland area and simulate the environmental impacts of uses of draws in the field. The study shows that relative to agricultural uses, alternative uses of draws have significant environmental benefits in terms of reducing surface runoff and sediment and associated pollutants, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and pesticides. Agricultural uses of draws are not always the most profitable option. Certain alternatives, such as curly willow and the mixed buffer, are highly profitable. Agricultural landscapes could be differentially managed to achieve both economic variability and environmental benefits. Government support is necessary to promote alternative uses of woody draws. The support can be in the form of CRP payments or market development of buffer products. Farmers and resource managers can use study results to manage woody draws and evaluate the merits of alternative policies for managing woody draws.

Humans have extensively altered those processes in North America, with serious consequences for aquatic ecosystems. We collected data on Upper Tennessee River tributaries in North Carolina to: (1) compare landuse and landscape geomorphology with respect to their ability to explain variation in water quality, sedimentation measures, and large woody debris; (2) determine if landscape change over time contributed significantly to explaining present stream conditions; and (3) assess the importance of spatial scale in examining landuse influences on streams. Stream variables were related to both landuse and landscape geomorphology. Forest cover accounted for the most variation in nearly all models, supporting predictions of nutrient enrichment, thermal pollution, and sedimentation caused by landscape disturbance. Legacy effects from past catchment disturbance were apparent in sedimentation measures. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, as well as stream temperature, were lower where riparian buffers had reforested. Models of stream physicochemistry fit better when predictors were catchment wide rather than more localized (i.e., within 2 km of a site). Cumulative impacts to streams due to changes in landuse must be managed from a watershed perspective with quantitative models that integrate across scales.

J	Bergman, MJ; Green, W; Donnangelo, LJ				Bergman, MJ; Green, W; Donnangelo, LJ			Calibration of storm loads in the South Prong watershed, Florida, using BASINS/HSPF	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						pollution modeling; storm loads; Total Suspended Solids (TSS); Total Phosphorus (TP); Total Nitrogen (TN); HSPF; BASINS; watershed modeling		The South Prong watershed is a major tributary system of the Sebastian River and adjacent Indian River Lagoon. Continued urbanization of the Sebastian River drainage basin and other watersheds of the Indian River Lagoon is expected to increase runoff and nonpoint source pollutant loads. The St. Johns River Water Management District developed watershed simulation models to estimate potential impacts on the ecological systems of receiving waters and to assist planners in devising strategies to prevent further degradation of water resources. In the South Prong system, a storm water sampling program was carried out to calibrate the water quality components of the watershed model for total suspended solids (TSS), total phosphorous (TP), and total nitrogen (TN). During the period of May to November 1999, water quality and flow data were collected at three locations within the watershed. Two of the sampling stations were located at the downstream end of major watercourses. The third station was located at the watershed outlet. Five storm events were sampled and measured at each station. Sampling was conducted at appropriate intervals to represent the rising limb, peak, and recession limb of each storm event. The simulations were handled by HSPF (Hydrologic Simulation Program-Fortran). Results include calibration of the hydrology and calibration of the individual storm loads. The hydrologic calibration was continuous over the period 1994 through 1999. Simulated storm runoff, storm loads, and event mean concentrations were compared with their corresponding observed values. The hydrologic calibration showed good results. The outcome of the individual storm calibrations was mixed. Overall, however, the simulated storm loads agreed reasonably well with measured loads for a majority of the storms.

Earthen ponds (10 x 7.5 m) were provided with an artificial substrate constructed from poles of either bamboo, kanchi or hizol tree branches (1.0 m(2) artificial substrate per m, pond surface). Higher periphyton biomass, in terms of dry matter (DM) (4.9 mg cm(-2)) and chlorophyll a (11.5 mug m(-2)) developed on hizol and bamboo, respectively. Periphyton ash content was higher on hizol (41%) than on the other two substrate types (29%). Protein content of the periphyton growing on bamboo (38% of ash-free dry matter (AFDM)) was 50% higher than that on the other two substrate types. Maximum periphyton productivities of 1.01, 1.38 and 1.03 g C m(-2) d(-1) were obtained for bamboo, hizol and kanchi substrates, respectively. Taxonomic composition of periphyton showed a rapid development of a relatively stable community with few differences between the substrate types. In total, 56 genera of algal periphyton and 35 genera of phytoplankton were identified.

J	Burian, SJ; McPherson, TN; Brown, MJ; Streit, GE; Turin, HJ				Burian, SJ; McPherson, TN; Brown, MJ; Streit, GE; Turin, HJ			Modeling the effects of air quality policy changes on water quality in urban areas	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT			English	Article						water quality; air quality; stormwater; airshed; watershed management; modeling	DRY DEPOSITION; NITROGEN; CALIFORNIA; POLLUTION; FUGACITY	This paper describes the development and application of an integrated modeling framework composed of an urban air chemistry model, an urban runoff model, and a water-quality model. The models were linked to simulate the fate and transport of air emissions of nitrogen compounds in the air, urban watershed, surface water runoff, and in a coastal receiving-water body. The model linkage is demonstrated by evaluating the potential water quality implications of reducing NOx emissions by 32%, volatile organic compound emissions by 51%, and ammonia emissions by 30%, representing changes from 1987 levels to proposed 2000 target levels in Los Angeles, California, USA. Simulations of the Los Angeles dry season during the summer of 1987 (June 1 to August 31) indicated that by reducing emissions from 1987 to proposed year 2000 levels, the dry deposition nitrogen loads to Santa Monica Bay and the Ballona Creek watershed were reduced 21.4% and 15.0%, respectively. Water quality modeling results indicated that dry season atmospheric load reductions to the Ballona Creek Estuary did not reduce chlorophyll-a levels or significantly raise nighttime dissolved oxygen levels because the magnitude of the reductions was negligible compared to non-atmospheric inputs of nitrogen compounds. Simulations of the time period from November 18, 1987 to December 4, 1987 during the Los Angeles wet season indicated that air emissions reductions produced an 18.6% reduction in the dry deposition nitrogen load to Santa Monica Bay, a 15.5% reduction in the dry deposition nitrogen load to the Ballona Creek watershed, a 16.8% reduction in the wet deposition nitrogen load to the Ballona Creek watershed, and a 16.1% reduction in the stormwater discharge load from the Ballona Creek watershed. Although the wet season load reductions are significant, modeling results of the ultimate effect on the Ballona Creek Estuary water quality were inconclusive.

J	Scalenghe, R; Edwards, AC; Marsan, FA; Barberis, E				Scalenghe, R; Edwards, AC; Marsan, FA; Barberis, E			The effect of reducing conditions on the solubility of phosphorus in a diverse range of European agricultural soils	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article							MALACHITE GREEN; PHOSPHATE	The effects of reducing conditions on solubility of phosphorus (P) can directly influence water quality. The release of P is enhanced although the P is not directly involved in reduction processes. We here compare the responses to flooding of 12 overfertilized agricultural soils in widely varying pedological and management regimes, belonging to seven World Reference Base groups. The redox potential initially ranged from 305 to 515 mV and decreased to - 157 to - 195 mV within 32 days. The onset of reducing conditions led to an increase in the concentration of soluble P. The maximum rate of solubilization occurred within 1-3 weeks under reducing conditions, and the steady-state concentrations of P never exceeded 200 mumol dm(-3). Four stages in the development of the reduction process are identified, and a simple empirical model describes the change in concentrations of soluble P. The potential of P release under reduction is positively correlated with the soil saturation with P. Flooding over a few weeks triggered the release of large amounts of P. Constant pe + pH is related to constant concentration of molybdate-reactive P, suggesting that soluble P is effectively buffered so that P will be immobilized. In general the solubilization of P under reducing conditions is likely to be aggravated by the increased soil P status that has resulted from overfertilization of agricultural land with P. These findings bear on the establishment and long-term effectiveness of riparian buffer zones where phosphorus is likely to accumulate by the interception of drainage.

J	Olsen, Y				Olsen, Y			MARICULT Research Programme: background, status and main conclusions	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						MARICULT Programme; sustainable exploitation; food web; resources; environment	FISH PRODUCTION; MYTILUS-EDULIS; FOOD; FERTILIZATION; GROWTH	The human population is expected to reach about 10 billion by 2050, and it can be questioned how we can provide the food and the essential nutrients that will be needed. The ultimate goal of MARICULT was to provide a basis for the evaluation of environmental constraints and the potential for increased sustainable provision of food, raw materials and energy from the ocean. The Programme has primarily addressed fundamental questions on the marine ecosystem, because new concepts of harvesting and mariculture must be based on knowledge, and the environmental impact of new concepts should always be elaborated together with their production potential. The work has involved studies of food web structure and its functioning in the marine ecosystem as well as more applied research and testing of concepts for increasing the harvesting potential. There is a relatively tight connection between the nutrient supply rate and the primary production of phytoplankton, but the response of single species of animals is less predictable, especially for single populations on high trophic levels. There is, however, an empirical positive relationship between nutrient supply and secondary production, including fishery yields, on a regional scale. The low contribution of fisheries and aquaculture to human food compared to the contribution by agriculture is due to the fact that we primarily exploit first and higher carnivores. The general strategy to increase the marine harvesting potential is therefore to harvest and cultivate organisms at lower trophic levels. A number of harvesting and production concepts that may allow enhanced availability of marine resourses are proposed. These involve (1) harvesting of herbivore zooplankton resources, (2) cultivation of benthic, herbivore/omnivore animals, (3) enhancement of production potential by the creation of artificial up-welling systems, (4) strategic fertilization or use of available nutrient resources, and (5) further exploitation of biomass from macro-algae. All concepts involve harvesting or cultivation at low trophic levels, and some may readily be combined. It is important to note that some methods are not feasible for all coastal regions. In spite of great similarities, there are some clear differences in how the ecosystems react to enhanced nutrients in European marginal seas (Baltic Sea, Mediterranean Sea) and in Atlantic waters. Negative ecological effects caused by enhanced nutrient supply to pelagic ecosystems may occur if the primary production is not being grazed efficiently by zooplankton or benthic grazers. Dispersion by advection or retention in deepwater are important modifying factors. Loss of integrity in food web function seem to occur above a certain nutrient loading rate, suggesting a critical nutrient-loading rate for the maintenance of food web integrity. The Programme has contributed to a conceptual platform for assessment criteria of the state of the ecosystem and the water quality in pelagic coastal waters that are potential components in nutrient management models. The western principles of removing nutrient wastes from biological cycling is hardly sustainable. The counter-measure strategy that is still not explored and implemented is to reduce the ecological effects of uncontrolled nutrient emission in the coastal zone by using these nutrients for mariculture production. A more holistic ecological view in management and resource exploitation, where we recognize that we are also components in the ecosystem, is well accepted in eastern Asian countries, but not in the West.

The model consists of three interacting components (terrestrial, hydrodynamic and biological submodels), which are used to evaluate the likely environmental impact of various economic development scenarios. Multicriteria Analysis combines the model outputs with socioeconomic values for the coast and through assignment of different weights/priorities by the user provides a ranking system for these scenarios. The Gulf of Gera, Island of Lesvos, Greece, a semi-enclosed and shallow system surrounded by a cultivated and inhabited watershed, was used as a case study for this method. Four scenarios concerning the development of tourism, the construction of agricultural greenhouses, the cultivation of woody plant species and the development of animal husbandry were tested against the present condition of the watershed (which is primarily dominated by olive oil production). The trade-off between increased profits and environmental impacts for these development scenarios was illustrated using Cluster and Principal Component Analysis. The results of these analyses showed that tourism and animal husbandry balance profits and environmental degradation most effectively and represent the most favorable future development strategies for the study area. The present approach can be used as a supportive tool for policy-planners and decision-makers to quantify interrelated socio-economic and environmental issues for the sustainable development of coastal areas.

This study evaluated agronomic and environmental soil tests for predicting P losses in water leaching from undisturbed soils. Intact soil columns were collected for five soil types that had a wide range in soil test P. The columns were leached with deionized water, the leachate analyzed for dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), and the soils analyzed for water-soluble phosphorus (WSP), 0.01 M CaCl2 P (CaCl2-P), iron-strip phosphorus (FeO-P), and Mehlich-1 and Mehlich-3 extractable P, Al, and Fe. The Mehlich-3 P saturation ratio (M3-PSR) was calculated as the molar ratio of Mehlich-3 extractable P/[Al + Fe]. Leachate DRP was frequently above concentrations associated with eutrophication. For the relationship between DRP in leachate and all of the soil tests used, a change point was determined, below which leachate DRP increased slowly per unit increase in soil test P, and above which leachate DRP increased rapidly. Environmental soil tests (WSP, CaClz-P, and FeO-P) were slightly better at predicting leachate DRP than agronomic soil tests (Mehlich-1 P, Mehlich-3 P, and the M3-PSR), although the M3-PSR was as good as the environmental soil tests if two outliers were omitted. Our results support the development of Mehlich-3 P and M3-PSR categories for profitable agriculture and environmental protection; however, to most accurately characterize the risk of P loss from soil to water by leaching, soil P testing must be fully integrated with other site properties and P management practices.

The objective of this study was to compare recently published approaches for relating terrestrial N inputs to the Mississippi River basin (MRB) with measured nitrate flux in the lower Mississippi River. Nitrogen inputs to and outputs from the MRB (1951 to 1996) were estimated from state-level annual agricultural production statistics and NOy (inorganic oxides of N) deposition estimates for 20 states that comprise 90% of the MRB. A model with water yield and gross N inputs accounted for 85% of the variation in observed annual nitrate flux in the lower Mississippi River, from 1960 to 1998, but tended to underestimate high nitrate flux and overestimate low nitrate flux. A model that used water yield and net anthropogenic nitrogen inputs (NANI) accounted for 95% of the variation in riverine N flux. The NANI approach accounted for N harvested in crops and assumed that crop harvest in excess of the nutritional needs of the humans and livestock in the basin would be exported from the basin. The U.S. White House Committee on Natural Resources and Environment (CENR) developed a more comprehensive N budget that included estimates of ammonia volatilization, denitrification, and exchanges with soil organic matter. The residual N in the CENR budget was weakly and negatively correlated with observed riverine nitrate flux. The CENR estimates of soil N mineralization and immobilization suggested that there were large (2000 kg N ha(-1)) net losses of soil organic N between 1951 and 1996. When the CENR N budget was modified by assuming that soil organic N levels have been relatively constant after 1950, and ammonia volatilization losses are redeposited within the basin, the trend of residual N closely matched temporal variation in NANI and was positively correlated with riverine nitrate flux in the lower Mississippi River. Based on results from applying these three modeling approaches, we conclude that although the NANI approach does not address several processes that influence the N cycle, it appears to focus on the terms that can be estimated with reasonable certainty and that are correlated with riverine N flux.

J	Sekely, AC; Mulla, DJ; Bauer, DW				Sekely, AC; Mulla, DJ; Bauer, DW			Streambank slumping and its contribution to the phosphorus and suspended sediment loads of the Blue Earth River, Minnesota	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						phosphorus load; sediment load; streambank stumping; suspended sediment; topographic surveying	BANK EROSION; LAKE PEPIN; WATERSHEDS; MAGNITUDE	Suspended sediment transported in river systems has the ability to degrade water quality and impart negative impacts downstream as material is deposited. This study examines the significance of valley wait stumping as a source of both suspended sediment and phosphorus in the Blue Earth River. Several streambanks on the Blue Earth River in south central Minnesota were repeatedly surveyed from 1997 to 2000 to determine annual rates of streambank stumping. Volumetric changes between digital elevation models from successive topographic surveys were converted into changes in mass, and, subsequently, annual erosion rates were calculated based on surface area. An erosion rate constant was derived based on surface area of surveyed sites and applied to an inventory of eroding escarpments along the entire river to estimate the contribution of streambank stumping to the total suspended sediment (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP) loads in the Blue Earth River. Erosion rates for surveyed sites ranged from 544 to 3,995 t ha(-1) yr(-1) (242 to 1,782 tons ac(-1) yr(-1)), with an average rate Of 21154 t ha-1 yr-1 (961 tons ac-1 yr-1). The derived erosion rate constant for slumping sites was 0.23 t m(-2) yr(-1) (0.024 tons ft(-2) yr(-1)). Between 75,804 and 106,213 t (83,536 to 117,047 U.S. tons) of sediment is delivered to the river annually from all eroding escarpments inventoried, with between 28,047 and 39,299 t (30,908 and 43,307 U.S. tons) transported by flow as TSS. Streambank slumping accounts for 31% to 44% of the TSS toad at the mouth of the Blue Earth River. The percentage of the TP load originating from streambank stumping is estimated to be from 7% to 10%, with annual contributions Of 12 to 17 t P (14 to 19 U.S. tons).

The concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl) is found to be the preferred indicator of trophic state. The concentration of total phosphorus and clarity are compromised as trophic indicators in this system because of the contributions of inanimate particles (tripton) to these measures associated with the hydrology and morphometry of the lake and the occurrence of the whiting phenomenon. A Before-After-Control-Impact design is used to assess the ability of the monitoring program to detect potential impacts associated with operation of the cooling water facility. Statistical power analyses conducted with the pre-operational monitoring data indicate the current bi-weekly sampling program will detect a 30% change in Chi with a probability of 0.7. Attributing causation of any future change in Chl coincident with the start-up and operation of the cooling water facility is problematic because of potential confounding effects associated with variation in phosphorus loading from wastewater treatment facilities, natural variation in meteorological conditions, and water quality changes associated with zebra mussel populations.

However, accurate estimates of these variables using standard ocean color algorithms have been difficult due to the complex nature of the light field in these environments. In this study, we process SeaWiFS satellite data using two recently developed algorithms; one for atmospheric correction and the other a semi-. analytic bio-optical algorithm and compare the results with standard SeaWiFS algorithms. Overall, the two algorithms produced more realistic estimates of Chl and CDOM distributions in Florida Shelf and Bay waters. Estimates of surface salinity were obtained from the CDOM absorption field assuming a conservative mixing behavior of these Waters. A comparison of SeaWiFS-derived Chl and CDOM absorption with field measurements in the Florida Bay indicated that although well correlated, CDOM was underestimated, while Chl was overestimated. Bottom reflectance appeared to affect these estimates at the shallow central Bay stations during the winter. These results demonstrate the need for new bio-optical algorithms or tuning of the parameters used in the bio-optical, algorithm for local conditions encountered in the Bay.

J	Finlay, BJ; Monaghan, EB; Maberly, SC				Finlay, BJ; Monaghan, EB; Maberly, SC			Hypothesis: The rate and scale of dispersal of freshwater diatom species is a function of their global abundance	PROTIST			English	Article							PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITY; WATER-QUALITY; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; FLORIDA EVERGLADES; NUTRIENT GRADIENT; TROPICAL RIVER; LOWLAND RIVER; NATIONAL-PARK; COSTA-RICA; BODY-SIZE	We have analysed the geographical records of a representative selection of extant diatom species from a freshwater pond. The more often a species is recorded in the ecological literature, the greater is its apparent global distribution. One explanation is that the frequently recorded species are globally abundant, whereas species that are infrequently recorded are globally rare. We suggest a model in which random dispersal is the dominant force driving large-scale distribution of species, with the rate and scale of dispersal largely determined by global population size. Thus species that are locally rare or abundant are likewise rare or abundant worldwide. It is predicted that many of the rarer diatom species will, with additional sampling effort, be shown to have wide geographical distribution, but this requires intensive studies focused on revealing species that are normally cryptic. The argument in favour of endemic diatom species is untenable, because it is not possible to disprove their existence elsewhere in the biosphere.

The field was managed to produce summer corn and winter wheat. Commercial fertilizer, the herbicide atrazine, and the insecticide carbofuran were applied to the field in 1993, 1994, and 1995. Average annual application rates were 266 kg nitrogen ha(-1), 2.5 kg atrazine ha(-1), and 2.4 kg carbofuran ha(-1). Monthly soil-water and groundwater samples were collected. The samples were analyzed for nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), chloride, atrazine, carbofuran, and deethylatrazine (DEA). Soil-water and groundwater samples indicated elevated NO3--N concentrations (>5 ppm) in the vadose zone at 4.3 m and in the aquifer at 10 m (> 4 ppm). Of the studied pesticides, carbofuran and DEA were observed at the greatest concentrations in groundwater. Both NO3--N and pesticides were transported during groundwater recharge following periods of excess precipitation. Peak pesticide concentrations in groundwater were observed in late 1994, driven by a large precipitation event in July of 1994 when 565 mm of rain fell over a 4-day period. Atrazine and carbofuran concentrations in groundwater did not exceed the EPA maximum contaminant levels of 3 ppb and 40 ppb, respectively. Spatially averaged concentrations observed in monthly groundwater collected directly below the field were well below these standards. Concentrations of NO3--N, atrazine, DEA, and carbofuran observed in groundwater from the on-field wells were significantly different from up-gradient and down-gradient concentrations (p = 0.05). These data indicate a significant impact to the local groundwater. Nitrate N was transported down-gradient from the field at the largest concentrations. Peak concentrations of atrazine and DEA were simultaneously observed in the groundwater, indicating similar transport rates for both compounds and rapid transformation from atrazine into DEA in the root-zone.

However, the radiological benefits of these measures may be accompanied by negative impacts on the environment. The aim of this work was to assess the impacts of selected countermeasures on water quality via losses of soil and phosphorus in river catchments in Scotland and Finland. Four countermeasures, suitable for different levels of radioactive deposition, were studied: deep ploughing, skim and burial ploughing, changes in the feeding of livestock and cessation of production. The assessments were performed using a deterministic mathematical simulation model capable of estimating the impact of changes in management practices and land use on the hydrology and on soil and phosphorus losses from land to water. Skim and burial ploughing had the least impacts. Deep ploughing generally reduced phosphorus losses but had variable effects on soil loss, which depended on the erodibility of the subsoil. Changes in the dairy feeding regime from roughage-dominated (local grass production) to more concentrates (local cereal production or imported) had variable impacts, depending on the local agricultural systems and management practices. The worst impacts on erosion and phosphorus losses may occur where large areas of grassland are converted to cereal production. Cessation of agricultural production resulted in large (50-90%) reductions in soil and phosphorus losses. The most recommended of the assessed countermeasures is skim and burial ploughing, but its wider use depends on the availability of specialized technical equipment.

J	Lode, T				Lode, T			An endangered species as indicator of freshwater quality: fractal diagnosis of fragmentation within a European mink, Mustela lutreola, population	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE			English	Article						pollution; water quality; indicator species; Mustela lutreola; fractal	CONSERVATION; DISPERSAL; DECLINE; LANDSCAPES; RANGES; MODELS	Decline of endangered species may be regarded as an indication of a deteriorating environment. European mink Mustela lutreola are freshwater predator populations which suffered a severe decline and are currently restricted to only two areas in Europe. A survey on distribution revealed that mink western population was highly fragmented. Watercourses occupied by mink significantly differed by their quality from watercourses where no mink were evidenced, with regard to most physicochemical parameters studied, organic and oxidizable matters, nitrogenous matters, phosphorus concentration, heavy metals, pesticides and other micropollutants, and hydrobiological quality. A Gaussian representation of mink breeding dispersal was performed and, based on a In-In regression analysis, the fractal dimension D provided an accurate quantitative evaluation of the subdivision level. As revealed by low fractal dimension (D = 1.40), subdivision within the mink population may be reaching a critical threshold for European mink conservation. Fractal investigation constitutes a resourceful method for relating environmental deterioration and breeding dispersal in endangered species. Moreover, mink were found to avoid some watercourses which still provide domestic water supplies for human people and the level of fragmentation should be seen as a warning of the deterioration of freshwater ecosystems.

J	Trepel, M; Palmeri, L				Trepel, M; Palmeri, L			Quantifying nitrogen retention in surface flow wetlands for environmental planning at the landscape-scale	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						weiland; environmental planning; decision making; nitrate removal; water quality; water policy; Germany; Baltic Sea	EUROPEAN PERSPECTIVE; UNITED-STATES; WATER; DENITRIFICATION; PHOSPHORUS; NUTRIENT; SYSTEMS; SHIELD; SEA	Surface flow wetlands are valued highly for their high nutrient retention potential and their unique biodiversity. At present, there are an increasing number of activities aimed at restoring these sites as multifunctional landscape entities. The success of wetland restoration is however clearly dependent on the site selection to achieve the specific restoration goals. This study first presents a tool to identify the Most Suitable areas for the restoration of surface flow wetlands for water quality improvement in a given catchment and secondly compares three different mathematical equations in order to quantify the effect of nitrogen retention when restoring the previously selected, most suitable wetland sites. For site selection, a score system was developed which is linked to a Geographical Information System. The score system combines information from a given catchment in eight data layers including soil substrate, actual land use, relief features, hierarchical drainage basin classification, river proximity and socio-economic factors. The score system was applied to a potential use Situation in the Neuwuhrener Au watershed (40 km(2)) in northern Germany belonging to the Baltic Sea drainage basin. Three areas were identified as most suitable for the restoration of surface flow wetlands, Their potential effect on nitrogen retention was evaluated using three different equations: (I) a linear relation between wetland load and a wetlands (II) an exponential equation between wetland load and wetland area: and (III) an exponential equation between wetland load and hydraulic retention time. The linear approach calculates increasing wetland retention with increasing upstream catchment area and appears to overestimate nitrogen retention in wetlands located more downstream, The two exponential equations calculated nitrogen retention in the three wetlands in the same order of magnitude. The results from the siting procedure and the prediction of nitrogen removal rates are useful for decision makers in wetland planning to base their decision on best available data and knowledge. The model comparison allows the incorporation of uncertainty in the decision progress which is seen as a necessary requirement when quantifying biological processes in environmental planning.

J	Schmidt, W; Willmitzer, H; Bornmann, K; Pietsch, J				Schmidt, W; Willmitzer, H; Bornmann, K; Pietsch, J			Production of drinking water from raw water containing cyanobacteria - Pilot plant studies for assessing the risk of microcystin breakthrough	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						cyanobacteria; Planktothrix rubescens; microcystins; drinking water; water treatment; modelling; risk assessment	SAMPLES; TOXINS; LR	Toxins in cyanobacteria are a recognized risk in the treatment of drinking-water treatment. Cyanotoxins can occur in two modifications: cell bound and dissolved in water. The process of toxin release may occur naturally, but it also may be induced through the processes of drinking-water treatment. Both causes of release are relevant to the safety of drinking water. This study investigated cyanotoxin release and elimination through different treatment trains in systematic pilot-scale studies with water from the Weida Reservoir, in Thuringia, Germany. The Weida Reservoir is a dimictic mesoeutrophic reservoir typical for a number of mountainous areas in Europe, with Planktothrix rubescens as the dominant phytoplankton species, and shows a characteristic seasonal pattern of population development and microcystin occurrence. To assess the risk of microcystin breakthrough, the pilot-scale results as well as results of laboratory-scale experiments were used for developing a kinetic model of toxin release in relation to elimination. By calculating removal efficiency of total microcystins (cell bound and dissolved) for different treatment trains, raw water quality was related to the quality targets for finished water, and breakthrough risks could be calculated for given treatment trains and varying cyanobacterial population densities in the reservoir.

J	Paerl, HW; Dennis, RL; Whitall, DR				Paerl, HW; Dennis, RL; Whitall, DR			Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen: Implications for nutrient over-enrichment of coastal waters	ESTUARIES			English	Review							NEUSE RIVER ESTUARY; DISSOLVED ORGANIC NITROGEN; WESTERN ATLANTIC-OCEAN; WET DEPOSITION; DRY DEPOSITION; CHESAPEAKE BAY; PHYTOPLANKTON COMMUNITIES; MARINE EUTROPHICATION; INORGANIC NITROGEN; TRANSPORT DISTANCE	Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (AD-N) is a significant source of nitrogen enrichment to nitrogen (N)-limited estuarine and coastal waters downwind of anthropogenic emissions. Along the eastern U.S. coast and eastern Gulf of Mexico, AD-N currently accounts for 10% to over 40% of new N loading to estuaries. Extension of the regional acid deposition model (RADM) to coastal shelf waters indicates that 11, 5.6, and 5.6 kg N ha(-1) may be deposited on the continental shelf areas of the northeastern U.S. coast, southeast U.S. coast, and eastern Gulf of Mexico, respectively. AD-N approximates or exceeds riverine N inputs in many coastal regions. From a spatial perspective, AD-N is a unique source of N enrichment to estuarine and coastal waters because, for a receiving water body, the airshed may exceed the watershed by 10-20 fold. AD-N may originate far outside of the currently managed watersheds. AD-N may increase in importance as a new N source by affecting waters downstream of the oligohaline and mesohaline estuarine nutrient filters where large amounts of terrestrially-supplied N are assimilated and denitrified. Regionally and globally, N deposition associated with urbanization (NOx, peroxyacetyl nitrate, or PAN) and agricultural expansion (NH4+ and possibly organic N) has increased in coastal airsheds. Recent growth and intensification of animal (poultry, swine, cattle) operations in the midwest and mid-Atlantic regions have led to increasing amounts of NH4+ emission and deposition, according to a three decadal analysis of the National Acid Deposition Program network. In western Europe, where livestock operations have dominated agricultural production for the better part of this century, NH4+ is the most abundant form of AD-N. AD-N deposition in the U.S. is still dominated by oxides of N (NOx) emitted from fossil fuel combustion; annual NH4+ deposition is increasing, and in some regions is approaching total NO3- deposition. In receiving estuarine and coastal waters, phytoplankton community structural and functional changes, associated water quality, and trophic and biogeochemical alterations (i.e., algal blooms, hypoxia, food web, and fisheries habitat disruption) are frequent consequences of N-driven eutrophication. Increases in and changing proportions of various new N sources regulate phytoplankton competitive interactions, dominance, and successional patterns. These quantitative and qualitative aspects of AD-N and other atmospheric nutrient sources (e.g., iron) may promote biotic changes now apparent in estuarine and coastal waters, including the proliferation of harmful algal blooms, with cascading impacts on water quality and fisheries.

J	Faeth, P; Greenhalgh, S				Faeth, P; Greenhalgh, S			Policy synergies between nutrient over-enrichment and climate change	ESTUARIES			English	Article								Surplus nitrogen from agricultural production is a leading cause of water quality problems in the U.S. It is also a source of nitrous oxide, the largest category of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. Any reduction in the amount of nitrogen lost from farming practices would produce significant benefits for both water quality and climate protection. Using a model of the U.S. agricultural sector we adapted to explore water quality and climate issues, we evaluate a variety of policy options for their impact on farm income and the environment. We find that policies to create markets for reductions in nitrogen lost to water or greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture would increase farm income while producing cost-effective environmental benefits.

J	Boesch, DF				Boesch, DF			Challenges and opportunities for science in reducing nutrient over-enrichment of coastal ecosystems	ESTUARIES			English	Article							GULF-OF-MEXICO; CHESAPEAKE BAY; WATER-QUALITY; MARINE EUTROPHICATION; MISSISSIPPI RIVER; CLIMATE-CHANGE; NITROGEN; TRENDS; IMPACT; HYPOXIA	Nutrient over-enrichment has resulted in major changes in the coastal ecosystems of developed nations in Europe, North America, Asia, and Oceania, mostly taking place over the narrow period of 1960 to 1980. Many estuaries and embayments are affected, but the effects of this eutrophication have been also felt over large areas of semi-enclosed seas including the Baltic, North, Adriatic, and Black Seas in Europe, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Seto Inland Sea in Japan. Primary production increased, water clarity decreased, food chains were altered, oxygen depletion of bottom waters developed or expanded, seagrass beds were lost, and harmful algal blooms occurred with increased frequency. This period of dramatic alteration of coastal ecosystems, mostly for the worse from a human perspective, coincided with the more than doubling of additions of fixed nitrogen to the biosphere from human activities, driven particularly by a more than 5-fold increase in use of manufactured fertilizers during that 20-year period. Nutrient over-enrichment often interacted synergistically with other human activities, such as overfishing, habitat destruction, and other forms of chemical pollution, in contributing to the widespread degradation of coastal ecosystems that was observed during the last half of the 20th century. Science was effective in documenting the consequences and root causes of nutrient over-enrichment and has provided the basis for extensive efforts to abate it, ranging from national statutes and regulations to multi-jurisdictional compacts under the Helsinki Commission for the Baltic Sea, the Oslo-Paris Commission for the North Sea, and the Chesapeake Bay Program, for example. These efforts have usually been based on a relatively arbitrary goal of reducing nutrient inputs by a certain percentage, without much understanding of how and when this would affect the coastal ecosystem. While some of these efforts have succeeded in achieving reductions of inputs of phosphorus and nitrogen, principally through treatment of point-source discharges, relatively little progress has been made in reducing diffuse sources of nitrogen. Second-generation management goals tend to be based on desired outcomes for the coastal ecosystem and determination of the load reductions needed to attain them, for example the Total Daily Maximum Load approach in the U.S. and the Water Framework Directive in the European Union. Science and technology are now challenged not just to diagnose the degree of eutrophication and its causes, but to contribute to its prognosis and treatment by determining the relative susceptibility of coastal ecosystems to nutrient over-enrichment, defining desirable and achievable outcomes for rehabilitation efforts, reducing nutrient sources, enhancing nutrient sinks, strategically targeting these efforts within watersheds, and predicting and observing responses in an adaptive management framework.

J	Zhang, YZ; Pulliainen, J; Koponen, S; Hallikainen, M				Zhang, YZ; Pulliainen, J; Koponen, S; Hallikainen, M			Application of an empirical neural network to surface water quality estimation in the Gulf of Finland using combined optical data and microwave data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							SYNTHETIC-APERTURE RADAR; THEMATIC MAPPER DATA; ATMOSPHERIC CORRECTION; IMAGING RADAR; OCEAN COLOR; COASTAL; MODEL; PHYTOPLANKTON; CHLOROPHYLL; SENSITIVITY	Since neural networks have been widely applied to the nonlinear transfer function approximation, we present an empirical neural network algorithm to estimate major parameters in surface waters from combined optical data and microwave data in the Gulf of Finland. Concurrent in situ surface water quality measurements, optical (Landsat TM) data and microwave (ERS-2 SAR) data were obtained in selected locations in August 1997. The TM and ERS-2 SAR data from locations of water samples were extracted and digital data were examined in numerous transformations. Although significant correlations were observed between digital data and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), suspended sediment concentration (SSC), turbidity (Turb), and Secchi disk depth (SDD), application of neural networks appears to yield a superior performance in modeling transfer functions in this study area. Here, an empirical neural network algorithm is applied to estimate the transfer functions between the major characteristics of surface waters and the satellite optical and microwave data. The results show that the estimation accuracy for major characteristics of surface waters using the neural network is much better than those from regression analysis. The results also indicate that microwave data can assist to improve the estimation of these characteristics. Therefore, it may be possible to develop surface water quality algorithms in which microwave data are used as supplementary data to optical observations. However, this improvement of optical data retrieval algorithm is limited in this case study. The technique still needs to be refined in detail in order to detect differences within the typical range of these water quality parameters found in the area under study.

J	Thiebaut, G; Guerold, F; Muller, S				Thiebaut, G; Guerold, F; Muller, S			Are trophic and diversity indices based on macrophyte communities pertinent tools to monitor water quality?	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						water quality; diversity indices; trophic indices; macrophyte communities	WEAKLY MINERALIZED STREAMS; INCREASING EUTROPHICATION; AQUATIC MACROPHYTES; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; SPECIES TRAITS; RUNNING WATERS; BIOINDICATORS; RIVER; ACIDIFICATION; SEQUENCE	Diversity and trophic indices based on macrophyte communities were calculated to test their pertinence to monitoring water quality in the Northern Vosges (NE of France). Highly significant correlations were found between the four tested chemical variables (bicarbonate, calcium, phosphorus and ammonium nitrogen) and trophic indices and between them and abundance and richness. Trophic indices and McIntosh's index appeared to be more effective in predicting water quality than diversity indices.

The sustainable management of water quality requires an appreciation of the temporal and spatial assessment of the resource, together with an identification of reference or natural conditions from which to determine change, and the elucidation of the drivers of change. Only through this integrated approach, can appropriate management strategies be developed and prioritised, bearing in mind that impacts may be decoupled from sources in both time and space. This paper highlights recent trends in water quality (from a hydrochemical perspective) with separation into three broad groups: rivers, lochs and estuaries. For rivers, a general reduction in concentration of determinants that are more indicative of urban point sources (phosphorus, ammonium, suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand etc.) is apparent, while in more agriculturally-dominated areas, an increase in concentration of solutes that are considered more diffuse in origin, (e.g. nitrate) is reported. The increasing contribution to total loads from diffuse pollutants is a priority area for both research and policy. Current scientific challenges are to define the most appropriate spatial context within which regional water quality issues can be monitored and managed. It is likely that future emphasis will be placed on making an initial ecoregion based grouping in conjunction with physically defined catchment, which will be used to quantify site-specific impacts. Such an organisational approach will provide a mechanism that enables a targeted monitoring strategy to be developed. This will allow the establishment of ecologically based targets for water quality, and an improved understanding the biogeochemistry of pollution reversibility and ecosystem recovery. It is also fundamental to the development of tools through which to predict the time scale and magnitude of any recovery, such that environmental benefit can be optimised against realistic socio-economic constraints. The inter-relations between water quality objectives and the development of legislation for water resources management in Europe are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Nutrient concentrations vary spatially and temporally with levels being highest under arable farming during the autumn and winter. Annual fluxes from the 14.5 km(2) catchment are estimated at 25.67 and 1.26 kg ha(-1) a(-1) for NO3-N and NH3-N, respectively, and 0.26 kg ha(-1) a(-1) for PO,-P. Hydrological controls exert a strong influence on both nutrient concentrations and fluxes. Over short timescales nutrient concentrations and fluxes are greatest during storm events when PO4-P and NH3-N are mobilized by overland flow in riparian areas, particularly where the soils have been compacted by livestock or farm machinery. Delivery of deeper soil water in subsurface storm flow, facilitated by agricultural under-drainage, provide large contributions of NO3-N on the recession limb of hydrological events. In contrast, groundwater inputs generally have lower NO3 concentrations implying that denitrification may be a pathway of N loss in the saturated zone. Approximately 75% of the N loss for the catchment occurs during the autumn and early winter when high flows dominate the hydrological regime. The close coupling of hydrological pathways and biogeochemical processes has major implications for catchment management strategies such as Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs) as it is likely that significant groundwater stores with long residence times will continue to cause N losses before water quality improvements become apparent.

J	Gallegos, CL; Neale, PJ				Gallegos, CL; Neale, PJ			Partitioning spectral absorption in case 2 waters: discrimination of dissolved and particulate components	APPLIED OPTICS			English	Article							DIFFUSE ATTENUATION COEFFICIENT; SUBMERSED AQUATIC VEGETATION; NATURAL PHYTOPLANKTON; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; RHODE RIVER; CHLOROPHYLL; ESTUARY; MATTER; VARIABILITY; NUTRIENTS	A series of three mathematical procedures is derived to discriminate the light absorption by phytoplankton, colored dissolved organic matter, and nonpigmented particulates in waters in which absorption is dominated by factors other than phytoplankton (i.e., case 2 waters). The procedures utilize normalized absorption cross-sectional spectra of the absorption components and matrix inversion to solve for the coefficients that scale the normalized spectra. The procedures differ in the amount of ancillary measurements incorporated to reduce the variability of the estimates. The procedure that incorporates no ancillary information is expected to be unbiased only over long time periods. Application of the procedures to a 15-day time series of continuously monitored data from the Rhode River, Maryland, revealed the presence of large (approximately twofold) changes in absorption at 440 nm over periods of a few hours. Hourly sampling over a 24-h period confirmed that the changes in measured optical coefficients corresponded to changes in water quality. Errors in estimates of absorption components were of a magnitude consistent with those observed in development of the procedures and confirmed the progressive improvement achieved by incorporation of additional information. Over the time period observed, changes in optical properties appeared to be driven by advective processes. (C) 2002 Optical Society of America.

J	Rice, RW; Izuno, FT; Garcia, RM				Rice, RW; Izuno, FT; Garcia, RM			Phosphorus load reductions under best management practices for sugarcane cropping systems in the Everglades Agricultural Area	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						organic soils; agricultural run-off water quality; phosphorus load; Everglades Agricultural Area; sugarcane; hydrologic variability; cumulative data distributions; South Florida		Stormwater run-off from the 290,000 ha Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) is directed into South Florida's Everglades wetland ecosystem. Concerns regarding run-off water quality and environmental impact led to a 1992 regulatory program which requires P levels in basin run-off be reduced by at least 25% relative to historic trends. Farmers must collectively achieve this annual basin-level target by implementing best management practices (BMPs) to reduce P levels in farm drainage waters. At the time, proposed BMP strategies were largely untested, and to what extent they might reduce farm-level P discharge trends (also poorly documented) was unknown. Given these uncertainties, objectives of this study were to: (1) document long-term drainage P trends for EAA sugarcane systems and (2) quantify BMP effects on-farm drainage P loading. In late-1992, discharge pumps at five farm sites (cropped to sugarcane, sugarcane-vegetables, and/or sugarcane-rice) were instrumented to collect water samples for P analysis during all drainage events throughout baseline (BL pre-BMP) and BMP operations. Highly variable rainfall distributions in the region strongly influence farm drainage requirements, thus, meaningful interpretations of water quality trends require hydrologic adjustment to P load data. Five rainfall-adjustment analyses were applied to the 6-year farm-level databases. Two analysis methods compared P load trends for the entire BL and BMP monitoring periods. In Method 1, unit area P load (UAL) to rainfall ratios (UAL:R) during BMP operations were 20.4-47.3% smaller across all five sites than those recorded during BL. In Method 2, slope coefficients describing cumulative UAL versus cumulative rainfall trends during BMPs were 14.9-25.0% smaller than BL slopes. The remaining three methods assessed data trends across five consecutive "water years" (WY). In Method 3, slope coefficients describing WY96-98 cumulative UAL versus rainfall distributions were 32.8% lower in magnitude relative to WY94. In Method 4, average UAL:R for the WY96-98 period were 31.0% smaller than for WY94. Basin-level P loads are calculated every WY by state water management regulators, using a hydrologic adjustment model calibrated to a historic load and rainfall database. During the first 3 years (WY96-98) of required BMP implementation, the basin recorded a 55% P load reduction, When this model was applied to the farm data (Method 5), farm P load reductions for WY96-98 averaged 59.7%. All five analytical methods confirm favorable P-reduction trends under recommended BMP strategies for EAA sugarcane-based cropping systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Schilling, KE				Schilling, KE			Chemical transport from paired agricultural and restored prairie watersheds	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							CONSTITUENT LOADS; SURFACE WATERS; NITROGEN; QUALITY; NITRATE; PHOSPHORUS; POLLUTION; STREAMS; FLOW; IOWA	A five-year record of streamflow and chemical sampling data was evaluated to assess the effects of large-scale prairie restoration on transport of NO3-N, Cl, and SO4 loads from paired 5000-ha watersheds located in Jasper County, Iowa. Water quality conditions monitored during land use conversion from row crop agriculture to native prairie in the Walnut Creek watershed were compared with a highly agricultural control watershed (Squaw Creek). Combining hydrograph separation with a load estimation program, baseflow and stormflow loads of NO3-N, Cl, and SO4 were estimated at upstream and downstream sites on Walnut Creek and a downstream site on Squaw Creek. Chemical export in both watersheds was found to occur primarily with baseflow, with baseflow transport greatest during the late summer and fall. Lower Walnut Creek watershed, which contained the restored prairie areas, exported less NO3-N and Cl compared with upper Walnut Creek and Squaw Creek watersheds. Average How-weighted concentrations of NO3-N exceeded 10 mg/L in upper Walnut Creek and Squaw Creek, but were estimated to be 6.6 mg/L in lower Walnut Creek. Study results demonstrate the utility of partitioning loads into baseflow and stormflow components to identify sources of pollutant loading to streams.

J	Sheeder, SA; Lynch, JA; Grimm, J				Sheeder, SA; Lynch, JA; Grimm, J			Modeling atmospheric nitrogen deposition and transport in the Chesapeake Bay watershed	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							RETENTION; INPUTS; LAKES	Atmospheric deposition of nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen has been identified as a major factor in the decline of water quality in the Chesapeake Bay. Reports have indicated that atmospheric deposition may account for 25 to 80% of the total nitrogen load entering the bay. However, uncertainties exist regarding the accuracy of the atmospheric deposition inputs, nitrogen retention coefficients, and in-stream nutrient uptake rates used in these studies. This project was designed to reassess the potential inputs of atmospheric nitrogen deposition to the bay through the use of a high-resolution wet deposition model, improved wet and dry deposition and nutrient retention estimates, existing soils and land use data, and geographic information systems software. Model results indicate that the methods used in previous studies may overestimate the contribution of atmospheric nitrate and ammonium deposition to the Chesapeake Bay watershed (CBW). Wet and dry atmospheric nitrate and ammonium nitrogen deposition estimates to the CBW ranged from 52.7 to 141.9 and 41.9 to 60.1 million kg/yr, respectively, between 1984 and 1996. Dry and total atmospheric deposition loads to the watershed are substantially less than previous estimates. Estimates of the percent contribution of atmospherically deposited nitrogen to the Chesapeake Bay represent between 20 and 32% of the total nitrate and ammonium nitrogen load to the watershed from all nitrogen sources. While these estimates are lower than many other published estimates, regression analysis of model parameters, nitrogen retention coefficients, output, and measured in-stream nitrogen loads indicate that the calculated nitrogen loads may still be too high.

J	Fierer, NG; Gabet, EJ				Fierer, NG; Gabet, EJ			Carbon and nitrogen losses by surface runoff following changes in vegetation	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							COASTAL SAGE SCRUB; RAINFALL SIMULATION; SOIL-EROSION; TRANSPORT; WATERSHEDS; NUTRIENTS; IMPACT; CRUSTS	Rainfall simulation experiments were conducted on annual grassland and coastal sage scrub hillslopes to determine the quantities of C and N removed by surface runoff in sediment and solution. Undisturbed coastal sage scrub soils have very high infiltration capacities (>140 mm h(-1)), preventing the generation of surface runoff. Trampling disturbance to the sage scrub plots dramatically reduced infiltration capacities, increasing the potential for surface runoff and associated nutrient loss. Infiltration capacities in the grassland plots (30-50 mm h(-1)) were lower than in the sage scrub plots. Loss rates of dissolved C and N in surface runoff from grasslands were 0.5 and 0.025 mg m(-1) s(-1) respectively, with organic N accounting for more than 50% of the dissolved N. Total dissolved losses with simulated rainfall were higher than losses in simulations with just surface runoff, demonstrating the importance of raindrop impact in transferring solutes into the How. Experimental data were incorporated into a numerical model of runoff and sediment transport to estimate hillslope-scale sediment-bound nutrient losses from grasslands. According to the model results, sediment-bound nutrient losses are sensitive to the density of vegetation cover and rainfall intensity. The model estimates annual losses in surface runoff of 0.2 and 0.02 g m(-1) for sediment-bound C and N, respectively. The results of this study suggest that conversion of coastal sage scrub to annual grasslands increases hill-slope nutrient losses and may affect stream water quality in the region.

This methodology was applied on the gulf of Gera, Island of Lesvos, Greece, a semi-enclosed and shallow ecosystem surrounded by an intensively cultivated watershed. The simulation of biological and chemical processes in the water column was focused on the interactions of inorganic nutrients, primary producers and organic matter. The hydrodynamic behaviour of the area was estimated by the combination of the Princeton Ocean Model and a multiple-box mass balance approach in order to describe the tidal hydraulic regime. The estimation of nutrient fluxes due to non-point sources was based on a modification of the unit-mass response functions. The results have shown that nutrient loading from agricultural runoff could be considerable after episodic rainfall events, resulting in an increase of the nutrient stock from 40% to 60%. The responses of the primary producers are regulated from weather conditions of the following period and the residence time of excessive nutrient loads within the gulf that ranges from a time span of less than 10 days to 1 month period. The good fit between simulated and experimental data supports the view that this integrated modelling approach should be considered as a realistic reproduction of the dynamics of coastal marine ecosystems and be used for testing various scenarios concerning their sustainability.

J	Wang, E; Harman, WL; Williams, JR; Sweeten, JM				Wang, E; Harman, WL; Williams, JR; Sweeten, JM			Profitability and nutrient losses of alternative manure application strategies with conservation tillage	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						conservation tillage; economics; environment; manure; net present return; nutrient accumulations; nutrient loss; water quality	WATER-QUALITY; CORN; ABATEMENT; SYSTEMS	Profitability and nutrient loss in runoff and sediment of alternative manure utilization strategies integrated with conservation tillage in irrigated agriculture were examined for the Tierra Blanca Creek watershed in the central Texas panhandle. Average and maximum nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses in runoff and tong-term accumulations of P in the topsoil were simulated. These factors were considered to be environmental indicators of water and soil quality when applying manure and commercial fertilizers. Costs and profitability of alternative manure management strategies were compared to determine how to best safeguard the environment while maximizing profits. The study found that both objectives could be achieved with the application of N fertilizer combined with a reduced manure rate using conservation tillage to eliminate following. A sensitivity analysis of the price of anhydrous ammonia indicated that a 50% increase would, however, reduce the profitability of this strategy to less than that of the two all-manure utilization strategies.

J	Woli, KP; Nagumo, T; Hatano, R				Woli, KP; Nagumo, T; Hatano, R			Evaluating impact of land use and N budgets on stream water quality in Hokkaido, Japan	NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS			English	Article						impact factor; livestock density; N budget; point source pollution; water quality	NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS; NITROGEN; GROUNDWATER; AGRICULTURE; LOSSES	This study was conducted to evaluate the impact of land use system and N loadings to the environment estimated from N budgets on quality of stream water in Hokkaido, Japan. A case study was carried out in three towns of southern Hokkaido, which are Shiraoi, Yakumo, and Shizunai, characterized by intensive poultry farming (IPF), dairy cattle farming (DCF), and race horse farming (RHF), respectively. The estimation of N budgets using an N flow model indicated that the highest disposal N (880 Mg N yr(-1)) was generated in the IPF town and it resulted in 250 kg ha(-1)yr(-1) surplus N in croplands. The disposal N was much lower in the DCF and the RHF town (102 and 71 Mg N yr(-1), respectively) than that of the IPF town. Cropland surplus N in DCF town was 31 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1), whereas RHF town had negative N balance. The linear regression analysis indicated that NO3-N concentration in stream water was significantly correlated with the proportion of upland field in drainage basins. The regression slopes varied among the towns, and it was the highest for IPF (0.040), intermediate for DCF (0.023) and the lowest for RHF town (0.006). The multiple regression analysis showed that regression slopes were significantly correlated (R-2 = 0.77 at 5% level) with livestock disposal N and cropland surplus N. Therefore, we assumed that these regression lines were the baselines for non-point source pollution, and the regression slopes were determined to act as impact factors of stream water quality. However, two sampling sites in the IPF area were scattered above the baseline. This fact strongly suggests that the area was affected by point source pollution.

EPIC has been tested and validated under a wide range of conditions; however, there is an ongoing need to further test the model to improve its prediction capabilities. In this study, EPIC was calibrated and validated using 3 years (1990-1992) of data collected from a field site near Nashua, Iowa. The model's performance was evaluated by assessing its ability to replicate the effects of various tillage and crop rotation systems on subsurface tile flow, nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) loss with tile flow, and crop yield. Predicted annual average tile flows and nitrate losses in the tile flows were generally within 10% of measured values; the major exceptions were errors of 19.3% and 58.3% predicted for tile flow and nitrate loss for a no-tilled corn-soybean rotation system: Comparisons of monthly predictions with measured values resulted in r(2) values between 0.67 and 0.89 for the tile flows and 0.60 to 0.83 for the associated nitrate losses in the tile. flows. Paired t-tests that accounted for tillage and crop rotation effects on tile flow and nitrate losses showed that EPIC was in agreement with observed values in 11 out of 14 comparisons. However, EPIC showed a limited capability to reproduce tillage and crop rotation effects on crop yield, similar to results found in several previous studies. Further testing-of EPIC is needed to refine and improve the model's performance under conditions similar to those at the Nashua site.

J	Park, SS; Lee, YS				Park, SS; Lee, YS			A water quality modeling study of the Nakdong River, Korea	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						water quality model; river; QUAL2E; denitrification; eutrophication		A water quality modeling study was performed for water quality management of large river systems where autochthonous sources and denitrification play an important role in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and nitrogen dynamics. The model was based on the USEPA's QUALM and several modifications were made in the computer code to overcome limitations of QUALM. This paper outlines changes which were made in the model in addressing some of water quality problems and demonstrates the model application to the Nakdong River, Korea. The changes include the modification of computational structure and the addition of new constituent interactions, such as conversion of algal death to BOD, denitrification, and dissolved oxygen (DO) change caused by fixed plant. To validate the program modifications, both QUAL2K and QUALM were applied to the same reaches of river and the results were compared. The water quality parameters included in the model were DO, BOD, nitrogen and phosphorus series, and chlorophyll-a. Both QUAL2K and QUALM model represent the field data quite well except for some parameters of QUALM. In BOD, DO, and total nitrogen, there are significant discrepancies between the results of two models, where QUAL2K displayed better agreement with the field measurements than QUALM due to QUAL2K's ability to simulate the conversion of algal death to BOD, fixed plant DO, and the denitrification.

Constructed wetlands are ecologically beneficial, low cost treatment alternatives proven capable of reducing suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), nitrogen, phosphorus and heavy metals from wastewater of many sources. The goal of this study was to determine how well a constructed wetland performed as a filter in a full-scale shrimp aquaculture operation. A 7.7 ha (19 ac) mesohaline (3-8 ppt) constructed wetland treating 13,600 m(3) per day (3.6 MGD) of effluent from 8.1 ha (20 ac) of intensively farmed shrimp ponds at the Loma Alta Shrimp Aquaculture Facility (LASAF), located along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico in semi-arid South Texas, was found to reduce concentrations of total phosphorus (TP), total suspended solids (TSS) and inorganic suspended solids (ISS) by 31, 65 and 76%, respectively, during recirculation, and maintained consistently low levels of mean BOD (< 9 mg l(-1)), total ammonia (< 1.8 mg N l(-1)) and nitrate (< 0.42 mg N l(-1)). Determination of parameter values for the k-C* wetland design model for ISS or TP showed that mean target levels could be achieved, given expected influent concentrations, when the ratio of pond surface to wetland surface was 12. Constructed wetlands can perform satisfactorily as recirculation filters in large-scale shrimp aquaculture operations, reducing the impact of effluent on local water bodies, conserving large quantities of water and providing valuable ecological habitat.

Some of them were created around 900 years ago. These fish ponds form an important part of the hydrological system in the landscape; they also serve as water purification systems and sediment traps, provide habitat for many plant and animal species, as well as being used for recreation purposes-but above all, they are dedicated to fish production. The original oligo- or mesotrophic character of these fish ponds has been altered to one of eutrophic or even hypertrophic conditions due to the nature of the intensive management for high fish production, as well as agriculture practices within the catchment area. It can also be due to other uses of fish ponds, such as wastewater recipients. A thick layer of black anaerobic sediment invariably develops and serves as an uncontrolled internal source of nutrients. In order to stop the development of water blooms and restore the lake to reasonable healthy conditions, both the external and internal loading has to be reduced. An example of such a fish pond restoration within the Czech Republic is described. The phosphorus budget of the Vajgar fish pond (40 ha, S Bohemia) was evaluated and the dry matter, organic matter, nutrients, heavy metals and other metals content were estimated in the vertical profile of the fish pond's sediment. A precision suction dredger was designed, constructed, and used for the selective removal of 330 000 m(3) black sediment from the Vajgar fish pond. The sediment was pumped to settling ponds at a distance of 2.5 km. Later, the suction dredger was used for sediment removal from other fish ponds. In one case, 40000 m(3) Of eutrophic sediment was directly applied on an agriculture field. In another case, sediment containing oil products was decontaminated by using a biocatalyst and bacterial culture. Sediment removal from Vajgar fish pond resulted in a temporary negative phosphorus budget (lower concentrations in the outflow than the inflow). The temporary absence of cyanobacteria (Microcystis sp.) blooms was the result of the removal of the black sediment layer. The improvement of water quality after sediment removal was, however, temporary. A more holistic approach, aimed at the reduction of matter losses from the fish pond's catchment area, is therefore being adopted. The principles of such an holistic approach are described.

J	Temprano, J; Tejero, I				Temprano, J; Tejero, I			Detention storage volume for combined sewer overflow into a river	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						detention basins; water quality; storm water; runoff; SWMM	SYSTEMS	This article discusses the storage volume needed in a combined sewer system tank in order to preserve the water quality. There are a lot of design criteria which do not take into account the conditions of the receiving water, and as a result are inappropriate. A model was used to simulate the performance of a theoretical combined sewer system where a tank was located downstream. Results were obtained from the overflows produced by the rain recorded in Santander (Spain) for 11 years, with several combinations of storage volume and treatment capacity in the wastewater treatment plant. Quality criteria were also proposed for faecal coliforms, BOD, and total nitrogen to evaluate the effects from the overflows in the river water quality. Equations have been obtained which relate the number of overflows, the storage volume and the treatment plant capacity. The bacteriological pollution, quantified by means of faecal coliforms, was the analytical parameter which produced the most adverse effects in the river, so that more storage volume is needed (45 to 180 m(3)ha(-1)net) than with other simulated pollutants (5 to 50 m(3)ha(-1) net for BOD and less than 4 m(3)ha(-1) net for the total nitrogen). The increase in the treatment plant's capacity, from two to three times the flow in dry weather, reduces the impact on the river water in a more effective way, allowing a reduction of up to 65% in the number of overflows rather than increasing the storage volume.

We built empirical models that predict the level of six different types of stress with fish and benthic macroinvertebrate data as explanatory variables. Significant models were found for six stressor factors: stream corridor structure: siltation; total suspended solids (TSS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and iron (Fe); chemical oxygen demand (COD) and BOD; zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb); and nitrate and nitrite (NOx) and phosphorus (P). Model R-2 values were lowest for the siltation factor and highest for TSS, BOD, and Fe. Model R-2 values increased when spatial relationships, were incorporated into tire model. The models generally performed well when applied to a random subset of the data. Performance was more mixed Mien models were applied to data collected from a previous time period, perhaps because of a change in the spatial structure of these systems, These models may provide a useful indication of the levels of different stresses impacting stream reaches in the Eastern Corn Belt Plains ecoregion of Ohio, USA. More generally, the models provide additional evidence that biological communities can serve as useful indicators of the types of anthropogenic stress impacting aquatic systems.

In this paper we examine the potential of a cichlid fish species (Sarotherodon galilaeus ) to both maintain positive growth rates through filter-feeding on phytoplankton and improve water quality in Lake Kinneret through suppression of dinoflagellate (Peridinium gatunense ) blooms. 2. Seasonal plankton consumption by S. galilaeus from Lake Kinneret was examined experimentally by monitoring changes in plankton assemblages during 24 h in 5-m(3) mesocosms containing varying densities of fish. Taxon-specific grazing rates ranged from 0 to 17 mg g(fish) day(-1), with mean total consumption of 1.6% fish body weight per day. During the spring bloom of P. gatunense, S. galilaeus consumed mostly (94%) netphytoplankton (greater than or equal to20 mum). The remaining 6% consisted mostly of nanophytoplankton (<20 &mu;m). During the summer and fall, net- and nanophytoplankton accounted for 54 and 42%, respectively, of the diet of S. galilaeus . Zooplankton and flagellated and ciliated protozoans made up the remaining 4%. 3. Simulations using a fish bioenergetics model indicated that consumption rates (C) were near maximum in spring (90%C-max), while consumption was reduced in summer-fall (59%C-max). Sarotherodon galilaeus obtains sufficient energy through filter-feeding year-round, although most growth (&GE;60%) occurs during the spring P. gatunense bloom. 4. Despite efficient feeding on P. gatunense and nanophytoplankton by S. galilaeus , estimates of instantaneous plankton mortality caused by ingestion were two orders of magnitude lower than maximum potential plankton growth rates. Thus the potential for the S. galilaeus population in Lake Kinneret to positively affect water quality through algal suppression is low.

However, present monitoring programmes often do not include shallow and sheltered near-shore areas, which are adjacent to human population and used for recreation purposes. We collected new near-shore water quality data from the southern coast of Finland that will allow the definition of the present state of these systems and may serve as reference data for possible future monitoring programmes. The data set comprises 45 small and shallow embayments with a mean surface area of 211 ha and a mean depth of 4.3 m. According to redundancy analysis (RDA), catchment land use explained 20.3% of the variance in the measured water chemistry. Agriculture had the strongest influence on the water quality of the study sites, capturing 13.1% of the variance. Nitrogen seemed to be strongly related to agriculture, whereas phosphorus was correlated with urban areas and industry. Higher than average nutrient concentrations regularly occurred at the mouths of large rivers, or close to human settlement, emphasising the significance of local sources to the nutrient concentrations of coastal waters. No increasing trend in nutrient or chlorophyll-a concentrations was observed from west to east in these shallow and sheltered nearshore areas. This contrasts with earlier results from pelagic samplings that report a marked influence of the River Neva and St. Petersburg on the nutrient status of the Gulf of Finland. Because these shallow embayments are strongly influenced by the local nutrient load, continued measures must be undertaken to reduce the nutrient load from land to prevent the continued deterioration and eutrophication of the nearshore, coastal waters.

The Integrated Nitrogen model for European Catchments (INCA) project aims to develop a generic version of the Integrated Nitrogen in Catchments (INCA) model to simulate the retention and transport of nitrogen within river systems, thereby providing a tool to aid the understanding of nitrogen dynamics and for river-basin management/policy-making. To facilitate the development of the model, 10 partners have tested the INCA model with data collected in study sites located in eight European countries as part of the INCA project, This paper summarises the key nitrogen issues within Europe, describes the main aims and methodology of the INCA project, and sets the project in the context of the current major research initiatives at a European level.

J	Tietema, A; Mol-Dijkstra, JP; Kros, J; De Vries, W				Tietema, A; Mol-Dijkstra, JP; Kros, J; De Vries, W			Dynamic nitrogen deposition thresholds during forest stand development in a Douglas fir forest analysed with two nitrogen models SMART2 and MERLIN	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article						critical load; dynamic deposition threshold; nitrogen; forest; SMART2; MERLIN	CRITICAL LOADS; NETHERLANDS; ECOSYSTEM; SOIL	In contrast to the classical critical load (CL) concept, based on long-term steady state conditions, a dynamic deposition threshold (DDT) is introduced. This DDT takes into account all relevant dynamic aspects of vegetation development/forest growth, mineralisation, immobilisation and denitrification, depending on the successional stage of the forest. DDT values for nitrogen were determined for a Douglas fir rotation by two process-based nitrogen models SMART2 and MERLIN using three different criteria for critical nitrogen leaching. During most of the rotation time, the predicted DDT values were higher than the corresponding traditional CL. SMART2 and MERLIN predicted a maximum DDT of 4.9 and 4.6 kmol N ha(-1) yr(-1) (69 and 64 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), respectively, when accepting a critical N leaching level of 1.73 kmol N ha(-1) yr(-1) related to impacts on ground water quality. This is due mainly to relatively high tree uptake during the first 50 years of a forest rotation, compared to a long-term estimate, Le, the average tree uptake during a rotation period, used in the traditional CL calculation. At the lowest critical N leaching level of 0.10 kmol N ha(-1) yr(-1), corresponding to a level that might be critical for vegetation changes, the calculated DDT value and related N availability was such that it influenced tree growth, indicated by an increased CN ratio in foliage and organic matter. The two models SMART2 and MERLIN predicted comparable absolute levels of DDT but with a completely different temporal pattern. This was caused by differences in timing of mineralisation in the soil. Both models showed the importance of the soil for supplying N for tree growth in young and productive forests, but the timing of this mobilisation of N from the soil was different. This difference between the two models reflects the lack of knowledge of the mechanisms of the role of soil organic matter in satisfying tree N demand, Nevertheless, this method has a high potential for increasing more detailed insight into the dynamic behaviour of CL, which will make it possible to focus management options on a smaller spatial and temporal scale.

J	Langusch, JJ; Matzner, E				Langusch, JJ; Matzner, E			N fluxes in two nitrogen saturated forested catchments in Germany: dynamics and modelling with INCA	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article						forest ecosystem; modelling; N budgets; N saturation; NO3 leaching; water quality; INCA	MULTIPLE SOURCE ASSESSMENT; SULFATE REDUCTION; ECOSYSTEMS; NITRATE	The N cycle in forests of the temperate zone in Europe has been changed substantially by the impact of atmospheric N deposition. Here, the fluxes and concentrations of mineral N in throughfall, soil solution and runoff in two German catchments, receiving high N inputs are investigated to test the applicability of an Integrated Nitrogen Model for European Catchments (INCA) to small forested catchments. The Lehstenbach catchment (419 ha) is located in the German Fichtelgebirge (NO Bavaria, 690-871 m asl.) and is stocked with Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) of different ages. The Steinkreuz catchment (55 ha) with European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) as the dominant tree species is located in the Steigerwald (NW Bavaria, 400-460 m asl.), The mean annual N fluxes with throughfall were slightly higher at the Lehstenbach (24.6 kg N ha(-1)) than at the Steinkreuz (20.4 kg N ha(-1)). In both catchments the N fluxes in the soil are dominated by NO3 At Lehstenbach, the N output with seepage at 90 cm soil depth was similar to the N flux with throughfall. At Steinkreuz more than 50 % of the N deposited was retained in the upper soil horizons. In both catchments, the NO3 fluxes with runoff were lower than those with seepage. The average annual NO3 concentrations in runoff in both catchments were between 0.7 to 1.4 mg NO3-N L-1 and no temporal trend was observed. The N budgets at the catchment scale indicated similar amounts of N retention (Lehstenbach: 19 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) Steinkreuz: 17 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). The parameter settings of the INCA model were simplified to reduce the model complexity. In both catchments, the NO3 concentrations and fluxes in runoff were matched well by the model, The seasonal patterns with lower NO3 runoff concentrations in summer at the Lehstenbach catchment were replicated. INCA underestimated the increased NO3 concentrations during short periods of rewetting in late autumn at the Steinkreuz catchment. The model will be a helpful tool for the calculation of "critical loads" for the N deposition in Central European forests including different hydrological regimes.

For the streams draining the felled podzolic areas, the concentrations of nitrate can be up to an order of magnitude higher than pre-fell values and post-fell concentrations can even be lower than the pre-fell values. Felling for the podzolic soils barely leads to any changes in ammonium or SRP concentration. For the gley soils, felling results in an order of magnitude increase in nitrate, ammonium and SRP for a small drainage ditch, but the pulse is much reduced before it reaches the main Nant Tanllwyth channel. Rather, within-catchment and within-stream processes not only imbibe nitrate, ammonium and SRP fluxes generated, but in the case of nitrate, concentrations with- and post-felling are lower than pre-felling concentrations. The flux changes involved are described in terms of (a) input-output relationships and (b) "felling disruption" and "felling recovery responses".

The model was calibrated for the first four years' data record (1994 to 1997) and tested over the following three years (1998 to 2000), The model calibration and testing periods incorporated a high degree of variability in climatic conditions and river flows within the Tweed catchment. The ability of the INCA model to reproduce broad-scale spatial patterns and seasonal dynamics in river flows and nitrate concentrations suggests that the processes controlling first order variability in river water nitrate concentrations have been represented successfully within the model. The tendency of the model to overestimate summer/early autumn baseflow nitrate concentrations during dry years may be linked to the operation of aquatic plant uptake effects. It is, therefore, suggested that consideration be given to incorporating a spatially and temporally variable in-stream plant uptake term for the application of INCA to lowland eutrophic rivers. Scenarios to examine possible impacts of environmental change on nitrate concentrations on the Tweed are examined, These include the effects of (i) implementing different recommendations for fertiliser use and land use change under the Nitrate Sensitive Areas (NSA) Scheme and the Scottish Code of Good Agricultural Practice, (ii) worst case scenario changes linked to a dramatic reduction in livestock numbers as a result of a crisis in UK livestock farming and (iii) changes in atmospheric nitrogen deposition.

Leaching from urban and agricultural areas was found to control nitrogen dynamics in reaches unaffected by effluent discharges and abstractions the occurrence of minimal flows resulted in an upward trend in nitrate concentration. Sewage treatment works (STW) discharging into the River Lee raised nitrate concentrations substantially, a problem which was compounded by abstractions in the Lower Lee. The average concentration of nitrate (NO3) for the simulation period 1995-96 was 7.87 mg N 1(-1). Ammonium (NH4) concentrations were simulated less successfully, However, concentrations of ammonium rarely rose to levels which would be of environmental concern. Scenarios were run through INCA to assess strategies for the reduction of nitrate concentrations in the catchment. The conversion of arable land to ungrazed vegetation or to woodland would reduce nitrate concentrations substantially, whilst inclusion of riparian buffer strips would be unsuccessful in reducing nitrate loading. A 50% reduction in nitrate loading from Luton STW would result in a fall of up to 5 mg N 1-(1) in the reach directly affected (concentrations fell from maxima of 13 to 8 mg N 1(-1), nearly a 40 % reduction), whilst a 20% reduction in abstractions would reduce maximum peaks in concentration in the lower Lee by up to 4 mg 1-1 (from 17 to 13 mg N 1(-1), nearly a 25 % reduction),.

INCA is a process-based model of the nitrogen cycle in the plant/soil and instream systems, The model simulates the nitrogen export from different land-use types within a river system, and the in-stream nitrate and ammonium concentrations at a daily time-step. The structure of the new version differs from the original, in that soil-water retention volumes have been added and the interface adapted to permit multiple crop and vegetation growth periods and fertiliser applications. The process equations are now written in terms of loads rather than concentrations allowing a more robust tracking of mass conservation when using numerical integration. The new version is able to reproduce the seasonal dynamics observed in the streamwater nitrogen concentration data, and the loads associated with plant/soil system nitrogen processes reported in the literature. As such, the model results suggest that the new structure is appropriate for the simulation of nitrogen in the River Kennet and an improvement on the original model, The utility of the INCA model is discussed in terms of improving scientific understanding and catchment management.

J	Wade, AJ; Whitehead, PG; Butterfield, D				Wade, AJ; Whitehead, PG; Butterfield, D			The Integrated Catchments model of Phosphorus dynamics (INCA-P), a new approach for multiple source assessment in heterogeneous river systems: model structure and equations	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article						modelling; water quality; phosphorus; soluble reactive phosphorus; basin management	NITROGEN MODEL; KENNET	A new model has been developed for assessing the effects of multiple sources of phosphorus on the water quality and aquatic ecology in heterogeneous river systems. The Integrated Catchments model for Phosphorus (INCA-P) is a process-based, mass balance model that simulates the phosphorus dynamics in both the plant/soil system and the stream, The model simulates the spatial variations in phosphorus export from different land use types within a river system using a semi-distributed representation, thereby accounting for the impacts of different land management practices, such as organic and inorganic fertiliser and wastewater applications, The land phase of INCA-P includes a simplified representation of direct runoff, soilwater and groundwater flows, and the soil processes that involve phosphorus. In addition, the model includes a multi-reach in-stream component that routes water down the main river channel. It simulates Organic and Inorganic Phosphorus concentrations in the land phase, and Total Phosphorus (dissolved plus particulate phosphorus) concentrations in the in-stream phase. In-stream Soluble Reactive Phosphor-us concentrations are determined from the Total Phosphorus concentrations and the macrophyte, epiphyte and algal biomasses are simulated also. This paper describes the model structure and equations, the limitations and the potential utility of the approach.

J	Coats, R; Liu, FJ; Goldman, CR				Coats, R; Liu, FJ; Goldman, CR			A Monte Carlo test of load calculation methods, Lake Tahoe basin, California-Nevada	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						aquatic ecosystems; statistical analysis; water quality; watershed management; Lake Tahoe; eutrophication; load calculation	TRANSPORT; PHOSPHATE; STREAMS	The sampling of streams and estimation of total loads of nitrogen, phosphorus, and suspended sediment play an important role in efforts to control the eutrophication of Lake Tahoe. We used a Monte Carlo procedure to test the precision and bias of four methods of calculating total constituent loads for nitrate-nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus, particulate phosphorus, total phosphorus, and suspended sediment in one major tributary of the take. The methods tested were two forms of the Beale's Ratio Estimator, the Period Weighted Sample, and the Rating Curve. Intensive sampling in 1985 (a dry year) and 1986 (a wet year) provided a basis for estimating loads by the "worked record" method for comparison with estimates based on resampling actual data at the lower intensity that characterizes the present monitoring program. The results show that: (1) the Period Weighted Sample method was superior to the other methods for all constituents for 1985; and (2) for total phosphorus, particulate phosphorus, and suspended sediment, the Rating Curve gave the best results in 1986. Modification of the present sampling program and load calculation methods may be necessary to improve the precision and reduce the bias of estimates of total phosphor-us loads in basin streams.

The agricultural practices comprising Scenario 1, which assumes perpetuation of current trends (conversion to conservation tillage, increase in farm size and land in production, use of currently-employed Best Management Practices (BMPs)) result in simulated increased export of nitrate and decreased export of sediment relative to the present, However, simulations indicate that the substantial changes in agricultural practices envisioned in Scenarios 2 and 3 (conversion to conservation tillage, strip intercropping, rotational grazing, conservation set-asides and greatly extended use of best management practices (BMPs) such as riparian buffers, engineered wetlands, grassed waterways, filter strips and field borders) could potentially reduce current loadings of sediment by 37 to 67 percent and nutrients by 54 to 75 percent. Results from the study indicate that major improvements in water quality in these agricultural watersheds could be achieved if such environmentally-targeted agricultural practices were employed. Traditional approaches to water quality improvement through application of traditional BMPs will result in little or no change in nutrient export and minor decreases in sediment export from Corn Belt watersheds.

Land uses in the study area included forest, range, urban, and agriculture. Most of the streams in this region can be characterized as open-channel systems influenced by intensive dryland (nonirrigated) and irrigated agriculture. Algal communities in forested streams were dominated by blue-green algae, with communities in urban and range streams dominated by diatoms. The predominance of either blue-greens or diatoms in agricultural streams varied greatly depending on the specific site. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated a strong gradient effect of several key environmental variables on benthic algal community composition. Conductivity and % agriculture were the dominant explanatory variables when all sites (n = 24) were included in the CCA; water velocity replaced conductivity when the CCA included only agricultural and urban sites. Other significant explanatory variables included dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), orthophosphate (OP), discharge, and precipitation. Regression and calibration models accurately predicted conductivity based on benthic algal communities, with OP having slightly lower predictability. The model for DIN was poor, and therefore may be less useful in this system.

The evaluation is based on: (1) results from a long-term monitoring program conducted on the lake, its tributaries, and the adjoining river that receives the lake's outflow, (2) algal bioassay experiments of the bioavailability of particulate P (PP) in inputs to the lake, (3) loading rate calculations for forms of P in these inputs, (4) calculations of water densities in inflows and the take, (5) model analyses of plunging interflows and responses to seasonal material loading, and (6) mass balance calculations for a tracer conducted around the lake outlet and the receiving river to estimate inflow to the lake from the river. Several important system-specific characteristics were found not to be accommodated in the current TMDL analysis, including: (1) a P load from the river back into the lake, (2) seasonal plunging of tributaries to depths below the productive layers of the take, (3) incomplete and different bioavailabilities of PP in the various inputs, (4) the different settling velocities of PP from these sources, (5) false high estimates of TP loading from tributaries associated with turbidity interferences in P analyses, and (6) the implications of the high flushing rate of the lake for strong seasonality in the relative impacts of externals loads. The TMDL analysis is demonstrated to understate the present role of the dominant point source and overstate the importance of non-point sources. Recommendations are made to upgrade the TMDL analysis through an integrated program of model development, testing and application, supporting process studies and monitoring, and re-evaluation of management options.

J	James, WF; Barko, JW; Eakin, HL; Sorge, PW				James, WF; Barko, JW; Eakin, HL; Sorge, PW			Phosphorus budget and management strategies for an urban Wisconsin lake	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						lake restoration; macrophyte senescence; motor boat activity; phosphorus budget; sediment phosphorus; flux urban lake	SEDIMENT; SHALLOW	Multiple external and internal phosphorus (P) sources to an urban lake, Half Moon Lake in Wisconsin, were examined during the summer of 1999 in order to develop management strategies for effective P control and reversal of eutrophication (Trophic State Index=74). Internal recycling of P accounted for 80% of the summer P budget of the take. Flux of P from the sediment accounted for most of the internal P loading(42% of total budget). However, decomposition of Potamogeton crispus and recycling of macrophyte P during the middle of the summer growing season, and P resuspension due to motor boat activity, accounted for 20% and 17% of the P budget, respectively, representing additional important sources to be controlled. In contrast, summer P loading via the watershed (storm sewers and precipitation) was much less. Using a water quality model (Bathtub),we found that reduction of internal P sources could substantially reduce by greater than 70% the high concentrations of algae in the lake (mean summer chlorophyll = 82 mg.m(-3)). Suggested internal P control measures included a sediment chemical treatment to bind P, greater harvesting of P. crispus to reduce the macrophyte P pool at the time of senescence, and limiting motor boat activity when the take is weakly stratified.

J	Burns, DA; Nguyen, L				Burns, DA; Nguyen, L			Nitrate movement and removal along a shallow groundwater flow path in a riparian wetland within a sheep-grazed pastoral catchment: results of a tracer study	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH			English	Article						riparian wetlands; nitrate removal; nitrate movement; groundwater; water quality; tracer study; grazing management	BROMIDE TRACER; WATER-QUALITY; NITROGEN; DENITRIFICATION; DYNAMICS; STREAM; IMPACT; FOREST; ZONES; SOILS	The movement and removal of nitrate (NO3-) along a groundwater flow path within a riparian wetland was investigated during a 24-day period in late autumn-early winter, using a lithium bromide (LiBr)-potassium nitrate (KNO3) tracer solution containing 19 200 mg/litre as Br- and 193.8 mg/litre as NO3-N. The tracer solution was added as an instantaneous dose of tracer solution at a depth of 10-20 cm to four injection wells in two 1 m(2) plots within a sheep-grazed pastoral catchment at the Whatawhata Agricultural Research Centre near Hamilton, New Zealand. Bromide and NO3-N concentrations were measured periodically in: (1) wetland groundwater samples from piezometers installed at 15 and 30 cm depths and located at 30, 60, and 100 cm down gradient from the injection wells; and (2) surface flow samples. Peak concentrations of 50-250 mg/litre of Br- and 0.2-1.1 mg/litre of NO3-N were reached within 1-2 days after application at most piezometers. Nitrate concentrations decreased thereafter more sharply than did those of Br-, resulting in decreased NO3-N/Br- ratios from Days 2 through 7. More than 99% of groundwater samples collected after the tracer application had NO3-N/Br- less than the value in the tracer solution indicating removal of NO3-N during transport. Mass flux estimates indicated removal of >90% of added NO3-N along the 100 cm flow path from the injection, with essentially all of the NO3- removed within the first 30 cm of transport. On Days 10 and 24, just after rain events, surface flow from the experimental plots had greatly elevated NO3-N concentrations that were not accompanied by correspondingly elevated Br- concentrations, indicating that NO3-N originating from the surrounding catchment was transported over the wetland surface with little penetration or mixing with wetland groundwater. Despite a significant capacity for NO3-N removal from shallow groundwater equivalent to an annualised value of 50 kg/ha in these wetland study plots, large amounts of NO3-N from the catchment are likely to move over the wetland surface during rain events without adequate soil contact time for efficient denitrification and retention.

This water supply reservoir for the city of Decatur receives water from the 2,400-square-kilometer Lake Decatur agricultural watershed and has high nitrate-N concentrations periodically exceeding the 10 milligram per liter drinking water standard of the US. and Illinois Environmental Protection Agencies (USEPA and IEPA). Using monitored and estimated data, the model was calibrated and validated to predict closely-observed runoff volumes and nitrate-N concentrations. Sensitive model parameters were identified The calibrated model was used to evaluate the effects of different agricultural and watershed management practices (BMPs) for reducing nitrate-N discharge into the lake. Model parameters were identified to represent the BMPs. Model results showed variations of nitrate-N discharge into the lake with respect to different BMPs and BMP applications at different areas of the watershed The model was found useful in the preliminary evaluations of the BMPs in the Lake Decatur watershed for reducing nitrate-N discharge into the lake. The BMP evaluation approach and the results may be useful to users of the AGNPS model and other non-point-source pollution models. Model limitations must be kept in mind in interpreting the results from this empirically-based model and in using them to solve practical problems.

J	Dodds, WK; Smith, VH; Lohman, K				Dodds, WK; Smith, VH; Lohman, K			Nitrogen and phosphorus relationships to benthic algal biomass in temperate streams	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article							NUTRIENT-CHLOROPHYLL RELATIONSHIPS; PERIPHYTON BIOMASS; TROPHIC STATE; LAKES; EUTROPHICATION; ECOREGIONS; RIVER; WATER; ECOSYSTEMS; LIMITATION	Knowledge of factors limiting benthic algal (periphyton) biomass is central to understanding energy flow in stream ecosystems and stream eutrophication. We used several data sets to determine how water column nutrients and nonnutrient factors are linked to periphytic biomass and if the ecoregion concept is applicable to nutrient-periphyton relationships. Literature values for seasonal means of biomass of periphyton, nutrient concentrations, and other stream characteristics were collected for almost 300 sampling periods from temperate streams. Data for benthic chlorophyll and nutrient concentrations from a subset of 620 stations in the United States National Stream Water-Quality Monitoring Networks were also analyzed. The greatest portion of variance in models for the mean and maximum biomass of benthic stream algae (about 40%) was explained by concentrations of total N and P. Breakpoint regression and a two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical technique established significant breakpoints of about 30 mug total P.L-1 and 40 mug total N.L-1, above which mean chlorophyll values were substantially higher. Ecoregion effects on nutrient-chlorophyll relationships were weak. Ecoregion effects were cross-correlated with anthropogenic effects such as percent urban and cropland area in the watershed and population density. Thus, caution is necessary to separate anthropogenic effects from natural variation at the ecoregion level.

J	Krysanova, V; Haberlandt, U				Krysanova, V; Haberlandt, U			Assessment of nitrogen leaching from arable land in large river basins Part I. Simulation experiments using a process-based model	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						ecohydrological modelling; diffuse pollution; nitrogen wash-off; nitrogen leaching to groundwater; water quality; river basin	DYNAMICS; LOSSES	A two-step procedure for analysing nitrogen leaching from arable land in large river basins is suggested: (1) application of a process-based dynamic model for a set of representative conditions in a large river basin to simulate water and nitrogen fluxes and (2) development of a fuzzy-rule based metamodel using the simulated nitrogen fluxes in Step 1 as a training set. After that the metamodel can be used for rapid assessment of water quality inside the considered ranges of parameters, describing natural conditions and management practices. This paper describes Step 1 of the procedure. Step 2 is described in an accompanying paper (Haberlandt et al., Ecological Modelling 150 (3) (2002) 277-294) The advantage of this approach is that it combines the 'process-based foundation' with the resulting simplicity of the metamodel. Simulation experiments for analysing nitrogen (N) leaching from arable land were performed using the Soil and Water Integrated Model (SWIM) for a set of representative conditions in the Saale basin (23687 km(2)) in Central Europe. The Saale River is one of the main tributaries of the Elbe. In advance, hydrological validation of the model was done for the whole Saale basin and validation of nitrogen dynamics was fulfilled in two mesoscale sub-basins of the Elbe. For the simulation experiments the drainage basin area was sub-divided into five climate zones and nine representative soil classes were chosen. The basic rotation and fertilisation schemes were established using regional information obtained from literature. In addition, the effects of changing the basic rotation to more/less intensive ones and changing fertilisation rates by 50% increase/decrease were studied. The ranges of simulated nitrogen fluxes for the basic rotation and fertilisation schemes are comparable to available regional estimates and differences between sub-regions and soils are plausible. The relative importance of natural and anthropogenic factors affecting nitrogen leaching for the Saale River basin was as follows: (1) soil, (2) climate, (3) fertilisation rate and (4) crop rotation. The simulation experiments provide a basis for a fuzzy-rule based metamodel approach, which aims at rapid water quality assessment of large regions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Herrera-Silveira, JA; Medina-Gomez, I; Colli, R				Herrera-Silveira, JA; Medina-Gomez, I; Colli, R			Trophic status based on nutrient concentration scales and primary producers community of tropical coastal lagoons influenced by groundwater discharges	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						coastal lagoon; eutrophication; primary productivity; phytoplanktonic biomass; residence time; groundwater; nutrients	WATER-QUALITY; EUTROPHICATION; INDEX	Changes in the rate of primary production as an indication of trophic status of aquatic ecosystems have been one of the major indicators of their health. Despite different approaches been devised for evaluating this process, few are useful for comparison and generalization of their results. The coastal zone ecosystems of Yucatan (SE Mexico) exhibit hydrological variability closely associated with the groundwater discharges, which are the only freshwater sources in the coastal ecosystems. In order to learn about the trophic status of karstic tropical coastal lagoons, three of them (Celestun, Chelem and Dzilam) located in Yucatan (SE, Mexico) were monitored for inorganic nutrients, Chl-a, phytoplankton and macrophyte productivity. The nitrate concentrations suggest that the trophic status was influenced by fresh water springs, being meso-eutrophic in Celestun, oligotrophic in Chelem, and mesotrophic in Dzilam. In the case of ammonium ions, the three lagoons were mesotrophic, indicating that processes such as remineralization play an important role in the trophic dynamic of these shallow ecosystems. According to phosphate concentrations, Celestun and Dzilam were mesotrophic, and Chelem was oligotrophic. External inputs of phosphate and bioturbation by waterfowl may be responsible of these differences. Primary productivity at Celestun was greater than at Chelem and Dzilam lagoons and the contribution by seagrasses was significant in all three. It is found that indices based on nutrient concentration and phytoplankton biomass are useful as an indication of trophic status in groundwater influenced coastal lagoons. Moreover, estimations on the total system productivity, and the relative contribution of each primary producer, is a holistic approach useful for understanding trophic dynamic in shallow tropical coastal ecosystems.

J	Griffith, JA; Martinko, EA; Whistler, JL; Price, KP				Griffith, JA; Martinko, EA; Whistler, JL; Price, KP			Preliminary comparison of landscape pattern-normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) relationships to central plains stream conditions	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							CONTERMINOUS UNITED-STATES; LAND-COVER DATA; WATER-QUALITY; FISH ASSEMBLAGES; DATA SET; ECOSYSTEMS; CHEMISTRY; SCALES; BIOTA; USA	We explored relationships of water quality parameters with landscape pattern metrics (LPMs), land use-land cover (LULC) proportions, and the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or NDVI-derived metrics. Stream sites (271) in Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri were sampled for water quality parameters, the index of biotic integrity, and a habitat index in either 1994 or 1995. Although a combination of LPMs (interspersion and juxtaposition index, patch density, and percent forest) within Ozark Highlands watersheds explained >60% of the variation in levels of nitrite-nitrate nitrogen and conductivity, In most cases the LPMs were not significantly correlated with the stream data. Several problems using landscape pattern metrics were noted: small watersheds having only one or two patches, collinearity with LULC data, and counterintuitive or inconsistent results that resulted from basic differences in land use-land cover patterns among ecoregions or from other factors determining water quality. The amount of variation explained in water quality parameters using multiple regression models that combined LULC and LPMs was generally lower than that from NDVI or vegetation phenology metrics derived from time-series NDVI data. A comparison of LPMs and NDVI indicated that NDVI had greater promise for monitoring landscapes for stream conditions within the study area.

The study area is the Ali Efenti Basin in central Greece. The soil and water assessment tool daily stop conceptual model has been applied to simulate the water cycle and the nitrogen transport within the catchment. The outputs of six general circulation models have been used to perturb the time series of precipitation and temperature. For all of the scenarios a decrease in streamflow is observed and there is an increase in the magnitude of floods for certain return periods. Changes in surface water runoff influence nitrogen losses, resulting in an annual reduction of the nitrogen flux to the water body.

J	Jassby, AD; Cloern, JE; Cole, BE				Jassby, AD; Cloern, JE; Cole, BE			Annual primary production: Patterns and mechanisms of change in a nutrient-rich tidal ecosystem	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							SAN-FRANCISCO BAY; PHYTOPLANKTON PRODUCTIVITY; DELTA CALIFORNIA; EMPIRICAL-MODEL; BIOMASS; LIGHT; VARIABILITY; ESTUARY; GROWTH; PHOTOSYNTHESIS	Although nutrient supply often underlies long-term changes in aquatic primary production, other regulator processes can he important. The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, a complex of tidal waterways forming the landward portion of the San Francisco Estuary, has ample nutrient supplies, enabling us to examine alternate regulatory mechanisms over a 21-yr period. Delta-wide primary productivity was reconstructed from historical water quality data for 1975-1995. Annual primary production averaged 70 C m(-2), but it varied by over a factor of five among years. At least four processes contributed to this variability: (1) invasion of the clam Potamocorbula amurensis led to a persistent decrease in phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) after 1986: (2) a long-term decline in total suspended solids-probably at least partly because of upstream dam construction-increased water transparency and phytoplankton growth rate: (3) river inflow, reflecting climate variability, affected biomass through fluctuations in flushing and growth rates through fluctuations in total Suspended solids: and (4) an additional pathway manifesting as a long-term decline in winter phytoplankton biomass has been identified, but its genesis is uncertain. Overall, the Delta lost 43% in annual primary production during the period. Given the evidence for food limitation of primary Consumers, these findings provide a partial explanation for widespread Delta species declines over the past few decades. Turbid nutrient-rich systems Such as the Delta may he inherently more variable than other tidal systems because certain compensatory processes are absent. Comparisons among systems, however can be tenuous because conclusions about the magnitude and mechanisms of variability are dependent on length of data record.

The model uses a spatially distributed delivery ratio (DR) parameter to account for nitrogen retention or loss along a drainage network. Delivery ratios are calculated from time of travel and an exponential decay model for in-stream dynamics. Travel times from any point in the drainage network to the watershed outlet are obtained from simulations using a combined physically based field hydrology and drainage canal routing model (DRAINMOD-DUFLOW). Nitrogen load from contributing areas in the watershed delivered to the main watershed outlet is obtained as the product of field export with the corresponding delivery ratio. The total watershed load at the outlet is the combined loading of the individual fields. Nitrogen exports from source areas are measured. The lumped water quality model is integrated within a GIS framework with menu interface, display options, and statistical procedures. Within this framework, the model can be used as a screening tool to analyze the effects of different land and water management practices on downstream water quality. A description of the model is presented along with the results from the evaluation of the model to characterize the seasonal and annual export of nitrogen from a drained forested watershed near Plymouth, North Carolina. Results of the study showed that the lumped parameter model can reasonably predict the loads at the outlet of the watershed. Predicted loads for 1997 were highly correlated with the observed loads (correlation coefficients of 0.99, 0.90, and 0.96 for nitrate-nitrogen, TKN, and total nitrogen respectively). Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses indicated that predicted outlet loads were sensitive to field flow predictions and export concentrations. Overall, the results indicate that the lumped parameter model can be an effective tool for describing the monthly nitrogen loads from a poorly drained coastal plain watershed.

J	Sogbedji, JM; McIsaac, GF				Sogbedji, JM; McIsaac, GF			Evaluation of the adapt model for simulating water outflow from agricultural watersheds with extensive tile drainage	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						ADAPT; water outflow modeling; watershed; streamflow	NITROGEN; DEPTH; CROP	In settings with relatively uniform soils and land use, field-scale hydrologic and water quality models may be useful simulation tools for analyzing the effects of climate change or policy alternatives. In this study, we evaluated the performance of the ADAPT model for simulating water outflow (tile drainage plus surface runoff) from 622 to 1500 km(2) watersheds in central Illinois, where a large portion of the land is used for maize-soybean production and tile drainage is common. Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity and porosity, rooting depth, leaf area index, drain spacing and depth, and drainage coefficient were used as calibration parameters to optimize the fit between measured and simulated water outflow from a 1500 km(2) watershed for 1987-1993. The applicability of the calibration parameters was tested by using these values for simulations of two neighboring watersheds for the 1987-1993 period and a second time period (1979-1986)for the three watersheds. The model effectively simulated annual waterflow for all time periods and all watersheds (Willmott's index of agreement ranged from 0.95 to 0.99). For monthly and weekly waterflows, Willmott's index decreased and ranged between 0.88 and 0.95 and between 0.88 and 0.93, respectively, and performance was markedly poorer for one of the three watersheds. For daily waterflow, Willmott's index ranged from 0.77 to 0.89, and this is due partly to the temporal and spatial resolution of the input data and the streamflow data. The largest deviations between simulated and measured flow tended to occur during soil freezing and snowmelt periods. The results indicate that, with calibration, the model can provide good simulation of the annual water outflow and reasonable simulation of the monthly to weekly water outflow from tile-drained watersheds. The field-scale model performance was nearly as good as simulations that incorporated spatially explicit approaches to simulating watershed-scale hydrology in relatively uniform watersheds.

This study was conducted to determine P and N transport in runoff following long-term (since 1953) manure and fertilizer applications. Duplicate soil samples (32) were collected in 1998 from the top 0.1 m of selected plots of a long-term manure and fertilizer applications field experiment and later placed in 1 m(2) soil pans in the laboratory. Manure and fertilizer were mixed with 16 of the soil samples, while no treatment was applied to the other half (long-term residual effect). Simulated rainfall was then applied to the soil during initial and wet (24 hours later) events. Manure added just before simulated rainfall resulted in significantly greater concentrations of dissolved P (DP), bioavailable P (BAP), particulate P (PP), total P (TP), NO3-N, and NH4-N than when the last manure application was the previous year in 1997. Soil test P level was not a significant factor in DP loss when manure was applied just before rainfall. When the last manure application was the previous year, similar concentrations of DP, BAP, PP and TP were measured on the manure and no-manure treatments. Concentrations of NO3-N and NH4-N in runoff were not influenced by long-term fertilizer application, but significantly increased with increasing N application rate when N was applied just before rainfall. Phosphorus concentration in runoff decreased with time of runoff up to 45 minutes, after which the P concentration remained constant. NO3-N and total N concentrations continued to decrease for the entire runoff period.

J	Lu, RS; Lo, SL				Lu, RS; Lo, SL			Diagnosing reservoir water quality using self-organizing maps and fuzzy theory	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						self-organizing map (SOM); eutrophication; reservoir water quality; fuzzy theory		Since trophic status assessment of water quality is very important for the water resources management, the assessment results obtained from using only one parameter may easily mislead or bias the decision makers or managers. Even when using a multivariable index, how to determine the weights of all factors is debatable. In this research, one complementary evaluation method, self-organizing map (SOM), for diagnosing water quality has been used to develop a trophic state classifier and is illustrated with a case study of trophic status assessment for Fei-Tsui Reservoir in Taiwan. The historical database was collected from the management agency of Fei-Tsui Reservoir from 1987 to 1995. The results of SOM are compared with those of the Carlson index and Fuzzy synthetic evaluation, showing that the inconsistent records can be mapped to the conflicting data zone of the SOM output map. In addition, SOM creates a diagnostic axis on the map to express the trophic status of the water body. As long as the SOM model is well-trained, new records can be assessed and classified as either one of three trophic levels or special cases. If special water quality conditions are expressed on the SOM output, those data can reveal that either total phosphorus (TP) or chlorophyll A (chl a) is higher than usual.

J	Conrad, JM; Lopez, A				Conrad, JM; Lopez, A			Stochastic water quality: Timing and option value of treatment	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						stochastic water quality; economics; option value		[1] An option-pricing model is developed to rank investments that might improve water quality. The model presumes that two investment options exist that have the potential to alter the stochastic drift of a pollutant. The investments have capital and operating costs and are irreversible once constructed. A stochastically evolving pollutant induces damage. The model provides a criterion for determining when it is optimal to adopt the investment with the highest option value. Option value, in this model, measures the expected present value of reduced damage, relative to doing nothing. If the investments are mutually exclusive, it is possible to obtain closed-form solutions for the barriers which would trigger investment. If the investments can be sequentially adopted, a methodology is developed to calculate option values for all possible combinations of adoption dates. To illustrate the option-pricing approach, a stylized analysis of investments to protect New York City's water supply is presented. Watershed management dominates filtration and, in the case of mutually exclusive investments, is initiated when the concentration of phosphorus reaches 22.80 mug/L.

These factors contribute to the profitability of production and to the environmental impact of shrimp fanning. The effect of four different feeding frequencies (3, 4, 5 and 6 feedings day(-1)) on the growth and survival of the black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon, and water quality was studied in an 8-week growth trial. The shrimp were held in 20 x 2500-1 outdoor tanks containing water and sediment from a shrimp pond. The water management and aeration strategies were designed to simulate a shrimp pond system. The shrimp (initial weight of 5.6 g) were stocked at a density of 25 animals m(-2) and fed a widely used, commercial pelleted feed, with all the feed being placed on feeding trays. The uneaten feed on the feeding trays was removed at specific time intervals so that in all treatments, the shrimp had access to the feed for 12 h day(-1). There were no significant (P > 0.05) differences due to feeding frequency on growth rate (1.4 +/- 0.08 g week(-1)), feed conversion ratio (FCR) (2.0 +/- 0.27) or survival (84 +/- 7.6%) of shrimp. Similarly, the water quality parameters (total N, ammonium, nitrate/nitrite, dissolved organic nitrogen, total phosphorus, phosphate, chlorophyll a, oxygen, pH, temperature, salinity, turbidity) were not different among treatments. The results suggest that there is no benefit from feeding P. monodon more frequently than 3 times day(-1) when using a feed that is nutritionally adequate and has high water stability. Therefore, it may be possible to reduce feeding frequency in commercial shrimp ponds without adversely affecting water quality, shrimp growth rate and survival, thereby improving farm profitability.

The relationship between benthic diatom taxa and measured environmental variables was explored using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). A weighted averaging (WA) regression model was developed to infer phosphorus concentrations of river water. The optima and tolerances of the diatom species were obtained from the WA regression. The performance of the WA model was assessed using correlation coefficients and the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) between the observed and inferred phosphorus concentrations. The model was cross-validated using an independent test set. The predictive power of the WA model was good (r = 0.91; RMSEP 13.9 mug P/l) in the training set. The weighted averaging also performed well in the independent test set (r = 0.87; RMSEP 15.6 mug P/l). The correlations were only slightly lower and predictive errors larger than in the training set. The weighted averaging gives a tool to evaluate tropic conditions in different ecoregions with the species optima list suitable for prevailing conditions and water quality.

J	Boyer, EW; Goodale, CL; Jaworsk, NA; Howarth, RW				Boyer, EW; Goodale, CL; Jaworsk, NA; Howarth, RW			Anthropogenic nitrogen sources and relationships to riverine nitrogen export in the northeastern USA	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						anthropogenic; atmospheric deposition; eutrophication; food production; nitrogen; nitrogen budget; nitrogen fixation; rivers	STREAM WATER-QUALITY; ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION; DRY-MATTER; AMMONIA EMISSION; N-2 FIXATION; PATTERNS; MODEL; FERTILIZER; TRANSPORT; FORESTS	Human activities have greatly altered the nitrogen (N) cycle, accelerating the rate of N fixation in landscapes and delivery of N to water bodies. To examine relationships between anthropogenic N inputs and riverine N export, we constructed budgets describing N inputs and losses for 16 catchments, which encompass a range of climatic variability and are major drainages to the coast of the North Atlantic Ocean along a latitudinal profile from Maine to Virginia. Using data from the early 1990's, we quantified inputs of N to each catchment from atmospheric deposition, application of nitrogenous fertilizers, biological nitrogen fixation, and import of N in agricultural products (food and feed). We compared these inputs with N losses from the system in riverine export. The importance of the relative sources varies widely by catchment and is related to land use. Net atmospheric deposition was the largest N source (>60%) to the forested basins of northern New England (e.g. Penobscot and Kennebec); net import of N in food was the largest source of N to the more populated regions of southern New England (e.g. Charles Blackstone); and agricultural inputs were the dominant N sources in the Mid-Atlantic region (e.g. Schuylkill & Potomac). Over the combined area of the catchments, net atmospheric deposition was the largest single source input (31%), followed by net imports of N in food and feed (25%), fixation in agricultural lands (24%), fertilizer use (15%), and fixation ill forests (5%). The combined effect of fertilizer use, fixation in crop lands, and animal feed imports makes agriculture the largest overall source of N. Riverine export of N is well correlated with N inputs, but it accounts for only a fraction (25%) of the total N inputs. This work provides an understanding of the sources of N in landscapes, and highlights how human activities impact N cycling in the northeast region.

IC50 values (concentrations of metals estimated to inhibit 50% growth relative to the control) were determined after 96 hours based on automated O.D. readings measured in Elisa microplates by a Multiskan spectrophotometer. Good agreement was achieved between O.D. readings and cell counts indicating that this new method is a simple, economical, practical and rapid technique for toxicity testing, and provides good reproducibility of IC50 values. Results of the toxicity tests indicate that Cu was the most toxic metal (average IC50 values ranging from 0.04 to 0.37 mg L-1), followed by Cd (0.06-5.7 mg L-1), Mn (7.2-21.4 mg L-1) and As (33.9-319.3 mg L-1). Test species had different degrees of sensitivity to the metals tested, with L galbana and C. calcitrans the most sensitive to Cu, Cd and Mn. Based on these findings it is recommended that the existing Malaysian Interim Standards for Marine Water Quality for Cd and Cu be reviewed.

J	Holdren, GC; Montano, A				Holdren, GC; Montano, A			Chemical and physical characteristics of the Salton Sea, California	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Salton Sea; saline lakes; nutrients; nitrogen; phosphorus; ionic composition; dissolved solids; geochemical modeling		A 1-year sampling program was conducted to assess current chemical and physical conditions in the Salton Sea. Analyses included general physical conditions and a suite of water quality parameters, including nutrients, trophic state variables, major cations and anions, trace metals and organic compounds. Samples were collected from three locations in the main body of the lake and from the three major tributaries. Nutrient concentrations in the Salton Sea are high and lead to frequent algal blooms, which in turn contribute to low dissolved oxygen concentrations. The tributaries consist primarily of agricultural return flows with high nutrient levels. Concentrations of trace metals and organic compounds do not appear to be of major concern. Two geochemical models, PHRQPITZ and PHREEQC, were used to evaluate potential chemical reactions limiting the solubility of selected water quality variables. Modeling indicated that the Salton Sea is supersaturated with respect to calcite, gypsum, and other minerals. Precipitation of these minerals may serve as a sink for phosphorus and limit the rate of salt accumulation in the Salton Sea.

The study focused on a 3500 km(2) catchment located in northern England, the Yorkshire Ouse. The SWAT model was calibrated and validated using sets of five years' measurements of nitrate and ortho-phosphorus concentrations and water flow. To increase the reliability of the hydrological model predictions, an uncertainty analysis was conducted by perturbing input parameters using a Monte-Carlo technique. The SWAT model was then run using a baseline scenario corresponding to an actual measured time series of daily temperature and precipitation, and six climate change scenarios. Because of the increase in temperature, all climate scenarios introduced an increase of actual evapotranspiration. Faster crop growth and an increased nutrient uptake resulted, as did an increase of annual losses of total nitrogen and phosphorus, however, with strong seasonal differences.

A large historical dataset of measurements of the concentration of chlorophyll a and phaeophytine a (Chl), suspended particulate inorganic material (SPIM) and the absorption coefficient of Coloured Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), spanning more than 25 years, has been used together with the model to develop algorithms for the retrieval of these water quality parameters, for a site in Lake Malaren, Sweden. The model takes as input the optically active substances and outputs a reflectance spectrum just above the water surface. From the modelled reflectance, algorithms were derived for Chl, SPIM and CDOM absorption at 420 nm. The algorithms were applied to atmospherically corrected remote sensing data, which were collected by the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager, CASI. The radiative transfer code 6S was used for the atmospheric correction of the data. Distribution maps for the three retrieved parameters were constructed and Chl and SPIM were validated by continuous field measurements of fluorescence and beam attenuation. The continuous data were calibrated with water analysis results from nine water samples. The time lag between the image acquisition and the ground data measurements was never more than 3 hours. Even though the model parameter values were collected at different times from that of the CASI over-flight, and from a larger geographic region of Lake Malaren than that used for the CASI measurements, the independently developed algorithms predicted the concentrations of the optically active substances within a reasonable level of accuracy, allowing spatial variations in the substances to be predicted.

J	Zou, R; Lung, WS; Guo, HC				Zou, R; Lung, WS; Guo, HC			Neural network embedded Monte Carlo approach for water quality modeling under input information uncertainty	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						neural networks; Monte Carlo method; water quality; models	PHOSPHORUS; MANAGEMENT; TRANSPORT; OXYGEN; LAKES	This paper proposes a neural network embedded Monte Carlo (NNMC) approach to account for uncertainty in water quality modeling. The framework of the proposed method has three major parts: a numerical water quality model, a neural network technique, and Monte Carlo simulation. The numerical model is used to generate desirable output for training and testing sets, and the neural network is used as a universal functional mapping tool to approximate the input-output response of the numerical model. The Monte Carlo simulation then uses the neural network to generate numerical realizations based on a probabilistic distribution of parameters, thus obtaining a probabilistic distribution of the simulated state variables. By embedding a neural network into the conventional Monte Carlo simulation, the proposed approach significantly improves upon the conventional method in computational efficiency. The proposed approach has been applied to uncertainty and risk analyses of a phosphorus model for Triadelphia Reservoir in Maryland. The results of this research show that the NNMC approach has potential for efficient uncertainty analysis of water quality modeling.

J	Harter, T; Davis, H; Mathews, MC; Meyer, RD				Harter, T; Davis, H; Mathews, MC; Meyer, RD			Shallow groundwater quality on dairy farms with irrigated forage crops	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY			English	Article						groundwater; contamination; dairy; nitrate; salinity; nitrogen; manure	DOMESTIC WELLS; WASTE LAGOONS; NITRATE; CONTAMINATION; AGRICULTURE; MANAGEMENT; WATER; ASSOCIATION; CALIFORNIA; LOSSES	California's dairies are the largest confined animal industry in the state. A major portion of these dairies, which have an average herd size of nearly 1000 animal units, are located in low-relief valleys and basins. Large amounts of liquid manure are generated and stared in these dairies. In the semi-arid climate, liquid manure is frequently applied via flood or furrow irrigation to forage crops that are grown almost year-round. Little is known about the impact of manure management practices on water quality of the extensive alluvial aquifers underlying these basins. The objective of this work is to assess nitrate and salt leaching to shallow groundwater in a relatively vulnerable hydrogeologic region and to quantify the impact from individual sources on dairies. The complex array of potential point and nonpoint sources was divided into three major source areas representing farm management units: (1) manure water lagoons (ponds); (2) feedlot or exercise yard, dry manure, and feed storage areas (corrals); and (3) manure irrigated forage fields (fields). An extensive shallow groundwater-monitoring network (44 wells) was installed in five representative dairy operations in the northeastern San Joaquin Valley, CA. Water quality (electrical conductivity, nitrate-nitrogen, total Kjehldahl nitrogen) was observed over a 4-year period. Nitrate-N, reduced nitrogen and electrical conductivity (EC, salinity) were subject to large spatial and temporal variability. The range of observed nitrate-N and salinity levels was similar on all five dairies. Average shallow groundwater nitrate-N concentrations within the dairies were 64 mg/l compared to 24 mg/l in shallow wells immediately upgradient of these dairies. Average EC levels were 1.9 mS/cm within the dairies and 0.8 mS/cm immediately upgradient. Within the dairies, nitrate-N levels did not significantly vary across dairy management units. However. EC levels were significantly higher in corral and pond areas (2.3 mS/cm) than in field areas (1.6 mS/cm) indicating leaching from those management units. Pond leaching was further inferred from the presence of reduced nitrogen in three of four wells located immediately downgradient of pond berms. The estimated minimum average annual groundwater nitrate-N and salt loading from manure-treated forage fields were 280 and 4300 kg/ha, respectively. Leaching rates for ponds are estimated to be on the order of 0.8 m/year, at least locally. Since manure-treated fields represent by far the largest land area of the dairy, proper nutrient management will be a key to protecting groundwater quality in dairy regions overlying alluvial aquifers.

This research studied, for Belgian farming conditions, (i) the effect of subsurface drainage density on nitrate losses and (ii) the economics of nitrate losses, using the nitrogen version of the pro-ram DRAINMOD-N. DRAINMOD was used to simulate the performance of the drainage system of the Hooibeckhoeve experiment, situated in the sandy region of the Kempen (Belgium) for a 14-year (1985-1998) period, A continuous cropping with maize was assumed. Daily NO3-N losses were predicted for a range of drain spacings and depths, two drainage strategies (conventional and controlled), and three fertilizer application rates (225, 275, and 325 kg N ha(-1)). Losses of N in subsurface drainage were assumed to occur almost entirely in the NO3-N form. Losses of organic and inorganic N in the form of NO3-N in surface runoff are small and were neglected. Hydrologic results indicated that increasing drain spacing or decreasing drain depth reduces drainage discharge while it increases runoff. The use of controlled drainage reduces subsurface drainage and increases runoff. Results also revealed that increasing the drain spacing or decreasing the drain depth reduces nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) drainage losses and net mineralization, while increasing denitrification and runoff losses, Controlled drainage caused a predicted reduction in drainage losses and an increase in denitrification and runoff losses. The optimal combination of drain density and management is one that maximizes profits and minimizes environmental impacts. Simulated results indicated that NO3-N losses to the environment could be substantially reduced by reducing the drainage density below the level required for maximum profits based on grain sales. The study concluded that, if the environmental objective is of importance equal to or greater than profits, drainage systems can be designed and managed to reduce NO3-N losses while still providing an acceptable profit.

J	Brezonik, PL; Stadelmann, TH				Brezonik, PL; Stadelmann, TH			Analysis and predictive models of stormwater runoff volumes, loads, and pollutant concentrations from watersheds in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, Minnesota, USA	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						urban stormwater; urban runoff; diffuse-source pollution; nutrients; nitrogen; phosphorus; event-mean concentrations; event loads		Urban nonpoint source pollution is a significant contributor to water quality degradation. Watershed planners need to be able to estimate nonpoint source loads to takes and streams if they are to plan effective management strategies. To meet this need for the twin cities metropolitan area, a large database of urban and suburban runoff data was compiled. Stormwater runoff loads and concentrations of 10 common constituents (six N and P forms, TSS, VSS, COD, Pb) were characterized, and effects of season and land use were analyzed. Relationships between runoff variables and storm and watershed characteristics were examined. The best regression equation to predict runoff volume for rain events was based on rainfall amount, drainage area, and percent impervious area (R-2 = 0.78). Median event-mean concentrations (EMCs) tended to be higher in snowmelt runoff than in rainfall runoff, and significant seasonal differences were found in yields (kg/ha) and EMCs for most constituents, Simple correlations between explanatory variables and stormwater loads and EMCs were weak. Rainfall amount and intensity and drainage area were the most important variables in multiple linear regression models to predict event loads, but uncertainty was high in models developed with the pooled data set. The most accurate models for EMCs generally were found when sites were grouped according to common land use and size. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Chau, KW				Chau, KW			Field measurements of SOD and sediment nutrient fluxes in a land-locked embayment in Hong Kong	ADVANCES IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Tolo Harbour; water quality; sediment oxygen demand; nutrient release	OXYGEN	The pollution problem in Hong Kong has increased over the past two decades, and the situation in the nearly land-locked Tolo Harbour, located at the north-eastern part of the territories, has been particularly problematic. Although the exogenous organic materials dissolved in the overlying water have been substantially reduced, the soft sediments at the bottom of the harbour continue to act as sources of nutrients. This sediment oxygen demand (SOD) amounts to a significant value, hence increasing the total oxygen demand load of the harbour. In this paper, the current state of the water environment is reviewed. The SOD and the rate of nutrient release in different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus were measured in laboratory experiments. It was found from the laboratory tests that the average SOD value is 38 MgO2/m(2)-h and that the mean release rates of phosphate phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen are, respectively, 3 and 62 mg/m(2) -d. These measured field data will be useful in understanding the water quality of the water body and also provide parameters that may be used when developing numerical water quality models for Tolo Harbour.

J	Humphry, JB; Daniel, TC; Edwards, DR; Sharpley, AN				Humphry, JB; Daniel, TC; Edwards, DR; Sharpley, AN			A portable rainfall simulator for plot-scale runoff studies	APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						rain simulator; runoff; water quality; erosion	EXTRACTABLE SOIL-PHOSPHORUS; EROSION	Rainfall simulators have a long history of successful use in both laboratory and field investigations. Man), plot-scale simulators, however have been difficult to operate and transport in the field, especially in remote locations where water or electricity is unavailable. This article describes a new rainfall simulator that is relatively easy to operate and transport to and from the field while maintaining critical intensity, distribution, and energy characteristics of natural rainfall. The simulator frame is constructed from lightweight aluminum pipe with a single 50 WSQ nozzle centered at a height of 3 m (9.8 ft). An operating nozzle pressure of 28 kPa (4.1 psi) yields continuous flow at an intensity of 70 min h(-1) (2.8 in. h(-1)) over a 1.5- x 2-m (4.9- x 6.6-ft) plot area with a coefficient of uniformity of 93%. Kinetic energy of the rainfall is about 25 J m(-2) mm(-1) (142.8ft-lb ft(-2) in.(-1)), approximately 87% of natural rainfall. The simulator can be easily, transported by two field personnel and completely assembled or disassembled in approximately. 10 min. Water usage is at a minimum as the simulator utilizes only one nozzle.

Material collected in sediment traps and soil samples were analyzed for organic carbon, total nitrogen, iron and aluminum concentrations. A dilution analysis method was used to differentiate between sedimented and resuspended particles. The rates of sedimentation and resuspension estimated from total solids increased during the experiment, ranging from 49.8 to 218.1 g/m(2) per day in the case of sedimentation and from 39.2 to 160.0 g/n(2) per day in the case of resuspension. Although fish weight increased through time, the relative resuspension did not change significantly, ranging from 42 to 47% of the total collected material. Total solids sedimentation and resuspension rates were highly correlated (Pless than or equal to0.01) to fish weight and biomass, chlorophyll-a, total suspended solids, total feed input and Secchi disk visibility.

I improvement purposes. We calibrated our model using field data on the japonica For water quality growth. reproduction. and mortality of P.japonica individuals collected over one growing season in 1997 (May-October). The model effectively predicted seasonal changes in the number of the individuals (r(2)=0.89), aboveground biomass (r(2) = 0.85). and nitrogen concentration (r(2) = 0.91). Total nitrogen. however. was poorly explained by Our model (r(2) = 0.53). To evaluate the effects of biomass removal (e.g. harvest or grazing) on Phragmites management strategies, removal was simulated by manipulating the intensity and period of biomass loss. Distinct patterns in population density and biomass were produced in intensity-period phase planes. suggesting that population dynamics are influenced by a strong relationship between disturbance intensity and period. In addition, the highest rates of nitrogen removal by P. japonica occurred for high-density populations that maintained relatively lock biomass levels. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The aim of the modelling approach developed for the Danube River, is to establish how land use and management of the whole watershed are linked to nutrient (N, P, Si) delivery and retention by the river. The approach uses an adaptation of the RIVERSTRAHLER model, which is based on a schematic representation of the drainage network deduced from geomorphological analysis by stream orders. The whole catchment was divided into 10 sub-basins and one branch, to provide a description satisfying both the need to take into account the heterogeneity of the system and the availability of constraints and validation data. On the basis of this description, a hydrological model was developed, which adequately simulated the seasonal variations of the discharge measured at the outlet of the basin. The model itself resulted from the coupling of the hydrological model with a biogeochemical model (RIVE), which takes into account the main ecological processes. It established a link between microscopic processes, their controlling factors and their macroscopic manifestations in terms of nutrient cycling and ecological functioning at the scale of the whole drainage network. The model was validated for the period from 1988 to 1991 on the basis of available observations of the major water-quality variables involved in the eutrophication processes (inorganic nutrients, phytoplankton biomass, dissolved oxygen, etc.). A reasonable agreement was found between the simulations of the model and the observations. Nutrient fluxes to the Black Sea, calculated for our reference period, are in the same range as those obtained via other approaches. Si/P and N/P ratios suggest silicon, rather than phosphorus, limitation for diatoms and phosphorus, rather than nitrogen, limitation for overall phytoplankton in the coastal zone of the Black Sea. The sharp drop in N and P delivery to the Black Sea, observed since 1991, was simulated with a scenario constructed to reproduce new constraints based on documented modifications of human activity in the watershed. Due to the scarcity of data, there is a need for further validation of the model. Nevertheless, the structure of the model allows the specificity of each sub-basin to be taken into account in future management plans. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, standard monitoring data from the River Avon in Warwickshire, U.K. were used to estimate in-river loads. A novel aspect was the application of uncalibrated P run-off coefficients from the literature to areas of different land-use to estimate the diffuse P load. Point source P-loads were estimated either from monitoring data or from published export coefficient values. Analysis of the data showed that the main source of variability in the estimate of in-river loads was from the flow data, which, at many sites, did not cover a sufficient range of natural flow rates to allow reliable estimates of the annual load to be made. Analysis of data from 20 sites where this condition was fulfilled showed that, in the large, urbanised (15% land cover) River Avon catchment the use of uncalibrated run-off coefficients gave reliable estimates of diffuse loads.

An empirical model predicting flow-weighted phosphorus concentrations (MRP) was derived using data collected from 35 Irish river catchments. Monitoring records of riverine P and stream now data were used to calculate MRP values averaged for the years 1991-1994. These data were modeled using land use, soil type, and soil P data. Soil type in catchments was described using soil survey classifications weighted according to their P desorption properties from laboratory results. Soil test P concentrations for the studied watersheds were obtained from a national database. Soil P levels ere weighted based on the results of field experiments measuring P losses in overland flow from fields at different soil test P levels. The 35 catchments were statistically clustered into two populations (A and B) based on differences in soil type, specifically, soil hydrology. Catchments in Cluster A had predominantly poorly drained soils and comparatively higher MRP concentrations (0.03-0.17 mg L-1) than Cluster B areas (0.01-0.7 mg L-1) with mostly well-drained soils. Regression equations derived for A and B type catchments predicted MRP values with 68 and 62% of the variation explained in the models, respectively. Data extracted for the rest of the country were applied to the models to delineate areas at risk on a national scale. While the models were only, moderately accurate they highlighted the influence of land management, specifically, high production grassland receiving high P inputs, in conjunction with the effect of soil type and soil hydrology on the transport of P to surface waters.

We found that chlorophyll extractions with hot ethanol gave values that were no different from those obtained with the standard method of grinding with acetone. In a comparative study of 125 lakes we found the data collected by volunteers were comparable to those collected by professionals. Mean Secchi disk depth, TP, TN, and chlorophyll values obtained by the citizens were strongly correlated (r > 0.99) to the mean values obtained by the professionals. To determine if freezing was a valid means of preserving water samples prior to analysis, we compared estimates of chlorophyll, TP, TN, pH, total alkalinity, and specific conductance obtained from fresh samples with estimates obtained from samples frozen up to 150 days. For most lakes there was little difference in chemical measurements made in samples preserved by freezing for different lengths of time, and various statistical tests indicated that freezing was a valid means of preserving take water samples prior to analysis. Water quality data produced by volunteer samplers following the LAKEWATCH protocols were just as good as those from samples collected by professional biologists and handled using standard methods of sample preservation. The fact that volunteers can collect credible data means that lake management agencies could amplify their limited budgets by using volunteer monitoring, to sample more lakes and to sample them more frequently.

J	Vadas, PA; Sims, JT				Vadas, PA; Sims, JT			Predicting phosphorus desorption from Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain soils	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL			English	Article							SOLUBLE PHOSPHORUS; KINETICS; PHOSPHATE; RUNOFF; SORPTION; OXALATE; RELEASE	Pollution of surface waters by P from agricultural areas is a water quality issue in Delaware. The FHANTM 2.0 computer model can help identify areas with a high potential for P loss, but the model's representation of P desorption from soils to runoff waters needs reevaluation. The equation, P-d = K P-0 t(alpha) W-beta, has been proposed to predict such P desorption, but equations originally proposed to predict values for the constants K, alpha, and beta from the ratio of soil clay content/soil organic C content may not be accurate for Delaware soils. Therefore, we measured P desorption for 23 sandy Delaware soils for times of 5 to 180 min, water/soil ratios of 10 to 1000 L kg(-1), and three initial levels of soil desorbable P. Values for the constants K, alpha, and beta were calculated and related to soil properties. We found that K, alpha, and beta values were not well related to clay/OC, but were better related to the ratio of oxalate-extractable Fe/OC content (alpha) or the sum of oxalate extractable Fe and Al (beta and K). These results can be used to help refine the FHANTM 2.0 model in predicting P loss from agricultural areas in Delaware and similar landscapes in the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain.

One proposed way out is the calibration and validation against additional observations, such as snow, soil moisture, groundwater or water quality. A general problem, however, when calibrating the model against more than one variable is the strategy for parameter estimation. The most straightforward method is to calibrate the model components sequentially. Recent results show that in this way the model may be locked up in a parameter setting, which is good enough for one variable but excludes proper simulation of other variables. This is particularly the case for water quality modelling, where a small compromise in terms of runoff simulation may lead to dramatically better simulations of water quality. This calls for an integrated model calibration procedure with a criterion that integrates more aspects on model performance than just river runoff. The use of multi-variable parameter estimation and internal control of the HBV hydrological model is discussed and highlighted by two case studies. The first example is from a forested basin in northern Sweden and the second one is from an agricultural basin in the south of the country. A new calibration strategy, which is integrated rather than sequential, is proposed and tested. It is concluded that comparison of model results with more measurements than only runoff can lead to increased confidence in the physical relevance of the model, and that the new calibration strategy can be useful for further model development.

The objective of the modelling was: (1) to characterize better the flow and nitrate transport in the groundwater and to determine the characteristic times of the system; (2) to explore the consequences of changes in nitrate leaching to groundwater on nitrate concentration in stream water. The finite-difference code MODFLOW was used to simulate the distribution of hydraulic head within the groundwater. Nitrate transport was described by the convection equation solved using MT3D. MODPATH was also used to analyse flow paths and travel times in the groundwater. Four units were considered in the model: (i) the plough layer, (ii) the soil, (iii) the weathered shale and (iv) the fissured shale. Autotrophic denitrification in the shale and partly in the weathered shale was represented, as well as heterotrophic denitrification in the upper horizon of bottom land. A steady-state average flow was assumed with a spatially uniform groundwater recharge of 2 mm day(-1), corresponding to the winter mean daily recharge observed in the Kervidy catchment. Nitrate recharge rate was fixed at 100 mg l(-1), which is equivalent to a nitrogen flux of 165 kg ha(-1) year(-1). Six scenarios of nitrate leaching changes were analysed with the model. The first two correspond to spatially uniform decreases of the nitrate recharge rate to 80 and 60 mg l(-1), respectively. In the other four scenarios, nitrate recharge rate was spatially distributed along the hillslope so that the average nitrogen flux remained equal to 165 kg ha(-1) year(-1). Simulated hydraulic heads were similar to observed values along the hillslope, except for the summit. The transport model reproduced the spatial pattern of nitrate concentrations observed in the weathered shale groundwater, a deviation appearing only in the nearest piezometer to the stream. Travel times within the groundwater appeared to be highly variable, from a few days up to 3 years. Scenario analysis showed that a significant decrease of stream nitrate concentration can be expected following a global decrease in nitrate leaching along the hillslope. However, the fall could be very gradual in time. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

This model, process-based and spatially distributed in order to take spatial interactions into account, has been kept as simple as possible. Here, only the hydrological module is discussed. The two main hypotheses of the hydrological model are taken from the TOPMODEL concept (constant hydraulic gradient equal to slope and hydraulic conductivity decreasing exponentially with depth). The model is based on a daily water balance for each cell of a regular square grid and computes an explicit cell-to-cell routing. Transfer through the vadose zone is simulated using a conceptual, layer-based algorithm analogous to the Burns model, except that a drainage water reservoir has been added to simulate mobile/immobile water processes and variations of the water table within the soil. The crop growth and nitrogen transformations are simulated using the equations of a generic plant-soil model, STICS. As an example, a preliminary study of the effect of the catchment geomorphology on denitrification is presented. The study was performed on theoretical catchments with contrasted slope shapes and pathway patterns. Results show that the whole-catchment denitrification depends on catchment geomorphology, although not directly through the extent of saturated areas. It is concluded that TNT2 seems to be a powerful tool to explore catchment processes, both by application to actual cases and by exploration on simple scenarios.

One ecological consequence of urbanization is higher concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) in streams, lakes, and estuaries. When received in excess, N and P are considered pollutants. Continuing urbanization will change the relative distribution of extant natural resources. Characteristics of the landscape can shape its response to disturbances such as urbanization. Changes in landscape characteristics across a region create a geographic pattern of vulnerability to increased N and P as a result of urbanization. We linked nutrient-export risk and urbanization models in order to identify areas most vulnerable to increases in nutrient-export risk due to projected urbanization. A risk-based model of N and P export exceeding specified thresholds was developed based on the extant distribution of forest, agriculture, and urban land cover. An empirical model of urbanization was used to increase urban land cover at the expense of forest and agriculture. The modeled (future) land cover was input into the N and P export risk model, and the "before" and "after" estimates of N and P export were compared to identify the areas most vulnerable to change. Increase in N and P export had to be equal to or greater than the accumulated uncertainties in the nutrient-export risk and urbanization models for an area to be considered vulnerable. The areas most vulnerable to increased N and P export were not spatially coincident with the areas of greatest urbanization. Vulnerability also depended on the geographic distribution of forest and agriculture. In general, the areas most vulnerable to increased N exports were where the modeled urbanization rate was at least 20% and the amount of forest was about 6 times greater than the amount of agriculture. For P, the most vulnerable areas were where the modeled urbanization rate was at least 20% and the amount of forest was about 2 times greater than the amount of agriculture. Vulnerability to increased N and P export was the result of two interacting spatial patterns, urbanization and the extant distribution of land cover. It could not be predicted from either alone.

J	Pei, HP; Ma, JY				Pei, HP; Ma, JY			Study on the algal dynamic model for West Lake, Hangzhou	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						algae; dynamic model; eutrophication; West Lake		An algal dynamic model describing the ecosystem of West Lake, Hangzhou, one of the typical shallow and eutrophic lakes, was proposed. The model consists of 13 state variables such as biomass of four main algae (Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta and Bacillariophyta) and respective content of phosphorus, biomass of zooplankton, the content of phosphorus in zooplankton, orthophosphate, phosphorus in detritus and phosphorus in sediment. Model simulation was carried out on year time scale to describe the dynamic change of four main algae and zooplankton. The result of model calibration and verification shows that the model can reasonably respond to the changes of forcing function in lake ecosystem. The model compares the possible changes of water quality with changes of drawing water quantity, phosphorus content of drawing water and stream water and removing quantity of sediment. The model has been used to simulate the dynamic changing of the four main algae with the measure taken. It shows that the measure by removing phosphorus in sediment is most available, and the biomass of Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, Cryptophyta will descend obviously. Furthermore, the improvement of water quality with above measures is also evaluated. On the basis of the results of the simulations, the best management strategy limiting eutrophication processes in West Lake has been pointed out. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Gove, L; Nicholson, FA; Cook, HF; Beck, AJ				Gove, L; Nicholson, FA; Cook, HF; Beck, AJ			Comparison of the effect of surface application and subsurface incorporation of enhanced treated biosolids on the leaching of heavy metals and nutrients through sand and sandy loam soils	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						nitrogen; phosphorus; compost; sewage sludges	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON; SEWAGE-SLUDGE; TRANSPORT; PHOSPHORUS; ADSORPTION; NITROGEN; CADMIUM	Use of enhanced treated biosolids such as composted and dried, mesophilic anaerobically digested, dewatered (MADD) biosolids is becoming more popular. This is mainly in response to concerns over the potential for pathogens to enter the food chain. There is, therefore, a need to investigate how enhanced treatment, and methods by which these biosolids are applied, affects the leaching potential of metal and nutrients to ensure that water quality is not compromised. MADD cake (fresh, dried and composted) and MAD liquid sludge were applied by surface application and subsurface incorporation to sand (typic quartzipsamments, %OM = 3.0, pH = 6.5), sandy loam (typic hapludalf, %OM = 4.8, pH = 7.6) and silversand 'repacked semi-structured cores' (0.2 in by 0.1 m diameter) at rates equivalent to 250 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Leaching of Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, N and P was investigated following application of five 8 h simulated rainfall events (4.9 nun h(-1)) in the laboratory. Little difference was observed between leaching of metals and nutrients from soils amended with enhanced treated biosolids (dried and composted MADD cakes) compared with conventional biosolids (fresh MADD cake and MAD liquid). Subsurface incorporation increased the risk of P and metal leaching compared with surface application. Nitrate losses were independent of application method. Similar nutrient losses from control and amended cores indicated that the leaching was derived predominantly from the soil clay and organic matter complexes. Evidence for attenuation of biosolids-derived metals and P by soil-derived clay and/or organic matter was found. Water balance data showed that hydrological regimes of each core were comparable and unlikely to account for observed differences in leaching losses.

J	De Oliveira, V; Ecker, MD				De Oliveira, V; Ecker, MD			Bayesian hot spot detection in the presence of a spatial trend: application to total nitrogen concentration in Chesapeake Bay	ENVIRONMETRICS			English	Article						Box-Cox family; median function; Monte Carlo; random field; sentivariogram; spatial prediction	CONTAMINATION; PREDICTION	Extreme concentrations of water quality variables can cause serious adverse effects in an ecosystem, making their detection an important environmental issue. In Chesapeake Bay, a decreasing gradient of total nitrogen concentration extends from the hi-hest values in the north at the mouth of the Susquehanna river to the lowest values in the south near the Atlantic ocean. We propose a general definition of 'hot spot' that includes previous definitions and is appealing for processes with a spatial trend. We model these data using the Bayesian Transformed Gaussian (BTG) random field model proposed by De Oliveira et al. (1997), which combines the Box-Cox family of power transformations and a spatial trend. The median function is used as the measure of spatial trend, which offers some advantages over the customarily used mean function. The BTG model is fitted by an enhanced Monte Carlo algorithm, and the methodology is applied to the nitrogen concentration data. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

Measurements of suspended sediments, inorganic nutrients (NO3-, NH4+, PO43-), chlorophyll a (chl a),. and salinity were taken monthly from December 1996 to January 1998. These data were compiled by season, and the Atchafalaya River plume data were also analyzed using the Generalized Additive Model technique. There were significant decreases in NO3- concentrations dining summer, fall, and winter as river water passed through the estuary, that were attributable to chemical and biological processes rather than dilution with ambient water. In some regions there were higher chl a concentrations during summer and fall compared to winter and spring, when river discharge and the introduction of inorganic nutrients were highest, suggesting biological processes were active during this study. The presence of NH4+, as a percentage of available dissolved inorganic nitrogen, increased with distance from the Atchafalaya River, indicative of remineralization processes and NO3- reduction. Mean PO43- concentrations were often higher in the estuarine regions compared to the Atchafalaya River. Dining summer total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations increased with distance from the river mouth, suggesting a turbidity maximum. Highest chl a concentrations were found in the bayous and shallow water bodies of the Terrebonne marshes, as were the lowest TSS concentrations. The low chl a concentrations found in other areas of this study, despite high inorganic nutrient concentrations, suggest light limitation as the major control of phytoplankton growth. Salinity reached near seawater concentrations at the outer edge of the Atchafalaya River plume, but much lower salinities (< 10 psu) were observed at all other regions. The Atchafalaya Delta estuarine complex buffers the impact of the Atchafalaya River on the Louisiana coastal shelf zone, with a 41% to 47% decrease in Atchafalaya River NO3- concentrations before reaching Gulf waters.

The lakes ranged from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic with total algal chlorophylls ranging from 1 to 241 mg m(-3). There were strong positive correlations between planktonic chlorophylls and total phosphorus and total nitrogen, but there were weak inverse relationships between the densities of periphyton and the trophic state indicators total phosphorus, total nitrogen and algal chlorophyll and a positive relationship with Secchi depth. There was no predictable relationship between the abundance of emergent, floating-leaved, and submersed aquatic vegetation and the trophic state indicators. It was only at the highest levels of nutrient concentrations that submersed macrophytes were predictably absent and the lakes were algal dominated. Below these levels, macrophyte abundance could be high or low. The phosphorus-chlorophyll and phosphorus-Secchi depth relationships were not influenced by the amounts of aquatic vegetation present indicating that the role of macrophytes in clearing lakes may be primarily to reduce nutrient concentrations for a given level of loading. Rather than nutrient concentrations controlling macrophyte abundance, it seems that macrophytes acted to modify nutrient concentrations.

Dissolved oxygen, suspended matter, phosphate, nitrite and nitrate were seemingly not affected by the farm. High concentrations of ammonia were clearly observed close to the raft. but rapidly vanished a short distance from it. when the fish biomass was at least 576 tonnes. At that time the nitrogen loadings from the farm were estimated at 101 kg/day. On the site, phytoplankton was similar to that of the nearby French coastal area of the English Channel. concerning generic composition (extensively dominated by diatoms) and the seasonal succession of genera. The farm did not cause any increase of faecal coliform bacteria. At this stock level. the dispersal characteristics of the farm site greatly reduced its apparent impact on the water quality.

J	Basnet, BB; Apan, AA; Raine, SR				Basnet, BB; Apan, AA; Raine, SR			Geographic information system based manure application plan	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						GIS; site suitability; weighted linear combination model; manure application plan	WATER-QUALITY; RUNOFF WATER; MANAGEMENT	A geographic information system (GIS) based manure application plan has been developed for the site-specific application of animal waste to agricultural fields in the Westbrook sub-catchment of the Murray-Darling Basin, south-east Queensland, Australia. Sites suitable for animal waste application were identified using a GIS based weighted linear combination (WLC) model. The degree of land suitability for animal waste application was determined using a range of social, economic, environmental, and agricultural factors. As eutrophication and toxic blue-green algae blooms are a known problem in the catchment, the manure application rates were limited to the rate of crop phosphorus removal. Maximum manure application rate was calculated spatially by taking the crop nutrient (P2O5) requirement and the manure nutrient (P2O5) content into account. The environmental suitability of the fields receiving animal waste was considered in prescribing the final application rate of solid and liquid manures generated by local animal production facilities. The degree of site suitability of the agricultural fields was also used to suggest manure management practices to minimise the socio-environmental risks and increase the nutrient use efficiency of the applied manure. The amount of ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) that would be added to the soil by satisfying the P2O5 requirement using manure sources was also calculated and an applied NH4-N map was created. This map could be used to assist farmers identify additional nitrogen requirements after manure application. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Canonical correspondence analysis with single treatment and with forward selection of environmental variables was used to detect 11 important ecological variables (dissolved inorganic carbon [DIC], Na+, total phosphorus [TP], dissolved organic carbon [DOC], total nitrogen [TN], pH, oxygen saturation, dissolved iron, SO42-, NH4+, soluble reactive silicium) and maximum water depth or Ca2+ or soluble reactive phosphorus that most independently explain major proportions of the total diatom variance among the habitats. Monte Carlo permutation tests showed that each contributed a significant additional proportion (P < 0.05) of the variance in species composition. Together, these 11 most important environmental variables explained 34% of the total variance in species composition among the sites and captured 73% of the explained variance from the full 21 parameters model. Weighted-averaging regression and calibration of 304 indicator taxa with tolerance down-weighting and classic deshrinking was used to develop transfer functions between littoral diatoms and DIC, pH, TP, TN, and Cl-. The DOC:TP ratio was introduced and a weighted-averaging model was developed to infer allochthonous DOC effects in freshwater ecosystems. This diatom-DOC/TP model was significant (P < 0.001) and explained 7.6% of the total diatom variance among the sites, surpassing the inferential power of the diatom-TP-transfer function (7.3% explained variance). The root-mean-square errors of prediction of the models were estimated by jack-knifing and were comparable with published data sets from surface sediment diatom samples. The data set of littoral diatoms and environmental variables allows use of the diatom-environmental transfer functions in biomonitoring and paleolimnological approaches across a broad array of natural water resources (such as floodplains, flushed lakes, estuaries, shallow lakes) in the central European lowland ecoregion.

Results were obtained with 12 weighable, monolithic lysimeters with a surface area of I m 2, a total depth of 3 m, and free drainage. Mean annual N-leaching losses of 5 to 44 kg ha(-1) and nitrate concentrations of the seepage water (leachate) between 80 and 200 mg 1(-1) were measured during the period of intensive agricultural use. On fallow land with a well-established grass vegetation, some nitrate was removed by the plants. As a result, the nitrate concentrations in the leachate were reduced significantly. Ecological farming measures generally reduced N leaching losses and kept the N-concentration in the leachate below the German threshold value for drinking water with 50 mg 1-1 nitrate. However, ploughing in of clover or leguminous vegetation and the application of farmyard manure in autumn caused the nitrate concentration in the leachate to rise significantly above the mentioned threshold value.

The age model of the sediment core is based on varve counting and Cs-137/Pb-210 dating and reveals that the sedimentary record covers the last 70 years, during which the lake has undergone major changes in productivity and eutrophication in response to nutrient loading. Since 1965, TOC, TIC, TN and TP accumulation rates in general reflect the change from oligo-/mesotrophic to eutrophic level. The isotopic compositions of autochthonous organic matter and authigenic calcite (whitings) demonstrate that carbon isotope fractionation takes place in a CO2-limited pool. In accordance with the historical limnological observations, enhanced eutrophication is reflected by delta(13)C(TOC) increases of over 3 parts per thousand from 1934 to 1985 as a result of less C-12/C-13 fractionation by photosynthesis during intense primary productivity. Decreasing delta(13)C(TIC) values indicate that biogenically induced calcite formation occurred during enhanced primary production accompanied by CO2 limitation. The gradual trend to more light nitrogen isotopic signatures towards the sediment surface reflects the dominance of air nitrogen fixation of cyanobacteria blooms during the last decades. The delta(18)O(TIC) distribution suggests that plankton blooms between 1934 and 1978 had shifted towards the early season with lower temperatures as a result of increasing nutrient level, which subsequently favor plankton blooms even in colder waters. Since the mid 1980s, decreasing delta(13)C(TOC) and increasing delta(13)C(TIC) values since 1985 indicate a more efficient C-12/C-13 fractionation during photosynthesis with no CO2 limitation. This improvement in water quality is in accordance with several remediation measures carried out since the late 1970s, Linear isotopic trends are interrupted by high TIC, TOC, TN and TP accumulation rates in the early 1970s, which can be clearly attributed to the artificial drainage of a nearby wetland carried out during that time. This event can be considered an important external source for nutrient-loaded water and particulate matter and is displayed by significantly heavier delta(13)C(TIC) and delta(18)O(TIC) values in the sedimentary record.

J	Hume, NP; Fleming, MS; Horne, AJ				Hume, NP; Fleming, MS; Horne, AJ			Plant carbohydrate limitation on nitrate reduction in wetland microcosms	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						carbon quality; denitrification; kinetics; plants; wetland	NITROGEN REMOVAL; SURFACE WETLANDS; WATER; DENITRIFICATION	Although nitrate limitation in most natural wetlands results in pseudo-first-order reductions, large site-to-site variations in apparent denitrification rates cannot be easily explained by water quality (e.g., pH, Temp, DOC) or plant productivity. Our microcosm results show increasing nitrate removal efficiencies at higher ratios of total applied plant carbon to nitrate reduced, suggesting that denitrification rates may be limited by the rates of supply of both electron donor or acceptor, described by an applied carbon to nitrate (C-App: N-Red) ratio. However, the observed first-order rate constants varied more strongly (r(2) = 0.77, p <0.000l) with the acid-soluble carbohydrates to nitrate (CH2OApp: N-Red) ratio than the total C-App: N-Red ratio. Although observed rate constants for bulrush (Scirpus sp.) were significantly lower (0.01 < p < 0.06) than for other plant sources (Hydrocotyle sp.. Lemna sp., Typha sp.), there were no significant differences in the plant-specific rate constants when compared at the same CH2OApp: N-Red ratio. In full-scale wetlands, this suggests that either high plant productivity or low NO3- loading (high CH2OApp: N-Red) may contribute to a high effective denitrification rate. In contrast, low productivity or a high NO3- loading (low CH2OApp: N-Red) would promote a lower denitrification rate. This co-limitation between plant carbon and nitrate may confound first-order rate comparisons in full scale denitrification wetlands since highly N-loaded systems may become carbon limited, requiring higher order reaction kinetics to better describe performance variations. In addition to hydraulic residence time, temperature and nitrate removal data, extending these results to compare large wetlands will require estimation of the CH2OApp: N-Red ratio from an inventory of plant species, productivity estimates and carbon quality.

It was decided that this concentration should be lowered to about 2 mg Pl(-1) to maintain a safe nitrogen: phosporus (N : P) ratio of about 10. Before deciding what type of treatment to use for the removal of phosphorus, a P budget was estimated for 1998 in order to evaluate the different pathways of phosphorus in the mesocosm. The resulting budget had only a 1% difference between the inputs (CV = 12.9%) and the sum of the outputs and changes in P pools (CV = 12.5%). P inputs amounted to 40.5 kg for 1998: food for fish and invertebrates contributed 76% of the inputs while seabird guano contributed 20%. Filtration and general cleaning removed 51% of the inputs while water losses removed 22%. The slight but constant difference between total phosphorus and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in 1998 and previous years led us to believe that only DRP (mostly orthophosphate) accumulated in the system. The accumulation of DRP was 10% of the inputs in 1998. The budget showed that the importance of water losses is relative and depends on the DRP concentration in the SLM. Furthermore, it was possible to compare this P budget with an N budget of the SLM prepared in 1995. The comparison helped us understand why nitrate in closed-circuit mesocosms are characterized by a high, never-ending accumulation while DRP is characterized by a net increase in the first few years after start-up followed by a very small increase in the following years. Considering its low CV, this P budget was considered a useful water quality management tool in designing a P removal unit for the SLM. This budget may also serve as a guideline for managers of closed-circuit systems such as marine aquariums and aquacultures as well as for designers of P removal units. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The effects of treatment are examined in relation to-boron, a conservative tracer of sewage effluent and in terms of the relative contributions of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) loads from point and diffuse sources, and in-stream SRP loads. These results indicate a baseline reduction in in-stream SRP concentrations immediately following P-treatment of approximately 72%. Subsequent high flows result in a greater contribution of diffuse inputs and increases in SRP levels relative to the initial post-treatment period. The dynamics of SRP and particulate phosphorus (PP) are examined under a wide range of river flow conditions. Given the flashy nature of near-surface runoff in the River Kennet, sub-weekly (daily automated) sampling was used to examine the dynamics in SRP and PP concentrations in response to storm events. Simple empirical models linking weekly SRP concentrations with flow were developed. The empirical models were successfully applied to the daily data, to partition TP measurements and provide an estimate of daily SRP and PP concentrations. Mass balance studies were used to examine net gains and losses along the experimental river reach and indicate large net losses (up to 60%) during the extreme low flows and high SRP concentrations prior to P-treatment, which may be linked to extensive epiphytic growth. Phosphorus dynamics and response to P-treatment are discussed in relation to hydrological controls in permeable chalk catchments and wider implications for eutrophication management are examined.

Mass balance	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						stream water quality; eutrophication; phosphorus; point source; diffuse source	LAND-USE CHANGE; SOLUBLE PHOSPHORUS; STREAM; PHOSPHATE; WATERS; SOIL; TRANSPORT; DYNAMICS; SEDIMENT; IMPACT	The relative magnitudes of annual diffuse and point source loads of phosphorus (P) to the River Thame were estimated from daily and monthly measurements of discharge and concentration. Existing data from gauging and monitoring sites on the river network and at point sources were supplemented by survey data at a range of spatial scales. Results showed that during low flow periods most of the P could be attributed to point sources, while at high flows the figure was less than 10%. The introduction of P stripping at Aylesbury, a major sewage treatment works in the catchment, was estimated to have reduced the annual load of P from the sewage treatment works by approximately 45 t, with a similar reduction in loss from the catchment. This gave a reduction in low flow concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) from 2.5 to 1.7 mg l(-1). Concentrations of SRP in river water remain above eutrophication thresholds because of the influence of other STWs in the catchment and insufficient natural discharge to dilute this.

The findings are related to issues of groundwater supplies and the introduction of phosphorus treatment of effluent from the Marlborough sewage treatment works (STW) at part of the way along the study reach. Being supplied from a Cretaceous Chalk aquifer, the Kennet is mainly of a calcium-bicarbonate type and has a relatively constant composition of many major water quality determinands. Typically, the waters average a pH of approximately eight (range approx. 7.5-8.5) during the day with the lowest values occurring at the upstream site. Dissolved carbon dioxide varies from approximately 5 to 35 times atmospheric pressure during the late morning with the highest values occurring at the upstream site. However, in-stream biological activity gives rise to marked diurnal fluctuations in pH and dissolved carbon dioxide concentrations and during the summer months, by mid to late afternoon, pH is at its maximum and dissolved carbon dioxide is at its lowest: this is shown by continuous measurements at one of the river sites. Alkalinity and calcium concentrations remain relatively constant at approximately 4700 muEq/l (range 3500-6000 muEq/l) and 120 mg/l (range 85-150 mg/l), respectively, and the waters are oversaturated with respect to calcium carbonate (calcite) typically by a factor of six (range 2-25). Along the reach, soluble reactive phosphate (SRP) increases from the first to the second site with the introduction of sewage supplies from the Marlborough STW, and then declines further downstream as sewage dilution and uptake by the river bed/aquatic plants increases. The differences in concentration decrease after phosphorus removal from Marlborough STW. Despite this change, there is no clear indication of any calcite solubility control except perhaps at times of extreme baseflow during the growing season when within-stream photosynthesis is maximal and within-stream residence times are longer. A comparison of river and groundwater data shows that the groundwaters have similar alkalinities and calcium concentrations. However, the groundwaters have (a) higher carbon dioxide saturations (a factor of 2-5 times the value for the river), (b) lower pHs (0.5-1.5 units), Q lower SRP concentrations (a quarter or less of the river values) and (d) waters near calcite saturation (unlike the surface waters which are oversaturated). The findings indicate a river system dominated by the input carbon dioxide laden groundwaters in approximate equilibrium with calcite attenuated by within-channel biological and physical processes. Within the river: (a) the waters degas carbon dioxide increasing the pH, producing oversaturated conditions; and (b) oscillating pH-dissolved carbon dioxide levels occur between day and night due to changing balances between photosynthesis and respiration. It seems that lowering the phosphorus levels have not resulted in calcite precipitation within the water column and that no significant within-stream self-cleansing mechanisms are occurring that might be predicted from theory: other components in the water such as dissolved organic carbon may inhibit calcite nucleation. However, the low SRP levels in the groundwater coupled with calcite saturation, may well indicate that phosphorous concentrations within the groundwater are regulated by such processes: the number of calcite nucleating sites are orders of magnitude higher and the calcite inhibitors may be less prevalent.

J	Wade, AJ; Neal, C; Smart, RP; Edwards, AC				Wade, AJ; Neal, C; Smart, RP; Edwards, AC			Calcite saturation in the River Dee, NE Scotland	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						water quality; calcium carbonate; calcite; pH; River Dee; phosphorus; carbon; basin management	WATER-QUALITY; MID-WALES; LAND-USE; CATCHMENT; PHOSPHORUS; STREAM; THAMES; CHEMISTRY; PHOSPHATE; NITROGEN	The spatial and temporal variations in calcite (calcium carbonate) solubility within the Dee basin of NE Scotland were assessed using water chemistry data gathered from a network of 59 sites monitored for water quality from June 1996 to May 1997. Calcite solubility, expressed in terms of a saturation index (SIcalcite), was determined from measured streamwater pH, Gran alkalinity and calcium concentrations and water temperature. In general, the waters of the Dee system are undersaturated with respect to calcite, though the saturation index is higher during the summer months indicating a dependency on flow conditions and biological activity. Under low-flow conditions, the streamwaters are dominated by water derived from the lower soil horizons and deeper groundwater stores and therefore, ions such as Gran alkalinity and calcium are at their highest concentrations as they are derived mainly from bedrock weathering. The influence of biological activity on the carbonate system is also evident as the observed pH and estimated EpCO(2) values indicate strong seasonal patterns, with the highest pH and lowest EpCO(2) values occurring during the summer low-flow periods. Only at three sites in the lowland region of the catchment, during the summer low-flow period, are the waters oversaturated. As such, the Dee system represents an extreme 'end-member' case when compared to many UK rivers that span both under- and oversaturated conditions during the year. Regression analysis highlights a systematic change in the SIcalcite-pH relationship in a broad cast-west direction across the Dee system. At sites draining the relatively impermeable upland areas, the regression of SICalcite against pH gives a straight line with a gradient in the range 1.6-2.4. Correspondingly, under the most extreme alkaline conditions found at sites draining lowland agricultural areas, a straight-line relationship exists but with a gradient of unity. It is concluded that these changes in the SIcalcite-pH relationship are due to variations in the bicarbonate system induced by the flow conditions and biological activity. Given the waters are undersaturated, then calcite precipitation and hence phosphorus co-precipitation cannot occur within the water column. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The investigation was based on the assessment of two flow change scenarios, which both included the simulation of decreasing total phosphorus concentrations from a sewage treatment works due to improved effluent treatment. In the first scenario, the precipitation and potential evaporation outputs from a climate change model (HadCM2 GGx) where input into the catchment model INCA to predict the mean daily flows in the reach. In the second scenario, the mean daily flows observed in a historically dry year were repeated as input to the in-stream model to simulate an extended low flow period over 2 years. The simulation results suggest that changes in the seasonal distribution of flow were not detrimental to macrophyte growth. However, the simulation of extended periods of low flow suggests that a proliferation of epiphytic algae occurs, even when the in-stream phosphorus concentrations are reduced due to effluent treatment. This epiphytic growth was predicted to reduce the macrophyte peak biomass within the reach by approximately 80%. Thus, the model simulations suggest that flow was more important in controlling the macrophyte biomass in the River Kennet, than the in-stream phosphorus concentrations, which are elevated due to agricultural diffuse sources.

J	Whitehead, PG; Johnes, PJ; Butterfield, D				Whitehead, PG; Johnes, PJ; Butterfield, D			Steady state and dynamic modelling of nitrogen in the River Kennet: impacts of land use change since the 1930s	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						water quality; River Kennet; dynamic model; land use change; nitrogen	MULTIPLE SOURCE ASSESSMENT; CATCHMENTS INCA; ENGLAND	Steady state and dynamic models have been developed and applied to the River Kennet system. Annual nitrogen exports from the land surface to the river have been estimated based on land use from the 1930s and the 1990s. Long term modelled trends indicate that there has been a large increase in nitrogen transport into the river system driven by increased fertiliser application associated with increased cereal production, increased population and increased livestock levels. The dynamic model INCA (Integrated Nitrogen in Catchments) has been applied to simulate the day-to-day transport of N from the terrestrial ecosystem to the riverine environment. This process-based model generates spatial and temporal data and reproduces the observed instream concentrations. Applying the model to current land use and 1930s land use indicates that there has been a major shift in the short term dynamics since the 1930s, with increased river and groundwater concentrations caused by both non-point source pollution from agriculture and point source discharges.

The Kennet represents a groundwater fed riverine environment impacted by agricultural and sewage sources of nutrient pollution. Descriptions of the general water quality of the area, nutrient sources, sinks and within river processes are provided together with biological responses to driving issues of agriculture, sewage treatment and climatic change. Models are developed and applied to assess the key processes involved for a highly dynamic system and to provide initial estimates of the likely responses to environmental change. Furthermore, the economic aspects of pollution control are reviewed, together with legislation issues, which are presented within the context of a landmark case known as the 'Axford Inquiry', the implications of which extend to regional and national dimensions. The paper concludes with a discussion on the present state of knowledge, key issues and future research on the science and management of groundwater fed nutrient impacted riverine systems.

Bacterial regrowth deteriorates water quality (taste and odor), accelerates corrosion, and potentially increases the risk of microbial diseases. Therefore, this research was conducted to evaluate the impact of four different advanced water treatment processes, including biological treatments such as a rotating biofilm membrane reactor (RBMR) and a biological activated carbon (BAC) filter and ultrafiltration (UF), on reduction of nutrient levels and biofilm formation potentials of the treated water entering model distribution systems (annular reactors). Our results revealed that biological treatments significantly improved the "biostability" of water leaving from the treatment plant. On average, The RBMR and BAC filter reduced easily assimilable organic carbon (AOC) concentration by half when compared with conventional treatment (multi-media filtration; MF) and ultrafiltration (from 35-49 to 18-23 gg C L-1). Consequently, biofilm formation potential was reduced by a factor of 5 to 10 (from 3,200-5, 100 to 490-710 pg ATP cm(-2)). With respect to "biostability" of water, ultrafiltration was less effective in reducing AOC concentrations. In addition, the impact of chlorine disinfection on biofilm accumulation and AOC levels in the distribution system were studied.

Firstly, a time-series TM-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data set was made for the Kamafusa Lake catchment based on 11 Landsat Thematic Mapper images and one image-based atmospheric correction algorithm-COST method. Secondly, the application of this data set in analyses of vegetation cover changes and their influences on stream water quality variation were conducted. The results showed that the concentrations of suspended solids and total nitrogen in stream water were closely correlated with the vegetation cover and depended on different land use coverage during the field surveys from April to October. Thirdly, the concentration-discharge relations (model 1: C=kQ(n)) were summarized through literature reviews, and relationship of constant k or n with vegetation cover changes was analyzed. Finally, an improved model 2: C=k'Q(n) NDVIm was proposed by incorporating the consideration of vegetation cover changes. The results showed that the model 1 is applicable to short-term period, such as storm event and snow-melting period, and the model 2 is applicable to long-term period, such as non-storm period in growth seasons. During the long-term period, the vegetation cover changes should be taken into account when studying the stream water quality variation.

In spite of a high circulation flow rate in the lake, strong thermal stratification is formed every summer. This phenomenon is caused by a huge water inflow from upper Lake Hibara, and this flux influences the water temperature quality of the epilimnion. Hence, in this study, the water balance in the lake is investigated from the viewpoint of heat balance. An increase in the acid nitrogen at the bottom of the lake is caused by high rainfall in summer. The variability of acid nitrogen due to rainfall is modeled. As a result, a denitrification rate can be estimated at the bottom of the lake.

It aimed to enhance the knowledge on prevention and reduction of water pollution and water scarcity caused by agricultural activities, especially in the moderate humid areas of the northern hemisphere. For water quality the emphasis was on nitrogen and phosphate compounds and to a lesser extent on other water quality characteristics. This paper provides an overview of the conference contributions, the discussion and the conclusions generated. The main subjects dealt with are risk assessment by monitoring, model development and decision support studies for the different levels at which policy development and water management take place: the agricultural production unit, in regions and at a national level. Attention is given to alternative approaches for policy making and the communication process between the parties involved, like policy makers, interest groups in society and scientists. The participants agreed on the Wageningen Statement, containing recommendations to governments and international organizations.

In North Carolina (NC), USA, the agencies that provide financial assistance (either state or federal funds) to producers for BMP implementation are required to document nitrogen (N), phosphorus, and sediment reductions. Recent legislation specific to nutrient sensitive river basins also requires detailed accounting of potential nutrient loading to surface and groundwaters from agriculture. In response to this need, a multi-agency effort was initiated to develop a methodology to provide quantitative estimates of nutrient dynamics that occur following the implementation of BMPs. Agencies involved in the development of this tool were North Carolina State University, the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Sciences, and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. The nitrogen loss estimation worksheet (NLEW) was developed as a field-based procedure to estimate changes in N losses from agricultural management units.

A consortium of federal and state government agencies and universities are participating in the project. Initial project results point to a nonlinear relationship between runoff P and soil P for most soils, suggesting the existence of natural thresholds in soil P, above which there is a higher risk of P loss in runoff. Other findings indicate that P release to runoff from noncalcareous soils is greater than that from calcareous soils. Over the next five years, the National P Project is expected to contribute to the development of cost-effective nutrient management strategies that target remedial activities on landscapes susceptible to P loss.

The interactions between human activities, vegetation, soil processes and hydrology are quantified with the DILAMO approach in a 32-km(2) sub-basin in northern Germany and analysed at various spatiotemporal scales. The linkage of a process-oriented model with GIS identified spatially explicit sandy areas covered with crops as quantitatively the most important input sources for nitrogen. Nitrogen loads from the sub-basin to surface water bodies were 40% less than the conditions in a scenario where the groundwater level was raised by only 30 cm. Nitrogen retention particularly increased in newly established surface flow wetlands.

The role of subsurface retention is highlighted and special attention is paid to river basins where groundwater residence times are long and leaching from arable soils represents a major source of riverine N. If measured water quality data are available as a reference, the subsurface transport and retention of N are estimated by combining models for N leaching from the root zone with models for residence times and denitrification in groundwater. Unmonitored areas are handled by statistical extrapolation of data from monitored catchments.

The efficiency of nutrient use in agriculture is used as an indicator in the proposed strategy. The estimation of nutrient efficiency is based on "on-farm" nutrient balances. This efficiency does not exceed 20% in the case of nitrogen, and 30% in the case of phosphorus. The main strategic goals are to double the nitrogen efficiency in agricultural production up to 2010, and to drop the use of phosphorus fertilizers on soils with a high or a very high P-test.

Coastal ecosystems are also under the influence of natural perturbations such as major storms and flooding. Distinguishing the impacts of natural and human stressors is essential for understanding environmentally-induced change in microbial diversity and function. The objective of this paper is to discuss the applications and merits of recently developed molecular, ecophysiological and analytical indicators and their utility in examining anthropogenic and climatic impacts on the structure and function of coastal microbial communities. The nitrogen-limited Neuse River Estuary and Pamlico Sound, North Carolina are used as examples of ecosystems experiencing both anthropogenic (i.e., accelerating eutrophication) and climatic stress (increasing frequencies of tropical storms and hurricanes). Additional examples are derived from a coastal monitoring site (LEO) on the Atlantic coast of New Jersey and Galveston Bay, on the Gulf of Mexico. In order to assess structure, function, and trophic state of these and other coastal ecosystems, molecular (DNA and RNA-based) characterizations of the microbial taxa involved in carbon, nitrogen and other nutrient transformations can be combined with diagnostic pigment-based indicators of primary producer groups. Application of these methods can reveal process-level microbial community responses to environmental variability over a range of scales. Experimental approaches combined with strategic monitoring utilizing these methods will facilitate: (a) understanding organismal and community responses to environmental change, and (b) synthesizing these responses in the context of ecosystem models that integrate physical, chemical and biotic variability with environmental controls.

A second aim was to conduct critical model tests of three models that predicts the impact of farm emitted phosphorus on total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll and Secchi depth. Extensive field studies were conducted between 1997 and 2999 in nine defined coastal areas with, and four reference areas without, fish farms. According to our results the most significant effects on TP concentrations, periphytic growth and phytoplankton standing crop was observed in two coastal bays with small to moderate fish farm production ( approximate to 70 tonnes per year). The significant effects in each bay was mainly due to the small size of the bay (0.48 and 0.73 km(2)) and the shallow mean water depth (3 and 3.8 m), rather than long water retention tithes (2 and 6 days). Due to a very large fish farm production (800 tonnes per year), we also observed significant effects in a coastal area of moderate size (8 km(2)), which had a theoretical water retention time of about 8 days. No significant effects of fish farm effluents on the surface water quality were observed in the other six areas. Furthermore, our data shows that, besides the fish farm effluents, the import of nutrients from the surrounding sea and the sediment resuspension may have a decisive effect on the water quality in the studied areas. Finally, we can conclude that at least two of the tested models are useful in context of environmental management. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

With addition of either carp or pumpkinseed sunfish, chlorophyll a and turbidity levels, as well as concentrations of total phosphor-us and total nitrogen increased. The magnitude of this increase depended on fish species and was severest in the carp treatment. Mosquitofish did not significantly affect water quality. In the treatments with fish, cyclopoid copepods and rotifers dominated, while cladocerans were virtually absent. Zooplankton biomass was significantly lower in the carp treatment compared with the control. However, no direct negative effect (predation) of carp was observed. Zooplankton biomass did not differ from the control, neither with pumpkinseed sunfish treatment nor with mosquitofish treatment. Nonetheless, both fish species had a negative impact on zooplankton biomass owing to planktivorous feeding. Ceriodaphnia reticulata Jurine populations increased in the fishless controls. Only this cladoceran species was able to control significantly phytoplankton. Results indicate that biomanipulations could have a high potential for environmental quality improvements of degraded riverine wetlands. A model was built to predict the potential advances and successes of biomanipulations in the wetland.

We briefly review the chemical, biotic, hydrologic and physical habitat assessment approaches commonly used in riverine systems. We then discuss how landscape indicators can be used to assess the status of rivers by quantifying land cover changes in the surrounding catchment, and contrast landscape-level indicators with the more traditionally used approaches. Landscape metrics that describe the amount and arrangement of human-altered land in a catchment provide a direct way to measure human impacts and can be correlated with many traditionally used riverine indicators, such as water chemistry and biotic variables. The spatial pattern of riparian habitats may also be an especially powerful landscape indicator because the variation in length, width, and gaps of riparian buffers influences their effectiveness as nutrient sinks. The width of riparian buffers is also related to the diversity of riparian bird species. Landscape indicators incorporating historical land use may also hold promise for predicting and assessing the status of riverine systems. Importantly, the relationship between an aquatic system attribute and a landscape indicator may be non-linear and thus exhibit threshold responses.

J	Nurminen, LKL; Horppila, JA				Nurminen, LKL; Horppila, JA			A diurnal study on the distribution of filter feeding zooplankton: Effect of emergent macrophytes, pH and lake trophy	AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article						emergents; pH; cladocerans; DHM; lake trophy; cyanophytes	SUBMERGED MACROPHYTES; HORIZONTAL DISTRIBUTION; SEASONAL SUCCESSION; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; VERTICAL MIGRATION; EUTROPHIC LAKE; LITTORAL-ZONE; FISH; SHALLOW; PHYTOPLANKTON	The objective of the present study was to investigate the importance of emergent macrophytes as refugia in lakes of different trophic status. Furthermore, the effect of water quality on diel changes in the distribution of littoral cladocerans was of interest, with special attention paid on diurnal fluctuations of filter feeder communities, induced by pH changes under a heavy phytoplankton bloom. The study was conducted by investigating littoral cladoceran populations in different zones (inside, at the edge and outside the macrophyte stands) in two basins with divergent water quality. No tendency towards diurnal migration related to emergent macrophytes was observed in the clear-water, mesotrophic Isontalonselka basin. The dominating cladoceran, Daphnia spp., formed highest densities during daytime in the outer zone. Meanwhile, strong nocturnal cladoceran density peaks in all zones, simultaneous with lowered pH, were witnessed in the very turbid, hypertrophic Kirkkojarvi basin. Reverse horizontal migration was observed in large-bodied filter feeders, Limnosida frontosa and Sida crystallina, conceivably due to predation avoidance from young-of-the-year fish aggregating within the vegetation during the day.

J	Lilburne, LR; Webb, TH				Lilburne, LR; Webb, TH			Effect of soil variability, within and between soil taxonomic units, on simulated nitrate leaching under arable farming, New Zealand	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH			English	Article						wheat; Monte Carlo; GLEAMS; sensitivity; risk; water quality	PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; SOLUTE TRANSPORT; WHEAT; CONTAMINATION; CANTERBURY; MODELS; SERIES; GLEAMS; SCALE	A Monte Carlo approach was used to predict the effect of soil variability on nitrate leaching from 8 soil series, encompassing a wide range of drainage, texture, and age of soil development characteristics. A database of soil physical properties consisting of a minimum of 9 profiles per soil series was used to derive correlated probability distribution functions of key soil properties. The distribution functions were then used for random sampling to derive input soil-data for the GLEAMS (Groundwater Loading Effects of Agricultural Management Systems) simulation model. Variability in soil properties found within single soil taxonomic units (depth/stoniness phases of soil series) resulted in an appreciable range of predicted leaching of nitrate. Leaching from soils with greatest variability (generally shallow and stony phases) had an inter-quartile range of predicted leaching of up to 19 kg N/ha in 1992. Sensitivity analysis indicated that organic matter content, depth to the base of the upper 2 horizons, and available water storage were important drivers of variability within soil taxonomic units. Despite wide variation within soil taxonomic units, there were still clear differences between them. Effective soil depth accounted for most of this variance, which was attributed to differences in total profile available water storage. Soil drainage had some effect on risk of leaching. This effect would probably have been greater if water table effects had been accounted for. Soil series distinctions related to soil age had no significant effect of leaching risk. These results indicate that nitrogen leaching risk assessment using GLEAMS is dependent upon soil maps with accurate identification of soil depth/stoniness phases and organic matter content.

The major part of the nutrient load enters the sea outside Finnish borders from the metropolis of St. Petersburg and the river Neva. Finnish local authorities are facing a difficult task of defining water protection measures, when the effects of local measures have to be weighted against transboundary influences. This complex situation can be demonstrated visually with the help of mathematical modelling. We present here a nested 3D model application for the Gulf of Finland, where focus is set,on the coast and archipelago outside the city of Kotka in the eastern Gulf of Finland. Our model describes the load and transport of soluble nutrients, the growth of two groups of phytoplankton and one group of littoral filamentous algae as well as the settling, sedimentation and regeneration of detritus nutrients. The results of both model calibration and validation are shown. We have used the model to demonstrate the effects of two scenarios, the Finnish National Water Protection Agenda and improvements in the sewage treatment in St. Petersburg, on the algal biomasses. The effects of Finnish national measures take place in the inner archipelago, close to the local sources of nutrient loads. This is the area where eutrophication problems are accentuated and where most of the human activities take place. The effects of the measures carried out in St. Petersburg can be seen in the middle and outer archipelago and coastal areas further away from local nutrient sources. The influenced areas of the two scenarios are practically complementary and, thus, they cannot be understood as mutually exclusive ways to solve the problem of eutrophication. The national measures are the only way to improve the water quality in the heavily loaded parts of the coastline. However, without major water protection measures in St. Petersburg, the eutrophication of the whole Gulf of Finland cannot be stopped. This will not be possible in Russia without extensive international co-operation.

J	Whalen, JK; Chang, C				Whalen, JK; Chang, C			Phosphorus sorption capacities of calcareous soils receiving cattle manure applications for 25 years	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS			English	Article							FEEDLOT MANURE; PHOSPHATE SORPTION; ADSORPTION; KINETICS; AGRICULTURE; CHEMISTRY; NITROGEN; NUTRIENT	Manure management is an important issue for cattle producers in areas where many intensive feedlots operate. Accumulation of phosphorus (P) in agricultural soils receiving repeated manure applications and transport of P from manure to ground and surface waters has been documented. This study investigates the P sorption capacities of soils amended with feedlot manure annually for up to 25 years. Non-irrigated plots at the Lethbridge Research Centre, Alberta, Canada, received 0, 30, 60. and 90 Mg manure (wet weight) ha(-1), and irrigated plots received 0, 60, 120, and 180 Mg ha(-1) annually for 25 years. The quantity of P sorbed to surface soils (0 to 15 cm) from solutions containing 0 to 40 mug P mL(-1) was determined, and sorption isotherm models were fitted to the Freundlich equation. The P sorption capacity of non-irrigated and irrigated soils declined with increasing soil available P concentrations, but the P sorption capacity of surface soils that received applications annually for up to 25 years was generally not more than 50% lower than the P sorption capacity of unamended soils. Soil organic matter content, pH, and surface chemistry were altered by manure application, and may explain why the P sorption capacity did not decline more as soil available P concentrations increased. Further investigations will be required to determine the fate of manure P not sorbed in manure-amended calcareous soils to promote manure management practices that are agronomically sound and protect water quality.

The risk for soil P transport from soil to rivers and streams is a function of soil phosphorus concentration and runoff-erosion potential. The actual risk varies between years based upon key factors such as land management and weather. Water phosphorus contents are often monitored on a watershed basis. Thus the importance of soil P measurements for the formulation of a risk assessment needs to be verified at the watershed level. Essential data, especially soil phosphorus, are not always available at the scale of interest, e.g., watershed or soil polygons. We introduce a methodology that can derive soil P information from an analysis of data obtained at a coarser scale of ecodistricts across Alberta, Canada. Two data sets collected at two different scales were found to share the same type of probability function (e.g., Inverse Gaussian-Wald distribution). Parameters of the watershed probability function were determined by a non-linear fitting process and used to calibrate the methodology for reconstructing watershed datasets from ecodistrict datasets. This methodology facilitates estimates of the probability distribution of soil P to be used for the evaluation of the risk of phosphorus runoff at a watershed scale.

The integrated modelling framework was adapted to address specific issues and scenarios. Based on the preliminary results, a hypothetical 50% re-forestation of the Linthipe Watershed in the southern part of Lake Malawi/Nyasa/Niassa may lead to a decrease in the spring peak value of total phosphorus concentration from about 15 mug/L to 10 mug/L in the top layer (0 - 40 m) of the lake's Outlet Basin. Discussions on improvement to future modelling and monitoring programs are also presented.

However intensive spatial and temporal data on concentrations or loads of these nutrients is relatively scarce. Given this constraint, nutrient export models which can provide useful information on nutrient loads with only sparse data inputs are required. In addition, more complex physics and conceptually based models which are commonly available worldwide are often inappropriate for predicting loads in catchments. Consequently, models of a simpler conceptual and/or empirical type are used where input data are sparse and key processes are catchment dependent. This paper compares four such models (CMSS, AQUALM, Moss model and IHACRESWQ) and several methods based on direct estimation for their ability to predict loads in Australian catchment situations. The implications of the limited available input data sets for load prediction in Australian catchments are discussed. In particular the importance of coordinated data collection over longer time periods and sufficiently fine temporal scales, covering a broad range of event sizes, is emphasised.

A recent survey of drinking water quality showed that around 8% of the Valencian Community population had water supplies with nitrate content above that limit. The Valencian Community has an intensive agricultural base that includes citrus trees, fruit trees, and vegetables. A summary of the available nitrate leaching results in vegetable fields and citrus orchards is presented. It is demonstrated in the main vegetables grown, that N inputs were much higher than the values recommended by some researchers, and that nitrate leaching values were in most cases within the range of 150-300 kg N ha(-1). Artichoke, early potato, and onion were the three crops with higher leaching rates than other crops, based on simulation studies made for several of the main vegetable growing areas of the Valencian Community. The mineral N content in the 0-60 cm layer at planting time in the vegetable fields is, in many cases, greater than 200 kg ha-1; fertilizer application could be greatly reduced if some recommendation system similar to the N-min system used in other European countries was adopted. A simplified N balance in onion and early potato crops showed that the lower limit for mineralization in the 0 60 cm soil layer during the crop period varied from 65 to 130 kg N ha-1. In these two crops nitrate leaching varied from 240 to 340 kg N ha-1, depending on the N fertilizer treatment, and representing about 66-70% of total N input in them onion crop, and from 38 to 65% in the potato crop. Nitrate leaching losses in citrus orchards were. in general, lower than 100 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), representing about 33% of the total N input. A comparison or these results with those obtained in other studies is made. Finally, prospects for improvements in the fertilizer practice of vegetable crops and citrus orchards in the Valencian Community are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

This transition has increased the nitrogen loads to coastal watersheds, and from watersheds to receiving estuaries. We modeled the nitrogen entering the watershed of Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts, and found that as the transition took place, nitrogen loads to watersheds increased from 1938 to 1990. The relative magnitude of the contribution by wastewater, fertilizers, and atmospheric deposition depends on the land cover mosaics of a watershed. Atmospheric deposition was the major input to the watershed surface during this period, but because of different rates of loss within the watershed, wastewater became the major source of nitrogen flowing from the watershed to the receiving estuaries. Atmospheric deposition prevails in watersheds dominated by natural vegetation such as forests, but wastewater may become a dominant source in watersheds where urbanization increases. Increased nitrogen loads resulting from conversion of natural to human-altered watershed surfaces create eutrophication of receiving waters. with attendant changes in water quality, and marked shifts in the flora and food webs of the affected estuaries. Management efforts for restoration of eutrophied estuaries require maintenance of forested land, and control of wastewater and fertilizer inputs, the major terms in most affected places subject to local management. Wastewater and fertilizer nitrogen derive from within the watershed, which means local measures may effectively be used to control eutrophication of receiving waters.

The main goals were to quantify the nitrogen input rate, the nitrogen pools in above-ground and below-ground compartments, nitrogen turnover processes in the soil as well as the output into the groundwater and into the atmosphere. The findings are based on continuous and discontinuous field measurements as well as on model results. While nitrogen input exceeded the Critical Loads of the WHO (1995), nitrogen deficiency and nutrient imbalances were verified by needle analyses. The atmospheric input of inorganic nitrogen was higher than the nitrogen output in 50 cm soil depth. A tracer experiment with N-15 helped to prove that not more than half of the applied nitrate could be discharged. This allows the conclusion that nitrogen is stored in the system and that the site cannot yet be said to be saturated with nitrogen. The same result was also obtained by modelling. In addition, it was proved that the nitrogen discharge did not stem from deposition but from processes within the system.

J	Preston, BL				Preston, BL			Spatial patterns in benthic biodiversity of Chesapeake Bay, USA (1984-1999): Association with water quality and sediment toxicity	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						ecological risk assessment; geographic information systems; water quality; toxicity; benthos	DISSOLVED-OXYGEN; SURFACE WATERS; LAND-USE; ESTUARINE; INTEGRITY; BLOOMS; EUTROPHICATION; LANDSCAPE; COASTAL; SYSTEMS	Non-point-source pollution is an increasing source of stress to aquatic, estuarine, and marine ecosystems. Such pollution may be of unknown etiology, distributed over extensive spatial scales, and comprised of multiple stressors. Current stressor-based paradigms for ecological risk assessment (ERA) may be insufficient to characterize risk from multiple stressors at regional spatial scales, necessitating the use of effects-based approaches. Historical data (1984-1999) for benthic macroinvertebrate biodiversity in Chesapeake Bay, USA, were incorporated into a geographic information system (GIS) and spatial analysis tools were used to model zones within the bay predicted to be of low or high anthropogenic impact. Data for benthic water quality and sediment toxicant concentrations from each of these zones were subsequently analyzed and compared to identify associations between benthic biodiversity and potential stressors. A number of stressors were significantly associated with high-impact zones, including increased nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, low dissolved oxygen, heavy metals, pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and polychlorinated biphenyls. The spatial autocorrelation among multiple stressors suggests that traditional stressor-based approaches to ERA may result in the a priori exclusion of ecologically relevant stressors. Considering the effects of individual stressors rather than net effects of multiple stressors may result in underestimation of risk. The GISs are a useful tool for integrating multiple data sets in support of comprehensive regional ERA.

J	Dekker, AG; Vos, RJ; Peters, SWM				Dekker, AG; Vos, RJ; Peters, SWM			Analytical algorithms for lake water TSM estimation for retrospective analyses of TM and SPOT sensor data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							INLAND WATERS; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; PHYTOPLANKTON; CHLOROPHYLL; OCEAN	Suspended matter in inland waters is related to total primary production and fluxes of heavy metals and micropollutants such as PCBs. Synoptic information on suspended matter cannot be obtained from an in situ monitoring network since suspended matter is a spatially inhomogeneous parameter. This problem can be solved by the integrated use of remote sensing data, in situ data and water quality models. To enable retrospective model and remote sensing data comparison of suspended matter concentration and distribution, a methodology is required for processing satellite images that is independent of in situ measurements. Analytical optical modelling, based on knowledge of the in situ inherent optical properties, leads to reliable multi-temporal algorithms for estimating suspended matter concentration in lakes for the data from the SPOT and Landsat TM sensors. This methodology allows multi-temporal, multi-site and multi-instrument comparison of TSM maps derived from satellite imagery. This means that satellite sensor data can now become an independent measurement tool for water management authorities. The remote sensing maps showed that large gradients in TSM were observed for the various lakes as well as temporal changes of these spatial gradients. In situ point samples are shown to be not representative for suspended matter in the lakes.

At the upper boundary of the investigated river stretch at kin 359 (Karlsruhe) low chlorophyll a concentrations (< 25 mu g/l) were measured throughout the year 1990, while at the lower river region at kin 865 (Bimmen) high chlorophyll a concentrations (>50-130 mug/l) occurred in spring time and late summer. The model-based analysis of the algal biomass shows that beside inoculation by the main tributaries Neckar, Main, Lahn and Moselle, algal production in the Rhine itself is of major concern. The calculated losses of phytoplankton showed seasonal dependency with a maximum grazing rate of about 0.04 d(-1) for rotifers and 0.2-0.3 d(-1) for D. polymorpha. Depending on the algal food content, the biomass of rotifers and Dreissena polymorpha population is simulated and compared with observed rotifer abundances and estimated zebra mussel biomass derived from measured densities and size structures of local populations. In agreement with observations modelled rotifer and D. polymorpha population biomass is increasing downstream, explained by modelling as a matter of improved food supply. Nevertheless, both groups were unable to control algal development in River Rhine between kin 359 and 860, due to favourable growth conditions for phytoplankton.

J	Richards, RP; Baker, DB				Richards, RP; Baker, DB			Trends in water quality in LEASEQ rivers and streams (northwestern Ohio), 1975-1995	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article								Trends in water quality in four northwest Ohio rivers over the period 1975-1995 were identified using datasets of daily concentrations containing 4500 to 6800 observations per river during the study period. Concentrations were log-transformed prior to analysis, and adjusted for flow using a focally weighted scatterplot smoother (LOWESS) fit between log(concentration) and log(flow). Seasonality was modeled using one- and two-cycle sinusoidal oscillations and monthly additive constants. Substantial decreases in total and soluble reactive phosphorus were documented at all stations. Smaller but highly significant decreases in total Kjeldahl nitrogen were documented at all stations, and significant decreases in total suspended solids were documented at three of the four stations. Nitrate did not show significant trends at the two stations draining major watersheds, and showed significant trends in opposite directions at the two stations on smaller watersheds. Comparisons using nonparametric, nonlinear trend fits (LOWESS) suggest that changes in fertilizer and manure application rates are the most important cause of trends in phosphorus and total Kjeldald nitrogen; point sources are insufficient to account for the phosphorus trends. The conflicting trends for nitrate are enigmatic, but may reflect diverging land use in the two smaller watersheds.

J	Baker, DB; Richards, RP				Baker, DB; Richards, RP			Phosphorus budgets and riverine phosphorus export in northwestern Ohio watersheds	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							LAKE-ERIE; NUTRIENT; MANAGEMENT; QUALITY; DYNAMICS; NITROGEN; SCALE	Phosphorus (P) budgets for large watersheds are often used to predict trends in riverine P export. To test such predictions, we calculated annual P budgets for 1975-1995 for soils of the Maumee and Sandusky watersheds of northwestern Ohio and compared them with riverine P export from these watersheds. Phosphorus inputs to the soils include fertilizers, manure, rainfall, and sludge while outputs include crop removal and nonpoint-source export via rivers. Annual P inputs decreased due to reductions in fertilizer and manure inputs. Annual outputs increased due to increasing crop yields. Net P accumulation decreased from peak values of 13.4 and 9.5 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) to 3.7 and 2.6 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) for the Maumee and Sandusky watersheds, respectively. Thus, P budget analysis suggests that riverine P export stu y per o, w should have increased throughout creases during more recent years. However, detailed water quality studies show that riverine export of total phosphorus (TP) has decreased by 25 to 40%. and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), by 60 to 89%, both due primarily to decreases from nonpoint sources. We suggest that these decreases are associated with farmers' adoption of practices that minimize transport of recently applied P fertilizer and of sediments via surface runoff, coupled with changes in winter weather conditions. In comparison with most Midwestern, watersheds, rivers draining these watersheds have high unit area yields of TP, low unit area yields of SRP, and high ratios of nonpoint source- to point source-derived P.

We hypothesized that before and after harvest, sod-forming smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) or alfalfa-smooth bromegrass mixtures would have less BAP, DRP, and BPP runoff losses than taprooted alfalfa. Swards established in 1992 near Lancaster, WI were subjected to a 72 mm simulated rainfall applied for 1 h in 1993 and 1994 to forage regrowth at 4 and 6 wk after first harvest and immediately (0 wk) after second harvest. Hourly BAP losses for all sward types were 82% less when 1.5 Mg ha(-1) of forage dry matter was present. High DRP losses (>0.050 kg ha(-1)) were associated with high DRP concentrations (>7.1 mumol L-1) and high surface soil P concentrations (>59 mg kg(-1)) resulting from broadcast maintenance P fertilizer. High BPP losses (>0.035 kg ha(-1)) were associated with high runoff volumes (>24 mm) and sediment concentrations (>2 g L-1). Summed over all 6 rainfall simulations, total BA-P loss was only 0.07 kg ha(-1) at the 6 wk stage of regrowth compared with 0.35 at 4 wk, and 0.41 at 0 wk. Moreover, there was no significant difference between sward types for DRP concentration, DRP loss, or BAP loss. We conclude that avoiding excessive defoliation was more effective at reducing BA-P losses than specific forage species selection.

The concentrations of the three toxins in the reservoir varied greatly depending on location and time water samples were collected. Water quality parameters such as light intensity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, suspended solid, chemical oxygen demand, dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, ammonia, nitrate, phosphate, total dissolved nitrogen, total dissolved phosphorus and chlorophyll-a were also measured in parallel with microcystin determinations. Relationships among water quality parameters, toxins and chlorophyll-a were established. Toxin concentration increased in proportion to increases in total phosphorus, fraction of dissolved phosphorus, but was inversely correlated with water pH and total suspended solids. The other measured parameters in the study showed no correlations to toxin level in reservoir water. Significant correlations between chlorophyll-a and suspended solids, phosphate, nitrate and ammonia were observed suggesting that nitrogen and phosphorus are the two major nutrients governing growth of algae in the reservoir. This relationship suggests that algal production as well as toxin concentration are dependant on nutrient levels in the water body, since both measured light intensity and temperature level was favorable for algal growth. A small algal bloom observed in the rainy season of each year (lasting for only a couple of months) paralleled measured increases in toxin concentration, chlorophyll-a, TP and TN in the water column. Toxin level in the water column remain detectable for 3-4 months period following the initiation of algal bloom. Results indicate that major blooms are likely to occur following the raining season which usually occurs near the end of October when runoff would increase nutrient level entering the reservoir. This study also demonstrated that an ongoing field-monitoring program is needed in these lakes and reservoirs for predicting toxic level of microcystin production for use in risk assessment and for alerting the public to potential health hazards. Concentration of toxin in the reservoir can perhaps be controlled by reducing non point source nutrient input within the watershed.

J	Hamblin, PF; Gale, P				Hamblin, PF; Gale, P			Water quality modeling of caged aquaculture impacts in Lake Wolsey, North Channel of Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						caged aquaculture; water quality modeling; Lake Huron		Nutrient release from fish farming could have an impact on water quality in restricted areas of the Great Lakes. Unprecedented hypolimnetic anoxia, discovered in a small bay of the LaCloche Channel in the vicinity of a caged aquaculture operation (Ontario Ministry of Environment, September 1997), stimulated an environmental review by provincial regulators of the increasing number of caged aquaculture operations in the North Channel area of Lake Huron. They found that water exchange rates between the restricted zones around the cages and surrounding waters are a key component in determining assimilative capacity and evaluating potential impacts on water quality. A caged aquaculture operation exists in Lake Wolsey (area 2,315 ha), a restricted embayment along the northwestern shoreline of Manitoulin Island and which ultimately drains into the North Channel of Lake Huron. The morphometry of Lake Wolsey lends itself to the formulation of a simple box model for the change in total phosphorus concentration due to loading from the caged operation and a specified exchange across the entrance of the embayment. Using water level readings at the entrance of the bay, the geometry of the entrance, and a one-dimensional exchange flow model, the exchange was found to be in the order of 14.3 m(3)/s on average. This relatively vigorous exchange is due to the presence of large wind and lunar tides in the North Channel. Such an exchange flow would result in a residence time of 215 days for the 25 in deep basin. Based on an estimated open water season (May to November) loading of 1,352 kg phosphorus for thefish culture operation, the resulting elevation of the total phosphorus concentration would be 5.1 mug/L above the measured background level of 8 mug/L, a total close to that observed, 12 mug/L. Similarly, in the ice-covered season with lower feeding rates the model predicted 7.9 mug/L comparing favorably to the observed spring turnover value of 8.0 mug/L. In Lake Wolsey, the long-term effects of caged aquaculture at its current level of production are probably minimal but in the short-term could result in algal blooms and increased oxygen demand.

J	Lehman, JT				Lehman, JT			Mixing patterns and plankton biomass of the St. Lawrence Great Lakes under climate change scenarios	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						irradiance; respiration; primary production; saturation light intensity; Great Lakes	POTENTIAL IMPACTS; WATER-QUALITY; FISH HABITAT; MICHIGAN; SUMMER; MODEL; ERIE; CLASSIFICATION; DEPENDENCE; STATES	This study is part of an assessment of potential effects of climate change on the St. Lawrence Great Lakes. Its purpose is to investigate potential future lake mixing patterns and primary production. Nested physical and biological models were applied to seasonal mixed layer depth, heat content, primary productivity, and to algal biomass measured a particulate chlorophyll. Two independent second generation General Circulation Models provided scenarios for future conditions of cloud cover, air temperature, humidity, and winds. The climate variables were used to force heat balance and surface mixed layer models for Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario. Physical models of heat balance and mixed layer dynamics were coupled with a model of primary biological production and growth of phytoplankton. Simulated climate conditions were for time periods centered at 1975, 2030, 2050, and 2090. Climate projections from both GCMs lead to elevated mixed layer and bottom temperatures in all five lakes by as much as 5degreesC during this century. Both GCMs point to longer duration of thermal stratification in the five lakes, stronger stability of stratification, and deeper daily mixing depths during peak thermal stratification. For Lake Erie, no striking differences in algal biomass are likely according to climate projections of either model, but for the other lakes, either the duration of nutrient limitation of algal growth is projected to increase, or light limitation caused by deeper mixing is projected to limit the development of algal biomass.

J	Brooks, AS; Zastrow, JC				Brooks, AS; Zastrow, JC			The potential influence of climate change on offshore primary production in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						climate change; primary production; Lake Michigan	GREAT-LAKES; PHYTOPLANKTON; GROWTH; FISH	This paper examines the potential influence of climate change on the primary productivity of Lake Michigan. Two general circulation models (GCMs) provided physical information on projected regional climate for the years 2030, 2050, and 2090. A 30-year record of meteorological data and limnological observations, from 1961 to through,1990, was used to define present, baseline conditions for the lake. GCM output was used to develop scenarios of future thermal characteristics, mixing patterns, and surface irradiance, which were then used to drive primary production calculations. Mean annual primary production for the base period was 116 g C/m(2). Under base conditions thermal stratification of the lake occurred on 13 June and extended 135 days until 26 October. Conditions projected for 2090 showed the mean date of stratification beginning as early as 5 April and remaining for 225 days until 20 November. Estimated mean annual primary production under these conditions totaled 113 g C/m(2), a decrease of 3% from the mean base value. Under the most extreme conditions of maximum projected cloud cover for 2090, primary production in that year could fall to 101 g C/m(2), a decrease of 13% from the base mean, or down 22% from maximum base production calculated under minimum base cloud cover conditions. The projected decrease may be attributed to physical/chemical constraints imposed on spring primary production by altered climate conditions. Early stratification would shorten the period of winter-spring mixing, during which time nutrients from the sediment are transported to the productive euphotic zone. The spring bloom was projected to diminish if early stratification capped the nutrient supply, and increased cloud cover reduced light input for photosynthesis. To a lesser extent fall production could also be reduced by the extension of the stratified period. Altered physical/chemical conditions influenced by a changing climate will be an important factor to consider in assessing future water quality conditions, primary production and the food web dynamics of the Great Lakes.

It will carry several instruments that provide new opportunities to measure oceanographic variables. Together, they represent the main measurement techniques of satellite oceanography, and complement each other in an ideal manner. These instruments are to be used in synergy to: Improve the analysis of measured wind and ocean wave fields, and thereby improve weather forecasting at weather centers; Determine the extent and variables of sea ice and develop a five-day sea ice prediction model, to support maritime shipping and offshore activities; Monitor and map sediment and suspended matter transport in coastal regions, especially in areas with large river estuaries, which greatly affects shipping lanes, harbors, and dredging activities; Monitor hydrobiological and bio-geochemical variables related to water quality in coastal regions and large inland waters, which affects ecology, coastal development, aquaculture, drinking water supplies, and tourism. To prepare the oceanographic community to make best use of the ENVISAT sensors in the pre-launch phase, existing algorithms to derive marine parameters are used and validated using data from the ERS SAR, the ERS RA, SeaWiFS and IRS MOS sensors now in operation. Derived products are used to address problems that can best be tackled using the synergy of radar and optical data, such as the effect of surface slicks on radar wind measurements, of sea state on ocean color, of wind and waves on the resuspension of suspended matter, and of wind and waves on sea ice variables.

This paper delineates a robust unsteady two-layered, 2D finite difference numerical model for eutrophication in coastal waters. The modelling is based upon the numerically generated boundary-fitted orthogonal curvilinear grid system and integrated with a hydrodynamic model. It simulates the transport and transformation of nine water quality constituents associated with eutrophication in the waters, i.e. three organic parameters (carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus), four inorganic parameters (dissolved oxygen, ammonia, nitrite + nitrate and orthophosphate), and two biological constituents (phytoplankton and zooplankton). Key kinetic coefficients are calibrated with the field data. The hydrodynamic, pollution source and solar radiation data in the model are real-time simulated. The computational results show that the present model mimic the stratification tendency for eutrophication phenomena during summer time in the Tolo Harbour successfully. The model running time for the long-term simulation is not excessive and it can be run on a microcomputer. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The assessment of properties and processes of costal zone is a major issue in aquatic system management. The aim of this paper is to test and analyse neural network capability in predicting changes of clorophyl-a as a phytoplankton biomass. Available data concern to a weekly medium-term time-series ranging from the end of 1994 to 2001, and it was collected at the Arraial do Cabo near shore upwelling, southeast of Rio de Janeiro state (Brazil). Dealing in particular with high non-linearity among variables, a genetic algorithm package was used to settle the best neural architecture and the specific pre-processing method presented. The results show the spread of predictions given by the models in short, medium and long-term periods.

As a means of interpreting the spatial distribution of chl-alpha in this image, a combined three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and ecological model was run using estimates of the environmental and planktonic conditions concurrent with and preceding the time of image acquisition. The post facto modelling of the dynamics of the lake produced spatial distributions of surface chl-alpha that were consistent with that evident in the remotely sensed image, It is proposed that CFD modelling benefits the interpretation of remotely sensed images of water bodies in that it may be used to infer the causes of the spatial distributions evident in the remotely sensed imagery. This is because modelling extends the analysis into the temporal and vertical domains. However, the value of combining CFD with remote sensing is limited by the quality and quantity of data available through surface observation and remote sensing, and the implications of this to the integration of CFD with remote sensing are discussed.

Images are displayed as 24 bit RGB images of the water surface using selected channel. Comparisons are made in this paper between a hyperspectral Monte Carlo and a hyperspectral layered analytical model of radiative transport applicable to shallow water types. Images at the selected wavelengths or channels centered at 490, 530 and 680 nm suggests the two models provide the same results when displayed as RGB images. The most sensitive parameters for generating realistic images are water depth and bottom reflectance in clean natural, optically shallow waters. The images clearly demonstrate the need importance of detailed and accurate water depths.

However, once established, TMDL implementation must take into account economic and political factors, uncertainty, future population growth and land use changes, as well as issues of equitability and feasibility. Tools that can help incorporate these considerations into TMDL implementation are lacking. Virginia is currently implementing its Potomac Tributary Strategy to reduce nutrient loads to the river by 40%. This effort has many similarities to the implementation of a TMDL. In 1998, a study was completed, which assessed the optimal combination of load control efforts that achieve the nutrient reduction goal for the Potomac. Study objectives were to: project annual nitrogen inputs to Potomac over 15 years; estimate the minimum annual costs for attaining the goal; and assess potential cost savings from using alternative development patterns within rapidly urbanizing areas. The model developed for the study uses water quality modeling results in conjunction with land use and economic data to assess temporal and spatial distributions of costs for controlling loads from various point sources and land uses. Model results were used to predict future costs and to assess tradeoffs between differing policy options. Results suggested meeting the goal in 1998, required at least $27 million, in additional annual expenditures. Point source retrofits accounted for two-thirds Of the additional expenditures, additional agricultural controls accounted for the remainder. Under current demographic trends, annual costs for maintaining the goal would increase 40% over 15 years. Rising costs result primarily from wastewater disposal needs of the watershed's growing population. Planning future development within the watershed to promote the use of centralized water treatment would slow the pace of future cost increases. The model developed for the study has the potential to support the TMDL allocation and implementation process. Potential uses are: assessing control costs for constituents, such as nutrients, sediment, or fecal coliform; examining tradeoffs between different reduction scenarios; targeting allocation of scarce funds; and assessing the feasibility of pollutant reduction trading, across geographic areas or economic sectors.

A TMDL program has been initiated for the North Bosque River Watershed in Texas, USA, where point and nonpoint sources of pollution are of a concern. Impairment was determined under narrative water quality criteria related to excessive aquatic plant growth. A watershed modeling approach was used to quantify the effects of phosphorus control measures on stream water quality. The watershed simulation model, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), was validated for flow, sediment, and nutrients. The validated model was applied to quantify the effects of management practices related to dairy manure management and municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent. This paper describes the impact of these practices on phosphorus. The benefits of phosphorus control measures for wastewater treatment plants resulted in greater improvement in stream concentrations, while control measures on dairies made greater difference on phosphorus loadings. Results were used to inform the TMDL stakeholder group of possible controls that could reduce phosphorus loadings and concentrations in the Bosque River Watershed. This SWAT application and these assessment methods are adaptable to similar TMDL/water quality projects in other parts of the United States.

Recently equations from the water quality model QUAL2E have been incorporated into the SWAT model. QUAL2E is a steady-state model used to predict the concentration of in-stream parameters based on constant streamflow and inputs. The validity of the incorporation of the QUAL2E equations into SWAT has never been adequately confirmed. In order to test the validity of the water quality component of SWAT, two approaches were used. The first approached extracted the water quality subroutine from SWAT and emulated a steady-state simulation for comparison with QUAL2E output. The second approach utilized the entire SWAT program emulating a steady-state simulation for comparison with a comparable simulation in QUAL2E. The extracted subroutine steady-state simulations had a low standard error of prediction (0.071) compared to the QUAL2E output, with all of the calculated variables very similar at low concentrations. However, as initial concentrations increased the standard error also increased. The full SWAT model exhibited differences from the QUAL2E model in 2, 6 and 24 hour element retention time simulations. SWAT gave the same results regardless of retention time, with the differences between the output of the two models decreasing as the duration of retention time increased. The greatest discrepancies between the two models occurred in the DO and chlorophyll-a simulations. A minor change in the SWAT program, removing a default which made all. retention times equal to one day, caused SWAT output in the 2 and 6 hour retention time simulations to better emulate the QUAL2E output. A limited test using modified algorithms for organic and dissolved phosphorus in the SWAT model was able to produce identical results to the QUAL2E simulation, leading to the conclusion that the QUAL2E equations may not have been correctly incorporated into the SWAT model. More analysis needs to be done to evaluate SWAT water quality algorithms.

These activities often result in increased erosion and sedimentation with detrimental impacts on stream and lake water quality. It is estimated that 60% of the approximately 3 billion tons of sediment per year deposited in the waterways originates from agricultural lands. Oxbow lakes are remnants of meandering floodplain rivers that have been cut off and physically isolated from their respective main river channels. Long known for their productivity and recreational value, these naturally formed lakes have not escaped the detrimental effects of soil erosion. Consequently, their popularity as recreational resources has decreased as water quality and fisheries have declined. If suspended sediment concentrations are low enough to provide suitable light penetration, oxbow lakes provide conditions conducive to photosynthesis, primarily via phytoplankton, and may support a sustainable sport fishery. However, agricultural practices often result in soil erosion that can lead to increased turbidity in the oxbow lakes and subsequent inhibition of photosynthesis. Turbidity in oxbow lakes can be persistent in areas having soils with high clay content. Although nutrients such as phosphorus are typically associated with alluvial soils and tend to load in oxbow lakes, these systems may become energy starved and very unproductive due to lack of light penetration. In order to establish reasonable Total Maximum Daily Loads for these types of systems, critical concentrations of total or suspended sediments, necessary to elicit a corresponding increase in chlorophyll, must be established. Oxbow lake water quality data collected from various research projects by the authors suggests that critical concentrations for suspended sediments may be established. This paper examines the relationship between suspended sediments, chlorophyll, and lake ecology and suggests a possible critical concentration for suspended sediment TMDL.

Designated uses of the River are aquatic life, recreation, industrial consumption, agriculture, wildlife, aesthetic enjoyment, and navigation. Monitoring in recent years has shown dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in portions of the river intermittently below the state water quality standard of 5 mg/L. As a result, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) placed four lower-river reach segments on the agency's 1998 "303(d) list". The main objectives of the project are to define the extent, persistence, and severity of the DO depletion problem, quantify point and non-point pollutant sources contributions to water quality impairments, and develop a TMDL for the watershed. The TMDL project has three phases. Phase I is an analysis of existing monitoring data to: determine the technical issues to be addressed within the scope of the project, outline a modeling strategy, define data gaps and additional monitoring needs, and prepare a monitoring plan to address the additional data needs. Review of the existing water quality data for the Long Prairie River indicates substantial seasonal and inter-annual variability but no significant long-term trends. Longitudinal total phosphorus profiles show a consistent pattern of gradual increase from the headwaters to the City of Long Prairie, followed by a steep increase downstream from the City.

BASINS/GIS integrates a geographic information system (GIS), national watershed data, and state-of-the-art environmental assessment and modeling tools into one package. Simulations of pollutant loading and transport with the BASINS model can be useful in developing Total Maximum Daily Loads or TMDL's, and determining where best management practices (BMP) would be most effective. Two East Tennessee watersheds were selected for this study: Pond Creek in Loudon County and Crooked Fork-Emory in Morgan County. The primary streams running through both watersheds are listed as only partially supporting their designated use according to the Tennessee 303d list of impaired waterways prepared by TDEC. Dairy and beef pasture systems are the predominant agricultural activities in Pond Creek. Crooked Fork-Emory has a mixed (forestry and urban) land use. During 2001, water quality in the streams was monitored. Analysis was performed on monthly grab samples for nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), sediments and pathogens. Field data including flow rate, water temperature, air temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and conductivity was recorded at eight sampling-sites. The data obtained from these will be used to determine the appropriate data inputs needed by the BASINS model to predict pollutant loading in east Tennessee watersheds and to compare the effectiveness of different BMP's in reducing the nutrient and pathogen loading in these watersheds.

In cases where more than one control strategy can achieve targets, an investigation of cost-effectiveness ratios may indicate the least costly control strategy. A cost-effectiveness analysis is applied to the N. Bosque River, where impairment is attributed to phosphorus (P) loading from dairy waste application fields (WAFs) and municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). On average, soluble reactive P (SRP) loads and concentrations need to be reduced by 65 and 70 percent respectively from potential future growth levels, which assume fully permitted flows at WWTPs and fully permitted cow numbers. A baseline scenario and six P control scenarios were simulated assuming fully permitted conditions. Three dairy best management practices (BMPs) were simulated: haul out of dairy manure, field application of manure at the P rate, and reduced P in dairy diet formulations. Phosphorus control at WWTPs and two combined strategies were also considered. The reduced P diet provided benefits (negative costs) to producers, while P control at WWTPs was the next most cost-effective control measure for reducing both P loads and concentrations. These control measures alone, however, do not achieve numeric targets for either SRP loads or concentrations. A combined strategy involving manure application at the P rate on existing WAFs, the haul out of excess manure, and implementation of a reduced P diets in combination with P reduction at WWTPs was estimated to reduce both P loads and concentrations by 87 percent of that needed to achieve targets. In this application, opportunities for reducing the total cost of achieving targets is limited because 1) both P loads and concentrations are targeted, and 2) the levels of those targets require substantial implementation of all control measures considered.

Yet the inherent differences between point and nonpoint sources of contaminants and associated transport mechanisms raise significant concerns and technical challenges in translating this concept to nonpoint sources, for application in a regulatory context. Some states, including Iowa, are utilizing TMDLs to accomplish comprehensive watershed assessment to target the implementation of voluntary conservation programs to specific water quality goals. Prescriptive models can be used in these assessments to predict nonpoint source contaminant transport and impact of various best management practices/systems. Many models are available for use and will give somewhat differing results. A study in Iowa is being planned to provide technical guidance on the selection and use of models that best fit the Iowa landscape, as well as facilitate input to the selection process by affected economic and environmental interests. Relative to nutrient criteria, the U.S. EPA is in the process of helping States and Tribes develop regionally-based numeric values for rivers and streams and lakes and reservoirs (as well as for estuarine and coastal marine areas and wetlands). Nutrient overenrichment is a major source of water pollution in the U.S., resulting in euthrophication. Region-specific nutrient criteria are expected to help address this pollution problem, and criteria are expected to protect and support the designated uses of a water body. In agricultural areas where drastic changes in land use and drainage/hydrology have occurred, there is concern for how these criteria will be set and used in the TMDL process. Comparisons made between possible criteria and existing conditions, and the potential to reach these criteria with reasonable implementation of BMPs, raises the issue of attainability.

Defining an appropriate data collection strategy for monitoring TMDL implementation involving nonpoint source contributions is, thus, a formidable task. Our objective was to define the sampling needed to adequately assess phosphorus (P) concentrations and loadings on an annual basis for sites along the North Bosque River in central Texas. Two TMDLs were conducted for segments on the North Bosque River to decrease soluble reactive P loadings and concentrations by about 50 percent. Our evaluation involved subsampling intensive storm and base flow monitoring data collected between 1995 and 1999. Preliminary results using routine sampling clearly show an increase in statistical confidence for annual average concentrations with increasing sampling frequency from quarterly to monthly to biweekly. Average annual P and TSS loadings were generally underestimated by biweekly sampling, using an integration approach, as compared to 'true" loads as estimated from a fill data set of storm and grab samples. Assuming that only a limited number of storm events could be monitored per year, storm sampling strategies evaluated included intensive monitoring of the first four storm events in a year or monitoring the first storm event in each quarter of a year. Flow-weighted event mean concentrations for storm events were associated with periods of elevated flow for loading calculations in conjunction with biweekly grab data representing base flow conditions. Intensive monitoring of the first four storm events in a given year appeared to give the most promising results for annual loading calculations for sites within the North Bosque River watershed. For sites where P or TSS is transported predominately by nonpoint source runoff, storm sampling using automated samplers is recommended to complement routine sampling.

This process require monitoring and assessment of quality of surface water bodies. The specific objectives of this study were to (1) determine the natural variability in the concentration of a non-point source pollutant (e.g., nitrate) and (2) to estimate minimum sample size needed to adequately describe TMDL process. Water samples were collected from nine sites in the Miracle Mile, North Platte River, Wyoming on six sampling dates. The temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH were measured in the field prior to the sampling. Samples were taken to the Water Quality laboratory and analyzed for nitrate with Ion Chromatography (IC). The temperature of the water was between 13 and 16.8degreesC and pH was from 7.6 to 8.9. The DO ranged between 59 and 137% saturation. These water quality parameters increased with distance. Nitrate-nitrogen concentrations ranged from 0.15 to 14.16 mg/L and yielded no consistent trends. Results in this study suggest that to adequately characterize a non-point source pollutant such as nitrate in a natural fluvial ecosystem require large sample sizes.

There are numerous dairies that produce large quantities of manure in the North Bosque River watershed that will be affected by the TMDL regulation. Currently, the State of Texas is subsidizing the composting of dairy manure for transport out of the watershed. Researchers at Texas A&M University are investigating the environmental effects of using composted dairy manure to grow turfgrass sod. The transport of manure nutrients in turfgrass sod may be a sustainable means to export composted dairy manure from the North Bosque River watershed. Implementation of turfgrass sod production necessitates identification of acceptable land areas for this use. Such considerations for land use could include soil type, irrigation water availability, property values, topography, identification of urban areas, distance from composting facilities, highway networks and other factors. With these considerations in mind, geographical information system (GIS) software will be used to identify suitable locations for turfgrass operations in or near the North Bosque River watershed. This GIS information can then be used in hydrology simulation models such as the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to assess improvements in water quality in the North Bosque River watershed due to the export of manure nutrients in turfgrass sod. This paper will focus on the use of GIS studies to locate turfgrass sod production sites in the North Bosque River watershed to utilize and export composted dairy manure.

This basin is also one of the fastest growing regions in Wisconsin for not only expanding dairy farms, but urban development as well. The natural conflict has raised serious concern among stakeholder groups about the long-term impacts of these changes on surface water quality. A mass balance of 13 dairy farms, ranging in herd size from 50 to 500 head and 4 cash grain operations was conducted in the Lower Pox River Basin over a two year period to determine the per-hectare rate of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium loading on farms in the basin. Incoming sources of these nutrients were quantified from feed, fertilizer and livestock purchases, as well as natural sources of nitrogen to examine if loading was higher for larger farms. Economic nutrient export was calculated, as well as an estimate of environmental phosphorus losses. The mass balance showed an average of 98 kg/ha nitrogen accumulation, 17 kg/ha phosphorus accumulation and 90 kg/ha potassium accumulation on dairy farms. Cash grain accumulation rates were -10, 3, and 26 kg/ha, respectively. The mass balance showed differences in cow populations did not change per hectare phosphorus accumulations. Potassium accumulations increased as herd size and acreage increased. Eleven of the 13 dairy farms had already implemented nitrogen based nutrient management plans. The study indicates phosphorus accumulations could be reduced by more than 90% by implementing a number of additional management practices, including switching to lower phosphorus protein supplements, growing rather than purchasing protein sources, reducing the amount of phosphorus in the dairy ration and reallocating manure across the farm to fields with the greatest phosphorus need.

This process require monitoring and assessment of quality of surface water bodies. The specific objectives of this study were to (1) determine the natural variability in the concentration of a non-point source pollutant (e.g., nitrate) and (2) to estimate minimum sample size needed to adequately describe TMDL process. Water samples were collected from nine sites in the Miracle Mile, North Platte River, Wyoming on six sampling dates. The temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH were measured in the field prior to the sampling. Samples were taken to the Water Quality laboratory and analyzed for nitrate with Ion Chromatography (IC). The temperature of the water was between 13 and 16.8degreesC and pH was from 7.6 to 8.9. The DO ranged between 59 and 137% saturation. These water quality parameters increased with distance. Nitrate-nitrogen concentrations ranged from 0.15 to 14.16 mg/L and yielded no consistent trends. Results in this study suggest that to adequately characterize a non-point source pollutant such as nitrate in a natural fluvial ecosystem require large sample sizes.

The land uses included single-family residential, golf course, industrial, dairy cow pasture, construction site, and wooded site. Average event mean concentrations and total annual load were computed for nitrogen forms, total phosphorus, and sediment from the land uses. Annual total nitrogen export was greatest for the construction land use during the house-building phase, followed closely by the residential and golf course land uses. Total phosphorus export was greatest for the golf course site followed by the pasture and residential land uses. Sediment export was greatest for the construction site during the rough grading phase, which averaged more than 10 times more sediment export than any of the other sites. To estimate export from a multiuse urban watershed, total nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment export from the residential, golf course, and construction sites were averaged. The average total nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment export from the three land uses was, respectively, 269, 302, and 256% greater than the corresponding exports from the wooded site, which was considered similar to the predevelopment land use. Additionally, analyses of rainfall samples indicated that a considerable portion of the nitrogen export from these sites likely comes from nitrogen in rainfall. Water Environ. Res., 74, 100 (2002).

The general characteristics such as utilisation of natural processes, simplicity in construction, operation and maintenance, and process stability allow the application of constructed wetlands with different quality of influent water and under various climatic conditions. Although constructed wetlands are now used widely, their design is based mostly on rules of thumb, providing a specific area requirement per person. A simulation model for subsurface-flow constructed wetlands was developed to provide a better understanding of the processes Within the black box "constructed wetland" and to optimise the design of constructed wetlands. The multi-component reactive transport model CW2D describes the elimination and transformation processes of the main constituents of wastewater: organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus. The model description comprises 9 processes and 12 components. The simulation results for a pilot-scale constructed wetland for wastewater treatment show a good match with the measured data for both flow and reactive transport simulations.

An A(2)/O (anaerobic-anoxic-oxic) process using immobilized media is proposed here, as a high-end technology to meet stricter discharge standards when faced with treatment space limitations. In order to investigate the applicability of the process, a pilot-scale study using municipal wastewater was conducted. Fluidized immobilization media were added to the aerobic reactor to maintain a high concentration of nitrifying bacteria and nitrification rate. Relationships between nutrient removal performance and varied operating conditions were examined. The results of the pilot plant test indicated that the process performs well for removal of nitrogen and phosphorus. Under the condition of HRT = 8 hr, it was possible to obtain an effluent water quality as follows: T-N<8.0 mg/L; T-P<1.0 mg/L. It was observed that reaction time needed for a complete nitrification was shortened by the addition of of immobilized media to the aerobic reactor, and longer reaction time would be needed for a completed phosphorus uptake process other than complete nitrification in an aerobic tank. Therefore, the phosphorus uptake rate, as well as nitrification process, should be considered as one of the important factors, affecting the design parameters of an aerobic reactor.

It is said that a high level of primary production provides much. organic matter and affects water quality of the bay, and it is proved by the appearance of phytoplankton throughout the year. In this study, we simulated variations of phytoplankton population with a box-type model using monthly data in a long-term measurement and we analyzed the final growth rate changes of phytoplanktons that explain the conditions for its appearance. Consequently, we found that the final growth rate varies with pattern of half-year periodicity and water temperature and/or ambient nutrient controls the final growth rate to be low every January and July.

The lagoons were operated at hydraulic retention times (HRT) of 6, 9 and 15 days. One lagoon was covered with Water Hyacinth, which is naturally growing in the Muna Reservoir, while another lagoon was operated as a conventional oxidation pond. The Water Hyacinth lagoon had better removal efficiencies for almost all parameters measured: BOD5, total suspended solids, COD, nitrogen, phosphorus and heavy metals. The oxidation lagoon was facultative for HRT of 9 and 15 days, and anoxic when operated at 6 days HRT. At HRT of 15 days the water quality in the effluent of the covered lagoon corresponded to 12 mg/l of BOD, 6 mg/l of suspended solids and 0.8 mg/l of hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide levels in the Muna reservoir can be substantially reduced at HRT higher than 15 days in both lagoons. The uncovered lagoon had better hydrogen sulfide removal during the day but presents high levels at night. If the hydraulic retention time in the Muna reservoir is increased, the water quality of the Bogota river can be substantially improved for all the HRTs tested in the pilot units. HRT seems to give a better prediction of overall effluent water quality than surface loading. More research is needed in order to define the optimum water hyacinth density in the Muna reservoir to determine its influence on the water quality of the effluent. The influence is expected to be negative due to an internal increase of BOD, solids, nutrients and metals loads due to plant decay.

We did not obtain satisfying linear relationships between fluorescence and COD or TOC (r(2) congruent to 0.4) for any of the emission wavelengths used between 320 and 400 nm (especially at 355 nm, the average emission lambda(max)). The relationships with N-K were better (r(2) = 0.7); leading us to suggest that one evaluates mainly the organic nitrogen content at ?, x, = 280 nm. Whole spectra processing did not improve the correlations. Gel permeation chromatography yielded markedly different TOC and fluorescence chromatograms, which explains the difficulty of correlating organic content and fluorescence. Other investigations are necessary before spectrofluorimetry can be used as a reliable technique for on-line wastewater pollution estimation.

In order to assess the actual risk of P pollution of groundwater and surface waters, dynamic process oriented soil and water quality models have been frequently used. Recently, an approximating model for phosphorus, called SIMPLE, has been developed. This model approximates the output from a complex dynamic water quality model. The approximating model is called a metamodel. This simple P-model proves to be a powerful tool for quick assessment of the risk of P pollution from agricultural land to surface waters.

It is a shallow eutrophic lake with a dense growth of macrophytes. The main contributors of nutrients and other pollutants to the lake are the creeks carrying the runoff water from the watershed and upland farming land, in addition to the domestic and industrial wastewater discharges from a nearby town and industries. Hydrodynamic and water quality modeling techniques were used to determine the optimum management schemes for the lake restoration and diffuse pollution control. Management scenarios were devised and tested to control allochthonous and autochthonous nutrient inputs to the lake. Phosphorus and nitrogen load reductions were the main test elements for the control of allochthonous nutrient inputs. The scenario analysis revealed that reduction of phosphorus and nitrogen loads from diffused sources will have a marginal effect on controlling eutrophication if macrophyte growth is left uncontrolled. Scenarios employing macrophyte harvesting and sediment dredging have been evaluated for autochthonous nutrient input control. Sediment dredging alone has been shown to yield the most favorable conditions for water quality improvement in Mogan Lake. Further, control of diffuse pollution was an essential final step to achieve an acceptable long-term sustainable water quality improvement in the lake.

Continuous in-stream water-quality monitors are installed at selected U.S. Geological Survey stream-gaging stations to provide real-time measurement of specific conductance, pH, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and total chlorophyll. In addition, periodic water samples are collected manually and analyzed for nutrients, bacteria, and other constituents of concern. Regression equations then are developed from measurements made by the water-quality monitors and analytical results of manually collected samples. These regression equations are used to estimate nutrient, bacteria, and other constituent concentrations. Concentrations then are available to calculate loads and yields to further assess water quality in watersheds. The continuous and real-time nature of the data may be important when considering recreational use of a water body; developing and monitoring total maximum daily loads; adjusting water-treatment strategies; and determining high constituent concentrations in time to prevent adverse effects on fish or other aquatic life.

They re facing increasing pressure from land and water resources development and, whilst they are considered to be still in relatively good, condition,no studies have yet been carried out to verify this. Such baseline studies are crucial if we are,to assess any ecological changes in response to development and management interventions. The ecological condition of four of these endorheic rivers (Georgina, Diamantina, Cooper-Thomson and Bulloo) flowing into the Lake Eyre and Bulloo Basins in central Australia was assessed using several criteria (level of human influence, habitat condition, water chemistry and aquatic macroinvertebrate composition). Using criteria based on the level of human influence, most of the sites were assessed to be relatively unimpacted (reference) condition. The most discernible and widespread impact was riparian and bank damage by stock access. However, the level of this impact was considered to be only moderate. Most aquatic macroinvertebrates found in the area are considered to be opportunistic and tolerant of a Wide range of environmental conditions, but with their life histories known to be linked to flow conditions. Their trophic guild was dominated by collectors and predators. The AusRivAS modelled observed to expected values of macroinvertebrate composition indicated that there were differences in ecological condition between sites (e.g. different waterholes) and between times (e.g: seasons and years). Overall, 75% of sites were assessed to be good condition with the remainder being mildly impaired. Water chemistry of the sites was characterised by high spatial and temporal variability With low-conductivity and alkaline pH, relatively high turbidity, total nitrogen and total phosphorus, and wide-ranging dissolved oxygen. Given the high variability in water quality and ecological condition within a catchment, there Was little evidence of any overall difference in these factors between the catchments. However, given that the hydrology of each river system is distinctly different, one might expect some differences in ecological structure and function at finer scale. Periods of hydrological isolation (eg. to allow natural dryouts) as well as the maintenance of natural connectivity (eg. instream, overbank and floodplain wetting) are both necessary for the maintenance of ecological integrity of these systems.

Therefore, understanding the flux of ammonia by direct deposition to the biologically active surface layer is critical to understanding the nutrient dynamics of the bay. This paper presents the results of a 2-yr study measuring gaseous ammonia (NH3) and aerosol ammonium (NH4+) in Baltimore and Solomons, MD,from which direct atmospheric loading of total ammonia (N-t = NH3 + NH4+) to the Chesapeake Bay is estimated. Mean atmospheric concentrations of total ammonia for Baltimore and Solomons were 2.7 +/- 1.7 and 1.0 +/- 0.8 mug of N m(-3), respectively. Monte Carlo estimates of gross dry deposition ranged from < 100 to 4900 mug of N m(-2) d(-1). However, based upon water quality parameters, Monte Carlo estimates of gross volatilization of NH3 were calculated to range from < 100 to 7700 mug of N m(-2) d(-1). The resulting net air-sea exchange flux varied seasonally from a net deposition into the water during the winter to a net volatilizing into the atmosphere during the summer. A total of 60% of the paired air-water samples had flux estimates that were not significantly different than equilibrium at the 90% confidence interval. The gross deposition, gross volatilization, and not air-sea fluxes were greater and more variable in Baltimore relative to the rural site. Atmospheric ammonia concentrations decrease during the winter at the rural site. However, the not exchange is still into the water due to an exponential decrease in [NH3](eq) with temperature. These results indicate that the nitrogen-limited Chesapeake Bay can act as a source of ammonia to the local atmosphere.

The role of vegetation in NO3 retention remains unclear and may be direct (uptake) or indirect (stimulation of microbial activity). We studied the riparian shrub Baccharis salicifolia (seepwillow) in Sycamore Creek (Arizona, USA), to determine (1) if sites colonized by seepwillow were sinks for NO3, and (2) the mechanism by which seepwillow causes NO3 retention. Subsurface water was sampled along flowpaths from an uncolonized gravel bar through seepwillow sites at several depths and on several gravel bars. NO3 concentration was significantly lower in seepwillow sites than in uncolonized sites, at least to 20 cm below the water table. Predictions of three hypotheses were tested to explain NO3 losses: (H1) by plant uptake, (H2) by stimulation of denitrification by seepwillow, and (H3) a prior condition unrelated to seepwillow. Six experiments were used to test these hypotheses, Transplant experiments, plant size relationships, and root distribution experiments all demonstrated the importance of seepwillow (rejection of H3). Other tests involving removal of aboveground biomass, denitrification measures, and mass balance calculations showed a predominance of denitrification over uptake (rejection of H1). We conclude that the main effect of seepwillow is to produce organic matter creating conditions favorable to denitrification and a loss of NO3 from subsurface water. Since denitrification is a permanent loss of N to the atmosphere, and uptake only temporarily retains N, the interaction between plants and microbes has important implications for the maintenance of water quality in streams and downstream reservoirs.

Experimental design and results.	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						enhanced biological phosphorus removal; COD/P ratio; anaerobic fraction; sludge retention time	NUTRIENT REMOVAL; SYSTEM; REQUIREMENT; MODEL	The uncontrolled dumping of phosphorus into a water environment creates serious problems of eutrophication, affecting water quality and causing grave problems in the aquatic ecosystem. European legislation demands drastic reduction of phosphorus dissolved in wastewater. Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal (EBPR) is the current tendency in wastewater treatment. This biological process depends on a multiplitity of variables, but its three main factors are: influent COD/P ratio, anaerobic fraction and sludge retention time (SRT). The aim of this work is to statistically determine the effect of these three parameters in EBPR through a response surface methodology. The objective function that has been chosen is phosphorus removed per unit biomass formed. This function provides ample information on BPR, since the quantity of phosphorus removed depends on the accumulative capacity of the microorganisms present. Two levels were chosen for the SRT (5 and 10 days), two for the anaerobic fraction (0.1 and 0.2), and six for levels of the influent COD/P ratio (between 16 and 87). The experiments were undertaken at pilot scale (100 litres) with an A(2)/O configuration, with simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorous removal. The wastewater used is a synthetic mixture of complex sources of carbon and nitrogen without volatile fatty acids. The empirical model obtained indicates that the factor most influencing the EBPR process is the influent COD/P ratio, whilst the anaerobic fraction is that which has least influence. Additionally, there is an optimum in the influent COD/P ratio that is to be found between 41 and 48.

By the year 2010, nitrogen loads are predicted to increase an additional 45% or 58%, depending upon progress being made toward replacing older septic tank systems with centralized sewerage (nitrogen loads of 12.2 and 13.3 kg TN ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). Using 1995 estimates, nonpoint sources (stormwater runoff) are thought to be responsible for ca. 76% of the annual nitrogen load, folllowed by septic tank systems (14%), rainfall (10%), and an insignificant load from baseflow. Based on an empirically-derived nitrogen load:chlorophyll a relationship developed for a portion of nearby Tampa Bay, a 45% increase in nitrogen loads into Lemon Bay could result in a 29% increase in annual average chlorophyll. a concentrations. Using the estimate of a 29% increase in future chlorophyll a concentrations, an empirically-derived optical model for Lemon Bay suggests that light attenuation coefficients in the bay would increase ca. 9%, and the average depth limit of Thalassia testudinum in Lemon Bay would decrease by ca. 24%.

The Riverstrahler model is used to establish the link between these long-term trends in the functioning of the Seine system and the evolution of agricultural, domestic, and industrial activity in the watershed over this period taking into account natural and man-induced hydrological variations. Oxygenation of the fluvial sector below Paris has increased considerably owing to improved wastewater treatment, but a large part of the estuary remains completely anoxic during the spring and summer months. Nitrogen input to surface waters from urban sources has remained essentially constant while diffuse inputs from agricultural soils have increased 5-fold as a result of more intensive agricultural practices as well as the loss of retention capacity in riparian zones. Phosphorus inputs from domestic and industrial sources increased 3-fold from 1950 to 1980, but have decreased gradually in recent years. The generally Wgh level of phosphorus contamination has favored strong algal development in all large tributaries of the Seine River upstream of Paris since the 1960s. Silica inputs, originating mainly from the weathering of rocks, fluctuate widely depending on hydrology. In-stream retention of silica, linked to diatom blooms, has increased but remains limited. These changes have induced several shifts in the nutrient limitation conditions of the Seine Bight.

J	Beutel, MW				Beutel, MW			Oxygen consumption and ammonia accumulation in the hypolimnion of Walker Lake, Nevada	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						ammonia; hypolimnion; oxygen demand; sediment	SEDIMENT PHOSPHORUS RELEASE; FLOW VELOCITY; EUTROPHIC LAKES; WATER-QUALITY; DEEP; DEMAND; TRANSFORMATIONS; DENITRIFICATION; MICROELECTRODE; BACTERIA	Walker Lake (area = 140 km(2), Z(mean) = 19.3 m) is a large, terminal lake in western Nevada. As a result of anthropogenic desiccation, the lake has decreased in volume by 75% since the 1880s. The hypolimnion of the lake, now too small to meet the oxygen demand exerted by decaying matter, rapidly goes anoxic after thermal stratification. Field and laboratory studies were conducted to examine the feasibility of using oxygenation to avoid hypolimnetic anoxia and subsequent accumulation of ammonia in the hypolimnion, and to estimate the required DO capacity of an oxygenation system for the lake. The accumulation of inorganic nitrogen in water overlaying sediment was measured in laboratory chambers under various DO levels. Rates of ammonia accumulation ranged from 16.8 to 23.5 mg-N m(-2) d(-1) in chambers with 0, 2.5 and 4.8 mg L-1 DO, and ammonia release was not significantly different between treatments. Beggiatoa sp. on the sediment surface of the moderately aerated chambers (2.5 and 4.8 mg L-1 DO) indicated that oxygen penetration into sediment was minimal. In contrast, ammonia accumulation was reversed in chambers with 10 mg L-1 DO, where oxygen penetration into sediment stimulated nitrification and denitrification. Ammonia accumulation in anoxic chambers (18.1 and 20.6 mg-N m(-2) d(-1)) was similar to ammonia accumulation in the hypolimnion from July through September of 1998 (16.5 mg-N m(-2) d(-1)). Areal hypolimnetic oxygen demand averaged 1.2 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1) for 1994-1996 and 1998. Sediment oxygen demand (SOD) determined in experimental chambers averaged approximately 0.14 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1). Continuous water currents at the sediment-water interface of 5-6 cm s(-1) resulted in a substantial increase in SOD (0.38 g O-2 m(-2) d(-1)). The recommended oxygen delivery capacity of an oxygenation system, taking into account increased SOD due to mixing in the hypolimnion after system start-up, is 215 Mg d(-1). Experimental results suggest that the system should maintain high levels of DO at the sediment-water interface (similar to10 mg L-1) to insure adequate oxygen penetration into the sediments, and a subsequent inhibition of ammonia accumulation in the hypolimnion of the lake.

Riparian buffers as narrow as 4.6 m (15ft) are eligible for cost-share by USDA. The Riparian Ecosystem Management Model (REMM) provides a tool to judge water quality improvement by buffers and to set design criteria for nutrient and sediment load reduction. REMM was used for a Coastal Plain site to simulate 14 different buffers ranging from 4.6 m to 51.8 m (15 to 170 ft) with three different types of vegetation (hardwood trees, pine trees, and perennial grass) with two water and nutrient loads. The load cases were low sediment/low nutrient - typical of a well managed agricultural field and low sediment/high nutrient - typical of liquid manure application to perennial forage crops. Simulations showed that the minimum width buffer (4.6 m) was inadequate for control of nutrients under either load case. The minimum width buffer that is eligible for cost share assistance on a field with known water quality problems (10.7 m, 35 ft) was projected to achieve at least 50 percent reduction of N, P, and sediment in the load cases simulated.

This paper examines research in the glaciated Northeast to relate variability in ground water nitrate removal to site attributes depicted in readily available spatial databases, such as SSURGO. Linking site-specific studies of riparian ground water nitrate removal to spatial data can help target high-value riparian locations for restoration or protection and improve the modeling of watershed nitrogen flux. Site attributes, such as hydric soil status (soil wetness) and geomorphology, affect the interaction of nitrate-enriched ground water with portions of the soil ecosystem possessing elevated biogeochemical transformation rates (i.e., biologically active zones). At our riparian sites, high ground water nitrate-N removal rates were restricted to hydric soils. Geomorphology provided insights into ground water flowpaths. Riparian sites located on outwash and organic/alluvial deposits have high potential for nitrate-enriched ground water to interact with biologically active zones. In till deposits, ground water nitrate removal capacity may be limited by the high occurrence of surface seeps that markedly reduce the time available for biological transformations to occur within the riparian zone. To fully realize the value of riparian zones for nitrate retention, landscape controls of riparian nitrate removal in different climatic and physiographic regions must be determined and translated into available spatial databases.

J	Baker, ME; Wiley, MJ; Seelbach, PW				Baker, ME; Wiley, MJ; Seelbach, PW			GIS-based hydrologic modeling of riparian areas: Implications for stream water quality	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						aquatic ecosystems; GIS; ground water hydrology; modeling; watershed management; wetlands	LAND-USE; AGRICULTURAL WATERSHEDS; NITRATE DYNAMICS; COASTAL-PLAIN; BUFFER STRIPS; GROUNDWATER; LANDSCAPE; RIVER; FORESTS; PHOSPHORUS	Riparian buffers have potential for reducing excess nutrient levels in surface water. Spatial variation in riparian buffer effectiveness is well recognized, yet researchers and managers still lack effective general tools for understanding the relevance of different hydrologic settings. We present several terrain-based GIS models to predict spatial patterns of shallow, subsurface hydrologic flux and riparian hydrology. We then link predictions of riparian hydrology to patterns of nutrient export in order to demonstrate potential for augmenting the predictive power of land use/land cover (LU/LC) maps. Using predicted hydrology in addition to LU/LC, we observed increases in the explained variation of nutrient exports from 290 sites across Lower Michigan. The results suggest that our hydrologic predictions relate more strongly to patterns of nutrient export than the presence or absence of wetland vegetation, and that in fact the influence of vegetative structure largely depends on its hydrologic context. Such GIS models are useful and complimentary tools for exploring the role of hydrologic routing in riparian ecosystem function and stream water quality. Modeling efforts that take a similar GIS approach to material transport might be used to further explore the causal implications of riparian buffers in heterogeneous watersheds.

J	Kim, JP; Hunter, KA				Kim, JP; Hunter, KA			Geochemical cycling of major and minor elements in the Taieri River and Waipori River catchments	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND			English	Article						major ions; trace metals; geochemical cycling; New Zealand; Taieri; Waipori; river	DISSOLVED TRACE-METALS; NEW-ZEALAND; CENTRAL OTAGO; MANUHERIKIA RIVER; AQUEOUS CHEMISTRY; MISSISSIPPI RIVER; TOTAL PHOSPHORUS; TOTAL NITROGEN; WATERS; ESTUARIES	The concentrations of the major ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-, total alkalinity A(T) and dissolved silica SiO2) and the dissolved trace metals Cu and Zn have been determined in the combined catchments of the Waipori and Taieri Rivers, in Otago, New Zealand. In general, the concentrations of the major ions were low, and were similar to levels observed in other uncontaminated rivers in the South Island. However, elevated concentrations of Na+, Cl-, Ca2+, HCO3-, with mole ratios characteristic of seawater, were found in the lower catchment, indicating intrusion of sea salts by tidal mixing. Significant inputs of nutrients, Zn, and, to a lesser extent, Cu, resulting from sewage effluent of the Mosgiel treatment plant, were observed at some periods during a time series of samples collected over a 20-month period. Estimates, based on the data, of the annual flux of nutrients and trace metals to the lower Taieri River catchment from this source indicate that the treatment plant contributes approximately 45% of the nutrients NO3-, PO43-, and dissolved Zn. This implies that the recent closure of this treatment plant should result in a significant improvement in the water quality of the lower Taieri River.

J	Morgan, C; Owens, N				Morgan, C; Owens, N			Benefits of water quality policies: the Chesapeake Bay	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						benefit analysis; Chesapeake Bay; nutrients; water pollution	OUTDOOR RECREATION; DEMAND	The Chesapeake Bay is a unique and treasured natural resource. It is the largest estuary on the Atlantic coast and one of the largest estuaries in the world. The Chesapeake drains portions of six states: Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New York, and West Virginia and the District of Columbia. As testimony to its importance, the US Congress issued a directive in 1976 to the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) to examine and identify the factors that were altering the conditions of the Bay. Nutrient delivery to the Bay, which has increased dramatically over time, was identified as one of the factors and has been the primary focus of research and policy efforts related to achieving water quality improvements. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the benefits of water quality legislation in the Bay region from 1972, the year the Clean Water Act (CWA) was promulgated, to 1996. Nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorous, are the dominant criteria addressed by this case study. Benefits are assessed from a 'with-without' perspective. That is, 1996 water quality is compared with what it would have been in 1996 without the CWA and related legislation. The US EPA CBP Watershed and Water Quality Models were used to determine the distribution of nutrient loadings from point and non-point sources and characterize water quality. Modeling results indicate that conditions in the Bay are improved in some areas for some pollutants. Total phosphorus has decreased dramatically from 'without' concentrations in all major tributaries and segments of the Chesapeake Bay. The monetized annual boating, fishing, and swimming benefits of water quality improvements in the Chesapeake Bay range from $357.9 million to $1.8 billion. These benefit estimates represent use values for persons living in the District of Columbia, and portions of Maryland and Virginia. Residents of Delaware, New York, and Pennsylvania, which are also part of the Bay Watershed, are not included in this analysis. As such, this range likely underestimates the true benefits of Bay water quality improvement. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

It uses a finite differences scheme for spatial integration and a Runge-Kutta IV order or the Euler scheme for temporal integration. It includes the advection and diffusion of the considered variables and the analysis of biochemical interaction between phytoplankton, nutrients, zooplankton, detritus and dissolved oxygen. The release of nutrients and pollutants due to river discharge or to sediment re-suspended by sea bottom dredging is also considered. Model performance has been tested against analytical solutions.

J	Power, JF; Wiese, R; Flowerday, D				Power, JF; Wiese, R; Flowerday, D			Managing farming systems for nitrate control: A research review from management systems evaluation areas	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Review							FIELD-SCALE VARIABILITY; WATER-QUALITY; NITROGEN STRESS; IRRIGATED CORN; RIDGE-TILLAGE; AERIAL-PHOTOGRAPHY; CHLOROPHYLL METER; DRAINAGE WATER; NO-TILL; SOIL	The U.S. Department of Agriculture funded the Management Systems Evaluation Area (MSEA) research project in 1990 to evaluate effectiveness of present fanning systems in controlling nitrate N in water resources and to develop improved technologies for farming systems. This paper summarizes published research results of a five-year effort. Most research is focused on evaluating the effectiveness of farming system components (fertilizer, tillage, water control, cropping systems, and soil and weather variability). The research results show that current soil nitrate tests reliably predict fertilizer N needed to control environmental and economic risks for crop production. A corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] rotation usually controls risk better than continuous corn, but both may result in unacceptable nitrate leaching. Reduced tillage, especially ridge-till, is better than clean tillage in reducing risk. The drainage controls nitrate in ground water, but discharge may increase nitrate in surface waters. Sprinkler irrigation systems provide better water control than furrow irrigation because quantity and spatial variability of applied water is reduced. Present farming systems have two major deficiencies: (i) entire fields are managed uniformly, ignoring inherent soil variability within a field; and (ii) N fertilizer rates and many field practices are selected assuming normal weather for the coming season. Both deficiencies can contribute to nitrate leaching in parts of most fields.

It is subject to blooms of the toxic cyanobacterium Anabaena circinalis, which present significant water quality problems. As a result of these blooms, an algal management strategy has been developed for the Murray-Darling basin. One of the major objectives of the strategy is the development of flow management strategies for key reaches of the river system. Intensive studies in the Murrumbidgee River, Australia, have indicated that persistent thermal stratification is a requirement for blooms of this cyanobacterium to occur. In the lower Murray, mean wind speed was found to be the major factor affecting the degree of thermal stratification under low flow conditions, which generally exist during the months of December to March. In this paper, the effect of various flow management scenarios on the likelihood of the occurrence of blooms in the River Murray at Morgan, South Australia, are assessed. A frequency analysis is carried out on 30 years of wind speed data to determine the probability of occurrence of persistent thermal stratification under a number of flow regimes. The scenarios evaluated include existing base flow conditions, altered base flow regimes, temporary releases from an upstream storage (Lake Victoria) and the temporary reduction of weir pool levels. The results obtained indicate that the dispersal of existing blooms by simultaneously reducing the weir pool levels at Locks 1-3 is the most effective and economical strategy for combating bloom formation by A. circinalis in the River Murray at Morgan.

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which had been validated for flow and sediment and nutrient transport, was applied to quantify the effects of Best Management Practices (BMPs) related to dairy manure management and municipal waste water treatment plant effluent. Results are presented for the period from 1960 through 1998 for three sites along the North Bosque River Results are presented as annual time-weighted concentrations (average of the daily load divided by daily flow over a year) and annual flow-weighted concentrations (total cumulative load divided by total cumulative flow over a year). The wastewater treatment plant BMPs resulted in greater improvement in time-weighted instream soluble phosphorus concentrations than dairy BMPs. On the other hand, dairy BMPs made greater differences in flow-weighted concentrations. This study showed that SWAT could be a useful tool for studying the effects of alternative management scenarios for pollution control from point and nonpoint sources in large watersheds.

J	Chinkuyu, AJ; Kanwar, RS				Chinkuyu, AJ; Kanwar, RS			Predicting soil nitrate-nitrogen losses from incorporated poultry manure using the GLEAMS model	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						lysimeters; poultry manure; NO(3)(-)-N; drainage; GLEAMS; nitrate; nitrogen; nonpoint source	SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE WATER; SIMULATION; TILLAGE; LITTER; CROP	Proper calibration and validation of computer models can inexpensively and quickly assess the impacts of different agricultural management practices on water quality. This study used Groundwater Loading Effects of Agricultural Management Systems (GLEAMS) version 2.1 to determine the effects of two nitrogen (N) application rates (168 kg N/ha (168PM) and 336 kg -N/ha (336PM))from poultry manure and one N application rate (168 kg N/ha (168UAN)) from urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) fertilizer on NO(3)(-)-N loss with subsurface drainage. The simulated NO(3)(-)-N losses by the GLEAMS model were compared with two-year (1999 and 2000) monthly measured NO(3)(-)-N losses from six 2.1-m(2)field lysimeters under continuous corn production. Results indicated that the two-year average simulated subsurface drainage consistently followed the average measured subsurface drainage from 168UAN, 168PM, and 336PM treatments, with mean errors of 9%,3%, and -2%, respectively. The model was capable of predicting overall NO(3)(-)-N concentration in subsurface drainage front lysimeters tinder 168UAN, 168PM, and 336PM treatments reasonably well, giving mean errors of 19%, -29%, and 9%, respectively. The overall two-year results also show that there were no significant differences (p= 0.05) between average measured and simulated NO(3)(-)-N losses with subsurface drainage from poultry manure treatments. The study concluded that the GLEAMS model can be used as a viable management and decision-making tool to assess the impacts of long-term poultry manure application on water quality and agricultural production for Iowa soils.

This study was conducted to compare interrill runoff losses of P and N from three soils following the application of swine manure obtained from selected diets. The soils used in this investigation included a Hersh sandy loam, Pierre silty clay, and Sharpsburg silt loam. Simulated rainfall was applied during both initial and wet runs to a soil pan on which swine manure produced from low phytate corn (LPC), phytase added to the diet (PHY), or a traditional corn diet (TCD) was added. Additional experimental treatments included inorganic fertilizer and an untreated check. For the initial rainfall simulation run, concentrations of dissolved P, bioavailable P, and Total P were greater for the fertilizer treatment than any of the manure treatments. Use of manure from a LPC diet generally did not result in a reduction in N and P concentrations in runoff when compared with the TCD. Concentrations and total amounts of nutrients transported in runoff were affected by soil type. Changing the TCD to LPC and PHY diets to reduce the P content of manure did not significantly affect the total amounts of DP, BAP, or Total P transported in runoff, when simulated rainfall was applied soon after manure application.

J	McDowell, RW; Sharpley, AN				McDowell, RW; Sharpley, AN			Phosphorus losses in subsurface flow before and after manure application to intensively farmed land	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						phosphorus losses; subsurface flow; leaching; manure	WATER-QUALITY; SOIL; GRASSLAND; MOBILITY; NITROGEN; SORPTION	A study was conducted to examine the loss of P in subsurface flow from three cultivated soils of varying soil P concentrations. Measurements were made in flow waters from the soils before applying manure and then 3 weeks after sowing the soils to grass. An additional measurement of P in flow waters was made 1 year later. Dissolved reactive P (DRP) concentrations measured in flow water before (0.15-0.20 mg l(-1)) and after (0.39-0.51 mg l(-1)) manure application exceed current estimates of those required to promote surface water eutrophication (0.05 mg l(-1)). Concentrations of DRP 1 year after manurial application increased compared to 3 weeks after application and was attributed to the slow movement of P down the cultivated soil. Concentrations of soil P were significantly increased down the soil profile and attributed to the P saturation of soils before manurial application. The results suggest that despite the establishment of fast growing grass, P concentrations would not be mitigated in the short-term (= 1 year), due to the large contribution of P in subsurface pathways.

The model consists of a 2-D hydrodynamic and a chemical-biological blocks and is an intermediate variant between the self-purification models.. usually used in the engineering practice, and the eutrophication models. The advanced engineering parts are: (1) the grid and subgrid hydrodynamic formulation; (2) the anthropogenic and natural organic matter fluxes; and (3) relations between the phytoplankton productivity and the conditions of the nutrients and light. The model was calibrated and applied for the Cienaga de Tesca shallow lagoon (Colombia). Results, obtained by means of numerical simulations, are considered as possible alternatives to improve the ecological state of the Cienaga de Tesca. Engineering dignities of the model are coupled in a minimum available hydrobiological information that is needed and the representation of model results. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Gardi, C				Gardi, C			Land use, agronomic management and water quality in a small northern Italian watershed	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						watershed; water quality; crop simulation model; GIS; land use; northern Italy	NITRATE; SEDIMENT; NITROGEN; RUNOFF	European union (EU) agricultural policy has induced significant changes in crop rotations, especially in marginal areas. The evaluation of the impact on water quality induced by this new agronomic framework is presented in this paper. The discharge, the sediment content and the concentrations of herbicides and nitrates in the Centonara creek, draining a hilly watershed near Bologna, were measured from October 1994 to September 1996. A geographic information system (GIS) and the crop simulation model CropSyst were used to characterize the relationships between cropping systems, land use, pedological and morphological properties of the watershed as well as nitrate losses. Hydrological results showed that the Centonara creek discharge was characterized by low base flows and by fast increments during flooding. Herbicide concentrations were above the EU 0.1 mug l(-1) limit on several occasions, whereas nitrate concentrations were always below the 50 mg l(-1) limit established by EU for drinking waters. It was estimated that more than 30% of the nitrogen input in the watershed is due to atmospheric depositions. The purpose of GIS was to subdivide the watershed in 86 "agronomically homogeneous areas", which were then utilized as the basis for the application of CropSyst. Simulations obtained by the model showed that the greatest leaching losses of nitrates were higher than 10 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) exclusively in the agronomically homogeneous areas characterized by coarser textured soils. Overall nitrate and herbicide losses were low, mainly due to the differentiation of the cropping systems in the watershed. The combined use of GIS and CropSyst enabled the characterization of the environmental vulnerability in relation to the land use in the watershed by means of pedologic cartography, land use maps and meteorological data. In particular, erosion and herbicide losses were higher in sloping areas planted with spring-summer crops. The increase in row crops cultivations, determined by EU agricultural policy, represents the main impact on water quality of the investigated area. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Downing, JA; Watson, SB; McCauley, E				Downing, JA; Watson, SB; McCauley, E			Predicting Cyanobacteria dominance in lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article							BLUE-GREEN-ALGAE; TOTAL PHOSPHORUS; N-P; NITROGEN; BIOMASS; RATIOS	A controversial precept of aquatic ecology asserts that low ratios of nitrogen to phosphorus (N:P) lead to noxious and sometimes toxic blooms of Cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria dominance is a major risk to human and ecosystem health. The stoichiometric control of Cyanobacteria therefore has become central to freshwater resource management. This controversial concept is based on observed Cyanobacteria dominance in lakes with low N:P and the results of lab and field experiments. Here we analyze data from 99 of the temperate zone's most studied lakes and show that this model is flawed. We show that the risk of water quality degradation by Cyanobacteria blooms is more strongly correlated with variation in total P, total N, or standing algae biomass than the ratio of N:P. Risks associated with Cyanobacteria are therefore less associated with N:P ratios than a simple increase in nutrient concentrations and algal biomass.

Here we summarize a decadal field effort in fish kill assessment, encompassing kills related to Pfiesteria (49 major kills in North Carolina estuaries since 1991 and 4 in Maryland estuaries in 1997) and to other factors such as low oxygen stress (79 major fish kills in North Carolina estuaries). The laboratory and field data considered in developing our protocols are described, including toxic Pfiesteria behavior, environmental conditions conducive to toxic Pfiesteria activity, and impacts of toxic clonal Pfiesteria on fish health. We outline the steps of the standardized fish bioassay procedure that has been used since 1991 to diagnose whether actively toxic Pfiesteria was present during estuarine fish kills. Detailed data are given for a 1998 toxic Pfiesteria outbreak in the Neuse Estuary in North Carolina to illustrate of the full suite of diagnostic steps completed. We demonstrate that our conservative approach in implicating toxic Pfiesteria involvement in fish kills has biased in favor of causes other than Pfiesteria. Data are summarized from experiments that have shown stimulation of toxic Pfiesteria strains by nutrient (N, P) enrichment, supporting field observations of highest abundance of toxic strains in eutrophic estuaries. On the basis of a decade of research on toxic Ffiesteria, we present a conceptual model of the seasonal dynamics of toxic strains as affected by changing food resources and weather patterns. We also recommend protocols and research approaches that will strengthen the science of fish kill assessment related to Pfiesteria and/or other causative factors.

Sample sites were near freshwater outlets in the Bay and popular sandy beaches. RT-PCR is a primer-based molecular biology technique, used to detect the genomes of specific groups or types of viruses based upon conserved sequences. Results of the 50 analyses showed our ultrafiltration concentration methods and RT-PCR protocol could be used consistently to detect enteroviruses from 201 samples of coastal seawater. Of the 50 samples, 16 (32%) were positive for enteroviruses, 27 (54%) were negative and 7 (14%) were inconclusive. There was no significant correlation between (lie presence of enteroviruses and individual standard microbiological indicators of fecal contamination, specifically total coliforms. fecal coliforms, or enterococci (r=0.14, r=0.28 and r=0.34, respectively, p>0.05). However, there was a significant correlation r=0.71) to a combined set of bacterial water quality standards, involving all three indicators, recently adopted in California. There was no significant correlation between the RT-PCR results and levels of rainfall (a large source of runoff), but our analyses demonstrated that positive results for enteroviruses were significantly more likely during the winter 'wet' season than during the summer 'dry' season. Our results demonstrate that RT-PCR is an effective method for the detection of enteroviruses in coastal seawater, and they suggest that bacterial indicators are not necessarily good predictors of the presence of such viruses. Enteroviruses are known to be important etiological agents of disease from recreational water contact, so analysis for their presence might be advisable at certain locations (e.g. high-use sandy beaches) or during certain seasons of the year.

J	Mahujchariyawong, J				Mahujchariyawong, J			Modelling sustainable water quality improvement using water hyacinth and its application in Thailand	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY			English	Article						eutrophication; maximum sustainable yield (MSY); natural waterway; nutrient removal; water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes)		This study contains a harvest model of water hyacinth which is applicable in natural waterways for nutrient removal at maximum sustainable yield (MSY). When the concentration of inorganic nitrogen in water (WA) (and the concentration of phosphorus in water (W-P) in the case of W-N < 0.164) is measured, MSY and the potential of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) removal from water by harvesting water hyacinth can be calculated from this model. The harvest biomass and nutrient removal are dependent on the concentration of nutrient in the water and the farming surface area. In this case study of Bangkok, Thailand, the potential for nitrogen and phosphor-us removal is compared between input and output of nutrient in the natural water-ways. The potential in the current condition reaches rates of 1.25% and 0.006%, respectively, while the potential of expected application in the future reaches rates of 1.45% and 0.007%, respectively.

The test system is a short (2.3 km) phytoplankton-rich section of the Seneca River, N.Y., which is believed to represent an upper bound of the impact of this exotic invader on oxygen resources because of the unusually high population densities and limited turbulent mixing that prevail. Model calibration is supported by comprehensive measurements of DO, which resolve diurnal and seasonal patterns, and various forcing conditions over a four-month period. Wide temporal variations in the areal consumption rate of DO by zebra mussels [zebra mussel oxygen demand (ZOD), g . m(-2) . day(-1)] were determined through model calibration. These determinations are supported by closure with earlier estimates based on simple DO budget calculations, and with laboratory biomass-specific oxygen consumption rates published in the scientific literature, Values of ZOD at times (e.g., > 50 g . m(-2) . day(-1)) were an order of magnitude greater than the sediment oxygen demand associated with organically enriched deposits. The model performs well in simulating important features of the complex patterns of DO observed, including (1) DO depletion across the study section; (2) vertical DO stratification, and (3) diurnal changes. ZOD was the dominant sink for DO over the river study section; it was entirely responsible for the substantial observed DO depletion, and it was the major cause of the DO stratification during periods of low flow. A preliminary extension of the model is demonstrated to be successful in simulating the persistence of DO depletion 15 km downstream. The model is expected to have management utility for this and other phytoplankton-rich rivers that have been, or will be, invaded by zebra mussels.

Previous work has shown that under certain situations, application of broiler (Gallus gallus domesticus) litter to grasslands may lead to elevated levels of phosphorus (P) in surface runoff. The EPIC simulation model may be a useful tool to identify those situations. This work A as conducted to evaluate EPIC's ability to simulate event and annual runoff volume and losses of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) from tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.)-bermudagrass [Cynodon dacrylon (L.) Pers.] paddocks fertilized with broiler litter. The EPIC simulations of event runoff volume showed a trend toward underestimation, particularly for runoff events > 30 mm. On an annual basis, EPIC also tended to underestimate runoff, especially at runoff volumes > 100 mm. Both event and annual runoff estimations were strongly associated with observed values, indicating that model calibration could improve the simulation of surface runoff volume. The relationship between simulated and observed values of DRP loss was relatively poor on an event basis (r = 0.65), but was stronger (r = 0.75) on an annual basis. In general, EPIC tended to underestimate annual DRP losses. This underestimation was apparently caused by the lack of an explicit mechanism to model broiler litter on the soil surface. These results suggested that additional work on the EPIC P submodel would be warranted to improve its simulation of surface application of broiler litter to grasslands.

The methodology is based on integrating End Member Mixing Analysis (EMMA), the Model of Acidification of Groundwater in Catchments (MAGIC) and spatial data describing the catchment characteristics stored on a Geographical Information System (GIS). These are integrated within a Functional Unit Network (FUN) to predict the changes in Gran alkalinity resulting from possible future changes in atmospheric deposition and land use (low intensity afforestation) in the River Dee catchment, NE Scotland. Model results indicate that declining sulphate and constant nitrogen deposition, combined with low intensity Scots pine (Pines sylvestris) afforestation are unlikely to contribute significantly to streamwater acidification.

J	Zhou, MF; Li, YC				Zhou, MF; Li, YC			Phosphorus-sorption characteristics of calcareous soils and limestone from the southern Everglades and adjacent farmlands	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL			English	Article							PHOSPHATE SORPTION; CALCIUM-CARBONATE; FRACTIONATION; HORIZONS; RUNOFF	The understanding of P sorption and desorption by soils is important for safeguarding water quality and for fertilizer management. Little is known about the P-sorption characteristics of the calcareous soils and limestone bedrocks in southern Florida. In this study, 19 samples of calcareous soil and subsurface limestone bedrock were collected from the southern Everglades wetland, pineland, and nearby farmland. At very low P concentrations. P sorption in these soils fit the linear isotherm. The equilibrium P concentration at zero-net P sorption (EPCo) of soils correlated positively with P saturation. Phosphorus-sorption data of soils at medium P concentrations fit the Freundlich and Langmuir equations up to a point at high P concentrations where the slope of the isotherm changed abruptly. In bedrock samples the sorption-isotherm-inflection point, which is caused by P precipitation, occurred at much lower solution P concentrations than in the case of soils (4-18 vs. 400-600 mg mL (1)). Also bedrock samples had significantly lower Freundlich values, K-f, than soils. The sorption of Pin soils occurred at relatively low solution P concentrations (as indicated by Freundlich value, K-f), and appears to be caused by strong affinity of the noncarbonate clay, while the P sorption at relatively high solution concentrations (as indicted by Langmuir maximum sorption, S-max) appears to be caused by the affinities of both the noncarbonate clay and carbonate clay. Phosphorus-sorption values (P-sorption) estimated from the one-point isotherm were comparable with the S-max values calculated from the Langmuir isotherm. Phosphorus saturation and the P-retention capacities (S-max or P-sorption) were correlated strongly to the percentage of P desorption.

Drainage waters from the agricultural lands in the EAA contribute nutrients, primarily phosphorus, to downstream regions, including Everglades National Park. The growers in the EAA are participating in a major program to implement agricultural management practices that minimize the nutrient load attributed to their discharge waters. Farm- and basin-scale studies showed that the bulk of exported particulate phosphorus (PP) originates from biotic material growing in farm canals. This was contrary to previous assumptions that soil erosion was the primary PP contributor Computer modeling of PP transport can allow economical evaluation of various control schemes. Such an effort requires a mathematical model that accurately describes the spatial and temporal variation of the biologically sourced suspended solids encountered in the EAA. This work presents a lumped-parameter mathematical model that describes sourcing, mobilization, transport, and demobilization of phosphorus-containing organic matter on the farm scale. The model was calibrated and validated on a 518(-ha) sugarcane farm in the EAA. It was then used to evaluate several typical management practices.

J	Kadlec, RH; Reddy, KR				Kadlec, RH; Reddy, KR			Temperature effects in treatment wetlands	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH			English	Article						temperature; season; pollutant removal; treatment wetlands; nitrogen; phosphorus; biochemical oxygen demand; design models	FRESH-WATER WETLANDS; BIOLOGICAL TREATMENT; NITROGEN; DENITRIFICATION; PHOSPHORUS; MODEL; NITRIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; RETENTION; SEDIMENT	Several biogeochemical processes that regulate the removal of nutrients in wetlands are affected by temperature, thus influencing the overall treatment efficiency. In this paper, the effects of temperature on carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling processes in treatment wetlands and their implications to water quality are discussed. Many environmental factors display annual cycles that mediate whole system performance. Water temperature is one of the important cyclic stimuli, but inlet flow rates and concentrations, and several features of the annual biogeochemical cycle, also can contribute to the observed patterns of nutrient and pollutant removal. Atmospheric influences, including rain, evapotranspiration, and water reaeration, also follow seasonal patterns. Processes regulating storages in wetlands are active throughout the year and can act as seasonal reservoirs of nutrients, carbon, and pollutants. Many individual wetland processes, such as microbially mediated reactions, are affected by temperature. Response was much greater to changes at the lower end of the temperature scale (< 15 degreesC) than at the optimal range (20 to 35 degreesC). Processes regulating organic matter decomposition are affected by temperature. Similarly, all nitrogen cycling reactions (mineralization, nitrification, and denitrification) are affected by temperature. The temperature coefficient (theta) varied from 1.05 to 1.37 for carbon and nitrogen cycling processes during isolated conditions. Phosphorus sorption reactions are least affected by temperature, with 6 values of 1.03 to 1.12. Physical processes involved in the removal of particulate carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus are not affected much by temperature. In contrast, observed wetland removals may have different temperature dependence. Design models are oversimplified because of limitations of data for calibration. The result of complex system behavior and the simple model is the need to interpret whole ecosystem data to determine temperature coefficients. Temperature seems to have minimal effect on biochemical oxygen demand (0.900 < theta < 1.015) and phosphorus (0.995 < theta < 1.020) removal, and more significant effect on nitrogen removal (0.988 < theta < 1.16). In colder climates, there may be seasonal slowdown of treatment, which can decrease the overall treatment efficiency of constructed wetlands.

A mass balance model was developed to predict phosphorus fate and transport in the Everglades Protection Area that could result from proposed phosphorus reduction strategies, The modeled area is about a 7000 km(2) region that is divided into 642, 3.2 x 3.2 km cells, plus additional cell areas for canals. Phosphorus is transported between model cells and canals in accordance with output from a regional hydrology model. Simulated water column phosphor-us dynamics within each cell and canal is further controlled by a simple, apparent net settling rate coefficient that integrates the effects of chemical, biological, and physical processes, and leads to net deposition of phosphorus in the sediments. After specification of external phosphorus loads (surface water and atmospheric wet and dry deposition) and system boundary conditions, the model was calibrated to available field data. The calibration procedure consisted of varying the apparent net settling rate coefficients in the WCA and the ENP. The goodness of fit of predicted water column total phosphorus concentrations varied temporally and spatially. Sediment phosphorus net deposition rates calculated by the model matched well with in situ observations where available. The model indicates that phosphorus in seasonal rainfall is a dominant influence on water column phosphorus dynamics in remote areas of the Everglades, whereas phosphorus dynamics in cells directly downstream of runoff inputs exhibit well-documented, nutrient gradients in receiving waters and sediments that could not be caused by rainfall alone. The model suggests that reductions of phosphorus concentrations leaving agricultural areas at the north end of the system will lead to lower concentrations entering ENP at the south end of the system.

J	Bowen, JL; Valiela, I				Bowen, JL; Valiela, I			The ecological effects of urbanization of coastal watersheds: historical increases in nitrogen loads and eutrophication of Waquoit Bay estuaries	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION; LAND-USE; NUTRIENT; NITRATE; INPUTS; PRECIPITATION; MANAGEMENT; VEGETATION; ECOSYSTEM; FLUXES	Historical changes in land use on coastal watersheds have increased rates of land-derived nitrogen loading to estuaries and altered their biogeochemistry and food webs. We used information on human populations and land uses within the watershed of Waquoit Bay, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, U.S.A., to model how nitrogen loads derived from atmospheric deposition, fertilizer use, and wastewater disposal have changed since the 1930s. Nitrogen loading into Waquoit Bay more than doubled between 1938 and 1990. The predominant source of nitrogen added to the bay changed from atmospheric deposition to wastewater disposal during the 1980s, reflecting the increasing urbanization of Cape Cod. Larger nitrogen loads increased nitrogen concentrations in the water, altering the assemblage of primary producers and resulting in eutrophication of the estuary. Biomass of phytoplankton and macroalgae increased, and areal cover of eelgrass (Zostera marina) decreased, with increasing nitrogen load. An increase in nitrogen load from 15 to 30 kg N.ha(-1).year(-1) virtually eliminated eelgrass meadows. Land-use changes prompted by urban sprawl can therefore be linked to marked changes in water quality and eutrophication of receiving waters.

The suitability of this model was tested to predict metal retention in a young constructed wetland receiving agricultural and urban runoff. During two years, water samples for total and dissolved metal analyses were collected every third day at both the inlet and the outlet. The wetland retained metals best during summer and fall whereas during winter the retention of metals was significantly lower. The first-order removal model predicted Fe and Mn retention in the spring and dissolved Zn retention from spring to fall in both years. During those periods, hydraulic retention times: (HRTs) greater than 7 days provided maximum retention for Fe, Mn, and dissolved Zn. However, first-order removal models failed to fit summer, fall and winter data fur almost every metal under investigation (Fe, Mn, dissolved Cu, dissolved As) suggesting that HRTs (< 1-25 days) did not affect metal retention during these seasons. The metal loading to the wetland was low and the input of metals through internal loading may be more significant consequently decreasing the metal retention. Therefore, the first-order removal model is inadequate to predict metal retention on a seasonal basis. Models used to design constructed wetlands under cold climates must consider seasonal changes that affect biological as well as hydrological variables. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

We used a spatially-explicit three-dimensional (3-D) model that divided the heterogeneous habitat of Chesapeake Bay into over 4,000 cubes. Each cube represented a volume of water that was characterized by a specific set of environmental variables (phytoplankton biomass, temperature, and dissolved oxygen) driven by the 3-D water quality model. Foraging and bioenergetics models transformed the environmental variables into measures of potential growth rates of menhaden. Potential carrying capacity of menhaden was estimated as a function of phytoplankton production, menhaden consumption rate, and potential growth rate, combining phytoplankton production, thermal habitat, and menhaden physiology into one ecological value that is a measure of habitat quality from the perspective of the fish. Seasonal analysis of the Chesapeake Bay carrying capacity for Atlantic menhaden suggested two bottleneck periods: one in early June and a second during the fall. The fall bottleneck in carrying capacity was at about 10 billion age-0 fish. Annual recruitment of age-0 menhaden for the entire Atlantic coast of the U.S. ranged from 1.2-18.6 billion fish between 1955 and 1986. It appears that carrying capacity of Chesapeake Bay does not limit the coastwide production of young menhaden. Any conditions such as nutrient reduction strategies, further eutrophication, or global climatic warming, that may influence the carrying capacity during the fall or early June periods, may ultimately alter coastwide abundance of menhaden through changes in Chesapeake Bay carrying capacity.

Fortunately, water samples and the total biomass of aquatic plants were collected at the same time of acquired satellite image (September 1995). TM bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 and band ratios 3/1, 2/1, 2/4, and 3/4 were compared with in situ measurements and laboratory analysis of water samples. The water quality of interest included K+, Na+, total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, Salinity, depth, Secchi disc, and biomass of the aquatic plants (submerged, floating, and emergent). Correlation and regression models were developed between each of the water quality parameter measurements and the radiance of image data. Some water quality parameters were significantly correlated with TM radiance data. Subsequently, the regression models were used to prepare digital cartographic products depicting the water quality over the entire study area. This Study Constitutes the first effort to use Landsat TM data for mapping water quality parameters in all over the Egyptian lagoons.

J	Johnson, GD; Myers, WL; Patil, GP				Johnson, GD; Myers, WL; Patil, GP			Predictability of surface water pollution loading in Pennsylvania using watershed-based landscape measurements	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						landscape patterns; nutrient loading; pollution potential; water quality; watersheds; multi-scale relationships	PATTERNS; ECOLOGY; QUALITY; SCALE; GIS	We formally evaluated the relationship between landscape characteristics and surface water quality in the state of Pennsylvania (USA) by regressing two different types of pollutant responses on landscape variables that were measured for whole watersheds. One response was the monthly exported mass of nitrogen estimated from field measurements, while the other response was a GIS-modeled pollution potential index. Regression models were built by the stepwise selection protocol, choosing an optimal set of landscape predictors. After factoring out the effect of physiography, the dominant predictors were the proportion of "annual herbaceous" land and "total herbaceous" land for the nitrogen loading and pollution potential index, respectively. The strength of these single predictors is encouraging because the marginal land cover proportions are the simplest landscape measurements to obtain once a land cover map is in hand; however, the optimal set of predictors also included several measurements of spatial pattern. Thus, for watersheds at this general hierarchical scale, gross landscape pattern may be an important influence on instream pollution loading. Overall, there is strong evidence that using landscape measurements alone, obtained solely from remotely sensed data, can explain most of the water quality variability (R-2 approximate to approx. 0.75) within these watersheds.

Phosphorus and nitrogen loads and concentrations entering and leaving a subtropical wetland (the Everglades Nutrient Removal Project, ENRP) were calculated on the basis of three sampling frequencies. The first frequency included weekly composite samples (three daily samples composited for one week) and grab samples from August 1994 to July 1997, representing a base-line condition for comparison with results using reduced sampling frequencies. The second and third sampling frequency included three and two composite samples per month, respectively, drawn from the weekly samples. Total phosphorus and nitrogen loads calculated using two and three samples per month were almost identical to results based on four samples per month (least-squares regression coefficients ranged from 0.96 to 0.98). Results of monthly mean flow-weighted nutrient concentrations, obtained using reduced sampling frequencies, also were strongly correlated to concentrations calculated using the base-line sampling frequency (r(2) ranged from 0.82 to 0.93). Grab samples did not always provide good estimates of loads or concentrations, particularly at the inflow when data were highly variable. From the results of this study, we can recommend that bi-weekly composite sampling be used to Monitor nutrient concentrations and loads discharged from larger-scale Everglades Stormwater Treatment Areas (STAs) now under construction. Because there are high costs associated with water sample collection and processing, studies to identify optimal sampling frequencies should be a key feature in the design of any comprehensive wetland-monitoring program.

J	Bonnet, MP; Wessen, K				Bonnet, MP; Wessen, K			ELMO, a 3-D water quality model for nutrients and chlorophyll: first application on a lacustrine ecosystem	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						3-D ecological model; nutrients; phosphorus; phytoplankton; hydrodynamics; lake	LAKE; SHALLOW; PHYTOPLANKTON; FLOW	Water quality degradation is a worldwide object of concern, involving the development of management tools. 1-D ecological modeling is now a common approach to investigate the seasonal time scale of the dominant processes in aquatic ecosystems. The purpose of this study was to determine the hydrodynamic and ecological responses of the system to short forcing events such as strong winds or flood, when the 1-D assumption is no longer valid. To reach this goal, we developed a 3-D ecological model that describes the biogeochemical processes in the lake and the sedimentary transport. It was applied on the lake Burragorang (near Sydney, Australia). Results show that for wind events, lateral heterogeneities may be as strong as in the vertical direction. Ir there are major hydrodynamic influences on the ecosystem behavior, living communities responses seem to be very quick. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

It is based on horizontally averaged changes in substance and organism concentrations due to vertical mixing, sedimentation, in- and outflows and biogeochemical conversion processes in the water column and in adjacent sediment layers. The biological part of the model was kept as simple as possible with the three plankton classes Planktothrix Oscillatoria) rubescens (most abundant blue-green algae in the lake), other algae and zooplankton. Due to a strong phosphate limitation of algae growth in summer, the stoichiometry of primary production with respect to phosphorus had to be made variable in order to describe data sets available from Lake Zurich. In addition, a process of phosphate uptake of organic particles sinking through the hypolimnion had to be taken into account. After adjusting some model parameters, the model was able to reproduce the key features of the nutrient and oxygen profiles and of algae -zooplankton interactions over several years. However, it was not able to predict occasionally occurring blooms of specific types of algae. This shows that the model is a good tool for studying the dynamics of the key processes governing plankton and nutrient dynamics in the lake, but that it is not detailed enough for the investigation of rarely occurring phenomena involving specific types of algae and for an accurate representation of zooplankton dynamics.

J	Verburg, PSJ; Johnson, DW				Verburg, PSJ; Johnson, DW			A spreadsheet-based biogeochemical model to simulate nutrient cycling processes in forest ecosystems	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						nutrient cycling; modeling; forest soils; nitrogen mineralization; leaching	SOLLING SPRUCE SITE; LUMPED-PARAMETER MODEL; SOIL ACIDIFICATION; ACID DEPOSITION; PINE FOREST; NITROGEN; GROWTH; CARBON; DECOMPOSITION; GERMANY	A Nutrient Cycling Spreadsheet (NuCSS) model was developed to simulate nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. This model is intended to provide a tool for nutrient management and is intermediate in complexity between simple budget calculations and complex, process-based ecosystem models. NuCSS simulates biomass production, organic matter decomposition, N mineralization, cation adsorption, weathering and leaching (hydrology not included) using empirical relationships and simple mechanistic process descriptions. The model calculates a target biomass production and associated nutrient uptake. By reviewing soil nutrient pools the user can assess whether available soil nutrients can sustain the targeted biomass production. NuCSS was calibrated to a Norway spruce site in the Solling Mountains, Germany. The model performance was evaluated using long-term data on deposition, vegetation, water quality and soil nutrient inventories. Long-term predictions were made using a 'business as usual' and two reduced deposition scenarios. Results from NuCSS were compared with simulations from other biogeochemical models. The element distribution over soil, forest floor and vegetation closely matched measurements both after one and 15 years. Forest floor nutrients were underestimated but data on forest floor accumulation proved to be unreliable. NuCSS overestimated N uptake, N mineralization and leaching but not enough data on these fluxes were available to determine whether NuCSS was wrong. Simulated base cation leaching agreed well with the measurements but K leaching was overestimated most likely due to an underestimation of the selectivity coefficient for K adsorption. The reduced deposition scenarios caused N and base cation leaching to decrease with time. When N deposition was reduced by 95%, a N deficit occurred and N mineralization and deposition could not sustain the (fixed) uptake. For most simulated parameters NuCSS agreed well with more detailed, process-based, biogeochemical models. In general, NuCSS simulated a higher N leaching and N mineralization than most other models. Trends in base saturation and base cation leaching simulated by NuCSS agreed well with other models. The model proved to be helpful in addressing some of the uncertainties in nutrient cycling regarding vegetation uptake, weathering rates and N mineralization. Given the uncertainties in description of certain processes, a quantitative use of NuCSS may not be justified. These uncertainties also apply to more complex nutrient cycling models, however.

J	Rupert, MG				Rupert, MG			Calibration of the DRASTIC ground water vulnerability mapping method	GROUND WATER			English	Article								Ground water vulnerability maps developed using the DRASTIC method have been produced in many parts of the world. Comparisons of those maps with actual ground water quality data have shown that the DRASTIC method is typically a poor predictor of ground water contamination, This study significantly improved the effectiveness of a modified DRASTIC ground water vulnerability map by calibrating the point rating schemes to actual ground water quality data by using nonparametric statistical techniques and a geographic information system. Calibration was performed by comparing data on nitrite plus nitrate as nitrogen (NO2 + NO3-N) concentrations in ground water to land-use, soils, and depth to first-encountered ground water data. These comparisons showed clear statistical differences between NO2 + NO3-N concentrations and the various categories. Ground water probability point ratings for NO2 + NO3-N contamination were developed from the results of these comparisons, and a probability map was produced. This ground water probability map was then correlated with an independent set of NO2 + NO3-N data to demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting elevated NO2 + NO3-N concentrations in ground water. This correlation demonstrated that the probability map was effective, but a vulnerability map produced with the uncalibrated DRASTIC method in the same area and using the same data layers was not effective. Considerable time and expense have been outlaid to develop ground water vulnerability maps with the DRASTIC method. This study demonstrates a cost-effective method to improve and verify the effectiveness of ground water vulnerability maps.

The model uses export coefficients to predict annual diffuse losses of phosphorus from catchment land use, which are temporally disaggregated using empirical relationships between phosphorus load and discharge in headwater streams. Dynamic inputs of phosphorus are incorporated into a hydrologically based, multi-reach distributed catchment model which also simulates sewage discharges, abstractions and reservoirs/lakes. The model allows a comparison of simulated output with observed discharge and water-quality data from various points within the river system.

J	Bakhsh, A; Kanwar, RS				Bakhsh, A; Kanwar, RS			Simulating tillage effects on nonpoint source pollution from agricultural lands using gleams	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						tillage systems; NO3-N losses; atrazine; alachlor biomass	SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE WATER; NO3-N LOSSES; QUALITY; NITROGEN; NITRATE; FIELD; MANAGEMENT; SOIL	A GLEAMS (ver 2.10) model was calibrated and validated using three years (1990-1992) of field-measured data to simulate tillage effects on nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and herbicide losses with subsurface drain "tile" water beneath a continuous corn production system. The model was calibrated for chisel plow systems using 1991 field data and was validated against field data of two years (1990 and 1992) for chisel plow and three years (1990-1992) for moldboard plow (MB), ridge till (RT), and no-till (NT) systems. The model simulations were made with a single run using data on measured tile flows; nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), atrazine, and alachlor losses with tile flows; N-uptake; and other biomass parameters for the period I January 1990 through 31 December 1992 for CP, MB, RT, and NT systems. All four tillage treatments, each replicated three times, were applied in a randomized complete block design at Iowa State University's Northeastern Research Center, Nashua, Iowa, to collect field data. A specific calibration procedure for the nutrient component of the GLEAMS model was developed adjusting the N-uptake coefficient and using steady-state N-pool values obtained after multiple years of the model runs. The results of this study indicated that model simulations on subsurface drain water quality and plant parameters were adequate for chisel plow systems and the percent difference, on the average, was < 10% between predicted and measured data with R-2 = 0.99. The change in tillage management option for MB, RT and NT systems slightly affected the model predictions on subsurface drain water quality, probably due to the lack of a macropore option in the model and perhaps also due to no fall plowing in 1991 because of wet weather. However, calibration of the nutrient submodel using steady-state N-pool values was successful and may be tested to simulate the long-term effects of different cropping systems on soil and water quality.

J	Shuman, LM				Shuman, LM			Phosphate and nitrate movement through simulated golf greens	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION			English	Article						golf greens; irrigation; leaching; nitrate; phosphate; transport; soil columns	PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; BENTGRASS; TURFGRASS; LOSSES; SOILS; FATE	Phosphorus and nitrogen can leach from porous golf greens potentially causing degradation of ground water quality. A greenhouse experiment was carried out with 52 cm columns (15 cm diam.) made to USGA green specifications and sodded to 'Tifdwarf' bermudagrass to determine the effects of fertilizer sources at various rates on P and N leaching. Fertilizers were balanced soluble and controlled-release (poly and sulfur coated) sources at N rates of 0, 12, 24, and 49 kg N ha(-1) and at P rates of 0, 5, 11, and 21 kg ha(-1) every other week for a total of 6 applications. Controlled-release N was from NH4 and urea and the soluble source N was from KNO3, urea, and (NH4)PO4. Irrigation rate was 0.63 cm per day initially and increased to 1.25 cm per day at week 7. Weekly leachate collections for 23 weeks were analyzed for P and NO3-N. Concentrations of N and P were lower in the leachate for the controlled-release source than for the soluble source. Leaching of P continued for the entire 23 weeks of the experiment, whereas N was essentially exhausted by week 15 indicating that P leaches at a slower rate than N. For the low P rate (5 kg ha(-1)) for the controlled-release source there was no increase in P concentration in the leachate compared to control. Thus, low P rates will not result in degradation of water quality due to increased P. For the controlled-release source at the low rate < 10% of the P added leached, whereas the values for N were in the range of 20 to 45% for all rates and sources. Control treatments resulted in N concentrations in the leachate as high as 26 mg L-1. Results show that P leaching is a potential problem only at high rates of soluble sources and high irrigation, whereas N is more readily leached.

The water quality of the final effluent was stably controlled under normal nitrate input conditions by using the on-off control algorithm that is connected to the effluent nitrate concentration. However, unexpected nitrite accumulation was observed under abnormal nitrate input conditions (i.e., sudden increase of nitrate concentration), resulting from chemical oxygen demand (COD) limitations during denitrification. On the contrary, the feedforward control algorithm more reliably controlled external carbon addition even under abnormal nitrate input conditions. The input COD/NO3--N was controlled between 3.55 and 3.62 during the operational period when the feed-forward algorithm was applied. Through trial and error, the optimum value of COD/NO3--N for denitrification was determined to be 3.59 in separate experiments.

J	Klove, B				Klove, B			Characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loads in peat mining wastewater	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						water quality; peat mining; wastewater; hydrology; leaching	FORESTED WETLAND; ORGANIC-MATTER; PEATLANDS; CHEMISTRY; DYNAMICS; FINLAND; STREAMS; RUNOFF; FLOW	Runoff water quality from a peat mine was studied during 1995 and 1996 in Central Finland. Water samples from three drained sub-catchments and groundwater were analysed for all the standard physio-chemical parametres including different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus. The annual leaching of phosphorus, nitrogen and suspended solids was estimated to be 16-38 kg km(-2), 1073-1500 kg km(-2), and 2-8 t km(-2), respectively. The variation in nutrient concentrations could be best explained by the relative volumes of new water (5-day sum of rainfall), ditchwater temperature and conductivity. Heavy rainfall caused new water to infiltrate washing nitrate out of the unsaturated peal layer resulting in high concentrations in ground- and ditchwater. Ditchwater phosphorus concentrations always decreased with increased runoff and peaked, as did COD and colour, after dry spells when old groundwater dominated runoff. A large part of the suspended solids load occurred during snowmelt, whereas disserved solids and nitrogen loads peaked during summer flows. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ersahin, S				Ersahin, S			Assessment of spatial variability in nitrate leaching to reduce nitrogen fertilizers impact on water quality	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT			English	Article						NLEAP; nitrate leaching; spatial variability; mean correlation distance; site-specific management	FIELD CONDITIONS; SOIL COLUMNS; TRANSPORT; MOVEMENT; TRACER	Nitrogen leaching has caused a growing societal concern over N fertilizer impact on water quality. One way to decrease nitrogen loss through leaching is to adjust fertilizer inputs to site-specific conditions. This study was conducted to investigate spatial variability of NO3 leaching parameters on a 5 ha commercial wheat field (Typic Ustifluent) located 25 km north of Tokat, Turkey, for the purpose of dividing the field into small cells in which application rates can be kept constant. NO3 leaching parameters were calculated using the monthly analysis version of computer program NLEAP (nitrate teach and economic analysis package) on a regular grid spacing of 25 m, and semi-variogram for each parameter was calculated using the computer program GEAOES. The values for parameter NL (nitrate leached) were between 24.64 (low) and 77.28 kg ha(-1) (medium), for NAL (nitrate available for leaching) 42.46 (low) and 274.40 kg ha(-1) thigh), and for MRI (movement risk index) 0.28 (low) and 0.35 (medium). Values for parameter ALRP (annual leaching risk potential) varied from high tinder = 4) to moderate tinder = 3). A moderately significant correlation (r = 0.54, P < 0.01) was found between measured and model-estimated values for the parameter NAL, indicating that the NLEAP model adequately simulated the NO3 leaching in the study area. Values for range were 360 m for NAL, 350 m for NL and 180 m for MRI, and nugget effect was 0.72 for MRI, 0.45 for NAL and 0.25 for NL, and mean correlation distances (MCD) were 145 m for NAL and 61 m for NL. Although, the spatial patterns for the parameters NAL and NL were similar, the upper cell limit for parameter NAL was higher than two times that of parameter NL, suggesting that calculation of input for continuous control of nitrogen application rate in a variable rate nitrogen fertilizer application program be based on the spatial pattern of NL but not on that of NAL.

The experimental design was that of a random block including four plots per treatment of the following three irrigation treatments. (I) Water desalinated by reversed osmosis, aimed at simulating a fresh water source, with a salinity expressed as electrical conductivity (EC) of 1.64 and 1.44 dS m(-1) (dS: deci siemens). (II) Secondary effluent from the sewage treatment plant of the city of Eilat, EC = 3.20 and 4.24 dS m(-1). (III) Salinated secondary effluent, produced by pumping a concentrated NaCl solution into a particular irrigation system of secondary effluent, EC 6.59 and 9.78, for the 1st and 3rd cuts, respectively. The middle 1-m wide stripe along the entire length of each plot was harvested, weighed and sampled. Freeze-dried ryegrass samples were ground and analyzed. Water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) content was 3-6 times higher in the ist cut forage than in the 3rd cut, and unlike neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentration, responded positively to the increase in water salinity. During that period, the plants counteracted the high osmotic pressure of the salinated secondary effluent, by accumulating more WSC, on the expense of cell wall (CW) synthesis. The 3rd cut was apparently not sensitive to water quality with respect to WSC and NDF contents. During that period, osmotic accommodation was attained apparently by accumulating more sodium in the plants. Organic matter yield was negatively affected by salinity, but partly compensated by an increase in the in vitro organic matter digestibility from 70.9 to 83.2 and from 73.5 to 78.1 in the 1st and 3rd cuts, respectively. The NDF monosaccharide composition was unaffected by salinity treatment. The proportion of ferulates involved in bridging was similar to 10% in the forage of the 1st cut and raised to 20-40% in that of the 3rd cut. Salinity effect on cinnamic acids content in the Ist cut, followed the pattern of NDF, and was negatively related to digestibility. Such relationship between cinnamic acids content and digestibility was not found in the 3rd cut.

J	Reynolds, CS; Irish, AE; Elliott, JA				Reynolds, CS; Irish, AE; Elliott, JA			The ecological basis for simulating phytoplankton responses to environmental change (PROTECH)	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						phytoplankton; ecology; modelling; water quality; species selection	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; CLOSED SYSTEMS; DYNAMICS; LAKES; MODEL; BIODIVERSITY; ZOOPLANKTON; VARIABILITY; RESERVOIRS; POPULATION	The theory and mathematical development of a model, called PROTECH, are presented. The model simulates the dynamic responses of up to eight species of phytoplankton to environmental variability in lakes and reservoirs. PROTECH models were developed originally to fulfil a commercial, decision-support role in the management of industrial water quality, where plankton growth is an issue. The progressive refinements to the model nevertheless. have a robust ecological basis. This makes PROTECH a promising tool for researching plankton community ecology. The model calculates exponents describing growth acid attrition, from a base of the maximum growth rates of algal species in culture. Subject to defined thresholds, growth integrates variability in the fluxes of light and nutrients. The paper develops this philosophy and its embodiment into the structure of the model. Examples of its authenticated, validated and sensitivity-tested outputs are presented. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Nitrogen leaching from dairy effluent compromises these standards, with the consequent move being toward land-based effluent disposal. The cost of this to the dairy sector was estimated and a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model (GTAP) was used to investigate the impact of additional production costs on NZ's dairy export trade. Two scenarios were analysed: first, NZ acts unilaterally in imposing water quality regulations, second, the other principal dairy exporters act in a similar fashion. Changes in trade patterns vary from insignificant to large, depending on the scenario analysed.

J	Sklar, FH; Fitz, HC; Wu, Y; Van Zee, R; McVoy, C				Sklar, FH; Fitz, HC; Wu, Y; Van Zee, R; McVoy, C			The design of ecological landscape models for Everglades restoration	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article							CONSERVATION AREA 2A; NORTHERN EVERGLADES; FLORIDA EVERGLADES; VEGETATION; FIRE; THERMODYNAMICS; SIMULATIONS; EVOLUTION; DYNAMICS; NUTRIENT	Restoration of the Everglades is a multi-objective, multi-scale, multi-agency program that requires numerous computer models to test alternatives, understand ecosystem processes, and evaluate restoration performance. Landscape models used for Everglades restoration include hydrologic models, transition probability models, gradient models, distributional mosaic models, and individual-based models. As tools for restoration feasibility and as the backbone of the policies that will drive Everglades restoration for the next 20 years, it is critical that a wide audience evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of six landscape models. Simulations of historic hydropatterns and current hydropatterns, based mostly upon sheet-flow equations and canal-flow equations, respectively, have been the realm of the Natural Systems Model (NSM) and the South Florida Water Management Model (SFWMM). Despite a lack of biology in these two models, a comparison of their spatial output became the basis for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) approved by the US Congress in October, 2000. SAWCAT, a transitional probability model, was based upon an analysis of the patchiness of cattail (Typha) and sawgrass (Cladium) cells in association with levees, water depth, and phosphorus. This statistical approach was used to predict the amount of sawgrass that would be converted to less desirable cattail, if phosphorus runoff patterns to the Everglades remained constant. The Everglades Water Quality Model (EWQM), a mass-balance gradient approach used to track phosphorus according to a simple net phosphorus removal coefficient, was used to design Storm Water Treatment Areas (STA) and to evaluate where and when phosphorus 'thresholds' would be exceeded under various hydrologic restoration plans. The Everglades landscape Model (ELM), a complex distributional mosaic model, used site-specific biogeochemical mechanisms and mass-balance to control energy and material flows, and to predict changes in carbon and phosphorus structure of the soil, water, and plant communities as a result of modified water deliveries to the Everglades. The Across Trophic Level Spatial Simulation (ATLSS), also a distributional mosaic modeling approach, used individual-based rules of behavior to predict animal movement and abundance in relation to hydrologic restoration plans. When these landscape models are combined, they effectively contribute to water management and policy for Everglades restoration.

J	Gallegos, CL				Gallegos, CL			Calculating optical water quality targets to restore and protect submersed aquatic vegetation: Overcoming problems in partitioning the diffuse attenuation coefficient for photosynthetically active radiation	ESTUARIES			English	Article							SEAGRASS DEPTH LIMITS; SCATTERING COEFFICIENTS; NATURAL-WATERS; LIGHT; PHYTOPLANKTON; DEPENDENCE; ABSORPTION; EXTINCTION; TURBIDITY; ESTUARY	Submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) is an important component of shallow water estuarine systems that has declined drastically in recent decades. SAV has particularly high light requirements, and losses of SAV have, in many cases, been attributed to increased light attenuation in the water column, frequently due to coastal eutrophication. The desire to restore these valuable habitats to their historical levels has created the need for a simple but accurate management tool for translating light requirements into water quality targets capable of supporting SAV communities. A procedure for calculating water quality targets for concentrations of chlorophyll and total suspended solids (TSS) is derived, based on representing the diffuse attenuation coefficient for photosynthetically active radiation, Kd(PAR), as a linear function of contributions due to water plus colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), chlorophyll, and TSS. It is assumed that Kd(PAR) conforms to the Lambert-Beer law. Target concentrations are determined as the intersection of a line representing intended reduction of TSS and chlorophyll by management actions, with another line describing the dependence of TSS on chlorophyll at a constant value of Kd(PAR). The validity of applying the Lambert-Beer law to Kd (PAR) in estuarine waters was tested by comparing the performance of a linear model of Kd(PAR) with data simulated using a more realistic model of light attenuation. The linear regression model tended to underestimate Kd(PAR) at high light attenuation, resulting in erroneous predictions of target concentrations at shallow restoration depths. The errors result more from the wide spectral bandwidth of PAR, than from irrecoverable nonlinearities in the diffuse attenuation coefficient per se. In spite of the failure of the Lambert-Beer law applied to Kd(PAR), the variation of TSS with chlorophyll at constant Kj(PAR) determined by the more mechanistic attenuation model was, nevertheless, highly linear. Use of the management tool based on intersecting lines is still possible, but coefficients in the line describing the dependence of TSS on chlorophyll at constant Kd(PAR) must be determined empirically by application of an optical model suitably calibrated for the region of interest. An example application of the procedure to data from the Rhode River, Maryland, indicates that approximately 15% reduction in both TSS and chlorophyll concentrations, or 50% reduction in chlorophyll alone, will be needed to restore conditions for growth of SAV to levels that existed in the late 1960s.

The combination of all the data into a fifth data set provided a N-NH4+ spectrum covering the whole range of the species. The investigated methods exhibited very contrasting performances. As a function of the data sets, the highest r(cv)(2) were obtained by STEPWISE, PLS and PCR. However, only the regression on CA components, PCR and PLS gave positive r(cv)(2) values whatever the data set. It was thus impossible to select a priori the method producing the lowest prediction error for all the investigated data sets. Among the methods producing the lowest prediction errors, PLS, PCR and regression on CA components provided acceptable predictions for all the investigated data sets. These techniques, although not producing the best predictions in all the cases, could therefore be seen as the best compromise between prediction accuracy and constancy of the prediction quality.

J	King, KW; Harmel, RD; Torbert, HA; Balogh, JC				King, KW; Harmel, RD; Torbert, HA; Balogh, JC			Impact of a turfgrass system on nutrient loadings to surface water	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						water quality; hydrology; urban landscape; runoff	PHOSPHORUS LOSS	Turfgrass systems are one of the most intensively managed land uses in the United States. Establishment and maintenance of high quality turfgrass usually implies substantial inputs of water, nutrients, and pesticides. The focus of this work was to quantify the concentration and loading of a typically maintained municipal turfgrass environment on surface water. Water quantity and quality data were collected from a golf course in Austin, Texas, and analyzed for a 13-month period from March 20, 1998, to April 30, 1999. Twenty-two precipitation events totaling 722 mm, produced an estimated 98 mm of runoff Nutrient analysis of surface runoff exiting the course exhibited a statistically significant (p < 0.05) increase in median nitrate plus nitrite nitrogen (NO3+NO2-N) concentration compared to runoff entering the course, a statistically significant decrease in ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), but no difference in ortho-phosphate (PO4-P). During the 13-month period, storm runoff contributed an estimated 2.3 kg/ha of NO3+NO2-N and 0.33 kg/ha of PO4-P to the stream. Storm flow accounted for the attenuation of 0.12 kg/ha of NH4-N. Baseflow nutrient analysis showed a statistically significant increase in median NO3+NO2-N, a significant reduction in NH4-N, and no change in PO4-P. Estimated NO3+NO2-N mass in the baseflow was calculated as 4.7 kg/ha. PO4-P losses were estimated at 0.06 kg/ha, while 0.8 kg/ha of NH4-N were attenuated in baseflow over the study period. Even though nutrient concentrations exiting the system rarely exceeded nutrient screening levels, this turfgrass environment did contribute increased NO3+NO2-N and PO4-P loads to the stream. This emphasizes the need for parallel studies where management intensity, soil, and climate differ from this study and for golf course managers to utilize an integrated management program to protect water quality while maintaining healthy turfgrass systems.

J	Ackerman, JD; Loewen, MR; Hamblin, PF				Ackerman, JD; Loewen, MR; Hamblin, PF			Benthic-Pelagic coupling over a zebra mussel reef in western Lake Erie	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							DREISSENA INTRODUCTION 1983-1993; WATER-QUALITY MANAGEMENT; MYTILUS-EDULIS-L; BOUNDARY-LAYER; FILTERING IMPACTS; BLOOM DYNAMICS; PRE-DREISSENA; SAGINAW BAY; POLYMORPHA; PHYTOPLANKTON	We conducted a field study including a series of cruises over an isolated offshore zebra mussel reef (7-11 m deep) in Western Lake Erie to examine the effect of zebra mussels (Dreissena spp.) on the water column. The horizontal currents over the reef were found to be primarily due to the hydraulic Bow and surface gravitational seiches. The turbulence generated by these currents was found to be too weak to fully mix the water column. Although seasonal stratification was not observed, solar heating during the day and intrusions of cold central basin water caused stable stratification of the water column 60% of the time. Results from the seston analysis taken at five depths showed a statistically significant mussel-feeding signature in chlorophyll a and organic seston concentrations measured within 2 m above the reef. Estimates of clearance rates based on field data were consistent with rates measured in a flow chamber using water from the site, which indicated that zebra mussels could remove up to 40% of the total seston. The detection of a zebra mussel-induced concentration boundary layer is due to: (1) reduced vertical mixing as a result of semidiurnal periodic stratification, (2) refiltration of bottom water in zebra mussel populations, and (3) in situ clearance rates that are lower than those observed in the laboratory. Thus, offshore zebra mussel colonies may have less of an effect on the water column than had been previously estimated by simple stirred reactor models, and the role of zebra mussels in the clarification of Lake Erie should be investigated further.

J	Langergraber, G; Haberl, R				Langergraber, G; Haberl, R			Constructed wetlands for water treatment	MINERVA BIOTECNOLOGICA			English	Article						constructed wetlands; water treatment; heavy metal removal; reactive transport model	WASTE-WATER	This paper gives an introduction to constructed wetland technology. The term constructed wetland as used in this paper describes an artificial wetland designed to improve water quality. Constructed wetlands provide the optimal treatment conditions found in natural wetlands but have the flexibility of being constructed. The two main types of constructed wetlands are described: surface now and subsurface now constructed wetlands (subsurface now constructed wetlands are further subdivided into horizontal and vertical flow constructed wetlands). The removal mechanisms for main constituents of wastewater (organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus) and for additional pollutants (heavy met als, special organic compounds, and pathogens) are discussed as well as the role of plants hi the treatment process. The treatment efficiency for heavy metal removal with constructed wetlands-is shown as an example. A simulation tool for subsurface flow constructed wetlands is presented that is capable to model the transformation and elimination processes for the main constituents of wastewater (organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus). Simulation results for a pilot-scale constructed wetland for wastewater treatment are shown.

Nitrogen and phosphorus removal rate of the wetlands were determined monthly during the flooding season to estimate their efficiency as filters to remove nutrients from agricultural sewage. The number of wetland birds was recorded regularly to identify their habitat preferences. Both the temporal dynamics and changes in the spatial pattern of land use cover during the last 20 years were determined from aerial photographs and field analysis. All the wetlands appeared to be very efficient in the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus exported from rice fields. Usually 50-98% of the nitrogen and less than 50% of the soluble phosphorus were removed by the wetlands at any stage of restoration. Wetland birds preferred wetlands with intermediate plant cover for resting and sleeping activities better than rice fields and either very open wetlands or very dense ones with tall vegetation. Apart from the improvement in water quality and the restoration of natural habitats, restoration of wetland belts around lagoons will increase spatial heterogeneity and diversity of the landscape.

This paper describes a new modelling approach to quantitatively evaluate the effect of the use of fertilisers on global nitrate leaching. A global process-based simulation model was previously developed for the nitrogen cycle in terrestrial ecosystems, in which soil inorganic nitrogen in the form df ammonium (NH4+) and NOS was considered. After introducing data on world fertiliser consumption (FAO, 1995) into the steady-state model, the extent of disturbance to the nitrogen cycle caused by fertilisation was calculated, Although fertilisation resulted in an annual increase in net primary production (NPP, represented as carbon) of 18 Gt year(-1). NO3- leaching and gaseous losses of nitrogen oxides and ammonia were also accelerated. Most regions with heavy fertiliser application lover 100 kg ha(-1) year(-1) . About 2.5% of the land area showed a high annual leaching load equal to or more than 20 kg ha(-1) year occupied by terrestrial ecosystems suffered a serious leaching load of more than 30 kg ha(-1) year(-1). Of the total amount of applied fertilisers (138 Tg year(-1)) 19% was lost to NO3- leaching, 8% to gaseous ammonia, and 3% to gaseous nitrogen oxides. The rest was assumed to be fixed in the ecosystems through vegetation uptake. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

This project caused hydrodynamic and water-quality changes; hence, phytoplankton-species composition changed and phytoplankton turnover increased, but primary production remained the same. In the prebarrier period (1980-1986), condition of mussels showed a significant negative correlation with the annual shellfish standing stock and a significant positive correlation with the annual primary production. The system was exploited at maximum capacity. In the postbarrier period (1987-1997), the significant correlation between mussel condition and primary production remained, but there was no longer a negative correlation between standing stock and condition. This indicates overstocking, but yields were maintained. This was explained by (i) feedbacks of the mussels in the Oosterschelde ecosystem-through their large filtration and nitrogen-regeneration capacity, increased phytoplankton turnover was induced; and (ii) adaptation to the new conditions by the shellfish farmers in their management of the mussel stocks. It was concluded that feedbacks by filter feeders and farmers have to be addressed in estimating the exploitation capacity of ecosystems.

Two alternative strategies for reducing nutrient loads from cropland are to reduce fertilizer application rates and to filter nutrients coming off cropland with restored wetlands. These two approaches are evaluated in the Mississippi Basin, where nutrient loadings to the Gulf of Mexico have caused a large zone of hypoxic waters. Because of the easement and restoration costs of wetlands, a fertilizer standard was found to be more cost effective than restoring wetlands for achieving a water quality goal up to a particular level of total nitrogen loss reduction. Beyond this point, wetland restorations are more cost-effective. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

The present study focused on regression models with time-varying intercept and slope parameters. In particular, rye derived and tested semiparametric models in which rapid interannual and interseasonal variation in the intercept were penalized in the search for a model that combined a good Pit to data with smoothly varying parameters. Furthermore, we developed a software package for efficient estimation of the parameters of such models. Test runs on time series of runoff data and riverine loads of nutrients and chloride in the Rhine River showed that the proposed smoothing methods were particularly useful for analysis of time-varying linear relationships between time series of data with both seasonal variation and temporal trends. The predictivity of the semiparametric models was superior to that of conventional parametric models. In addition, normalization of observed annual loads to mean or minimum runoff produced smooth curves that provided convincing evidence of human impact on water quality.

These are ideal conditions for bottom hypoxia during spring and an analytical model is presented for the time duration of this hypoxia. It shows that spring hypoxia only occurs if the winter salinity lies below a threshold value which depends both on sediment oxygen demand and physical parameters of the basin. The propensity of a shallow mediterranean estuary to become hypoxic is related not only to vertical mixing, but depends strongly on the vertical shear of currents and this is a critical factor for water quality in basins that are very shallow and microtidal. For one such basin, Harvey Estuary in south-west Australia, the modelled hypoxia threshold corresponds to the winter threshold salinity for blooms of Nodularia spumigena observed during the 1980s. The model is further supported by taking the annual values of observed organic phosphorus content in those blooms and dividing by the number of days of modelled hypoxia for each year. These calculated values of phosphorus content per day are all within a factor of 2 of the published values for the independently measured daily phosphorus release from sediments in the estuary when subjected to hypoxic conditions.

During this study, we conducted experiments to determine the P-fractions of the different pond sediments and to estimate the release from these sediments of phosphate available for algal uptake. We also determined the amount of phosphate needed to saturate the sediments of two different fish ponds under anoxic and oxic conditions. Phosphate release from sediments comes mainly from Fe(OOH)approximate toP and is more important in ponds lined with sheets. The accumulation of organic matter in sediments favours the installation of anoxic conditions and enhances the phosphate release from CaCO(3)approximate toP, labile in these pond sediments. Under experimental conditions, org-P plays a minor role in the P-release. Oxic conditions, to the contrary, have an inhibitory effect on the P-release from sediments. About 80-98% of the P-adsorbed onto different pond sediments was recovered in the inorg-P-fractions. Aeration induces the oxidation of FeS to Fe(OOH) which can adsorb phosphate from solution. Besides, the presence of bacteria in pond sediments was essential to promote phosphate release under anoxic conditions by controlling the oxidation state of iron and the mineralization of the organic matter. Sheet-lined ponds, when insufficiently dried, accumulate a large quantity of organic matter in their sediments. After a decrease in pH, P is released from CaCO(3)approximate toP and enhances the phytoplankton productivity responsible for renewed accumulation of organic matter. Org-C concentrations in sediments over 20 mg g(-1) d.w. favour the formation of toxic factors (Fe2+, Mn2+, NO2- and H2S) harmful for carp growth. An extended period of drying efficiently enhances the mineralization of organic matter.

J	Horowitz, AJ; Elrick, KA; Smith, JJ				Horowitz, AJ; Elrick, KA; Smith, JJ			Estimating suspended sediment and trace element fluxes in large river basins: methodological considerations as applied to the NASQAN programme	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						sediment chemistry; flux estimation; trace elements; suspended sediment	LOADS	In 1994, the NASQAN (National Stream Quality Accounting Network) programme was redesigned as a flux-based water-quality monitoring network for the Mississippi, Columbia, Colorado, and Rio Grande Basins. As the new programme represented a departure from the original, new sampling, processing, analytical, and data handling procedures had to be selected/developed to provide data on discharge, suspended sediment concentration, and the concentrations of suspended sediment and dissolved trace elements. Annual suspended sediment fluxes were estimated by summing daily instantaneous fluxes based on predicted suspended sediment concentrations derived from discharge-based log-log regression (rating-curve) models. The models were developed using both historical and current site-specific discharge and suspended sediment concentrations. Errors using this approach typically are less than +/- 10% for the 3-year reporting period however, the magnitude of the errors increases substantially for temporal spans shorter than 1 year. Total, rather than total-recoverable, suspended sediment-associated trace element concentrations were determined by direct analysis of material dewatered from large-volume whole-water samples. Site-specific intra- and inter-annual suspended sediment-associated chemical variations were less (typically by no more than a factor of two) than those for either discharge or suspended sediment concentrations (usually more than 10-fold). The concentrations, hence the annual fluxes, for suspended sediment-associated phosphorus and organic carbon, determined by direct analyses, were higher than those determined using a more traditional paired, whole-water/filtered-water approach (by factors ranging from 15- to 10-fold). This may be important for such issues as eutrophication and coastal productivity. Filtered water-associated (dissolved) trace element concentrations were markedly lower than those determined during the historical NASQAN programme; many were below their respective detection limits. This resulted from the use of clean sampling, processing, and analytical protocols. Hence, the fluxes for filtered water-associated (dissolved) Ag, Pb, Co, V, Be, Sb, and Se, as well as the total (filtered water plus suspended sediment-associated) fluxes for these constituents, could not be estimated.

J	Horowitz, AJ; Elrick, KA; Smith, JJ				Horowitz, AJ; Elrick, KA; Smith, JJ			Annual suspended sediment and trace element fluxes in the Mississippi, Columbia, Colorado, and Rio Grande drainage basins	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						sediment chemistry; flux; trace elements; suspended sediment	VARIABILITY; RIVER	Suspended sediment, sediment-associated, total trace element, phosphorus (P), and total organic carbon (TOC) fluxes were determined for the Mississippi, Columbia, Rio Grande, and Colorado Basins for the study period (the 1996, 1997, and 1998 water years) as part of the US Geological Survey's redesigned National Stream Quality Accounting Network (NASQAN) programme. The majority (greater than or equal to 70%) of Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni, Ba, P, As, Fe, Mn, and Al are transported in association with suspended sediment; Sr transport seems dominated by the dissolved phase, whereas the transport of Li and TOC seems to be divided equally between both phases. Average dissolved trace element levels are markedly lower than reported during the original NASQAN programme; this seems due to the use of 'clean' sampling, processing, and analytical techniques rather than to improvements in water quality. Partitioning between sediment and water for Ag, Pb, Cd, Cr, Co, V, Be, As, Sb, Hg and Ti could not be estimated due to a lack of detectable dissolved concentrations in most samples. Elevated suspended sediment-associated Zn levels were detected in the Ohio River Basin and elevated Hg levels were detected in the Tennessee River, the former may affect the mainstem Mississippi River, whereas the latter probably do not. Sediment-associated concentrations of Ag, Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, Cr, Co, Ba, Mo, Sb, Hg, and Fe are markedly elevated in the upper Columbia Basin, and appear to be detectable (Zn, Cd) as far downstream as the middle of the basin. These elevated concentrations seem to result from mining and/or mining-related activities. Consistently detectable concentrations of dissolved Se were found only in the Colorado River Basin. Calculated average annual suspended sediment fluxes at the mouths of the Mississippi and Rio Grande Basins were below, whereas those for the Columbia and Colorado Basins were above previously published annual values. Downstream suspended sediment-associated and total trace element fluxes increase in the Mississippi and Columbia Basins, whereas fluxes markedly decrease in the Colorado Basin. No consistent pattern in trace element fluxes was detected in the Rio Grande Basin.

Treatment effects were evaluated using simulated rainfall immediately after corn (Zea mays L.) planting, the most vulnerable period for soil erosion and water quality degradation. Sediment, total P, soluble P, and NH4+-N losses mainly occurred in surface runoff. The NO3--N losses primarily occurred in subsurface tile drainage. In combined (surface and subsurface) now, the MP treatment resulted in nearly two times greater sediment loss than RT (P < 0.01). Ridge tillage,vith urea lost at least 11 times more MH4+-N than any other treatment (P < 0.01). Ridge tillage with manure also had the most total and soluble P losses of all treatments (P < 0.01). If all water quality parameters were equally important, then moldboard plow with manure would result in least water quality degradation of the combined now followed by moldboard plow with urea or ridge tillage with urea (equivalent losses) and ridge tillage with manure. Tillage systems that do not incorporate surface residue and amendments appear to be more vulnerable to soluble nutrient losses mainly in surface runoff but also in subsurface drainage (due to macropore nov). Tillage systems that thoroughly mix residue and amendments in surface soil appear to be more prone to sediment and sediment associated nutrient (particulate P) losses via surface runoff.

Biosolids (sewage sludge) are frequently applied to agricultural land and in this study we evaluated how biosolids treatment processes and biosolids P tests were related to P behavior in biosolids amended soils. Eight biosolids generated by different treatment processes, with respect to digestion and iron (Fe), aluminum (Al), and lime addition, and a poultry litter (PL), were incubated with an Elkton silt loam (finesilty, mixed, active, mesic Typic Endoaquult) and a Suffolk sandy loam (tine-loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludult) for 51 d. The amended soils were analyzed at 1 and 51 d for water-soluble phosphorus (WSP), iron-oxide strip-extractable phosphorus (FeO-P), Mehlich-1 P and pH. The biosolids and PL were analyzed for P, Fe, and Al by USEPA 3050 acid-peroxide digestion and acid ammonium oxalate, Mehlich-1, and Mehlich-3 extractions. Biosolids and PL amendments increased extractable P in the Suffolk sandy loam to a greater extent than in the Elkton silt loam throughout the 51 d of the incubation. The trend of extractable WSP, FeO-P, and Mehlich-1 P generally followed the pattern: [soils amended with biosolids produced without the use of Fe or Al] > [PL and biosolids produced using Fe or Al and lime] > [biosolids produced using only Fe and Al salts]. Mehlich-3 P and the molar ratio of P to [Al + Fe] by either the USEPA 3050 digestion or oxalate extraction of the biosolids were good predictors of changes in soil-extractable P following biosolids but not PL amendment. Therefore, the testing of biosolids for P availability, rather than total P, is a more appropriate fool for predicting extractable P Com the biosolids-amended soils used in this study.

To protect these water sources, management practices to reduce nutrient movement or accumulation are being evaluated using computer models. The computer models, Groundwater Loading Effects of Agricultural Management Systems (GLEAMS) and a version of Riparian Ecosystem Management Model (REMM), were used to estimate nitrogen and phosphorus transport of nutrients through a riparian buffer zone from an agricultural field that received swine lagoon effluent. The models simulated annual application rates of effluent equivalent to 500 and 1000 kg N/ha. The GLEAMS model provided the weather data and nutrient concentrations in the soil, sediment, and leachate for input into REMM. Assuming a 1000 kg N/ha loading rate, GLEAMS monthly average NO3-N leachate concentrations were within 14% of the observed data, and REMM-simulated NO3-N leachate concentration was within 5% of the observed data. Both models provided an adequate estimation of nitrogen transport through the system. GLEAMS simulations of PO4-P leachate followed the general trend of observed data. However, there was no apparent response in simulated PO4-P leachate concentrations for the two loading rates (95 and 190 kg P/ha), indicating a problem in the phosphorus calculations in the model. The REMM-simulated PO4-P leachate was greater than observed concentrations and was affected by the inputs obtained from GLEAMS. The pre-release version of REMM provided good estimates of the nutrient transport, and with a few improvements, official releases of REMM have the potential to provide better estimates of nutrient movement through the riparian buffer zone.

J	King, KW; Balogh, JC				King, KW; Balogh, JC			Water quality impacts associated with converting farmland and forests to turfgrass	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article							UNITED-STATES; MODEL; GROUNDWATER; NITRATE; FLOW; GIS	Three to four hundred new or renovated turfgrass systems are constructed in the U.S. each year Many of these systems (golf courses, city parks, and residential and institutional lawns) are constructed in agricultural and silvicultural environments. However, knowledge of the water quality impact in transitioning from an agricultural or silvicultural landscape to a turfgrass landscape is at best limited. Using the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) water quality model, 99-year simulations for three locations were completed for a continuous corn (Zea mays L) agricultural rotation (AGR), a forested environment (FST), a golf course built in a previously agricultural setting (AGR-G), and a golf course constructed in a previously forested (FST-G) setting. Hydrologic, nitrate-nitrogen, and pesticide (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid) impacts were evaluated. The hydrologic balance associated with AGR was significantly different from those for AGR-G, FST-G, and FST Transition from FST to FST-G increased the loading and risk potential of surface runoff losses for both nitrate and 2,4-D and significantly increased (alpha = 0.05) the potential for percolate losses of 2,4-D. Converting AGR to AGR-G significantly reduced the loading and risk potential for nitrate and 2,4-D losses. However, the addition of housing developments and increased impervious areas, which generally follow turfgrass land developments, were not considered, so the actual risk potential is probably higher than shown with this model. In addition to the impacts assessed, this study shows the SWAT model and associated simulation and analysis strategy to be a useful tool in evaluating risk assessments associated with land use conversions.

Retention efficiency was measured using short-term nutrient and tracer injections to estimate nutrient uptake length (S-w) during summer 1999 and winter 2000. A one-dimensional transport model was used to estimate dispersion, transient storage size, and exchange. Soluble reactive P (SRP) and NO3-N concentrations were least in the stream with the lowest proportion of pasture in the upland (Dry Creek), whereas concentrations and land use were similar in Cherokee Creek and Cloud Creek. Water column SRP concentrations were similar between seasons in all streams, but NO3-N concentrations varied significantly. Injected NO3-N was not significantly retained in these systems, probably because the streams were saturated by ambient NO3-N concentrations (greater than 0.1 mg L-1). Phosphorus was retained during summer injections (S-W ranged from 200-900 m), but S-W regressions were not significant in winter Variation in catchment land use was not a major determinant in P retention during summer, but stream hydrology, such as discharge and transient storage, was a regulating factor Therefore, land use changes that alter stream hydrology may have a greater impact on P retention in these streams.

The microcystin concentration in particulate form increased dramatically from August up to a level of 200 ng liter(-1) in early October and thereafter tended to decrease. The microcystin concentration in dissolved form was about 28% of that of the particulate form. The microcystins detected using a protein phosphatase (PP) inhibition assay were highly correlated with those microcystins detected by a high-performance liquid chromatograph (r = 0.973; P < 0.01). Therefore, the effectiveness of a PP inhibition assay for microcystin detection in a high number of water samples was confirmed as easy, quick, and convenient. The microcystin concentration was highly correlated with the phytoplankton number (r = 0.650; P < 0.01) and chlorophyll-a concentration (r 0.591; P < 0.01). When the microcystin concentration exceeded about 100 ng liter(-1), the ratio of particulate to dissolved total nitrogen (TN) or total phosphorus (TP) converged at a value of 0,6. Furthermore, the microcystin concentration was lower than 50 ng liter(-1) at a particulate N/P ratio below 8, whereas the microcystin concentration varied quite substantially from 50 to 240 ng liter(-1) at a particulate N/P ratio of >8. Therefore, it seems that the microcystin concentration in water can be estimated and indirectly monitored by analyzing the following: the phytoplankton number and chlorophyll-a concentration, the ratio of the particulate and the dissolved forms of N and P, and the particulate N/P ratio when the dominant genus is toxigenic Microcystis.

A combination of daily meteorological readings, monthly measurements of inflows and water column composition, and a 7-month period of thermistor chain readings over a 2.5-year study period were used to assess physical and biogeochemical characteristics of Lake Rinihue and potential for change in trophic status. A coupled hydrodynamic-water quality model, DYRESM-WQ, was used to reproduce the observed changes in water temperature in the lake over this period. The model output yielded insights into the timing of stratification and mixis. Lake Rinihue did not mix completely over the 2.5-year period of the study (1995-1997). From late spring to autumn, a well developed thermocline was observed at depths of 20-40 m. Thermistor chain readings indicated that the thermocline position was quite variable on a day-to-day basis. Ln late winter the thermocline deepened rapidly in response to a sustained net negative heat flux, due largely to reduced solar radiation. Biological and chemical variables in DYRESM-WQ were calibrated over a period of 7 months and a further period of 2 years was used for validation. The simulation output reinforced the oligotrophic nature of Lake Rinihue ([chl-a] <6 mg/m(-3)), the general timing of changes in chlorophyll-a and the depletion of dissolved inorganic nutrients from the surface layer during summer. The DYRESM-WQ model and a bulk loading model were used to assess the potential for eutrophication of Lake Rinihue in response to increases in nutrient loads from inflows. The response to doubling of phosphorus (PO4-P and TP) concentrations in the inflows was to increase mean levels of depth-integrated chlorophyll-a near the water surface (0-58 m), from 1.36 mg/m(3) to 1.95 mg/m(3). The simulated 1.4-fold increase in chi-a concentrations in response to the increased phosphorus load was considerably less than that predicted from a combination of a bulk loading model for TP and a regression against chl-a (2.8-fold increase). The DYRESM-WQ model indicated that the trophic response to increased nutrient loading would be complicated by growth limitation by light and nitrogen.

Shasta Lake, in northern California. Shasta Dam was constructed in 1945 with a fixed-elevation penstock. The TCD was installed in 1997 to improve downstream temperatures for endangered salmonids by releasing epilimnetic waters in the winter/spring and hypolimnetic waters in the summer/fall. We calibrated a two-dimensional hydrodynamic reservoir water quality model. CEQUAL-W2, and applied a structured design-of-experiment simulation procedure to predict the principal limnological effects of the TCD under a variety of environmental scenarios. Calibration goodness-of-fit ranged from good to poor depending on the constituent simulated, with an R-2 of 0.9 for water temperature but 0.3 for phytoplankton. Although the chemical and thermal characteristics of the discharge changed markedly, the reservoir's characteristics remained relatively unchanged. Simulations showed the TCD causing an earlier onset and shorter duration of summer stratification, but no dramatic affect on Shasta's nutrient composition. Peak in-reservoir phytoplankton production may begin earlier and be stronger in the fall with the TCD, while outfall phytoplankton concentrations may be much greater in the spring. Many model predictions differed from our a priori expectations that had been shaped by an intensive, but limited-duration, data collection effort. Hydrologic and meteorological variables, most notably reservoir carryover storage at the beginning of the calendar year, influenced model predictions much more strongly than the TCD.

J	Schelske, CL; Kenney, WF				Schelske, CL; Kenney, WF			Model erroneously predicts failure for restoration of Lake Apopka, a hypereutrophic, subtropical lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						Lake Apopka; meroplankton; sediment resuspension; marsh flow-way; phosphorus; eutrophication; lake restoration		A recent paper (Bachmann et al., 1999) based on analysis of literature data predicts failure for restoration plans implemented by the St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD) for Lake Apopka, a large (125 km(2)), shallow (mean depth=1.63 m), polymictic lake in central Florida. A marsh flow-way designed to remove particulates from inflowing water from Lake Apopka as a means to improve down-stream and lake-water quality is part of the restoration plan. According to Bachmann et al. (1999), restoration "will be ineffective in removing particles from the lake'' and fail because estimated time for removal of 2.21 million tons of historic sediments in this constructed marsh flow-way is 329 years. This inadvertently proposed mining hypothesis given as a condition for successful restoration is based on questionable assumptions, i.e. removing all the historic sediments deposited over a 50-year period with the flow-way and exporting concurrent sedimentation while historic sediments are being removed. These questionable assumptions are used in an erroneous, discontinuous model of sediment dynamics that does not justify the alternate approach for restoration of Lake Apopka suggested in their paper.

J	Stow, CA; Borsuk, ME; Stanley, DW				Stow, CA; Borsuk, ME; Stanley, DW			Long-term changes in watershed nutrient inputs and riverine exports in the Neuse river, North Carolina	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						nutrient management; load estimation; watershed changes; trend detection	DENITRIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; NITRATE	We compared patterns of historical watershed nutrient inputs with in-river nutrient loads for the Neuse River, NC. Basin-wide sources of both nitrogen and phosphorus have increased substantially during the past century, marked by a sharp increase in the last 10 years resulting from an intensification of animal production. However, this recent increase is not reflected in changes in river loading over the last 20 years. Temporal patterns in river loads more closely parallel short-term changes in point sources and cropland nutrient application despite their overall lower magnitude. Total phosphorus loads have declined at all stations considered, corresponding to a 1988 phosphate detergent ban. Nitrogen load temporal patterns Vary by location and the nitrogen fraction considered. The furthest upstream station exhibited nitrogen decreases after the completion of a dam in 1983. At a station just downstream of a rapidly growing urban area, the total nitrogen load has increased since the mid-1980s, primarily as a nitrate concentration increase. This is consistent with concurrent increases in chemical fertilizer use and point source discharges, as well as increased nitrification at treatment plants. This increase in nitrate loading is not reflected at the most downstream station, where no clear nitrogen trends are discernable. The lack of clear downstream nutrient increases suggests that current water quality impairment in the lower river and estuary may result from chronic nutrient overload rather than recent changes in the watershed. If this is true, then the impact of a planned 30% nitrogen loading reduction may not be immediately apparent. We calculate that, given annual variability, detecting a load reduction of this magnitude will take at least four years, and, should nutrients accumulated in the watershed become a significant source, detecting the resulting ecological improvements is likely to take substantially longer.

Data sets considered refer to some sampling point located in the sub-alpine meso-eutrophic Lake Iseo, surveyed six times over the period March-July and once in November 1998, as these months were very important for the characterization of the springtime algal bloom, which affect the lake waters yearly. At each point station, limnological observations (chlorophyll, total suspended solids. Secchi disk depth) were conducted simultaneously with optical measurements. The latter consisted of water leaving radiance measured by means of a spectroradiometer above the water surface: moreover, a standard reflector radiance was also measured to obtain the water reflectance. Reflectance spectra were transformed according to two well-documented models and correlated to water quality parameters, to investigate their performances as retrieval algorithms under different conditions and referring to different analytical methods. Results outline the sensitivity of the models to chl-a concentrations, different phytoplankton composition, and the sampling depth. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Field campaigns have been performed on Lake Erken in Sweden during the summer of 1997. Water samples have been collected and analysed in laboratory. Continuously measured variables from a boat have added a spatial dimension to the ground truth dataset. The data have been used to construct algorithms, based on remotely sensed data, for the retrieval of water quality parameters. The correlation between the continuous data and the collected CASI data has been investigated. Algorithms using both the point sampling results and the continuous data have been developed. Maps based on data from each instrument, showing the distribution of chlorophyll, are presented. Problems of having few water sampling stations, and the potential of using sub-water optics models are addressed as well. Tests were performed on MERIS bands and found useful for mapping chlorophyll and turbidity, and algorithms have been suggested for future use with MERIS. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Pierson, DC; Strombeck, N				Pierson, DC; Strombeck, N			Estimation of radiance reflectance and the concentrations of optically active substances in Lake Malaren, Sweden, based on direct and inverse solutions of a simple model	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						radiance; reflectance; model; inherent; optical; properties; chlorophyll	AQUATIC PARTICLES; CHLOROPHYLL-A; ABSORPTION; OCEAN; PHYTOPLANKTON; VARIABILITY; INHERENT; MATTER	A semi-analytical model which predicts radiance reflectance just below the water surface (L-u/E-d 0 -) has been developed and used to predict the spectral variability of radiance reflectance in Lake Malaren, Sweden. Radiance reflectance is predicted as a function of the optically active substances in the water, which include the concentrations of chlorophyll-a + phaeophytin-a, suspended particular inorganic material (SPIM), suspended particulate organic material (SPOM), and dissolved yellow substances. These substances are linked to the absorption and backscattering coefficients through a series of empirical relationships, and ultimately radiance reflectance is estimated as a function of the ratio of backscattering to absorption. Parameterization of the model, i.e. the development of the empirical relationships linking the optically active substances to the inherent optical properties (IOPs), is based on both in situ measurements and laboratory analyses. We have collected data that allowed us to examine the potential variability in radiance reflectance, as predicted by our model, due to both variations in the optically active substances, and in the model parameterization. Simulations based on a data set collected during the fall of 1997 from 12 sites, which span a large range in water quality (secchi depth 0.8-5.0 m), suggest that, with the proper parameterization, the model can accurately predict the spectra of radiance reflectance as a function of the concentration of optically active substances. Variations in the concentrations of optically active substances accounted for a large portion of the total simulated variability in radiance reflectance (i.e. that resulting from variations in parameterization and in the concentrations of optically active substances). However, the measured variability in parameterization could account for up to 50% of the total variability in simulated radiance reflectance. This suggests that variability in the model parameterization, arising from both real variability and experimental error, will limit the use of this model for interpreting remote sensing data. Nevertheless, inverse solutions of the model are able to estimate the concentrations of chlorophyll, suspended inorganic material (SPIM) and the absorption of yellow substances from measured radiance reflectance spectra The average error for the 12 sites was a -0.07 for chlorophyll, -0.15 for dissolved yellow substances (measured as the absorption at 400 nm) and 0.07 for SPIM, even though individual errors could be as great as 50%.

In environmental economics it is therefore one of the main objectives of future research to derive prices for environmental resources in an interdisciplinary framework with the natural sciences. Several valuation methods exist for this objectification and a concise model comprising the demand and supply sides was developed. Important advances were made on the demand side. The results of the conjoint-analysis regarding the relative importance of elements of a sustainable land-use system clearly show that water quality with 32 % and economic performance of a region with 23 % are particularly important. The conservation of the landscape heritage (18 %) and biodiversity (16 %) are of medium importance. The capacity of a landscape to absorb organic waste (11 %) is an insignificant factor for the general public. People in the region have an average willingness to pay of 142 DM for the improvement of the water quality and of 133 DM per household per annum for the conservation of local biodiversity. The contingent valuation results also find that willingness to pay is significantly influenced by socio-demographic variables like environmental conscience, household income and education. The supply side of the model presented (chapter 2) is not yet fully specified, as some relevant data is not available yet. Nevertheless econometric estimations identified interesting trade-offs and win-win situations between environmental and economic resources. For example, an increase in the additional value of agricultural production by 1170 DM/ha leads to a 4.6 kg/ha increase in nitrogen pollution of the ground water. An important win-win situation was found between the conservation of landscape heritage and water quality.

We followed a linked modeling approach that used a specialized reservoir water quality model to forecast operation-induced changes in phytoplankton production. A food web-energy transfer model was also applied to propagate predicted changes in phytoplankton up through the food web to the predators and sport fishes of interest. The food web-energy transfer model employed a 10% trophic transfer efficiency through a food web that was mapped using carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis. Stable isotope analysis provided an efficient and comprehensive means of estimating the structure of the reservoir's food web with minimal sampling and background data. We used an optimization procedure to estimate the diet proportions of all food web components simultaneously from their isotopic signatures. Some consumers were estimated to be much more sensitive than others to perturbations to phytoplankton supply. The linked modeling approach demonstrated that interdisciplinary efforts enhance the value of information obtained from studies of managed ecosystems. The approach exploited the strengths of engineering and ecological modeling methods to address concerns that neither of the models could have addressed alone: (a) the water quality model could not have addressed quantitatively the possible impacts to fish, and (b) the food web model could not have examined how phyto plankton availability might change due to reservoir operations.

Previous studies have indicated that hydrology influences productivity but that the relationship between hydroperiod and productivity is a complex one. Consequently, we compared multiple indexes of productivity, nutrient circulation, and hydroperiod among three communities on the Flint River floodplain, Georgia, that differed in terms of inundation frequency. We hypothesized that (a) the wettest community would have the lowest total net primary production (NPP) values because of saturated soil conditions; (b) as wetness increases, nutrient circulation ill litterfall would decrease because of the hypothesized lower productivity in the wetter community; and (c) as wetness increases, internal translocation would become more efficient. The study site was partitioned into three wetness types-somewhat poorly drained (SPD), intermediate (I) and poorly drained (PD). We found that belowground biomass was greatest on the SPD, litterfall was similar for all three sites, and that woody biomass current annual increment (CAI) was greatest in the PD community. However, when the three variables were totaled for each site, the PB had the greatest NPP, thus disproving hypothesis (a). For hypothesis (b), we observed that P content in litterfall, although not significant, followed the predicted trend; nitrogen (N) content displayed the opposite pattern (PD > I > SPD). As wetness increased, internal translocation became more efficient for phosphorus (support for hypothesis [c]), but the SPD community was more efficient at retranslocating N (contradict ion of hypothesis [c]).

The land-based system was separated into three main compartments: a seawater reservoir, fish ponds and a lagoon (sedimentation pond). Three submodels were built for simulation purposes: (1) a hydrological submodel which simulated water exchange; (2) a fish growth and excretion bioenergetic submodel; and (3) a nitrogen compound transformation and loss submodel (i.e. ammonification, nitrification and assimilation processes). A two-year sampling period of nitrogen water quality concentrations and fish growth was used to validate the model. The model fitted the observations of dissolved nitrogen components, fish growth and water fluxes on a daily basis in all the compartments. The dissolved inorganic nitrogen ranged widely and over time from 0.5 to 9 g N m(-3) within the system, depending on seawater supply and water temperature, without affecting fish growth. Fish feed was the most important input of nitrogen into the system. The mean average input of nitrogen in the feed was 205 kg N day(-1), of which 19% was retained by fish, 4% accumulated in the sediment and 61% flowed from the system as dissolved components.

Calcium carbonate saturation levels and phosphate concentrations (SRP - soluble reactive phosphate) across the major eastern UK river basins are examined to test for solubility controls. The study shows that calcite saturation varies for each catchment as a function of flow and biological activity rather than by direct regulation by SRP. Indeed, there is no evidence, for any of the rivers studied, that calcite solubility controls hold. However, for groundwater and groundwater-fed springs in the Chalk of the Thames basin, calcite saturation is observed with associated low SRP levels. A self-cleansing mechanism may well be operative within the Chalk due to two factors. Firstly, there is a high potential for nucleation on the calcite micro-crystals in the aquifer. Secondly, there are within aquifer reactions that remove the calcite nucleating inhibitors (SRP and dissolved organic carbon, DOC) to levels lower than those occurring within the rivers do. These inhibitors enter the catchment at very high concentrations in association with agricultural pollution (fertilizer application and animal slurry) and household contamination (e.g. sewage sources from septic tanks). Under low flow conditions, when the saturation index for calcite is at its highest, so too is the concentration of the nucleation inhibitor SRP. Companion work shows that calcite precipitation can occur at the water-sediment interface of the river and this may involve SRP removal. The data, as a whole, define an apparent bound for calcite solubility control where in the presence of nucleating centres, SRP must be less than 4 muM-P l(-1) and DOC must be less than 150 muM-C l(-1): a condition that does not seem to pertain within most UK rivers.

In 1987 a commitment was made to reduce controllable sources of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) by 40% by the year 2000, although the causes and effects of eutrophication were incompletely known. Subsequent research, modeling, and monitoring have shown that: (i) the estuarine ecosystem had been substantially altered by increased loadings of N and P of approximately 7- and Ii-fold, respectively; (ii) hypoxia substantially increased since the 1950s; (iii) eutrophication was the major cause of reductions in submerged vegetation; and (iv) reducing nutrient sources by 40% would improve water quality, but less than originally thought. Strong public support and political commitment have allowed the Chesapeake Bay Program to reduce nutrient inputs, particularly from paint sources, by 58% for P and 28% for N, However, reductions of nonpoint sources of P and N were projected by models to reach only 19% and 15%, respectively, of controllable loadings. The lack of reductions in nutrient concentrations in some streams and tidal waters and field research suggest that soil conservation-based management strategies are less effective than assumed, In 1997, isolated outbreaks of the toxic dinoflagellate Pfiesteria piscicida brought attention to the land application of poultry manure as a contributing factor to elevated soil P and ground water N concentrations.

J	Charette, MA; Buesseler, KO; Andrews, JE				Charette, MA; Buesseler, KO; Andrews, JE			Utility of radium isotopes for evaluating the input and transport of groundwater-derived nitrogen to a Cape Cod estuary	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY			English	Article							COASTAL WATERS; CONTINENTAL-SHELF; DISCHARGE; EMBAYMENT; NUTRIENTS; RA-226; FLUX; BAY	Because of rapid increases in population, anthropogenic sources of nitrogen have adversely impacted the water quality of coastal ponds on Cape God. A major source of "new" nitrogen to these estuaries is groundwater, which intercepts septic tank fields in its flow path to the coastline. Many attempts have been made to quantify this process; however, groundwater discharge is often patchy in nature and is therefore difficult to study by use of traditional techniques such as seepage meters. In Waquoit Bay, MA, we tested an approach based on radium, which is naturally enriched in aquifer fluids and has four isotopes with half-lives ranging from 4 d to 1600 yr. Groundwater entering the bay was low in salinity and contained several orders of magnitude greater radium and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) relative to ambient bay water. Using a mass-balance approach for radium, we calculated a submarine groundwater flux of similar to 37,000 m(3) d(-1), which compared well with aquifer recharge rates calculated from rainfall. From the DIN content of the groundwater, we estimated that similar to 2100 mol N d(-1) was directly input to the estuary. However, this nitrogen flux was small in comparison with literature values for DIN fluxes from the heavily populated subestuaries. Furthermore, our results suggest that groundwater flux of DIN was assimilated by plant biomass during the summer but may be exported from the embayment to coastal waters during the winter months.

This study was conducted to test the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM98) using four years (1996 to 1999) of field-measured data to simulate the effects of different N-application rates on corn yields and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) losses via subsurface drain water Three N-application rates (low, medium, and high), each replicated three times, were applied to corn in 1996 and 1998 under a randomized complete block design at a tile-drained corn-soybean rotation field near Story City, Iowa. No N-fertilizer was applied to soybean in 1997 and 1999. Model calibration and evaluation were based on field measurements of the flows, NO3-N losses in tile water and corn-soybean yields. On average, the model simulated tile flow, NO3-N losses in tile water, and yields by showing a percent difference of -8%, 15%, and -4%, respectively, between measured and simulated values. The simulated yield response function showed that corn grain yields reached a plateau level when the N-application rate exceeded 200 kg-N/ha in 1996 and 170 kg-N/ha in 1998. These results suggest that RZWQM has the potential to simulate the effects of N-application rates on corn yields and NO3-N losses with tile water However, the model overestimated NO3-N losses in subsurface drainage water during the soybean growth period, which may require further refinements in the N-cycling algorithm in relation to N-2-fixation and N-uptake processes.

Wetland mesocosms using FGD liners retained more total and soluble reactive phosphorus, with lower concentrations in the leachate (first year) and higher concentrations in the surface water (second year). Leachate was higher in conductivity (second year) and pH (both years) in lined mesocosms. Surface outflow did not reveal any significant difference in physicochemical characteristics between lined and unlined mesocosms. There was no significant difference in total biomass production of wetland plants between lined and unlined mesocosms although lon er average stem lengths and fewer stems bearing flowers were observed in mesocosms with FGD liners. Potentially phylotoxic boron was significantly higher in the belowground biomass of plants grown in lined mesocosms with low phosphorus lending.

J	Istvanovics, V; Somlyody, L				Istvanovics, V; Somlyody, L			Factors influencing lake recovery from eutrophication - The case of basin 1 of Lake Balaton	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						pre-reservoir; OECD model; sediment mass balance; internal load		Lake Balaton is a large, shallow, and calcareous lake that was subject to a rapid eutrophication during the 1970s. Management measures taken from the mid 1980s decreased the phosphorus load to the lake from 0.5 to 0.3 g Pm-2 yr(-1). Using long-term load and water quality data, we analyse the response of the formerly hypertrophic Basin 1 of the lake by the means of simple empirical models. Several factors that are commonly neglected during studies of lake recovery modified the apparent settling velocity of total P and consequently, the biomass of the phytoplankton. These factors included the loads of calcium and suspended solids, the loading ratio of the dissolved to particulate phosphorus, and blooming of the dominant cyanobacterium, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. Due to the rapid immobilisation of the mobile phosphorus in the surface sediments, moderate reduction (45-50%) in the external load resulted in a surprisingly fast and significant improvement of the water quality in the hypertrophic southwestern basins of the lake, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Subcatchments were defined by exclusion drains in the upper reaches and stainless steel barriers at the lower boundary. Water samples were analysed for 20 different chemical fractions. Chemical loads were examined in order to determine relationships among simple empirical event and site characteristics, and between chemical fractions. All but five of the chemical fractions could be separated into one of two clear groups using a statistical technique based on the magnitude of simple correlation coefficients. The two groups consisted of either dissolved or particulate fractions. The clear separation into these groups is consistent with the majority of chemical fractions moving from pasture by one of only two processes. Simple empirical variables in a multiple regression explained a high proportion of variation in chemical loads in runoff water. These findings may have major implications in the modelling and prediction of chemical loads in runoff from agricultural catchments and the setting of environmental limits, in simplifying chemical loss predictions by adding a nutrient loss module to runoff volume predictions.

This paper addresses the underwater light climate, with reference to effects of suspended solids and growth responses of autotrophs with emphasis on phytoplankton. Effects of the most important factors contributing to the absorption and scattering of light in surface waters were described. A comparison between spectral and scalar approaches to underwater light climate modeling was made and examples of linear approximations to light attenuation equations were presented. It was demonstrated that spectral and scalar photosynthesis models may converge to similar values in spectral-flat, high photon flux environments, but that scalar PAR models may overestimate biomass-specific production by 70%. Such differences can lead to serious overestimates of habitat suitability for the growth and survival of submersed macrophytes, particularly in relatively turbid, coastal waters. Relationships between physical and optical properties of suspended sediments were described theoretically, and illustrated with modeling examples and measurements. It was found that the slowly settling particulate fraction contributed substantially to the suspended solids concentration, and greatly to light attenuation within the water column. It was concluded that distinguishing particles by fall velocity and concomitant light attenuation properties in the modeling of underwater light conditions allowed the establishment of useful, although not simply linear, relationships. In eutrophic, shallow lakes, the largest contribution to light attenuation often originates from phytoplankton on a seasonal basis (months-years), but from suspended solids behavior on a shorter time scale (days-weeks), particularly when water bodies are wind-exposed. Temporal and spatial variabilities in wave height, suspended solids concentrations, and light attenuation within the water column, and their importance for autotrophic growth were described, and illustrated with a case study pertaining to Markermeer, The Netherlands. The influence of underwater light conditions on phytoplankton succession was briefly discussed and illustrated with a case study pertaining to Lake Veluwe, The Netherlands. It was concluded that modeling the underwater light climate in a water body on a few sites only can indicate how important various components are for the attenuation of light, but based on the current state of the art, it can not be expected that this will provide accurate predictions of the underwater light climate, and of phytoplankton and submersed macrophyte growth.

Because of the recent, large-scale, declines in aquatic vegetation, largely attributed to deterioration of the underwater light climate, interest in tools to predict the wax and wane of aquatic macrophyte populations has greatly increased. This paper summarizes two modeling approaches that can be applied to assess impacts of changes in underwater light climate on submersed vegetation. The first, stand-alone, model type focuses on metabolism and biomass formation of submersed freshwater macrophytes with difference in phenologies. This type is illustrated by examples from various sites using models developed for the freshwater macrophytes Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) Royle (HYDRIL) and Myriophyllum spicatum L. (MILFO), and also by an example ecological risk assessment. The models (HYDRIL and MILFO) track carbon flow through the vegetation in meter-squared (m(2)) water columns. The models include descriptions of various factors that affect biomass dynamics, such as site-characteristic changes in climate, latitude, light attenuation within the water column, carbon assimilation rate at light saturation, temperature, wintering strategies, grazing and mechanical control (removal of shoot biomass). Simulated biomass, net assimilation and maintenance respiration over a relatively short (1-5 year) period agree well with measured values. The models are, therefore, believed to be suitable for predicting plant community production, growth and survival characteristics over relatively short periods over a large range of sites. The feasibility of using a macrophyte growth model of the HYDRIL type for ecological risk assessment is demonstrated. It is used to evaluate the consequences of management changes in large rivers for the survival of submersed vegetation. The current assessment evaluates the potential impact of increased commercial navigation traffic on the growth of Potamogeton pectinatus L. in Pool 4 of the Upper Mississippi River, U.S.A. In this case, navigational traffic scenarios were translated into suspended solids concentrations and underwater light climate, with the latter being used as inputs into the aquatic plant growth model. Model results demonstrate that the scenario increases in commercial traffic cause minimal decreases in growth and vegetative reproduction. Results indicate that this growth model can be a useful tool in ecological risk assessment, since the required stress-response relationships could be established. The second, integrated, model type focuses on the role of seagrass and other primary producers in estuarine littoral zone material cycling (carbon and nitrogen) at the Goodwin Islands, Virginia, U.S.A. The latter model was used to explore the effects of changes in underwater light climate and inorganic nitrogen on the biomass formation of Zostera marina in one of four interacting habitats at different elevations, coupled by a hydrodynamic model. Simulation results indicate that the water quality recently met the light extinction coefficient standard viewed as critical for the presence of healthy seagrass meadows, but that increased material loading into the littoral zone is expected to increase turbidity in the water column, causing a decreased production of seagrass and increased production of phytoplankton, lower overall system production, more rapid turnover of nitrogen, and a less vegetated habitat for fauna. Submersed macrophyte growth models can be useful tools to enhance our understanding of macrophyte responses, that is, their interactions with environmental factors and anthropogenic stressors. They can be used for predictions of future states based on assumptions of known interactions, but they can not be expected to provide precise predictions of future states.

Determination of the concentration of carbonate, Fe, Mn, and different forms of P in conjunction with total sediment fluxes derived from C-14 ages allows an estimation of yearly fluxes of these sediment components. High fluxes of endogenic carbonate occur during the early to middle Holocene. Nonapatitic inorganic phosphorus flux is variable but shows some higher-than-present values during this period. These observations are interpreted as being a result of enhanced productivity by favourable conditions for phytoplankton development. In addition, the low Mn/Fe ratio of the redox-sensitive forms of these elements recorded during this period suggests low oxygen concentrations in the bottom waters. Therefore it appears that the lake may have undergone oxygen depletion in the bottom water during the warmer-than-present periods, due to increased productivity and subsequent oxygen consumption from the decay of organic matter. With future climate changes, this suggests that lake water quality may likely degrade under global warming.

J	McFarland, AMS; Hauck, LM				McFarland, AMS; Hauck, LM			Determining nutrient export coefficients and source loading uncertainty using in-stream monitoring data	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						nonpoint source pollution; water quality; export coefficients; nutrient loads; nitrogen; phosphorus; animal waste; uncertainty analysis	NITROGEN; WATER	Over a three-year period, flow and nutrients were monitored at 13 sites in the upper North Bosque River watershed in Texas. Drainage areas above sampling sites differed in percent of dairy waste application fields, forage fields, wood/range, and urban land area. A multiple regression approach was used to develop total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) export coefficients for the major land uses in these heterogeneous drainage areas. The largest export coefficients were associated with dairy waste application fields followed by urban, forage fields, and wood/range. An empirical model was then established to assess nutrient contribution by major sources using developed export coefficients and point source loadings from municipal wastewater treatment. This model was verified by comparison of estimated loadings to measured in-stream data. Monte Carlo simulation techniques were applied to provide an uncertainty analysis for nutrient loads by source, based on the variance associated with each export coefficient. The largest sources of nutrients contributing to the upper North Bosque River were associated with dairy waste application fields and forage fields, while the greatest relative uncertainty in source contribution was associated with loadings from urban and wood/range land uses.

J	Helliwell, RC; Ferrier, RC; Kernan, MR				Helliwell, RC; Ferrier, RC; Kernan, MR			Interaction of nitrogen deposition and land use on soil and water quality in Scotland: issues of spatial variability and scale	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						nitrogen deposition; soil C/N ratios; surface water NO(3); spatial variability	FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; NITRATE CONCENTRATIONS; EUROPEAN FORESTS; SURFACE WATERS; GREAT-BRITAIN; MAGIC MODEL; CATCHMENT; IMPACT; ACIDIFICATION; MHARCAIDH	Over large areas of the Scottish uplands anthropogenic sulfur (S) deposition is declining in response to stringent national and European controls on S emissions. At the same time, however, the relative contribution of nitrogenous (N) compounds to the total anthropogenic deposition loading has increased. To investigate the significance of N deposition on the potential acidification of surface waters, national. regional, and catchment databases were developed to assess the relationships between N deposition, soil C/N ratios, land use and surface water NO(3) concentrations. National classification schemes for land use and soils were used as only limited empirical data are available at such large spatial scales. Data were screened to eliminate areas where N inputs are dominated by non-atmospheric sources. From these screened datasets, it was apparent that areas with the highest risk of N leaching were situated predominantly in the upland areas of south-west and west Scotland (areas with low soil C/N ratios). At the regional scale, surface-water NO(3) concentration in afforested catchments was negatively correlated with soil C/N ratios below 20. This relationship was not evident in moorland catchments, where NO(3) leaching was strongly related to N deposition and the loch/catchment ratio, rather than the soil C/N ratio. Temporal trends of regional water quality highlighted as increasing loch NO(3) concentrations between 1988 and 1996-1997, presumably reflecting an increase in N deposition, enhanced leaching losses from the terrestrial component of the catchment, or altered in-lake processes. The hydrochemical records for two catchments in NE Scotland (Lochnagar and Allt a Mharcaidh) highlight the importance of within catchment process in controlling the nitrogen response observed in surface waters. The potential mechanisms through which vegetation and soils may modify incoming deposition are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Vinten, AJA; Dunn, SM				Vinten, AJA; Dunn, SM			Assessing the effects of land use on temporal change in well water quality in a designated nitrate vulnerable zone	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						nitrate; groundwater quality; horticulture; temporal change; modelling; GIS	MODEL; CATCHMENTS; FERTILIZER; MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN; SOIL	The nitrate concentration in discharge from the Balmalcolm borehole in Fife, Scotland, has steadily increased from 4.5 mg l(-1) NO3--N in the early 1970s to 11.0 mg l(-1) NO3--N in 1998. Consequently the catchment of the borehole, covering an area of 400 ha has recently been designated a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone under the EC Nitrate Directive [Commission of European Communities L375, (1991) 1]. The sandstone aquifer that supplies the borehole is recharged by water draining from land that is intensively cropped to green vegetables. There is, therefore, a need to identify appropriate land management techniques that will help to abate the nitrate losses from the land and to estimate the length of time that it is likely to take before the abatement is observed as a decrease in well-water concentrations. Estimates of nitrate leaching for the range of crops that have been grown in the catchment over the last 30 years have been made using a balance sheet approach, modified to allow for estimates of denitrification and in-field composting of vegetable crop residues. Integration over the whole catchment using a GIS approach, indicates a steady-state well water [NO3--N] of 23 mg l(-1) - a situation that has not yet been reached. Prediction of the time course of change in well water quality from 1970 (when intensification began) has been made by calculating the travel time from different parts of the catchment both in the saturated and unsaturated zones. The results show good agreement between the measurements and simulation. Well water [NO3--N] under potential future management scenarios have also been investigated using the same approach. The greatest reduction in steady-state concentration, to 9 mg l(-1), is achieved for the scenario of extensification to spring cereals with moderately fertilised grassland. However, the temporal simulations suggest that it would take approximately 100 years before 80% of this change is observed in the well-water, starting from a concentration of 23 mg l(-1).

This paper discusses continuing efforts to develop a set of tools and procedures that combine the power of GIS with a set of water quality models to support the management of water resources and in-stream water quality. Initial efforts focused on the Watershed Characterization and Modeling System (WCMS), a set of GIS tools focused on watershed issues in West Virginia including flow estimation, delineation of watersheds for a selected pour point, identify potentially affected streams from a pollutant source, rank watersheds for remediation, and use water quality data to estimate pollutant loadings and concentrations related to acid mine drainage. WCMS also includes an overland flow model that bases estimates of nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and total suspended solids (TSS) loadings on expected mean concentrations for specified land use/cover classes. An additional component, the Water Quality Modeling System (WQMS), was developed to dynamically estimate the impacts of pollutant or treatment on downstream water quality. WQMS uses a stream network model developed with Java tools as an adjunct to WCMS. This system includes over 38 parameters that may affect stream water quality. It improves significantly on the ability of WCMS to track specific pollutants. WCMS and WQMS are designed as tools for regulators, industrial operators, environmental planners, and communities to better understand stream conditions and the cumulative impacts of pollution and treatment on water quality.

J	Milstein, A; Zoran, M; Kochba, M; Avnimelech, Y				Milstein, A; Zoran, M; Kochba, M; Avnimelech, Y			Effect of different management practices on water quality of intensive tilapia culture systems in Israel	AQUACULTURE INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						aeration; draining frequency of wastes; intensive culture systems; management procedures; nitrification; organic loading; tilapia culture; water exchange rate; water quality		Commercial intensive aquaculture systems were built and are managed in a somewhat different way in each farm. To evaluate the effects of several management procedures on water quality in intensive fish ponds, data from several locations, times and culture conditions in different farms were collected and are herein analyzed through multivariate statistics. Water quality in the intensive ponds depends on the water entering, the biological processes within, and the water leaving the ponds. A reservoir used as source and sink water supplied the intensive ponds with higher organic loading than clear source waters, and its phytoplankton content affected nitrogen cycling within the intensive ponds. The systems with a reservoir had better water quality in the intensive ponds than those with only clean source water. Within the ponds (1) compared to paddle-wheel aeration, aeration by pure oxygen increased oxygen concentration, improved nitrification and promoted decomposition that reduced organic loading. (2) In concrete ponds accumulation of organic matter and development of anerobic conditions on the pond bottom was higher than in the slippery plastic-covered ponds. (3) All intensive ponds provided good growth conditions, tilapia biomass having relatively small influence on water quality. Only in paddle-wheel aerated ponds did increased tilapia biomass increased inorganic nitrogen compounds and soluble phosphorus through excretion, and reduce organic nitrogen through a more efficient removal of food particles. Water leaving the ponds removes matter affecting water quality within the pond. (1) Draining sediments accumulated on the bottom avoided development of anaerobic conditions where denitrification and phosphorus liberation can occur. (2) Water exchange removed particles with nitrifying bacteria and algae that absorb nutrients. A high water exchange rate may have a negative effect from the water quality point of view and from the extra costs incurred in energy and feeds washed out. The processes described occur simultaneously throughout the culture period and shape water quality dynamics in the ponds. This research contributed to the understanding of how management procedures affect the different phases of water quality dynamics in real-scale tilapia commercial intensive systems.

Runoff ranged from 0.4% to 10% of annual rainfall and >90% of this was overland flow. Phosphorus and carbon were measured in runoff. As much as 2.3 kg/ha of phosphorus and 10.7 kg/ha of total dissolved carbon were lost from the subcatchments in the wettest year. Over the study period, 98% of total phosphorus and 86% of total dissolved carbon were lost in overland flow. Around 45% of phosphorus was dissolved and 69% of total dissolved carbon was dissolved organic carbon. The proportion of phosphorus present in the particulate form decreased during each runoff season, and was highest in the wettest year. There was no consistent trend in the proportion of total dissolved carbon present as dissolved organic carbon because the factors found to affect dissolved organic carbon loss were different from those affecting dissolved inorganic carbon loss. Predictive relationships based on factors such as the time of year when the storm occurred and runoff volume have been developed from the 3 years of data and they explain a high proportion of variability of phosphorus and carbon loads.

The two analysed reduction scenarios were Finnish national agenda and the improvement of phosphorus removal in the present purification plants of St. Petersburg. The effects of load reduction scenarios were tested by using a 3D-ecosystem model with a horizontal resolution of 5 km. According to the results the Finnish national agenda cannot decrease the biomass of N-fixing cyanobacteria, but it seems to be able to reduce the total phytoplankton biomass in the coastal waters. The phosphorus reduction in St. Petersburg decreases the N-fixing cyanobacteria significantly in the central parts of the Gulf of Finland.

Since that time, more than 10 BNR plants have been built in western Canada, with capacities ranging from 2000 to 500 000 m(3)/d. As a result of the interaction among university researchers, plant designers, and plant operators, considerable progress has been made in refining the understanding of process and adapting the technology for cold climates. Consulting engineers from western Canada are now successfully competing in the international marketplace in the application of BNR technology in the U.S.A., the U.K., Europe, Asia, and Australia.

Hypoxia/anoxia occurs in both estuaries and in the open waters around Denmark with significant impacts upon living resources observed during the last century. A number of measures have been taken in the last decade to reduce nutrient loads with implementation of the Action Plan on the Aquatic Environment (Parts I and II). The phosphorus (P) load has been reduced by 80% due to improved sewage treatment, whereas little reduction in the nitrogen (N) load has occurred with implementation of Action Plan I. Additional policy measures have been taken which can contribute to the reduction in nitrogen emissions to the aquatic environment in Action Plan II. The final cost of this plan is expected to be ca. 1,000 million DKK (ca. 130 million ECU) with 50% paid for by the State and 50% paid for by the agricultural sector. Although significant improvements in water quality and living resources are not yet apparent, modeling efforts have predicted that the prescribed nutrient reductions can reduce the number of hypoxic and anoxic events in Danish estuaries and coastal waters.

J	Phillips, IR				Phillips, IR			Nitrogen and phosphorus transport in soil using simulated waterlogged conditions	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS			English	Article							DRYING CONDITIONS; DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENTS; HYPEREUTROPHIC LAKE; MARINE-SEDIMENTS; WATER-QUALITY; AVAILABILITY; FLUX; AMMONIUM; SORPTION; IONS	The diffusive and convective transport of ammonium (NH4-N) and phosphate (PO4-P) was investigated under laboratory conditions using two soils which had been waterlogged for a period of 21 days. Ammonium and PO4-P diffusion studies were conducted using a krasnozem soil and the organic surface material from a Melaleuca wetland. Approximately 30 g of each material were placed into a 60 mt polypropylene tube, and mixed with 45 mt of either deionized water, di-ammonium phosphate or potassium nitrate solution. The concentrations of water-soluble NH4-N and PO4-P were determined on day 0 and day 21. The diffusive Aux of these nutrients into or out of the soil materials over the 21 day period was calculated using Fick's First Law.Ammonium-N diffusive fluxes for the krasnozem ranged from 147 to 808 mg m(-2) d(-1), and from 7 to 621 mg m(-2) d(-1) for the wetland material. Waterlogging increased porewater NH,-N concentrations in the krasnozem, and this was attributed to displacement of resident NH,-N by iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) solubilized under reducing conditions. In contrast, waterlogging decreased porewater NH4-N concentrations in the wetland material. and this was attributed to sorption by newly created exchange sites. Phosphate diffusive fluxes for the krasnozem ranged from 3 to 1,050 mg m(-2) d(-1), and from 1 to 1,175 mg m(-2) d(-1) for the wetland material. Waterlogging increased porewater PO4-P concentrations in both soils, which was attributed to loss of sorption sites with solubilization of Fe and Mn hydous oxides under reducing conditions. Column (10 cm i.d. x 25 cm long) leaching studies were undertaken using samples of wetland material that had been previously waterlogged for 21 days, and samples which had not been waterlogged. Retention of surface-applied NH4-N and PO4-P was greater for waterlogged samples compared with retention by non-waterlogged material. Increased NH4-N retention was attributed to an increase in cation exchange capacity generated under waterlogged conditions, while increased PO4-P retention may be due to sorption and/ or precipitation reactions with solubilised Fe. Much of the sorbed NH4-N was readily desorbed by 0.01 M CaCl2, suggesting this cation was primarily retained by weak electrostatic forces, while the limited desorption of PO4-P suggests this anion was retained by much stronger forces. Results from this study demonstrate the importance of fundamental soil properties such as cation exchange capacity and competition for sorption sites on NH4-N and PO4-P transport in waterlogged sediments.

Cover crops reduce sedimentation production from cropland by , grow during periods when the soil might otherwise be fallow. While actively growing, cover crops increase solar energy harvest and carbon flux into the soil, providing food for soil macro and microrganisms, while simultaneously increasing evapotranspiration from the soil. Cover crops reduce sediment production from cropland by intercepting the kinetic energy of rainfall and by reducing the amount and velocity of runoff. Cover crops increase soil quality by improving biological, chemical and physical properties including: organic carbon content, cation exchange capacity, aggregate stability, and water infiltrability. Legume cover crops contribute a nitrogen (N) to subsequent crops. Other cover crops, especially grasses and brassicas, are better at scavenging residual N before it can leach. Because growth of these scavenging cover crops is usually N limited, growing grass/legume mixtures often increases total carbon inputs without sacrificing N scavenging efficiency. Cover crops are best adapted to warm areas with abundant precipitation. Water use by cover crops can adversely impact yields of subsequent dryland crops in semiarid areas. Similarly, cooler soil temperatures under cover crop residues can retard early growth of subsequent crops grown near the cold end of their range of adaptation. Development of systems that reduce the costs of cover crop establishment and overcome subsequent crop establishment problems will increase cover crop utilization and improve soil and water quality.

Additionally, erosion can contribute to removal of nutrients, soil organic matter, and fine particles. Balancing nutrients for these systems while protecting water and soil quality requires best management practices (BMPs). Crop rotations with deeper rooted small grains and winter cover crops reduced potential losses of fine particles, soil organic matter, nitrogen, and other nutrients due to wind erosion and protected soil and water quality. The cropping system N status can be monitored by assessing chlorophyll, sap NO3--N concentrations and N indexes of the canopy. The Nitrogen Leaching Economic Analysis Package (NLEAP) model simulated residual soil NO3--N and soil water and showed that there is potential to use precision farming to improve NUE. Simulations of the system showed that BMPs increased NUE and that NO3--N can potentially be removed from the shallow underground water table protecting water quality. These results show that with the application of models, and tools to monitor the N status of the aboveground canopy, such as chlorophyl readings, sap NO3--N concentrations, N indices, and other new technologies such as precision farming and remote sensing, nutrient use efficiency in the new millennium will be significantly increased, environmental quality will be conserved, and product quality will be improved at the farm level for the benefit of producers, processors and consumers.

It studies the possibility of remote measurement not only of those parameters which have a direct effect on the value of the uprising radiation, such as the chlorophyll-a concentration, the relative transparency (depth of visibility of Secchi disc), turbidity and coloration, but also those which are indirectly associated with optically active components. A significant correlation was established between chlorophyll-a concentration and oxygen content, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, chemical oxygen demand and conductivity. Regression equations for recovering a large number of water quality parameters from remote sensing data are obtained.

The withdrawal level was also regulated to keep the downstream epilimnion away from the nutrient supply. This method markedly reduced algal blooming in the reservoir downstream of the curtains during spring and summer. The physical and biological processes in the reservoir ecosystem were analysed using the 2-D reservoir model DYRESM and chemical and biological submodels, to predict the water quality and algal species composition in the reservoir. The horizontal variability was maintained in the model by dividing the horizontal layer into parcels. Temperature, chlorophyll-a, soluble phosphorus, nitrate, ammonium, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, internal nitrogen, internal phosphorus were considered as state variables in the model. The simulated results revealed the mechanism of how algal blooming is reduced, during early spring high algal concentrations consume large amounts of nutrients, which reduces the nutrient supply to the downstream zone of the reservoir, whereas during late spring and summer, nutrient dispersion from the upstream epilimnion to the downstream epilimnion is curtailed by the curtains, markedly reducing algal blooming in the downstream zone.

J	Murray, AG				Murray, AG			The use of simple models in the design and calibration of a dynamic 2D model of a semi-enclosed Australian bay	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						simple models; coastal; phytoplankton; denitrification	PORT-PHILLIP-BAY; WATER-QUALITY; ECOSYSTEM; PREDATION	Like many ecosystems that of Port Phillip Bay (Australia) shows spatial and temporal variability. As such, we have constructed a spatially structured dynamic model (the full model) to describe it. However, such complex models are very difficult to design and analyse. We have derived earlier a simple model of a semi-enclosed marine ecosystem, whose analytical solution has allowed the determination of the dependence of major variables and fluxes on model formulation and parameter values. Here we apply this simplified model to the analysis of responses to changes in nutrient loads and zooplankton mortality formulation (trophic closure). Output of the simple model compares well with output from the full model (averaged in space and time) at current and moderately elevated nutrient loads; but at highly elevated loads, there is a breakdown in the linkage between the predictions of the two models due to the role of spatial variation in moderating ecosystem responses. Observations obtained from Port Phillip Bay are then used to select the most realistic zooplankton mortality formulation of this bay. Observed chlorophyll concentration supports a quadratic over a linear zooplankton mortality model. Observation of phytoplankton size fractions indicate that in productive waters of the bay picophytoplankton are grazer controlled, while microphytoplankton escape grazer control; analytical solutions show how rather subtle differences in parameter values allow this to occur. This analysis tool allows the prediction of the effects of changes to model formulation, parameter values and external forcing on the full model. However, the simple model is not intended to be, or used as, a realistic model in itself; rather it is a design tool that has been used for the development of more detailed models.

The physical model implements a k-epsilon turbulent closure for an accurate water temperature representation over a wide range of meteorological data. For the oxygen budget, the one-dimensional diffusion equation is solved using the turbulent diffusivities provided by the turbulence model. Source and sink terms for surface re-aeration, photosynthetic production, respiration, biochemical oxygen demand and sediment oxygen demand are included. The model is forced by measured chlorophyll-a data. We shall report our experience gained with this model in simulating the metalimnetic oxygen minimum of 1996 in Lake Ammer, Germany.

In order to quantify the transport of water quality constituents in a harbour connected to a large lake, two-dimensional hydrodynamic and transport models have been extended to three dimensions and an extensive set of field observations collected. The models' performance is assessed by comparison of output with field observations. Use is made of a naturally occurring gradient in the salinity or total dissolved solids (TDS) distributions for testing the ability of the model to simulate such contaminants as dissolved phosphorus. In particular, we examine in some detail the salinity distribution in an arm of the harbour where its concentration ranges from 03 to 0.6 g/kg. It is found that the model replicates the distribution along the arm and also in the channel connecting the harbour to the lake, supporting its application to water quality problems.

Chiu's models for calculating the distribution of velocity and sediments over a channel cross-section were combined in this study. Models were applied to estimate the total phosphorus flux in inflows of Te-Chi Reservoir and Feitsui Reservoir in Taiwan. The model results compare favorably to the vertical distribution of observed data in velocity, sediments, and dissolved and particulate phosphorus concentrations. Using long-term streamflow data (hourly or daily), the annual total phosphorus loading rates can be estimated by the models developed herein. Those loading rates are essential for water quality and eutrophication modeling in the reservoir.

The CIT airshed model and the United States Environmental Protection Agency Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) were linked in order to simulate the fate and transport of nitrogen species through the atmosphere and storm drainage system in Los Angeles, California, USA. Coupling CIT and SWMM involved defining and resolving five critical issues: (1) reconciling the different modeling domain sizes, (2) accounting for dry deposition due to plant uptake, (3) estimating the fraction of deposited contaminant available for washoff, (4) defining wet deposition inputs to SWMM, and (5) parameterizing the SWMM washoff algorithm. The CIT-SWMM interface was demonstrated by simulating dry deposition, wet deposition, and stormwater runoff events to represent the time period from November 18, 1987 to December 4, 1987 for a heavily urbanized Los Angeles watershed discharging to Santa Monica Bay. From November 18th to December 3rd the simulated average dry deposition flux of nitrogen was 0.195 kg N/ha-day to the watershed and 0.016 kg N/ha-day to Santa Monica Bay. The simulated rainfall concentrations during the December 4th rainfall event ranged from 3.76 to 8.23 mg/l for nitrate and from 0.067 to 0.220 mg/l for ammonium. The simulated stormwater runoff event mean concentrations from the watershed were 4.86 mg/l and 0.12 mg/l for nitrate and ammonium, respectively.

J	Shamrukh, M; Corapcioglu, MY; Hassona, FAA				Shamrukh, M; Corapcioglu, MY; Hassona, FAA			Modeling the effect of chemical fertilizers on ground water quality in the Nile Valley aquifer, Egypt	GROUND WATER			English	Article								Chemical fertilizer use in Egypt has increased significantly since the construction of the Aswan High Dam in 1968, Increased applications of chemical fertilizers in irrigated lands are likely to create nonpoint contamination sources of chemical fertilizer species. This study was conducted to investigate the contamination of ground water by nitrogen and phosphorus chemical fertilizers, as well as the availability of ground water for irrigation and public water supply for the next century. Future concentrations of NO3-, and PO43- in shallow and deep ground water in the Nile Valley were assessed under realizable rates of fertilizer application. A ground water modeling system (GMS) was used to simulate the three-dimensional ground water flow and contaminant transport in the Tahta region of the Nile Valley Aquifer, and to predict the future concentrations of chemical fertilizer species, Results of the transport simulation predict the occurrence of ground water contamination at shallow depths (30 m) due to the high rate and method of chemical fertilizer applications. Best management practices should be employed to control and reduce the nitrate leaching and future impact of phosphorus and potassium fertilizer applications. At the same time, new deeper wells should be constructed. In addition, the use of hand pumps, in zones close to croplands (15 m depth) must be avoided due to susceptibility to fertilizer contamination, Ground water from existing deep wells can be used as an alternative water supply Furthermore, a ground water quality monitoring system should be established for early detection of ground water contamination and to determine progress of the fertilizer contaminant plume, A properly designed system should monitor nitrate and phosphate composition in observation and water supply wells.

Throughout the years, the application of remote sensing and geographic information system technology has undergone numerous modifications and revisions to enhance their ability to control, reduce, and estimate the origin of non-point source pollution. Yet, there is still a considerable amount of uncertainty surrounding the use of this technology as well as its modifications. This research demonstrates how the application of remote sensing, geographic Information system, and global positioning system technologies can be used to assess water quality in the Wheeler Lake watershed. In an effort to construct a GIS based water quality database of the study area for future use, a land use cover of the study area will be derived from LANDSAT Thermatic Mapper (TM) imagery using ERDAS IMAGINE image processing software. A Digital Elevation Model of the Wheeler Lake watershed was also from an Environmental Protection Agency Basins database. Physical and chemical properties of water samples including pH, Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Total Fecal Coliform (TC), Total Nitrogen (TN), Total Phosphorus (TP), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), and selected metal concentrations were measured. Water samples were collected once a month from selected locations within the Wheeler Lake watershed. A Global Positioning System Unit was used to georeference sampling locations and allowed us to revisit the sampling sites to collect additional samples. The major land use cover of the study area consists of agricultural land and forestland. Preliminary results infer that utilizing remote sensing, geographic Information system, and global positioning system technologies, enhances our ability to manage, estimate, and predict non-point pollution sources.

On this foundation, assessed is the impact of the above mechanisms of light interactions in natural aquatic media on the water leaving radiance spectral composition. Developed is an approach for a simultaneous retrieval of both the concentration vector of major optically active components coexisting in natural water bodies and the bottom depth given the bottom spectral albedo.

The area was subdivided into five climate zones, and nine representative soil classes were chosen. The basic rotation and fertilization schemes were created using information obtained from environmental agencies. In addition, the effects of fertilization rates were studied. The ranges of simulated N fluxes for the basic rotation and fertilization schemes are comparable to available regional estimates, and differences between sub-regions are plausible. The relative importance of natural and anthropogenic factors affecting N leaching to groundwater for the Saale River basin was as follows: (1) soil, (2) climate, (3) fertilization rate, and (4) crop rotation. The simulation experiments provide a basis for a metamodel approach, which aims at rapid water quality assessment of large regions.

The joint Finnish-Estonian project enabled use of various modelling approaches for management planning. An integrated, dynamic water quality model of the drainage basin and the lake was applied as an operational management tool. The state of the lake was predicted according to different scenarios. The results indicated that external loading of the lake has been very high for a long time, which has led to hypertrophy and also very high internal loading. The most effective method of restoration that can be carried out in practice was found to be the prevention of too low water levels.

To investigate the water-leaving radiance adequately, the contribution of the atmospheric path radiance reaching the sensor should be removed. In this work a completely image-based atmospheric correction method was applied by means of an inversion technique based on a simplified radiative transfer code (RTC). A semi-empirical approach of relating atmospherically corrected TM spectral reflectances to in situ measurements through regression analysis was used. Limnological parameters were measured near to the TM images dates; some of the in situ measurements were used to define algorithms relating chlorophyll concentration measurements to water surface reflectance and the others too were used to validate the results of the predictive model. The models developed, which performed better (r(2) = 0.818) when concentrations were higher than > 3.0 mg m(-3), were used to map chlorophyll concentration throughout the lake. Spatial distribution maps of chlorophyll concentration and concentration changes were produced with contour intervals of 1 mg m(-3).

J	Ning, SK; Chang, NB; Yang, L; Chen, HW; Hsu, HY				Ning, SK; Chang, NB; Yang, L; Chen, HW; Hsu, HY			Assessing pollution prevention program by QUAL2E simulation analysis for the Kao-Ping River Basin, Taiwan	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						water-resources management; water-quality management; river-basin planning; environmental systems analysis; sustainable development	MICROBIAL WATER-QUALITY; MANAGEMENT; SLOVENIA; MODEL; SAVA	Wise and sustainable uses of water resources are essential for an effective river-basin-management planning. Recent management strategy further addresses the fact that quantity and qualify of water are closely interrelated, and both must be considered simultaneously for all wafer resources and water quality management practices. The aim of this paper is to explore the impacts of wafer resources redistribution and pollution prevention actions between and within river basins simultaneously in South Taiwan. Much emphasis will be placed on assessing the impacts of wafer transfer over natural boundary to satisfy the needs of industrial development in the Tseng-Wen River system and its resultant influence on the water qualify in the downstream area of the Kao-Ping River system where the pollution prevention program is to be implemented. The Kao-Ping River was further characterized hydraulically and environmentally, based on a full investigation of discharges and withdrawals in the river reaches. QUAL2E was successfully calibrated and validated using data collected between 1998 and 1999 and the model was capable of predicting the concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, total phosphate-phosphorus, and ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) for the entire river system. With the aid of QUAL2E simulation model, it shows eliminating the pig farming activities and constructing the sewer systems in the upstream area of Kao-Ping River cannot guarantee the full compliance with water qualify standards in the downstream area and wafer transfer in the upstream area further increases negative impacts on the water quality in the wet season. The predicted situation of wafer quality in the dry season may even present worse condition. Additional wafer pollution control policy, such as the use of economic instruments for controlling and reducing the waste-load of biochemical oxygen demand and ammonia-nitrogen is needed in the Kao-Ping River system in the long run.

J	Rostagno, CM; Sosebee, RE				Rostagno, CM; Sosebee, RE			Biosolids application in the Chihuahuan Desert: Effects on runoff water quality	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							SEWAGE-SLUDGE; SEMIARID GRASSLAND; CROP YIELD; SOIL; PHOSPHORUS; FERTILIZER; MANAGEMENT; RAINFALL; IMPACT	Surface-applied biosolids, the option most often used on rangelands, ran increase the concentration of macronutrients and trace elements in the runoff water and can potentially produce eutrophication or contamination of surface waters. In this study, the effects of postapplication age of biosolids (18, 12, 6, and 0.5 mo) and rate of application (0, 7, 18, 34, and 90 Mg ha(-1)) on the quality of runoff water from shrubland and grassland soils were assessed. Between July and October 1996 simulated rainfall was applied to 0.50-m(2) plots for 30 min at a rate of 160 mm h(-1). All of the runoff water was collected. The concentration of NH(4)(+)-N, NO(3)(-)-N, PO(4)(3-)-P, total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), Cu, and Mn in the runoff water increased with rate of biosolids application and decreased with time of postapplication on the two soils. The highest PO(4)(3-)-P and NH(4)(+)-N concentrations, 4.96 and 97 mg L(-1) , respectively, were recorded in the grassland soil treated with 90 Mg ha(-1) of biosolids 0.5 mo postapplication. For the same soil, rate, and postapplication age of biosolids, Cu exceeded the upper limit (0.50 mg L(-1)) in drinking water for Livestock. Ammonium N and PO(4)(3-)-P should be the main compounds considered when surface-applying biosolids. Ammonium N at concentrations found in all biosolids-treated plots may affect the quality of livestock drinking water by causing taste and smell problems. Orthophosphate can contribute to eutrophication if the runoff from biosolids-treated areas enter surface waters.

J	Fisher, MM; Reddy, KR				Fisher, MM; Reddy, KR			Phosphorus flux from wetland soils affected by long-term nutrient loading	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							PORE WATER CHEMISTRY; FLORIDA EVERGLADES; ORGANIC-MATTER; NORTHERN EVERGLADES; HYPEREUTROPHIC LAKE; SEDIMENT; RELEASE; RESOLUTION; DECOMPOSITION; EQUILIBRATION	Wetland soils play a key role in the cycling of nutrients within an ecosystem, Since soils are potentially a source or a sink for inorganic nutrients, it is important to quantify their influence on overlying water quality in order to understand their importance in overall ecosystem nutrient budgets. Laboratory and field studies were performed in the northern Everglades (WCA-ZA) to determine the magnitude of phosphorus (P) flux between the soil and the overlying water column, under various redox conditions. The P flux was estimated using three techniques: intact soil cores, in situ benthic chambers, and porewater equilibrators, There was reasonable agreement between the P flux estimated using intact soil cores and benthic chambers; however, P flux estimates using the porewater equilibrators were considerably lower than the other two techniques. Models of solute flux, based solely on soil physico-chemical characteristics, may substantially underestimate soil-water nutrient exchange processes. Phosphorus flux measured with the intact soil cores varied from 6.5 mg m(-2) d(-1) near nutrient inflow areas to undetectable flux 4 km away from the inflow. Oxygen consumption varied from 4 mg m(-2) d(-1) near the inflow to a constant 1 to 2 mg m(-2) d(-1) at a distance of 4 km from the inflow, Rate of consumption of NO3--N and SO42- showed no significant trend with respect to distance from inflow, Nitrate N and SO4 consumption rates averaged 120 and 130 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively, Consumption of O-2 was correlated with P flux, whereas NO3--N and SO42- consumption were not.

From 1994-95, quarterly measurements were made of physical-chemical conditions, plankton biomass, and plankton species composition at 18 stations throughout the lake (n = 111). Sampling sites were clustered according to their physical-chemical similarity; these zones corresponded with depositional regions in the lake (Deep water, Shallow water, and Impacted regions). While plankton biomass did not vary among lake-zones, species composition was zone-specific suggesting that several factors (food web structure, nutrient cycling, and physical mixing) may determine the distribution of species throughout the lake. Plankton biomass and gross composition (phyla) were variable in time (seasons), and exhibited predictable succession patterns. Phytoplankton peaked in June corresponding with the upward mixing of nutrients, while zooplankton peaked during mid-stratification (August) when water temperatures were most warm. Finally, the basin-wide estimates for both total phosphorus and phytoplankton biomass were lower compared with historical estimates (measured in 1970s) and significant differences were not observed between near- and offshore regions. Despite this, the data also show that phytoplankton species composition varies widely throughout the lake, and that some nearshore sites do support impacted assemblages.

As a result of rapid economic development in the surrounding coastal hinterland, the water quality characteristics within Bohai Bay have been of growing concern in recent years. Details are given herein of an aquatic environmental assessment study undertaken to investigate the hydrodynamic and transport processes within the Bay using an integrated numerical modelling approach and field measurements. 3-D numerical model was used to simulate the tide flow and 2-D model was deployed with moving boundary to simulate the water quality. In order to improve on the water quality characteristics in the near-shore coastal zone, an ocean disposal plan was also considered, with various scenarios being simulated using the 2-D model. From an analysis of data collected from the field measurements, it was found that both chemical and phytoplankton indicators were important in the assessment of the overall water quality of the Bay. The occurrence of red tides was also found to be closely linked to the composition of phytoplankton community.

J	Reavie, ED; Smol, JP				Reavie, ED; Smol, JP			Diatom-environmental relationships in 64 alkaline southeastern Ontario (Canada) lakes: a diatom-based model for water quality reconstructions	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY			English	Article						eutrophication; diatoms; Ontario; training set; calibration; phosphorus	ASSEMBLAGES; INDICATORS; ORDINATION	Lake eutrophication is a problem in many areas of Ontario, although the history of nutrient enrichment is poorly documented. The aim of this study was to construct a diatom-based transfer function to infer past phosphorus levels in Ontario lakes using paleolimnological analyses. The relationship between diatom assemblages and limnological conditions was explored from a survey of diatoms preserved in the surface sediments of 64 Southern Ontario lakes, spanning a total phosphorus gradient of 0.004 to 0.054 mg L-1. Over 420 diatom taxa were identified, 98 of which were sufficiently common to be considered in statistical analyses. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) determined that pH, ammonium, aluminium, spring total phosphorus(TP), strontium, total nitrogen (TN), maximum depth (MaxZ), chlorophyll a (Chla) and mean depth were significant variables in explaining the variance in the diatom species data. The environmental optima of common diatom taxa for the limnologically important variables (TP, pH, TN, MaxZ, Chla) were calculated using weighted averaging (WA) regression and calibration techniques, and transfer functions were generated. The diatom inference model for spring TP provided a robust reconstructive relationship (r(2) = 0.637; RMSE = 0.007 mg L-1; r(boot)(2) = 0.466; RMSEboot = 0.010 mg L-1). Other variables, including pH (r(2) = 0.702; RMSE = 0.208; r(boot)(2) = 0.485; RMSEboot = 0.234), TN (r(2) = 0.574; RMSE = 0.0899 mg L-1; r(boot)(2) = 0.380; RMSEboot = 0.127 mg L-1) and MaxZ (r(2) = 0.554; RMSE = 1.05 m; r(boot)(2) = 0.380; RMSEboot = 1.490 m), were also strong, indicating that they may also be reconstructed from fossil diatom communities. This study shows that it is possible to reliably infer lakewater TP and other limnological variables in alkaline Southern Ontario lakes using the WA technique. This method has the potential to aid rehabilitation programs, as it can provide water quality managers with the means to estimate pre-enrichment phosphorus concentrations and an indication of the onset and development of nutrient enrichment in a lake.

Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreber) plots received swine (Sus scrofa L) manure slurry at 1 or 2 Mg (dry weight) ha(-1) to provide N at 78.4 or 156.8 kg ha(-1). Simulated rain (75 mm hr(-1)) applied 24 hr after slurry application produced 30 min of runoff from each plot. Mean infiltration rates ranged from 7.7 to 60.6 mm hr(-1). Concentrations and mass losses of total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), NH4-N, dissolved reactive P (DRP), and total P in runoff increased significantly (alpha = 0.05) following slurry applications, and doubled when slurry application doubled. High infiltration rates reduced runoff volumes and runoff concentrations of Cl, total dissolved solids, DRP, TKN, and NH4-N. Concentrations of NO3-N and NH4-N in leachate water, collected at 0.4 m depth by suction cup lysimeters, did not increase following slurry applications.

Data from three rainfall simulation studies were used to evaluate the relative importance of the variables in the P index. These studies included plots containing sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L), and corn (Zea mays L) residues on which chemical fertilizer and composted or noncomposted beef cattle feedlot manure were applied under no-till and disked conditions. The factors of erosion, runoff, soil P level, P application source, and method and rate of P addition were weighted and considered in the index calculation. Measured soil erosion accounted for 78% and 88% of the variability in total and particulate P losses, respectively, indicating the importance of erosion in the loss of sediment hound P. Bioavailable and dissolved P losses were unrelated to measured soil erosion but were influenced by tillage, runoff amount, and P source. The P index of Lemunyon and Gilbert was modified based on the results of these experiments. The correlation coefficient value (r) between total P loss and the modified P index values, was 0.74 as compared to 0.52 for the Lemunyon and Gilbert P index Additive index values were more closely correlated with total P loss than the index values calculated by multiplying the weight of each factor. If erosion and runoff are accurately predicted, the P index can serve as a useful tool for identifying sites where transport of P to surface water can be a potential concern.

Evaluation of soluble phosphorus loading from manure-applied fields under various spreading strategies	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						agricultural non-point source pollution; Catskill mountains; hydrological modeling; hydrologically sensitive areas (HSA); manure management; phosphorus; water quality		A simple model was developed and applied to a dairy farm in the New York City (NYC) water supply watershed to evaluate the effectiveness of various manure spreading strategies for reducing non-point source, soluble phosphorus (SP) pollution. Phosphorus from manure-spread fields is recognized as one of the important non-point source pollutants in the region and there is acute interest in developing economically viable water quality management practices. The NYC watershed initiative, i.e. the Watershed Agriculture Program (WAP), mandated that water quality management practices would be scientifically justifiable based on the best information available (Walter and Walter, 1999). Thus, this project was carried-out to evaluate manure-handling strategies based on the currently available information. The model for predicting SP loading to perennial streams via surface runoff was developed by combining a mechanistic hydrological model with art empirical relationship for SP concentration in runoff This study showed that, in the short term, because of soil P accumulation associated with a history of dairy fanning, the maximum possible reduction in SP loading to perennial streams is about 50%. Exporting all manure from the NYC watersheds attains this. Utilizing the concept of hydrologically sensitive areas (Walter et al. 2000), this study suggests possible SP loading reductions of 25% with all manure remaining on-farm. This study supports and emphasizes the finding by Walter et al. (2000) that the timing and location of manure spreading strongly influences SP transport.

The treatment facilities are usually located at the end of sewer systems and may be positively affected by some functions (e.g. storage, contaminant decomposition, etc.) of the systems. The paper describes state of the art of physical models describing processes of the wastewater systems. Not only the model equations are presented but also available sensors and laboratory measurement techniques are reviewed, as the measurement data are needed to calibrate the models. The last section briefly describes models simplifications that are inevitable in their applications to system monitoring and control.

Annual N retention estimated by hydrodynamic modelling was 460 t N yr(-1), Direct measurements suggested that 60% of the retained N was denitrified. Despite high area-based denitrification rates (0.1 to 8 mmol N m(2) d(-1), or on average 140 kg N ha(-1) yr-1) the majority of the N freshwater input (90%) was exported to the open sea, the Kattegat. The model suggested maximum N retention in March and February, and our data indicate that N retention was mainly caused by sedimentation of freshwater allochthonous organic N in the inner part of the estuary. Annual P retention estimated by hydrodynamic modelling was 15 t P yr(-1), corresponding to 9% of the freshwater input. In contrast, flux measurements indicated a net release of 30 t P yr-1. Since the model operates on total P and the flux measurements only included fluxes Of PO43- , this significant difference was most probably due to sedimentation of allochthonous organic matter. Simple models used in previous studies of estuarine nutrient retention and denitrification could not explain our data. We tested a model reported in the literature for nitrogen and phosphorus retention as a function of freshwater residence time. Using this model, nitrogen retention was 1.6 times higher than that estimated by our model, while the phosphorus model predicted a 3% release, compared to 9% retention estimated by our model. Models that estimate denitrification from N03 concentrations in the water column and O-2 uptake in the sediment explained less than 7% of the annual and spatial variations of denitrification in Randers Fjord, Regulation of denitrification seemed to be more complex in Randers Fjord and, consequently, direct measurements or complex modelling will have to be applied to obtain reliable estimates of retention.

Discharge of nutrient-rich effluent from intensive culture systems can contribute to eutrophication of receiving waters, potentially impacting both natural biota and local culture operations. With the proliferation of catastrophic viral epidemics, implementation of techniques for minimizing water exchange has increased. A growing volume of scientific research and industry experience confirms that water exchange may be reduced or eliminated. Supplemental aeration plays a key role in the successful operation of semi-intensive and intensive closed systems. To maintain appropriate dissolved oxygen levels it has been estimated that paddlewheel aeration, used in many closed systems, must be increased by 10% or more over levels traditionally applied in intensive culture. As aeration rates are increased, aerator placement and use of back-up aeration and alarm systems becomes a necessity. The pond microbial community plays a major role in pond dissolved oxygen dynamics, natural food availability and mineral recycling rates. A growing volume of research and hands on experience suggests that manipulation of microbial communities through supplementation of limiting nutrients, selective habitat expansion, or culture additions can have positive impacts. In some cases, however, these same techniques can have unexpected consequences requiring more basic research on pond microbial community ecology and an improved understanding of mechanisms of action. Feed is the major source of nutrient input into pond systems. Without water exchange, control of feed formulations and feed inputs becomes one of the most critical factors for success as levels of intensification are increased. Preliminary studies are now underway aimed at increasing stocking densities in enclosed biosecure raceway systems using static water culture technologies. Preliminary results are presented and avenues for future research on water reuse are discussed. Sedimentation may represent an effective strategy for removal of organic material from culture systems and harvest water, Additional research will be needed to explore waste treatment and related disposal issues. An extended review of recent publications on the development and application of zero exchange systems at Belize Aquaculture, Ltd. is included. Application of recent technological advances and experience gained in research, pilot and commercial scale systems can improve the outlook for optimization of the design of new systems, the retrofitting of existing systems and the application of management protocols for shrimp culture with minimal water exchange.

Several states have tried to establish general threshold soil P levels above which the enrichment of surface runoff P becomes unacceptable. However, little information is available on the relationship between soil and surface runoff P, particularly for the northeastern United States. Further, threshold soil P criteria will be of limited value unless they are integrated with site potential for runoff and erosion. In response, the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) developed a P Index (PI), which ranks the vulnerability of fields as sources of P loss in runoff, based on soil P, hydrology, and land use. This study evaluated the relationship between soil and surface runoff P in a study watershed in central Pennsylvania. The relationship was then incorporated into the (PI), and its impact on the identification of critical source areas within the watershed was examined. Using simulated rainfall (6.5 cm h(-1) for 30 min), the concentration of dissolved P in surface runoff (0.2-2.1 mg l(-1)) from soils was related (r(2)=0.67) to Mehlich-3 extractable soil P (30-750 mg kg(-1)). Using an environmentally based soil P threshold level of 450 mg kg(-1) determined from the soil-runoff P relationship, the PI identified and ranked areas of the watershed Vulnerable to P loss. The vulnerable areas were located along the stream channel, where areas of runoff generation and areas of high soil P coincide, and where careful management of P fertilizers and manure should be targeted.

Loomis and Dow (1998) reported on the site conditions, constraints encountered, types of systems installed, actual measured hydraulic loading rates to these systems, targeted water quality goals, construction cost estimates, strategies for educating participating clientele groups, and startup performance results from these systems. In this paper we report on the treatment performances of one at-grade recirculating sand filter, two single pass sand filters, three Maryland style recirculating sand filters, five foam cube biofilters, and one recirculating textile filter. The data were collected over an 18 month period. All the sand filter systems studied reduced TSS and BOD5 by 90 to 99%; achieved 2.3 to 3.8 log(10) reductions in fecal coliform levels; and produced TN reductions ranging from 8 to 75%, depending upon type of sand filter system and season (temperature). Mean TSS and BOD5 effluent concentrations for the foam biofilters and the textile filter were both less than 20 mg/l. TN concentrations in recirculating textile filter effluent averaged 13 and 29 mg/l for the warm and cold seasons, respectively; whereas fecal coliform concentrations averaged 3,000 and 52,500 counts/100 ml. Log10 reductions of fecal coliform for the foam biofilters averaged about 1.5 regardless of season. Mean effluent TN concentrations and percent TN reductions in the foam biofilters ranged from 28 to 61 mg/l and 10 to 23%, respectively. All systems operated hydraulically without mishap, with the exception of the recirculating textile filter that needed retrofitting about midway through the study.

In this study three systems did not have advanced treatment while the remaining system was used in conjunction with an aerobic advanced treatment unit (ATU). The seasonal high water table (SHWT) was estimated during the site evaluation and monitor wells were installed to collect grab samples quarterly. The monitor wells were placed up-gradient of the system, inside the drainfield and down-gradient of the system. The grab samples were analyzed for Nitrate/Nitrite-N, Ammonia-N, Kjeldahl-N, Total N, pH, specific conductivity and fecal coliform bacteria. Two of the three systems, without the ATU, had SHWT's at 50 cm while the third was estimated at 27 cm. The system with the ATU had a SHWT at or near the soil surface. All of the systems appear to be functioning properly with no adverse environmental impacts. Nitrate/Nitrite-N did not increase significantly from the background samples taken before system operation The ATU system had a significant increase In the Nitrate/Nitrite-N levels within the wells that were located within the drainfield. This is expected due to the aerobic properties of the ATU which nitrifies the wastewater creating Nitrate/Nitrite-N. This form of nitrogen is readily absorbed by plant roots Fecal coliform bacteria levels were all generally less than 20/100mL with 79% of the total being less than 10/100mL. The reduction of the isolation distance from 45 cm to 30 cm appears to have no adverse impact on the ground water quality within the soils of Delaware. Further water sampling, plus soil sampling at four inch intervals, during the next year will provide more complete results and allow to see longer term exposure of the sites to wastewater treatment and disposal.

The conceptual semi-distributed water budget and water quality model NPSM (Non Point Source Model) was applied in the mesoscale Brugga catchment (39.9 km(2)) in southwest Germany. Spatial distribution was achieved by classifying sub-areas based on the concept of hydrological chemical response units (CHRUs). Parameter values for the runoff and nitrogen simulation were estimated from catchment properties, previous experimental and modelling studies, regional field studies and literature. Optimization of the parameter values, calibration of the model and validation of the simulation was achieved using the runoff curve, concentrations of nitrate and natural tracers. Sensitivity analysis revealed that only a few parameters were important for rile simulation of runoff and the dynamics of the nitrogen fluxes. The simulated nitrate concentrations were strongly controlled by the nitrogen input. the water movements and the nitrogen reactions in the different sub-areas. Due to the lack of data, the parameterization of the nitrogen contents and reactions in the soil remained uncertain. As a result of this study NPSM proved Co be applicable in a meso-scale catchment performing satisfactory results for the simulation of stream flow. However the short time dynamics of the measured nitrate could not be fitted by the nitrogen simulation. An improvement of the short time performance can only be achieved using a more detailed soil and agricultural data basis. To evaluate the suitability of the model as a tool for river basin management, simulations for longer time periods and with additional nutrients have to be performed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

An initial modelling attempt is conducted on a large deep sub-alpine lake (Lake Bourget, Savoy, France), where several categories of unicellular organisms, including potentially toxic Cyanobacteria, are examined. A biogeochemical model is developed and coupled to an existing one-dimensional thermal model. A first calibration is performed, using data issued by measuring campaigns on 1995 and 1996; it is afterwards checked for years 1997 and 1998. The calibration is satisfactory with regard to 2 major criteria: (1) the interannual differences of planktonic successions are fairly well represented, and (2) the orders of magnitude of algal groups' biomass are correct. Nevertheless, this preliminary calibration must be improved as important divergences between model and data persist: a time lag during organisms' growth and uncertainty regarding prediction of population peaks of a specific species category.

Direct methods require the measurement of drainage rate and its nitrate concentration. Direct measurement of drainage flow is only possible by using lysimeters, but normally it is estimated from water balance calculations, or from field measurements of hydraulic water gradients and hydraulic conductivity. However, hydraulic conductivity is highly variable and measurements in the field are very laborious, so this has stimulated the development and use of empirical estimation methods. Under cropping, the main difficulty in estimating drainage from water balance measurements stems from the difficulties of obtaining accurate values of evapotranspiration. A chloride balance method for measuring drainage can be a good choice under certain circumstances. There are different ways of sampling the draining soil solution and one of the most frequent is porous suction cups, however, questions about their validity still remain. Pan samplers are also used, but having to determine their collection efficiency is one of their main drawbacks. The more recently developed capillary passive samplers still need further testing.

The watershed has a baseline nonpoint source pollution (NPS) contributing to the Northwest River that eventually influxes to the Chesapeake Bay. Stormwater runoff discharge from the watershed influxes to the Northwest River, approximately 6.44 km (4 miles) upstream of the intake from the City of Chesapeake's potable water supply. A distributed parameter water quality model and Geographic Information System (GIS) framework was implemented to develop a spatiotemporal load allocation (LA) BMP and total maximum daily load (TMDL) estimation to abate the current level of NPS pollution at the same time to preserve the quality of drinking water supply at the Northwest River. A Unix-based Arc/INFO GIS was linked to an event-based, large problem domain distributed parameter water quality model to generate runoff synthesis and subsequent transport of pollutants and sediment from the watershed. This bilateral linkage framework resulted in a powerful, up-to-date tool that would be capable of monitoring and instantaneously visualizing the transport of any pollutant as well as effectively identifying critical areas of the NIPS pollution. The framework was also used to simulate various "what if" scenarios of event-based and background load (BL) of pollutants to develop WLA and TMDL through regulatory best management practice (BMP) protocols. Results showed that the optimal BMP scenario achieved an average reduction of about 41% in soluble and sediment-attached nitrogen and about 62% reduction in soluble and sediment phosphorous from current NPS pollution levels.

This project investigates whether new hyperspectral EO sensors provide enhanced accuracy and more detailed spatial context to aid the characterization of crop type and fractional ground cover. These are key input parameters in models of field and catchment scale nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment loss to streams. Such contemporary information, when coupled with supporting (e.g. digital elevation model) data, will help identify vulnerable areas and provide a framework for developing pollution risk assessment tools based on the spatial co-location of risk factors (slope, erodable soils, crop type).

We developed a P index based upon P losses using estimated P concentrations in eroded material and in solution, and WEPP to estimate carrier masses and enrichment. The purpose of an index is to guide management decisions. Two soil associations in Iowa were used to illustrate the concept, and to demonstrate the roles of sediment and water in contributing to eutrophication of surface waters. The results show clearly that soil and water conservation and management practices that control soil erosion are vital to reducing P contributions to water bodies.

A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was made to estimate the impact of topography on the transport pattern of a diffusive pollutant, The spatial distribution of soil and land use were collected from the local government agricultural agency, A 50 meter resolution pixel size was selected for raster representation of the spatial information. The Hanjaechun watershed in the Kyungpook province of South Korea was selected as a study area. Water quality samples were collected at 15 points along the primary stream network shortly after rainfall events. A heuristic approach was employed to calibrate the model parameters. Simulation results represent the spatial variation of pollutant concentration well. Spatial distribution of output map-layers such as nitrogen and phosphorous are expected to contribute in the decision-making procedure of selection of best management practices (BMP).

GLEAMS runoff soil and nitrogen loss predictions were compared with observed data collected from TRACE experimental plots located at North Carolina A&T State University Farm, Greensboro, North Carolina Tillage systems in TRACE were conventional tillage, strip tillage, no till controlled traffic, and no till full traffic. GLEAMS was not calibrated Inputs were taken from literature, GLEAMS user's manual or measured locally. Based on 20 months of observed data, we concluded that GLEAMS grossly under predicted runoff and nitrogen losses, and over-predicted sod loss for all tillage systems. This does not mean that GLEAMS prediction is inaccurate since this conclusion is based on a very limited database.

B	Zheng, F; Huang, CH; Norton, LD		Ascough, JC; Flanagan, DC		Zheng, F; Huang, CH; Norton, LD			How near-surface moisture gradients affect phosphorous and nitrate losses	SOIL EROSION RESEARCH FOR THE 21ST CENTURY, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	International Symposium on Soil Erosion Research for the 21st Century	JAN 03-05, 2001	HONOLULU, HI	Amer Soc Agr Engineers		water quality; N/P losses; soil erosion; artesian seepage	EROSION PROCESSES; EUTROPHICATION	Phosphorous (P) and nitrogen (N) in runoff from agricultural fields are key components of non-point source pollution, Extensive efforts have been made to determine conditions that contribute to P/N losses. However, one factor, which may contribute significant P/N movement on the landscape but has not yet been quantified, is artesian seepage. A laboratory study was designed to evaluate artesian seepage effects on P and N losses from soil boxes. Experimental variables included three rates of fertilizer input: control, low (P 40, N: 100 kg/ha) and high (P: 80, N: 200 kg/ha), and three near-surface hydrologic conditions: free drainage (Fd), saturation (Sa), and artesian seepage (Sp). Simulated rainfall of 50 mm/h was applied for 90 min and runoff samples were collected for dissolved P and nitrate-N analyses. The results showed that near-surface moisture gradients have great effects on nitrate-N and P losses. Comparing to drainage condition (Fd), nitrate-N concentrations in surface runoff from saturation (Sa), seep flow alone (Sp), and seepage with rain (Sp+R) ranged 41 to 62, 2242 to 9054, and 263 to 1110 times greater for control experiment, low and high fertilizer application rates, respectively. Similarly, average P concentrations from Sa, Sp, and Sp+R averaged 4 to 5, 8 to 16, and 7 to 8 times greater for low and high fertilizer inputs, respectively, as compared to Fd. These results showed that seepage condition may have a significant contribution to the water quality problem and efforts need to be focused on understanding and controlling hillslope seepage.

Twenty-one oligotrophic lakes within Killamey Park, Ontario were selected as the principal Canadian sites for this study. NLRS objectives for Killarney included: testing of new biomonitoring techniques, assessment of multiple stressor effects on recovery, and development of biological endpoints for critical load modelling. Sampling included: phytobenthos, phytoplankton, pelagic zooplankton littoral zooplankton, sublittoral chironomids, and fish, as well as sediment cores for paleolimnological assessment of pre-industrial biotic communities. Strong statistical models were developed relating biotic composition to water quality variables. Prediction of future recovery will require additional understanding of the effects of differential colonization rates, climate variability, and the impact of unique events such as the arrival of an exotic species. Recovery proved to be best measured against modem reference data from circumneutral lakes rather than against historic data from acidified systems.

The first scenario, according to the Helsinki Commission, assumed a proportional 50 % load reduction in all riparian countries. The second was based on a cost-effective optimal approach by Gren [1], with significant regional differences in load reduction. The comparative simulations covered a period of 16 month (January 1980 -May 1981). In the central Baltic Sea a 50 % load reduction caused a decrease in inorganic nitrogen concentration by 39 % and inorganic phosphorus declined by 8.3 % in the upper water layer (30 m). Chlorohyll-a, as an indicator for algae biomass, was reduced by 9 %. The comparison between the two 50 % reduction scenarios revealed pronounced differenced mainly in coastal waters. Near large rivers in the southern Baltic, like the Oder and the Vistula, the cost-effective scenario showed a farther decrease of chlorophyll-a concentrations by more than 5 %. Altogether the water quality in southern Baltic Sea, especially in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states clearly benefits from a cost-effective approach. Along the south coast of the Baltic Sea, bathing and summer tourism is most intensive, a major economic factor and high coastal water quality is essential. This is especially true for the intended further growth of tourism. Especially the German coast has a high net economic benefit from improved water quality of Polish rivers. Therefore, from an ecological and economical viewpoint it is reasonable that Germany invests money in improved Polish water treatment measures.

The continued release of the waste waters has had serious impact on the water quality of the river. In this paper major types of pollutants and their sources are presented. All water quality investigations have to start with measurements, but afterwards models become important tools for abstracting more information from these measurements. At present with increasing environmental controls, important river water quality projects can not any more be conducted without proper modelling of quality. In this research, the water quality (WQ) module in MIKE11 is applied to one catchment in Belgium. Concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), ammonium-nitrogen (NH4-N) and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) are modelled in MIKE11 by taking,into consideration advection, dispersion and the most important biological, chemical and physical processes. Model calibration was done on the basis of available measured water quality data. Continuous simulation over a period of 8 years is used to create CDF-curves (Concentration-Duration-Frequency) to gain an insight in the duration and the frequency of the occurrence of events with inadmissible concentrations of the modelled parameters. Moreover, comparisons with both Flemish and British standards are presented in this paper.

A comprehensive water quality-monitoring program was carried out between November 1998 and March 2000. Results show that the urban creeks are enriched with total phosphorus, total nitrogen and ammonia. Nutrient level in the creeks exceeded the recommended level [1] even before reaching the central business district (CBD). Provided that other factors are conducive phosphorus and nitrogen enrichment in water can induce higher plant growth in the aquatic system, including toxic cynobacterial blooms. The stormwater quality was flow dependent as the bulk of pollutant loads were delivered during storm events. The diffuse sources contributed 63% of the total annual nutrient load discharged by the Blackman's Swamp Creek catchment at the monitoring site (Site 1) whereas the Sewerage Treatment Plant (STP) contributed less than 40% of the total annual load. However, during the drier months (Deceniber-April) when 'rainfall-runoff is low, the contribution of STP makes up to 80% of total catchment load. In the contrary, this point source contribution declines to 20% of the nutrient loads during storm events. The variability of rainfall-runoff and subsequent impact of point and diffuse sources on water quality need to be established in order to predict pollutant export under different conditions. Such information is critical to the development of sustainable and cost-effective management strategies to regulate stormwater pollution.

Istanbul is the largest city of Turkey and has a population of 10 million that may reach about 20 million in 2032. The city is divided into Asian and European sides by the Bosphorus Strait. The Sea of Marmara is an enclosed sea, connected to the Black Sea and Aegean Sea by the straits of Bosphorus and Dardanelles, Therefore, there is very strong and permanent stratification in the Sea of Marmara throughout the year, lower layers carrying Mediterranean and the upper layers carrying Black Sea water. This unique coastal structure of Istanbul necessitated a detailed study to determine the level of wastewater treatment and the location and depth of marine outfalls. A comprehensive three-dimensional water quality modelling study concluded that tertiary treatment including nitrogen and phosphorus removal is required for the effluent discharges into the Marmara Sea. However, enhanced primary or even primary treatment has been found satisfactory for discharges into the lower layers of the Bosphorus and into the Black Sea. Provisions for upgrading to secondary treatment were recommended. The status of existing and planned wastewater treatment plants and sea outfalls of Istanbul city are also presented. Although the amount of treated wastewater was only 63 percent in 1998, a target of 95 percent treatment level by the end of 2000 has been adopted in implementation plans. All treatment plants are located at or close to the coast except Pasakoy WWTP which is in the catchment area of Omerli Reservoir, the major source of drinking water for Istanbul city. The Pasakoy WWTP has been designed to treat wastewaters collected from the catchment area of Omerli Reservoir to tertiary level before ultimate disposal. The implementation programme together with the cost estimates are given. Total investment on water, wastewater and stormwater projects up to year 2032 is estimated at about 10 billion US Dollars. The share of the wastewater projects in this total is increasing with time. The financial analysis concluded that investments for a Higher Demand Scenario can be realised by raising the water tariffs to 1.0 $/m(3) for Phase 1 and 0.9 $/m(3) for Phase 2.

The ANN process models, including ORP/pH simulation models and water quality ([NH4+-N] and [NOx--N]) prediction models, can assist in real-time searching the ORP and pH control points and evaluating the operation performances of aerobic nitrification and anoxic denitrification operation phases. Since the major biological nitrogen removal mechanisms were controlled at nitritification (NH4+- N --> NO2--N) and clenitritification (NO2--N -->N-2) stages, as well as the phosphorus uptake and release could be completely controlled during aerobic and anoxic operation phases, the system operation performances under this ANN real-time control system revealed that both the aeration time and overall hydraulic retention time could be shortened to about 1.9-2.5 and 4.8-6.2 hrs/cycle respectively. The removal efficiencies of COD, ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen, and phosphate were 98%, 98%, 97%, and 84% respectively, which were more effective and efficient than under conventional fixed-time control approach.

A GIS tool was used to define and identify the critical pollution areas and sources. Pollution source information such as population, livestock, industry and land use were collected on the basis of the individual village boundary. The industrial, land use and living pollution were aggregated by the GIS overlay analysis capability to obtain the combined pollution load within the watershed. Priority areas for the mitigation of the pollution were defined considering the pollution loading rate, distance of stream from pollution source, and political, religious, and touristic values of the area. This research noticed that Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur municipalities are the major polluting areas and living beings are the major factors of Bagmati River pollution, Delivery ratio for the watershed was found to vary from 40-69% for BOD and nitrogen but the delivery of phosphorus was exceptionally high (92% at Gaurighat and 77% at Chovar) due to cremation activity of the Hindu religion on the riverbanks. Thus, the priority areas for the mitigation of the carbonaceous and nutrient source pollution were identified. At present the land use and industry impaired a very low contribution compared to the huge pollution load from the municipalities to the river system.

The foundation of the nutrient control program for the Everglades is a set of six large constructed wetlands, referred to as Stormwater Treatment Areas (STAs). The initial treatment goal is to reduce phosphorus entering the Everglades to 50 parts per billion. The STAs comprise almost 17,000 hectares, with a capital cost of approximately $700 million. Approximately 4,720 hectares are currently operational, another 2,600 hectares are in the start-up phase, and construction is just getting under way on the remaining areas. Throughout the design process, engineers and scientists collaborated to capture the best available information on wetland treatment systems, and to develop the most appropriate design criteria. Some of the more challenging issues included characterizing stormwater inflows and phosphorus loads, determining appropriate nutrient removal performance characteristics, and estimating hydraulic design parameters relating to densely vegetated systems. The design process combined in-house staff with engineering consultants, construction contractors, external review groups and independent peer-review. This paper summarizes major design aspects and key assumptions, and sets the stage for addressing future challenges associated with achieving long-term water quality goals of Everglades restoration.

In this paper, a simple tool for the modelling of annual nutrient loads is presented. It is implemented in ARC/INFO GIS using Are Macro Language (AML). The use of a GIS is justified as the spatial characteristics of the catchment area (land use, industrial wastewater location) dictate water quality. The annual nutrient loads are worked out on the catchment scale, using existing GIS routines together with specific routines developed in AML for hydrological and water quality modelling purposes. The catchment area is divided into hydrological subcatchments with relatively homogeneous spatial characteristics. Each subcatchment is linked to a specific nutrient export potential. These nutrient loads, calculated on a subcatchment-by-subcatchment basis, are conveyed to the outlet of the catchment and allow annual nutrient load estimation. A comparison with a water monitoring study is conducted to verify the adequation of modelling results for phosphorus and nitrogen loads.

Poinciana Wastewater Treatment Plant No. 3 has discharged advanced secondary treated effluent to the Boot WTS since August 1984. Comprehensive operational monitoring has been ongoing since 1990. The Boot WTS has provided consistent removal of nitrogen and phosphorus. Influent total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations averaged approximately 10.0 mg/L and 2.5 mg/L at an average hydraulic loading rate (HLR) of 0.2 cm/d. Wetland effluent concentrations for TN and TP averaged 1.8 mg/L and 1.2 mg/L. Available flow and water quality data were used to develop estimates of the first-order removal rate, k, for TN (14 m/y) and TP (1.8 m/y). These removal rates are within the range of values for other forested treatment wetlands. Biochemical oxygen demand (2.2 mg/L) and total suspended solids (4.9 mg/L) in the influent are near background levels for forested wetlands and are not significantly reduced with passage through the system.

The remedy for this scenario is the introduction of methods to enhance oligotrophication by means of constructed wetlands and buffer zones. This paper discusses new data on nitrogen flux and population changes in the primary consumers in the Bradley Creek ecosystem, adjacent to the Duck Haven Golf Course in southeastern North Carolina. In 1998-99, over different seasons, density distribution of the field populations of the fiddler crab Uca minax, was monitored as an indicator of environmental health. A control site at Whiskey Creek, adjacent to the University Center for Marine Sciences, was monitored in the same period since this site is not influenced by any golf course nutrient flux. The results pointed out that threshold level for optimum population density in Spartina grandiflora salt marsh is 0.1 mg/L of nitrates. A dense crab population, adjacent to the golf course with a buffer zone, was indicative of restoration of the estuarine ecosystem. A model, involving the use of constructed wetlands for oligotrophication, is being prepared on the basis of studies conducted by the University of South Alabama for a stormwater wetland constructed adjacent to the university's golf course.

J	Zeng, W; Beck, MB				Zeng, W; Beck, MB			Development and evaluation of a mathematical model for the study of sediment-related water quality issues	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th IWA International Symposium on Systems Analysis and Computing in Water Quality Management	SEP 18-20, 2000	GHENT, BELGIUM	IWA		mathematical model; sediment transport; water quality; nutrient; verification; validation	LOAD TRANSPORT; PHOSPHORUS; SIMULATION	A mathematical model (Sediment-Transport-Associated Nutrient Dynamics - STAND) has been developed for the study of sediment-associated water quality issues. The model is intended to simulate changes of water composition associated with sediment behavior. It has a 3-level structure. The first level accounts for the hydraulics of open-channel flow. The second computes sediment transport potential and actual rates based on the information provided by the first level. A non-equilibrium approach is used. In the third level, changes of nutrient concentrations along a studied river are computed with the consideration of nutrient transport, adsorption/desorption, and release. In order to calibrate the model, field data were collected from the Oconee River, a major tributary of the Altamaha River in Georgia, USA. Two stations, approximately 17 km distant from each other, were established along the river for the purpose of data collection. Observations of the river's hydraulics, suspended sediment, and water quality (mainly orthophosphate, nitrate, temperature, specific conductivity, oxidation-reduction potential, dissolved oxygen, and pH) were collected at the two stations. Another data set collected along a major tributary of the Yellow River in China was also used for calibration of the model's hydraulics and sediment transport parts. Calibration and validation results are encouraging, which suggests STAND may be a useful tool for the thorough study and understanding of nutrient dynamics associated with sediment behaviour.

Oxygen and nitrogen conversion processes in the River Glatt (Switzerland)	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st World Water Congress of the International-Water-Association (IWA)	JUL 03-07, 2000	PARIS, FRANCE	Int Water Assoc		ammonia; dissolved oxygen; nitrite; nitrification; pH; calcite precipitation; primary production; respiration; rivers; water quality models	AQUATIC SYSTEMS; SIMULATION; TRANSPORT	Various simplifications of the river water quality model no. 1 are applied to data sets from the river Glatt in Switzerland. In a first application, the biomass responsible for nitrogen and oxygen conversion processes is quantified based on known reaeration rates, measured concentrations of ammonia, nitrite and oxygen and assumed growth parameters of algae and bacteria. In a second application, the model is extended to calculate chemical equilibria of inorganic carbon compounds dissolved in the water and daily variations in pH. The influence of partially unknown inflow concentrations and of calcite precipitation on fluctuations in electrical conductivity and pH are discussed. In the last model, the processes of growth of sessile algae and bacteria, detachment of algae, and grazing by benthic organisms are introduced. Due to lack of data for quantifying these processes, this last model application is speculative. Nevertheless, it is interesting because it shows a direction to which river water quality modelling would have to proceed in order to increase its predictive capabilities.

Runoff and deposition of fine-grained sediments into Moreton Bay, followed by resuspension, have been linked with increased turbidity and significant loss of seagrass habitat. Sewage-derived nutrient enrichment, particularly nitrogen (N), has been linked to algal blooms by sewage plume maps. Blooms of a marine cyanobacterium, Lyngbya majuscula, in Moreton Bay have resulted in significant impacts on human health (e.g., contact dermatitis) and ecological health (e.g., seagrass loss), and the availability of dissolved iron from acid sulfate soil runoff has been hypothesised. The impacts of catchment activities resulting in runoff of sediments, nutrients and dissolved iron on the health of the Moreton Bay waterways are addressed. The Study, established by 6 local councils in association with two state departments in 1994, forms a regional component of a national and state program to achieve ecologically sustainable use of the waterways by protecting and enhancing their health, while maintaining economic and social development. The Study framework illustrates a unique integrated approach to water quality management whereby scientific research, community participation and the strategy development were done in parallel with each other. This collaborative effort resulted in a water quality management strategy which focuses on the integration of socioeconomic and ecological values of the waterways. This work has led to significant cost savings in infrastructure by providing a clear focus on initiatives towards achieving healthy waterways. The Study's Stage 2 initiatives form the basis for this paper.	Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia	Abal, EG (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.

The fate of nutrient constituents was surveyed through a questionnaire as well as analytical observation. Taking the major environmental components of the paddy field into account, a mass-balance Row regarding fertilizing constituents such as nitrogen and phosphate was built up and used to estimate the contribution of fertilizer to paddy field water pollution. In the mass-flow analysis, the randomness of fertilizer used by local farmers is incorporated within the conventional input-output model. For the control volume of soil in 0-40 cm below paddy plot surface, the estimated average concentrations in soil were 1.8 ppm for inorganic nitrogen and 1.3 ppm for inorganic phosphate on the assumption of 50% non-excessive probability. From the reasonable consistency of the deduced concentrations of nutrients with observed ones, not only the mass balance of fertilizing substances but also the impacts of fertilizer on the paddy field aquatic environment in Vietnam could be understood. On the results from nutrient mass-balance analysis, it was found that 11.3-13.3 kg N/ha would percolate into the underground aquifer that is linked to surface channel flow in the vicinity of the paddy plots and affect the irrigation water quality. The nutrient portion in the materials harvested as grain and straw occupied 58% of total dosed nitrogen and 75.6% of total supplied phosphorus.

J	Buzas, K				Buzas, K			Use of fuzzy method to estimate river nutrient loads from scarce observation	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th IWA International Symposium on Systems Analysis and Computing in Water Quality Management	SEP 18-20, 2000	GHENT, BELGIUM	IWA		lack of data; water quality; uncertainty; fuzzy method; nutrient load	REGRESSION	Evaluation of data time series in order to get information about water systems is one of the routinely needed tasks. The results are always associated with uncertainties, of which one arises from data scarcity. Traditional methods, such as regression analyses etc. become rapidly useless with decreasing number of data available. A method based on fuzzy set theory was applied to get more reliable information about the system from scarce databases. Monitored daily flow and water quality data of the medium size Zala River in Hungary were considered as elements of fuzzy sets. Fuzzy rules were generated form data pairs (Row, suspended solids concentration, water temperature and phosphorus load as inputs and output. respectively) from which combined rule bases were set up. These rule bases can be considered as a tool of mapping from the input space to the output space using defuzzification procedure. The method is trainable: it can learn from observations. It is demonstrated that the method is capable to generate daily phosphorus loads and annual balance with acceptable accuracy when it is trained only by weekly, biweekly or monthly data pairs. In comparison to other approaches the tool is well suited to utilize better the information content of scarce observations, Furthermore, monitoring costs can be considerably decreased without substantial.

Phytoplanktons may have the biological capabilities to maintain activities of photosynthesis under unfavorable conditions, and these capabilities affect water quality in the bays, In this study, characteristics of primary production were analyzed with a simple box-type ecosystem model. We introduced a concept of efficiency for absorption of sunlight energy to our simulation model of water quality to explain rather high growth rates of phytoplanktons in low sunlight intensity. Through simulation with a box model, we found that the efficiency of primary production in winter is higher than that in summer. It was suggested that the organic pollution comes from dissolved organic carbon (DOC) throughout the year and that the DOC is originated from the primary production of phytoplanktons in biological response of the seasonal change of ambient conditions.

J	Clement, A				Clement, A			Improving uncertain nutrient load estimates for Lake Balaton	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th IWA International Symposium on Systems Analysis and Computing in Water Quality Management	SEP 18-20, 2000	GHENT, BELGIUM	IWA		Lake Balaton; load estimates; monitoring; phosphorus; sampling; uncertainties	TRIBUTARY MASS LOADS	Annual nutrient loads have been estimated for Lake Balaton over three decades. Tributaries may transport about half of the loads into the lake. The contribution of diffuse sources may reach two thirds of the total load. Biweekly/monthly water quality monitoring on small inflows (0.01 m(3)/s-0.3 m(3)/s range) results in a high uncertainty of load estimates. This paper evaluates the degree of uncertainties by using analytical expressions of sampling theory. Load-flow relationships were derived for five streams and annual total phosphorus load was predicted by four load estimation methods. A seasonal regression model, based upon the evaluation of historical set of observed phosphorus loads, appeared best to refine load estimates on small inflows. Correction frequently led to load estimates that exceeded uncorrected loads by a factor of two to three. Since the dynamics of the watercourses determined the errors of load estimates, stratified sampling is needed to decrease the uncertainties.

The Mesa Northwest Water Reclamation Plant has used soil aquifer treatment (SAT) since it began operation in 1990 and the recovery of reclaimed water from the impacted groundwater has been minimal. Groundwater samples obtained represent travel times from several days to greater than five years. Samples were analyzed for a wide range of organic and inorganic constituents. Sulfate was used as a tracer to estimate travel times and define reclaimed water plume movement. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations were reduced to approximately 1 mg/L after 12 to 24 months of soil aquifer treatment with an applied DOC concentration from the NWWRP of 5 to 7 mg/L. The specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) increased during initial soil aquifer treatment on a time-scale of days and then decreased as longer term soil aquifer treatment removed UV absorbing compounds. The trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) was a function of the dissolved organic carbon concentration and ranged from 50 to 65 mu gTHMFP/mgDOC. Analysis of trace organics revealed that the majority of trace organics were removed as DOC was removed with the exception of organic iodine. The majority of nitrogen was applied as nitrate-nitrogen and the reclaimed water plume had lower nitrate-nitrogen concentrations as compared to the background groundwater. The average dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the reclaimed water plume were less than 50% of the drinking water dissolved organic concentrations from which the reclaimed water originated.

Hypolimnetic oxygenators are used to add oxygen to the hypolimnion without significantly disrupting the thermal density structure. The three most common devices are the airlift aerator, the Speece Cone, and the bubble-plume diffuser. A discrete-bubble model based on fundamental principles has previously been shown to hold considerable promise for predicting the performance of airlift aerators and the Speece Cone. In this paper, we have further verified this model by comparing its predictions to a series of pilot-scale experimental measurements and have also demonstrated its ability, under somewhat idealized conditions, to predict the full-scale performance of a bubble-plume diffuser in a stratified reservoir. The potential for the diffused-bubble aeration system to increase oxygen demand, and the rate at which nitrogen builds up during operation and de-gasses following destratification, are also considered.

The model predicts catchment export of diffuse-source soluble and particulate phosphorus, particulate nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen and ammonium-nitrogen. It explicitly includes the nutrient cycling processes of sorption, mineralisation, leaching, fixation, volatilisation, nitrification, denitrification, plant uptake and harvest losses. Soluble nutrients are assumed to be mobilised by surface runoff and by baseflow discharge, while particulate nutrients are associated with surface erosion and the stream sediment transport processes of deposition, re-entrainment, bed degradation and settling. The nutrient model includes 29 optimisable parameters, 11 for phosphorus and 18 for nitrogen, although several of these can be prescribed from measurements or from the literature. The model is applied to two large subcatchments of the 120,000 km(2) Avon River basin in Western Australia and shown to provide good predictions of daily nutrient export in a long-term simulation.

Growth yield was lower, and kinetics were slower, for ethanol compared to lactate. Ethanol was converted into acetate and no significant carbon dioxide production was observed. A mathematical model for growth of sulfate-reducing bacteria on ethanol was developed, and simulations of the growth experiments on ethanol were carried out using the model. The pH variation due to sulfate reduction, and hydrogen sulfide production and removal by nitrogen sparging, were examined. The modeling study is distinct from earlier models for systems using sulfate-reducing bacteria in that it considers growth on ethanol, and analyzes pH variations due to the product-formation reactions.

J	Cioffi, F; Gallerano, F				Cioffi, F; Gallerano, F			Response of Lake Piediluco to the change of hydrodynamic conditions and nutrient load reductions	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						eutrophication; reservoir management; mathematical models; lake; water anoxia	WATER-QUALITY; MODEL; RESERVOIRS; SEDIMENTS; TRANSPORT	In order to verify and quantify the efficacy of management strategies utilised to improve the water quality of Lake Piediluco in the long and short term, a model was developed to represent the unsteady and three-dimensional form of eutrophication processes and water anoxia phenomena. Such a model, taking into account the hydrodynamic mean and turbulent characteristic of the lake, allows the simulation of the spatial and temporal evolution of the concentration fields of the following species: (a) in water, dissolved oxygen, algal organic carbon, particulate organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, orthophosphate, hydrogen sulphide; and (b) in sediments, dissolved oxygen, particulate organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, orthophosphate, adsorbed phosphorus, hydrogen sulphide. This paper presents the simulation results using the following configurations characterised by: different hydraulic regimes of the lake; different external phosphorus loads introduced into the lake from discharges; different initial adsorbed phosphorus concentrations in sediments (obtainable by sediment reclaim) in certain critical areas of the lake.

This includes impacts on nonpoint source (NPS) pollution, which is the leading cause of degraded water quality in the United States. Traditional hydrologic models focus on estimating peak discharges and NPS pollution from high-magnitude, episodic storms and successfully address short-term, local-scale surface water management issues. However, run-off from small, low-frequency storms dominates long-term hydrologic impacts, and existing hydrologic models are usually of limited use in assessing the long-term impacts of land-use change. A long-term hydrologic impact assess ment (L-THIA) model has been developed using the curve number (CN) method. Long-term climatic records are used in combination with soils and land-use information to calculate average annual runoff and NPS pollution at a watershed scale. The model is linked to a geographic information system (GIS) for convenient generation and management of model input and output data, and advanced visualization of model results. The L-THIA/NPS GIS model was applied to the Little Eagle Creek (LEC) watershed near Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. Historical land-use scenarios for 1973, 1984, and 1991 were analyzed to track land-use change in the watershed and to assess impacts on annual average runoff and NPS pollution from the watershed and its five subbasins. For the entire watershed between 1973 and 1991, an 18% increase in urban or impervious areas resulted in an estimated 80% increase in annual average runoff volume and estimated increases of more than 50% in annual average loads for lead, copper, and zinc. Estimated nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) loads decreased by 15% mainly because of loss of agricultural areas. The L-THIA/NPS GIS model is a powerful tool for identifying environmentally sensitive areas in terms of NPS pollution potential and for evaluating alternative land use scenarios for NPS pollution management.

Results suggest that the membrane-bound sterol ergosterol may hold significant promise as an quantitative indicator of fungal response to water quality. We suggest that realistic assessment of the environmental health of natural waters should include a suite of bioassays that could measure the response of living organisms to pollution much more directly than could be predicted by current, indirect monitoring techniques.

J	Hicks, BB; Valigura, RA; Courtright, FB				Hicks, BB; Valigura, RA; Courtright, FB			The role of the atmosphere in coastal ecosystem decline - Future research directions	ESTUARIES			English	Article							DRY DEPOSITION; SURFACE RESISTANCES; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; MODELING SYSTEM; CHESAPEAKE BAY; FLUXES; INPUTS; EUTROPHICATION; PHOSPHORUS	Current assessments of the role of atmospheric deposition in the declining health of aquatic ecosystems indicate that the atmosphere could account for as much as 30% to 40% of total external nitrogen loading to some coastal waters. All such assessments are uncertain and need to be refined. To focus attention on the problem as it affects eastern North American coastal waters, a series of interdisciplinary workshops has been conducted, bringing together scientists and regulators. The series started with a meeting at Mt. Washington, Maryland in 1994, with subsequent meetings at Warrenton, Virginia in 1995, and Raleigh, North Carolina in 1997. Although the workshops considered all nitrogen species, toxic chemicals, trace metals, precipitation chemistry, airborne aerosols, and supporting meteorological investigation, most of the discussion centered around the issue of nitrogen-species deposition. It was concluded that work is urgently needed to establish integrated monitoring stations to provide high quality deposition and watershed retention data within the catchment area, to take spatial and temporal variability into account in atmospheric deposition models, to improve biogeochemical watershed models, especially from the perspective of biological utilization and cycling of deposited materials, to refine emissions inventories and projections on which scenario investigations are based, to enhance all ongoing data collection efforts, especially those related to specific process studies, and to improve spatial resolution by increasing the number of deposition measurement sites. An overall conclusion was that there must be a strong effort to include considerations of air pollution and atmospheric deposition in the water quality regulatory process. It was repeatedly emphasized that any new efforts should build on existing programs rather than risk new starts that compete with ongoing and already productive work.

Zebra mussels removed seston and excreted ammonia and soluble phosphorus in laboratory systems. When normalized with respect to ash-free dry mass (i.e., mug g(-1) AFD mass d(-1)), smaller zebra mussels filtered seston and excreted soluble nutrients at a higher rate than larger zebra mussels. Although overall zebra mussel density is currently very low in Lake Pepin (similar to 150 ind. m(-2)), lakewide chlorophyll filtration rates of similar to7 mg m(-2) d(-1) were equivalent to chlorophyll loading into Lake Pepin via external sources and represented a turnover of 11 days for chlorophyll standing crop in the lake. Lakewide estimates of excretion of soluble phosphorus of similar to3 mg m(-2) d(-1) by zebra mussels in Lake Pepin were comparable to internal phosphorus loading from anoxic sediments in other eutrophic freshwater aquatic systems. Our results suggest that zebra mussels are currently having a modest impact on phytoplankton dynamics and P and N recycling in this system.

J	Steinman, AD; Rosen, BH				Steinman, AD; Rosen, BH			Lotic-lentic linkages associated with Lake Okeechobee, Florida	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						lotic-lentic linkages; Lake Okeechobee; Kissimmee River; south Florida; phosphorus; retention; eutrophication; watershed	PHOSPHORUS; BASIN; FATE	The hydroscape of south Florida has been severely altered over the past 50 y by the construction of canals, drainage ditches, levees, water control structures, and pump stations. This alteration has included, in part, channelization of the Kissimmee River, construction of a dike around Lake Okeechobee, increased ditching of pastures for drainage throughout the lake's watershed, and unnatural connections from Lake Okeechobee to estuaries on the east and west coasts of Florida. Collectively these processes have reduced the retention of flow in the lake's watershed, restricted the opportunity for nutrients to be assimilated on the landscape and, in turn, increased the rate of eutrophication in Lake Okeechobee. This paper reviews the history of these changes and current plans for system restoration. The fate and transport of P is used to illustrate how hydrologic changes have influenced the system's ecology. Improved drainage has been a key factor allowing for the expansion of dairy and beef cattle operations. This, in turn, has increased agricultural runoff to Lake Okeechobee. best management practices have helped reduce total P (TP) loads to the lake. However, TP concentrations in the pelagic region of the lake have not declined, presumably because of internal loading. Watershed and water-quality models are being used to examine the effect of changing land use in the watershed on the lake's condition. A number of large, multiagency projects are being developed in south Florida, with the goal to develop a hydrologic system that meets the multiple needs of agriculture, urban development, and the environment. Aquatic linkages, including lotic-lentic, lotic-lentic-estuarine and lotic-wetland, are critical aspects of these projects.

J	Smit, AB; Stoorvogel, JJ; Wossink, GAA				Smit, AB; Stoorvogel, JJ; Wossink, GAA			A methodology to support the decision to invest in spatially variable nitrogen fertilisation	NETHERLANDS JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE			English	Article						site specific management; sustainability; nitrogen fertiliser; water quality; risk		This paper reports a methodology to define and select basic activities for spatially variable N-management, referred to as management tracks. Their main purpose is to support decision making whether or not to apply variable nitrogen fertilisation. The methodology is based on biophysical simulation of crop growth and nitrogen leaching (WAVE) in combination with economic optimisation (linear programming) and enables a normative environmental-economic evaluation of site specific N-management to be made. The partial results of a case study with an input-intensive and an input-extensive crop (ware potato and winter wheat, respectively) showed that site specific nitrogen management led to positive returns over variable costs compared to uniform N-application, conditional on the validity of the WAVE model used in simulating yield effects. The investments that could be allowed for at maximum were 6,300 Dfl and 13,500 Dfl for winter wheat and ware potato, respectively, assuming application to an area of 100 ha. A pollution tax or a tax on nitrogen designed to internalise pollution costs in agricultural production raises these maximum amounts to 7,600 and 33,700 Dfl, respectively. practical feasibility requires site-specific nitrogen management to be integrated with time specific management since optimal N-tracks were found to be highly weather dependent. Besides, spatially variable management cannot be achieved unless good farming practices (soil testing and crop scouting) are already in place.

J	Smith, LK; Sartoris, JJ; Thullen, JS; Andersen, DC				Smith, LK; Sartoris, JJ; Thullen, JS; Andersen, DC			Investigation of denitrification rates in an ammonia-dominated constructed wastewater-treatment wetland	WETLANDS			English	Article						constructed wetlands; nitrogen removal; denitrification	FRESH-WATER WETLANDS; ESTUARINE SEDIMENTS; NITROGEN; QUALITY; VOLATILIZATION; NITRIFICATION; EFFLUENT; REMOVAL; IMPACTS; PLANT	Denitrification measurements were made under simulated field conditions using sediment cores and water collected from the Hemet/San Jacinto Multipurpose Demonstration Wetland (Riverside County, California, USA). The 9.9 ha constructed wetland is used to both polish ammonia-dominated secondary municipal effluent and provide migratory bird habitat. The wetland was originally constructed as a marsh-pond-marsh system in 1994. Over the period from January through March 1998, measured denitrification rates averaged 20.9 +/- 20.9 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) within the emergent marsh portions of the wetland and 646 +/- 353 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) in open water areas. The mean areal denitrification removal rate for this period was 0.70 kg N ha(-1) d(-1), which accounted for about 8% of the total N removed by the wetland. Internal retention was the main N-removal mechanism. Synoptic water quality surveys indicated that denitrification was limited by a lack of nitrification within the wetland. Between April 1998 and January 1999, the wetland was reconfigured as a hemi-marsh system, having equal areas of interspersed emergent marsh and deep open water. In May 1999, measured denitrification rates averaged 1414 +/- 298 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) within the emergent marsh zones and 682 +/- 218 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) in the open water areas. The mean areal denitrification removal rate was 3.58 kg N ha(-1) d(-1), which accounted for 40% of the total N removed by the wetland. A synoptic water quality survey indicated that nitrification within the wetland had been enhanced by the reduction of emergent macrophyte biomass and the increase in the area of interspersed deep open water. The modifications to the wetland shifted the nitrogen balance from a large internal storage component and a small denitrification component in 1998 to a more denitrifying system in 1999.

J	Spieles, DJ; Mitsch, WJ				Spieles, DJ; Mitsch, WJ			Macroinvertebrate community structure in high- and low-nutrient constructed wetlands	WETLANDS			English	Article						constructed wetland; treatment wetland; macroinvertebrate; environmental gradient	INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES; ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA; WATER-QUALITY; WASTE-WATER; RIVER; STREAM; CLASSIFICATION; ORDINATION; ASSEMBLAGES	We related macroinvertebrate community structure to physical, chemical, and biological gradients in flow-through constructed wetlands receiving secondarily treated domestic wastewater and lower-nutrient river water in Ohio, USA. Macroinvertebrates collected with benthic colonization plates and emergence traps were analyzed with diversity, biotic, and combination indices and related to seventeen parameters of water quality, substrate characteristics, and primary productivity in both wetland systems. A total of 36 and 39 macroinvertebrate taxa were collected in the wastewater wetland and river wetland, respectively. Invertebrate communities nearest to the wastewater source in the wastewater wetland had significantly lower (mean +/- SE) Simpson diversity (0.5 +/- 0.13) and Invertebrate Community Index (ICI) scores (2.6 +/- 0.8) than those of other sampling locations. Sampling locations near the middle and outflow of the wastewater wetland had diversity scores (0.84 +/- 0.01) and ICI scores (4.8 +/- 0.7) statistically similar to sites in the river-fed wetlands. Average diel dissolved oxygen and specific conductivity were the best environmental predictors of invertebrate community metrics; these variables along with chemical oxygen demand and nitrate-nitrogen described nearly 90% of the ICI variation in a four-predictor regression model. Multiple correspondence analysis showed sampling locations loosely grouped by average diel dissolved oxygen, which described 65.4% of the overall variation in the gradient data, and specific conductivity, which described and additional 16.4%. Macroinvertebrate analyses are presented as a valuable means of assessing the ecological status of wetlands used to improve water quality and as an important supplement for traditional chemical analyses.
