J	Singh, KP; Malik, A; Sinha, S				Singh, KP; Malik, A; Sinha, S			Water quality assessment and apportionment of pollution sources of Gomti river (India) using multivariate statistical techniques - a case study	ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Gomti river; water quality management; cluster analysis; factor analysis; principal component analysis; discriminant analysis; source apportionment	PHOSPHORUS	Multivariate statistical techniques, such as cluster analysis (CA), factor analysis (FA), principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant analysis (DA) were applied to the data set on water quality of the Gomti river (India), generated during three years (1999-2001) monitoring at eight different sites for 34 parameters (9792 observations). This study presents usefulness of multivariate statistical techniques for evaluation and interpretation of large complex water quality data sets and apportionment of pollution sources/factors with a view to get better information about the water quality and design of monitoring network for effective management of water resources. Three significant groups, upper catchments (UC), middle catchments (MC) and lower catchments (LC) of sampling sites were obtained through CA on the basis of similarity between them. FA/PCA applied to the data sets pertaining to three catchments, regions of the liver resulted in seven, seven and six latent factors, respectively responsible for the data structure, explaining 74.3, 73.6 and 81.4% of the total variance of the respective data sets. These included the trace metals group (leaching from soil and industrial waste disposal sites), organic pollution group (municipal and industrial effluents), nutrients group (agricultural runoff), alkalinity, hardness, EC and solids (soil leaching and runoff process). DA showed the best results for data reduction and pattern recognition during both temporal and spatial analysis. It rendered five parameters (temperature, total alkalinity, Cl, Na and K) affording more than 94% right assignations in temporal analysis, while 10 parameters (river discharge, pH, BOD, Cl, F, PO4, NH4-N, NO3-N, TKN and Zn) to afford 97% right assignations in spatial analysis of three different regions in the basin. Thus, DA allowed reduction in dimensionality of the large data set, delineating a few indicator parameters responsible for large variations in water quality. Further, receptor modeling through multi-linear regression of the absolute principal component scores (APCS-MLR) provided apportionment of various sources/factors in respective regions contributing to the river pollution. It revealed that soil weathering, leaching and runoff; municipal and industrial wastewater; waste disposal sites leaching were among the major sources/factors responsible for river quality deterioration.

Fertilizer run-off from agricultural land is a major cause of nutrient loading, along with soil erosion, atmospheric deposition, and point pollution from industrial and domestic affluent. The interactions between fertilizer applications, water quality, fish stocks, and yields are modelled in order to predict the effect of changes in the price of fertilizers on the fishery. The fishery model includes a measure of Chl a concentration (a proxy for phytoplankton density). The consequences of changes in Chl a concentration for fish stocks are modelled using Ecopath. We show that fertilizer prices are effective leading indicators of changes in fish biomass and yield. (c) 2005 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This research documents reductions in stream water phosphorus (P) loads resulting from agricultural best management practices (BMPs) implemented as part of an effort to control eutrophication of Cannonsville Reservoir, a drinking water supply for New York City. Dairy farms in the upstate New York reservoir basin were the target of BMPs designed to reduce P losses. A paired watershed study was established on one of these farms in 1993 to evaluate changes in P loading attributable to implementation of BMPs that included manure management, rotational grazing, and improved infrastructure. Intensive stream water monitoring provided data to calculate P loads from the 160-ha farm watershed for all runoff events during a two-year pre-treatment period and a four-year post-treatment period. Statistical control for inter-annual climatic variability was provided by matched P loads from a nearby 86-ha forested watershed, and by several event flow variables measured at the farm. A sophisticated multivariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) provided estimates of both seasonal and overall load reductions. Statistical power and the minimum detectable treatment effect (MDTE) were also calculated. The results demonstrated overall event load reductions of 43% for total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) and 29% for particulate phosphorus (PP). Changes in farm management practices and physical infrastructure clearly produced decreases in event P losses measurable at the small watershed scale.

J	Neumann, T; Schemewski, G				Neumann, T; Schemewski, G			An ecological model evaluation of two nutrient abatement strategies for the Baltic Sea	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Baltic Sea; biogeochemical cycled; modelling; nutrient loads		The reduction of nutrient loads is the overriding strategy in order to abate eutrophication and to improve the ecological state of the Baltic Sea. A 3D-ecosystem model of the Baltic Sea was used to analyze the effects of two different 50% nitrogen and phosphorus load reduction scenarios. The first scenario assumed a proportional 50% load reduction in all riparian countries. The second was based on a cost-effective approach by Gren [I.-M. Gren, 2000. Managing a sea. Cost-Effective Nutrient Reduction To The Baltic Sea. Earthscan Publ., London. Ch. 43-56.] with significant regional differences in load reduction. The simulations suggest that a 50% reduction of nitrogen and phosphorus loads affect predominantly the coastal waters and favours cyanobacteria blooms in the central Baltic Sea. In the cost-effective approach, blooms of the potentially toxic cyanobacteria become even more pronounced in the northern part of the Baltic Proper. The comparison between the two 50% reduction scenarios reveals differences mainly in coastal waters. Near large rivers in the southern Baltic, like the Oder and the Vistula, the cost-effective scenario shows a greater decrease of nutrients and chlorophyll-a concentrations. Altogether the water quality in southern Baltic Sea, especially in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states benefits from a cost-effective approach. However, differences in nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentrations between the scenarios are small. Referring to our simulation results, in a medium-term perspective the measures to abate eutrophication in the Baltic Sea will be not very efficient concerning the central Baltic Sea and might generate undesirable summer blooms of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria. These are a result of nutrient imbalances in the system and may persist for several decades. A more pronounced and early reduction of the phosphorus loads might shorten the period of bloom persistence. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Takeuchi, M; Itahashi, S; Saito, M				Takeuchi, M; Itahashi, S; Saito, M			A water quality analysis system to evaluate the impact of agricultural activities on N outflow in river basins in Japan	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES C-LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article								We have developed a personal-computer-based water quality analysis system for river basins. The system estimates potential N outlow by model and calculates actual N outflow from monitoring data. For the former it uses the potential load factor method to estimate annual nitrogen load from various sources and runoff potential from each area of land in a basin. For the latter it analyzes water quality monitoring data in relation to meteorological data. We used the system to analyze N outflow in basins around Lake Kasumigaura and the Yahagi River in central Honshu, Japan. The land around Lake Kasumigaura is rather flat, and about 25% is periodically flooded for rice and lotus cultivation. The land around the Yahagi River is mountainous, and much less land is flooded. In the Yahagi River basin the actual N outflow agreed closely with the potential. However, the actual N outflow in the basin around Lake Kasumigaura was much less than the potential, suggesting that a large part of the N load is denitrified in flooded soils. This further indicates that a sequence of different land uses including flooded rice fields is an important factor determining N outflow in basins in Japan. On the basis of the above analyses, we incorporated a denitrification model into the system that enables us to estimate N balance in a designated basin; this system may be helpful in the formulation of scenarios of land use and soil management for improving water quality.

It is thus important that SWAT realistically simulate tile flow and pothole landscapes that are common in much of the Corn Belt and Great Lakes states. In this study, SWAT was modified to simulate water table dynamics and linked with a simple tile flow equation. Algorithms were also added to SWAT to include simulation of potholes (closed depressions), surface tile inlets, and aeration stress on plants. Flow interaction between HRUs was introduced in order to simulate pothole water The modified SWAT model (SWAT-M) was evaluated using eight years of measured flow data from Walnut Creek watershed (WCW), an intensively tile-drained watershed in central Iowa. The model was calibrated during the period of 1992 to 1995 and validated during the period of 1996 to 1999. In addition, comparisons between the enhanced version (SWAT-M) and older version (SWAT2000) of SWAT were conducted. For assessing overall performance of the SWAT models, predictions were compared to data measured at stream sites approximately at the midpoint of the watershed (site 310) and at the outlet (site 330). Nash-Sutcliffe E values for the simulated monthly flows during the calibration/validation periods were 0.88/0.82 and 0.84/0.72 at sites 310 and 330, respectively. The relative mean errors (RME) of the simulated monthly flows during the calibration/validation periods were -2%/ -1% and -18% / 10%, respectively, for the same two sites. These statistical values indicate that SWAT-M estimated both pattern and amount of the monthly flows reasonably well for the large flat landscape of WCW containing tile drains and potholes. SWAT-M needs to improve in its daily prediction because of its lower E values (-0.11 to 0.55), compared to the monthly results. In applying the model to a third site (site 210) that was predominantly influenced by tile drainage, it was concluded that the pattern and amount of simulated monthly subsurface flows (E values of 0.61 and 0.70 and RME values of 10% and -9% for the calibration and validation periods, respectively) were relatively close to the measured values. Nevertheless, SWAT-M simulation of daily subsurface flows was less accurate than monthly results. In general, the pattern and amount of monthly flow and subsurface tile drainage predicted by SWAT-M has been greatly improved as compared to SWAT2000.

J	Hakanson, L; Mikrenska, M; Petrov, K; Foster, I				Hakanson, L; Mikrenska, M; Petrov, K; Foster, I			Suspended particulate matter (SPM) in rivers: empirical data and models	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						suspended particulate matter; rivers; empirical data; empirical models; catchment area	SURFACE-WATER CHEMISTRY; CHLOROPHYLL; GEOLOGY	This work uses three data-bases to derive the first (as far as we know) operational empirical model to predict concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in rivers. SPM is a variable of fundamental importance in aquatic sciences. This empirical model is meant to be used as a sub-model in models where the main aim is to predict concentrations of radionuclides, nutrients or metals in river water and biota. It is well known that SPM influences the transport of most types of pollutants in most systems and governs both primary phytoplankton and bacterioplankton production and hence also secondary production (e.g., of zooplankton and fish). An important feature of the requested model is that all variables needed to run the model should be readily accessible from standard monitoring programmes and/or maps. The UK data-base includes data on SPM, water discharge (Q) and many water quality variables for 79 river sites, and it covers a wide range in these variables and includes data from several years. This data-base has been used to address the within-site variability of SPM, and hence also the predictive power of the developed model for SPM. The characteristic coefficient of variation (CV = S.D./MV; S.D. = standard deviation; MV = mean value) for SPM in these rivers sites is very high indeed, 1.71. The factors influencing the variability of characteristic (median) SPM-values among sites in different rivers have been quantified and ranked using the other two data-bases, a European data-base including data on SPM, water discharge, latitude, longitude, continentality, and altitude, and a Swedish data-base, which includes a comprehensive set of data on catchment-area characteristics. The new empirical model is derived from the two latter data-bases. The measured river-characteristic SPM-values can be predicted from the following variables: (1) latitude (as a measure of mean temperature, primary production and weathering), (2) mean water discharge, (3) continentality (SPM increases with increased continentality), and from a simple system accounting for (4) the percentage of bare rocks, the relief of the catchment, the percentage of upstream lakes and the forest cover of the catchment area. The latter factors are categorised into three classes (1, 2 and 3) having little, average, or relatively large influences on the transport of suspended particulate matter from land to water. The presented model does not include any climatological variables or factors influencing daily to seasonal variations in SPM. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wudtisin, W; Boyd, CE				Wudtisin, W; Boyd, CE			Determination of the phosphorus fertilization rate for bluegill ponds using regression analysis	AQUACULTURE RESEARCH			English	Article						sportfish ponds; bluegill; phosphorus fertilization; water quality	NITROGEN	Pond fertilization studies usually are restricted by availability of ponds forcing researchers to limit treatments to maintain adequate replicates for statistical analysis. Data from a wide range of fertilizer rates applied over a single season in un-replicated ponds were treated using regression analysis to establish the optimum phosphorus application rate for bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) ponds. The response to phosphorus fertilization conformed to a saturation model (R-2=0.92). Bluegill production increased with greater fertilization rate up to 3 kg P2O5 ha(-1), but production was similar (501-558 kg ha(-1)) at rates of 3-7 kg P2O5 ha(-1). The observation that 3 kg P2O5 ha(-1) per application was adequate phosphorus fertilization for bluegill ponds with sufficient nitrogen agrees closely with the usual recommendation of 4 kg P2O5 ha(-1) per application. Results of this research also revealed that nutrient assessment in bluegill ponds can be based on total nitrogen and total phosphorus analyses, and Secchi disk visibility may be used as an index of plankton abundance.

These forest characteristics in turn influence the quality and quantity of public goods and services a forest provides, such as space for recreation, clean water, and air purification. In this paper, we use a forest growth simulator and a geographical information system (GIS) to assess the effects of three silvicultural strategies on recreational suitability, water purification potential and air purification potential in a peri-urban catchment in Switzerland. For each of the three services, an index was developed to capture the suitability of a stand for providing the service. The growth simulator SILVA 2.2 was used to project forest development over 50 years under the three silvicultural strategies BU 'business as usual' (small patch cuts, Swiss selection system), NI 'no intervention', and MA 'mass production' (clearcuts and plantations of Picea abies). In all three strategies, road maintenance continued. The outputs of SILVA 2.2 were transferred into the GIS. Indices for the three services were calculated and aggregated over the study area. The development of the indices for all three services mainly reflected the changes in developmental stages and in the spatial patch distribution as a result of silvicultural interventions. No single strategy resulted in maximum values for all three indices. Recreational suitability was highest with the BU strategy and lowest with the MA strategy. The latter was due to the conversion of broad-leaved forests into plantations. Water purification potential was captured as nitrogen (N) storage in tree biomass and N removal by timber harvesting. In these nearly N-saturated forest ecosystems, the water purification potential was generally highest with the BU strategy, and lowest with the NI strategy. The air purification potential was higher with the NI than with the BU strategy. With the MA strategy, it rapidly decreased at the beginning, but increased after 30 years and surpassed the other strategies as soon as most of the plantations had reached the pole stage. The NI and MA strategies presented are clearly extreme strategies, which could not realistically be applied to the whole catchment as so many different owners are involved. However, the results of our study can be used to show to what extent management activities affect goods and services. We propose using such tools more often in forest planning processes to support the development of land-use visions and policies on a regional scale. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Mitsch, WJ; Day, JW; Zhang, L; Lane, RR				Mitsch, WJ; Day, JW; Zhang, L; Lane, RR			Nitrate-nitrogen retention in wetlands in the Mississippi river basin	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Wetlands Invitational Workshop	MAY 15-16, 2003	Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH		Ohio State Univ	wetland; Mississippi River Basin; restoration; Olentangy River Wetland Research Park	GULF-OF-MEXICO; WATER-QUALITY; REDUCING NITROGEN; HYPOXIA	Nitrate-nitrogen retention as a result of river water diversions is compared in experimental wetland basins in Ohio for 18 wetland-years (9 years x 2 wetland basins) and a large wetland complex in Louisiana (I wetland basin x 4 years). The Ohio wetlands had an average nitrate-nitrogen retention of 39 g-N m(-2) year(-1), while the Louisiana wetland had a slightly higher retention of 46 g-N m(-2) year(-1) for a similar loading rate area. When annual nitrate retention data from these sites are combined with 26 additional wetland-years of data from other wetland sites in the Basin Mississippi River (Ohio, Illinois, and Louisiana), a robust regression model of nitrate retention versus nitrate loading is developed. The model provides an estimate of 22,000 km(2) of wetland creation and restoration needed in the Mississippi River Basin to remove 40% of the nitrogen estimated to discharge into the Gulf of Mexico from the river basin. This estimated wetland restoration is 65 times the published net gain of wetlands in the entire USA over the past 10 years as enforced by the Clean Water Act and is four times the cumulative total of the USDA Welland Reserve Program wetland protection and restoration activity for the entire USA.

Alternative fertilisers and management to decrease incidental phosphorus loss	ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						overland flow; eutrophication; soil; incidental transfer	OVERLAND-FLOW	Incidental phosphorus loss is a concern for surface water quality. Here we showed that the risk of incidental P loss can be minimised, even from highly soluble superphosphate fertiliser, by timing application when overland flow is unlikely. Moreover, we demonstrated that the risk of incidental P loss can be estimated from water solubility, decreasing the need for expensive field trials. As such, we suggest that slowly available fertilisers such as reactive phosphate rock or serpentine super could be used in situations where incidental losses need to be decreased and conditions are suitable e.g., soil pH less than 6 and rainfall greater than 800 mm for reactive phosphate rock.

Extremely high concentrations of CDOM in this river present special problems for the measurement of inherent optical properties, such as the presence of very fine particulate matter that passes through most glass fiber filters. Empirical relationships are presented for estimating true dissolved absorption at very high CDOM concentrations. Specific-absorption and -scattering coefficients of suspended particulate matter varied widely, but appeared to decline steadily with salinity at salinities above 5, consistent with increasing influence of large-sized, unconsolidated mineral particulates with increasing tidal energy near the estuary mouth. Relationships are given for prediction of inherent optical properties from water quality concentrations for use in radiative transfer modeling, and changes in water quality measurements are recommended that can avoid the need for empirical corrections.

The estuary was divided into boxes with two vertical layers and was driven by salinity and freshwater discharge data acquired during cruises in the spring, summer and fall of 1995. Model runs yielded estimates of the vertical non-advective exchange coefficients for each box, which were then used to establish balance equations for the microbial variables. Such equations allowed calculation of horizontal and vertical fluxes of phytoplankton, bacteria and viruses as well as their respective rates of production or consumption. Bacterial numbers peaked at intermediate salinities (12-18) whereas freshwater phytoplankton biomass decreased linearly with salinity, and estuarine communities increased at intermediate salinities. Virus-like particles had a similar behavior. The lower layer in the Douro Estuary was always a sink for phytoplankton, bacteria and viruses, giving way to negative or close to zero microbial fluxes. In the upper layer of the lower estuary, close to the coastal end where nutrients are abundant, water transparency was high, bacterial generation times were shorter and microbial fluxes were always positive, i.e. net growth occurred. The freshwater end of the estuary was a source of phytoplankton, irrespective of season, whereas it was a source of bacteria and viruses only in summer and spring, respectively. It is suggested that salinity acts as a boundary between different microbial communities, especially on a vertical scale. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Los Molinos reservoir represents an essential source of supply for the capital city (with 1.5 million inhabitants). The use of the water body is multiple, including not only the supply of water for human consumption, but also production of electric power, flood control, irrigation, recreation and touristic activities, with some small settlements existing within the boundaries of the lake. Since three decades back, a deterioration of the water quality has been observed, as well as eutrophication signs and periodic algal blooms. Within the scope of an interdisciplinary and interinstitutional research project, a seasonal-and currently monthly-monitoring was started in 1999. In this paper, main sources of phosphorus are identified, as well as their contribution to the total load of the reservoir by means of using the Flux modeling software and indirect calculations. Additionally, hydrodynamic and quality models (Dysrem-Caedym) are also applied, calibrated with field data. Finally, satellite images (Landsat) are used as a tool to develop models of space distribution of quality parameters (chlorophyll-a) in a reflectance function. The combination of remote sensing methods and numerical simulation for the behavior of the system associated to field works will allow to generate new bases for water resources planning and administration, especially on semi-arid regions, such as the Los Molinos reservoir case.

Surface salinity, nitrogen (N-NO3, N-NO2), and phosphorus (PO4) were used in the model to obtain the hydraulic balance, water residence tune, and nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes. Results showed that residual volume was mainly influenced by evaporation. Rainfall and runoff increased the mixed volume and reduced water residence time. Pre-rainfall hydraulic balance conditions were reestablished about 10 days after a rainstorm. Rainwater inputs also modified the quality of the coastal lagoon: the pre-rainfall scenario showed that more nitrogen is consumed than produced, and there is a phosphorus sufficiency. A rain disturbance induces a nitrogen and phosphorus increase. Eleven days after a rainstorm, nitrogen and phosphorus levels did not return to the pre-rainfall scenario. Rain disturbances in arid zone coastal lagoons modify their water quality and exchange with the adjacent ocean; some management strategies are suggested. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study examined nutrient and beta(17)-estradiol concentrations in runoff from small plots where six poultry litters were applied at a rate of about 67 kg/ha of total phosphorus (TP). The six poultry litter treatments included pelleted compost, pelleted litter, raw litter, alum (treated) litter, pelleted alum litter, and normal litter (no alum). Four replicates of the six poultry litter treatments and a control (plots without poultry litter application) were used in this study. Rainfall simulations at intensity of 50 mm/hr were conducted immediately following poultry litter application to the plots and again 30 days later. Composite runoff samples were analyzed for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), ammonia (NH4), nitrate (NO3), TP, total nitrogen (TN) and beta(17)-estradiol concentrations. In general, poultry litter applications increased nutrient and beta(17)-estradiol concentrations in runoff water. Ammonia and P concentrations in runoff water from the first simulation were correlated to application rates of water extractable NH4 (R-2 = 0.70) and P (R-2 = 0.68) in the manure. Results suggest that alum applications to poultry litter in houses inbetween flocks is an effective best management practice for reducing phosphorus (P) and beta(17)-estradiol concentrations in runoff and that pelleted poultry litters may increase the potential for P and beta(17)-estradiol loss in runoff water. Inferences regarding pelleted poultry litters should be viewed cautiously, because the environmental consequence of pelleting poultry litters needs additional investigation.

This study was designed to investigate the spatial relationships of low, medium, and high NO3-N leaching losses clusters with soil and landscape attributes using cluster and discriminant analysis and the map overlay capability of a geographical information system (GIS). Field measured data of a six-year (1993 through 1998) study on NO3-N leaching losses from 36 experimental fields at the Iowa State University's northeastern research center near Nashua, Iowa, were normalized on an annual basis to compare over the years. The cluster analysis resulted in the formation of three clusters based on the satisfactory evaluation criteria of pseudo-F statistic, cubic clustering criterion, and R-2 values. The discriminant analysis, carried out on the basis of clusters, identified elevation and subsurface drainage as the factors that contributed significantly (p < 0.01) in discriminating among these clusters. The verification of discriminant functions developed on these factors predicted the cluster membership for all the groups with an overall accuracy of 86 percent. The map overlay analyses of GIS showed that spatial occurrence of the clusters transporting high NO3-N leaching losses was affected by the interaction of soil type and elevation levels.

This usage is based on misconceptions about the meaning of the runoff value that the method computes, which is a likely fundamental cause of uncertainty in subsequent erosion and pollutant loading predictions dependent on this value. As a result, there are some major limitations on the conclusions and decisions about the effects of management practices on water quality that can be supported with current nonpoint source water quality models. They also cannot supply the detailed quantitative and spatial information needed to address emerging issues. A key prerequisite for improving model predictions is to improve the hydrologic algorithms contained within them. The use of the curve number method is still appropriate for flood hydrograph engineering applications, but more physically based algorithms that simulate all streamflow generating processes are needed for nonpoint source water quality modeling. Spatially distributed hydrologic modeling has tremendous potential in achieving this goal.

J	Greve, TM; Krause-Jensen, D				Greve, TM; Krause-Jensen, D			Predictive modelling of eelgrass (Zostera marina) depth limits	MARINE BIOLOGY			English	Article							DANISH COASTAL WATERS; SUBMERGED AQUATIC VEGETATION; HABITAT REQUIREMENTS; SEED DISPERSAL; PATCH DYNAMICS; LIGHT; GROWTH; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; PHYTOPLANKTON; TRANSPARENCY	Empirical models relating secchi depths to maximum depth limits of eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) can describe basic differences in depth limits between areas or time periods exhibiting large differences in secchi depth. However, these models cannot predict the precise depth limit at a particular site at any specific time. In this study we aim to improve the ability of regression models to predict maximum depth limits by: ( 1) assuming that eelgrass depth limits respond to changes in secchi depth with a temporal delay of 1 2 years, ( 2) including other water-quality variables in addition to secchi depth, and ( 3) taking into account that factors regulating depth limits may vary between years and between sites. We were not able to improve the models by introducing a systematic delay in the response of depth limits to changes in secchi depths. The reason for this failure is likely to have been the systematic nature of our approach, since some sites responded with a delay, while others did not. The explanatory power of the models increased when additional water-quality variables were added in a multiple regression model. Where secchi depth alone explained 58% of the variations in depth limits, addition of winter [NH4+] and maximum water depth as independent variables increased the explanatory power to 71%. These models applied to data from one specific year, but when data from several years ( 1989 - 1998) were included, only 35% of the variation in depth limits could be explained by the three factors. More detailed analyses showed that the regulation of eelgrass depth limits varied considerably between years and between sites, and the models were further improved by taking this information into account. Our results confirmed previous studies by showing light to be the most important parameter in the regulation of eelgrass depth limits, but also revealed a complexity in the regulation of depth limits not expressed in earlier studies. Limited colonisation potentials may delay the response to improved light conditions, and hypoxia/ anoxia and indirect effects of nutrients may prevent eelgrass from attaining the depth limit that light levels would allow. The power to predict depth limits on the basis of secchi depths can therefore be improved by taking site-specific information on eelgrass growth conditions into account.

Both the river and the reservoir are under the threat of several domestic and industrial point sources and land-based diffuse pollution. The river water quality is very poor with high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds at the entrance to Porsuk Reservoir. The reservoir shows symptoms of a hypertrophic lake. The expected responses of the whole river and reservoir system under different pollution control scenarios were estimated to develop plausible water quality management strategies. The adopted scenarios assumed different levels of treatment for the major domestic point sources that include conventional treatment and tertiary treatment. The contemporary Turkish Allowable Discharge Limits (ADLs) and the best available technology choices were the investigated treatment options for the major industries. The expected improvements of water quality characteristics under the management scenario options have been estimated by means of mathematical models. The model choices were the QUAL2E for the river and BATHTUB for the reservoir. Recommendations for different levels of treatment were derived in order to improve the water quality both within the river and in the reservoir.

J	Palmer, CG; Rossouw, N; Muller, WJ; Scherman, PA				Palmer, CG; Rossouw, N; Muller, WJ; Scherman, PA			The development of water quality methods within ecological Reserve assessments, and links to environmental flows	WATER SA			English	Article						environmental water quality; environmental flow requirements; ecological Reserve; water resource management		In the South African National Water Act (NWA, No 36 of 1998), the ecological Reserve is defined as the quality and quantity of water required to ensure appropriate protection of water resources, so as to secure ecologically sustainable development and use. Aquatic ecosystems are recognised as the core location of water resources, and although considerable progress has been made in developing methods for quantifying environmental flow requirements, this paper describes and discusses the first agreed method for quantifying environmental water quality requirements in an ecological Reserve assessment. Integration of flow and water quality is emphasised, and is based on the philosophy that environmental flows should be motivated to provide ecologically important flow-related habitat, or geomorphological function, but should not be motivated to solve water quality problems by dilution. Water quality is multivariate, and not all variables can be considered in an ecological Reserve assessment, but core water quality variables include: system variables (salts, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, temperature), nutrients (phosphate, nitrite, nitrate) and toxic substances (those listed in the South African Water Quality Guidelines for Aquatic Ecosystems, including toxic metal ions, toxic organic substances, and/or substances from a chemical inventory of an effluent or discharge). In addition, biological indicator data (e.g. SASS data), chlorophyll-a (e.g. phytoplankton and periphyton data) and toxicity test data may be used. For each variable, a concentration range or response is linked to a class within a water resource, classification system, where classes range from minimally to severely modified. There are five main stages in the environmental water,quality method: Initiate study and determine scope of assessment. Delineate water quality sub-units. Select sites and collect data and information. Determine, benchmarks, including generic boundary values (literature-based concentrations related to classes); the unimpacted, natural or reference condition; the present ecological state; and the contribution of water quality to the overall ecosystem importance and sensitivity. Provide quantified and qualitative water quality objectives for each ecosystem health class, and each variable in each resource unit. These steps are integrated with environmental flow assessment procedures. After environmental flows have been recommended to achieve a selected level of protection (class), flow-concentration relationships are modelled, and the likely water quality consequences of modified flows are provided to resource managers, who then decide on whether to allocate water for dilution and/or to address the pollution problem directly using source controls.

These three components also control the spectral reflectance characteristics of waterbodies. This Letter uses in situ reflectance measurements of water in Lake Balaton on three different occasions, supplemented by controlled tank experiments, to characterize the influences of suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) and Chl alpha on spectral reflectance and simulated Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) response. The results confirm that Chl alpha cannot be estimated directly from Landsat reflectance data in waters characterized by heterogeneous SSC. However, principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated that spectrally unique end-members can be identified, indicating that a spectral linear mixture modelling approach combined with a multivariate regression analysis may be used to provide estimates of Chl alpha concentrations, which would be independent of SSC.

J	Harris, G; Heathwaite, AL				Harris, G; Heathwaite, AL			Inadmissible evidence: knowledge and prediction in land and riverscapes	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						fractal; catchments; streams; nutrients	WATER-QUALITY; INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY; DOUBLE PARADOX; MODEL; UNCERTAINTY; NITROGEN; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; BIOGEOCHEMISTRY; BIODIVERSITY	Analyses of daily water quality data from two streams draining a pair of small coastal catchments in South Devon, England reveal that what conventionally would be thought to show random noise, has a discernable structure and is clear evidence of process. Catchment and aquatic systems are non-equilibrium systems and climate drivers cause fluctuations in water quality both in terms of the concentrations of individual parameters and in the correlations between parameters. The data reveal non-linear coupling at small scales and show evidence of fractal properties both of which may be evidence of self-organised phenomena at small scales in catchments and streams. These data show that: (a) water quality and catchment nutrient export data may be strongly aliased, and (b) there is a fundamental degree of indeterminacy underlying the data we can collect and the knowledge we can generate from the data. New techniques of data based modelling that use the data itself to define more parsimonious predictive models are needed because such an approach recognises the partial nature of our knowledge and requires adequate monitoring and adaptive management programs.

Water quality determinand relationships with boron (B) are presented to provide information that can be used, with stream water quality information, to assess the relative inputs of treated sewage effluent pollutants to streams in rural areas. The approach is based on three points: (1) information on sewage effluent and agricultural pollution is of concern in relation to the management of UK lowland river systems in rural environments; (2) the lack of detailed information on sewage runoff chemistry and flow means that direct assessment of sewage effluent pollution to surface waters cannot be gauged; (3) B provides a clear chemically conservative marker of sewage sources in surface and ground waters. Three types of relationship to B were observed. Firstly, determinands such as Na, Cl, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and NO3 showed a positive linear relationship with B and there is a near zero intercept; these components are essentially derived from sewage sources. Secondly, Mg and SO4 show linear relationships with B, but there is a non-zero intercept; these components have both a sewage component and a background component linked to water supplies from surface and groundwater sources. Thirdly, there are deteriminands that show no relationship with boron. In this study, an erratic pattern was observed for ammonium. This probably reflects the variable removal of this pollutant from sewage sources. Near constant concentrations of components such as Ca and alkalinity, which come from the background aquifer sources, were also found. SRP and B relationships for rivers in the upper Thames Basin showed the potential importance of (a) removal processes in the stream/groundwater for SRP derived from STW effluent inputs and (b) tertiary P stripping at the STWs on river water SRP levels. The importance of agricultural sources of SRP is questioned. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Information on origin and pathways of phosphorus is needed in order to improve water quality. P input by the different pathways and P retention were estimated for a small agricultural catchment area in NE Germany. Resulting P export is given for a 10-year period. Concentrations of phosphorus in surface runoff, tile drains, ditches and groundwater varied strongly from 15 to > 500 mu g L-1 P. A wide range of interannual variability of P concentration in tile drainage was also found. P retention in selected reaches was found to differ from 0.8-4.3 and 10.8-21.6 g m(-2) a(-1) depending on period and method applied. This was mainly caused by uptake (benthic algae, macrophytes), sorption onto Fe(III) hydroxides, and sedimentation of particulate matter in dead zones and on flood plains. Consequently, annual P loads also varied over a wide range. Infrequent storm water events strongly influenced the P loss from the catchment, but the dominating pathway was subsurface flow due to tile drainage. Total P loss varied from 0.04 to 0.25 kg ha(-1) a(-1) which is less than in more maritime regions with less permeable soils. The annual flow-weighted P export was between 0.82 and 2.16 g mm(-1) ha(-1). The dependence of P export on tile drainage of the basin is clearly demonstrated by a comparison with a mainly forested catchment. The information makes it possible to assess the variability of input, retention and output for small agricultural catchments in the glacial northeastern landscape. The results provide a base to develop restoration strategies to reduce diffuse pollution. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Their impacts on eutrophication and nutrient dynamics in the river were analyzed through a review of the public administration's historical data and the interpretation of two sampling profiles in September 02 (low flows season) and April 03 (high flows season). A marked seasonality was found in nutrient concentrations, nutrient loads and eutrophication indicators (O-2, Turbidity), appearing symptoms of eutrophication during the summer related to both NPS and PS Nutrient loads within the study area. Agricultural NPS account for 64% of NO3 loads generated within the study area while urban and industrial PS are responsible of 88% PO4-P and 71% COD loads. Biological reactions within the river ecosystem (including denitrification in the most eutrophic branches) were found to be a key factor in nutrient content and dynamics. Improvements in urban and industrial wastewater treatment facilities, land use planning and restoration of river-side wetlands, seem to be adequate policies for the improvement of the nutrient water quality in the studied sector of the Ebro River.

J	Littlewood, IG; Marsh, TJ				Littlewood, IG; Marsh, TJ			Annual freshwater river mass loads from Great Britain, 1975-1994: estimation algorithm, database and monitoring network issues	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						river mass loads; fluxes; estimation algorithm; north sea; OSPAR	QUALITY DATABASES; UK; LAND; STRATEGIES; CATCHMENT; MODEL; FLOW	The paper presents 20-year time series (1975-1994) of annual mass loads discharged from the aggregated freshwater-monitored area of Great Britain for suspended solids, total nitrogen, orthophosphate and zinc. Corresponding time series are also given for regional groups of catchments draining towards five sea-areas recognised for monitoring UK fluvial inputs to the North-East Atlantic. A mass load computational scheme that effectively merges the national river flow and water quality databases is used to derive the mass flow time series, and their utility is considered within the context of strategic information needs and the capabilities of current national monitoring programmes. While the aggregated annual suspended solids loads presented in the paper are often severe underestimates of the actual load, because infrequent sampling tends to miss high concentrations at high flows, the loads for total nitrogen and orthophosphate, which exhibit less variability in concentration than suspended solids, are of a more acceptable quality. Mass loads for zinc, and other determinands often recorded as 'less than a limit of detection' (< LOD), can be very uncertain. Bearing in mind the uncertainties involved, the time series presented are assessed for the presence or absence of trends. Not surprisingly, annual loads exhibit correlation with annual runoff. Except for zinc, however, there is no obvious evidence for temporal patterns in the time series that are not associated with variations in annual runoff. Zinc loadings have decreased as a result of improved environmental management in industrialized catchments. Discussion of the sources of uncertainty in regional mass flows is followed by some general recommendations related to capitalising most effectively on available mass flow time series.

Agriculture comprises the largest single source of nutrients into surface waters in Finland. Today, the main goal of water protection policy is controlling agricultural nutrient losses. In 1998, the Finnish Council of State issued a Decision-in-Principle on the water protection targets to 2005. By the year 2005, P and N loads from field cultivation should be reduced by 50% from the estimated loads at the beginning of the 1990s. The Finnish Agri-Environmental Programme (FAEP) forms the most important policy measure. It was implemented when Finland joined the European Union in 1995. The implementation of the Water Framework Directive will be reflected in the future environmental support scheme. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the water protection measures have decreased P and N losses in two small, intensively monitored agricultural catchments and in four coastal river basins in southern Finland. Due to high annual variability in observed losses, long-term monitoring data (years 1981-2000) of water quality were used in the analysis. Five year mean values of annual total P and total N loads were calculated for each of the catchments. The results showed that little or no reduction of loads was achieved during the first period (years 1995-1999) of the FAEP in the studied catchments. The results suggest that water protection measures for agricultural production need to be further intensified if the eutrophication tendency of Finnish lakes, rivers and coastal waters is soon to be reversed. The delayed response of water quality must be taken into account in the implementation of the Water Framework Directive. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

International Association for Hydrological Sciences Publication 285, 19], which is applied throughout England and Wales, some assessment of the implications of using input data derived at different scales must be made. This work is further driven by practical issues such as licensing costs and data availability, which mean that not all data are readily accessible for all end users. This paper represents a first step towards quantifying the 'value-added' to model predictions by using input data derived at three different scales: 50 X 50 m, I X I km and 5 X 5 km. Model runs using PIT were carried out against observed phosphorus water quality data from the River Start and River Gara, which are the main sub-catchments of Slapton Ley, a grade 1 National Nature Reserve in southwest England. Model runs for the main 46 km(2) Slapton catchment were also undertaken. The results show that some improvement in the ability of the model to capture the observed water quality behaviour may be made by using higher resolution DEM data, though these improvements may be outweighed by the extra data processing and computational time. Conversely, model runs driven by the 5 km data demonstrate consistent under-prediction for all three test catchments, which is perhaps not surprising given the greater degree of averaging underlying datasets at this scale. Results from the 1 km datasets provide the best agreement with observed water quality data, and appear to provide the 'best available' means of parameterising PIT at the national scale.

J	Kyllmar, K; Martensson, K; Johnsson, H				Kyllmar, K; Martensson, K; Johnsson, H			Model-based coefficient method for calculation of N leaching from agricultural fields applied to small catchments and the effects of leaching reducing measures	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						process-based model; coefficient method; nitrogen leaching; arable field; catchment; SOILNDB	NITROGEN; LOSSES	A method to calculate N leaching from arable fields using model-calculated N leaching coefficients (NLCs) was developed. Using the process-based modelling system SOILNDB, leaching of N was simulated for four leaching regions in southern Sweden with 20-year climate series and a large number of randomised crop sequences based on regional agricultural statistics. To obtain N leaching coefficients, mean values of annual N leaching were calculated for each combination of main crop, following crop and fertilisation regime for each leaching region and soil type. The field-NLC method developed could be useful for following up water quality goals in e.g. small monitoring catchments, since it allows normal leaching from actual crop rotations and fertilisation to be determined regardless of the weather. The method was tested using field data from nine small intensively monitored agricultural catchments. The agreement between calculated field N leaching and measured N transport in catchment stream outlets, 19-47 and 8-38 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively, was satisfactory in most catchments when contributions from land uses other than arable land and uncertainties in groundwater flows were considered. The possibitity of calculating effects of crop combinations (crop and following crop) is of considerable value since changes in crop rotation constitute a large potential for reducing N leaching. When the effect of a number of potential measures to reduce N leaching (i.e. applying manure in spring instead of autumn; postponing ploughing-in of ley and green fallow in autumn; undersowing a catch crop in cereals and oilseeds; and increasing the area of catch crops by substituting winter cereals and winter oilseeds with corresponding spring crops) was calculated for the arable fields in the catchments using field-NLCs, N leaching was reduced by between 34 and 54% for the separate catchments when the best possible effect on the entire potential area was assumed.

J	Andersen, HE; Kronvang, B; Larsen, SE				Andersen, HE; Kronvang, B; Larsen, SE			Development, validation and application of Danish empirical phosphorus models	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						phosphorus; diffuse losses; empirical models; validation; uncertainty assessment	LAND-USE; WATER-QUALITY; MANAGEMENT; STREAMS; EXPORT; NITROGEN; LOSSES; IMPACT	Phosphorus (P) is the limiting nutrient for algae growth in most Danish lakes and coastal waters. Discharge of P from point sources has been reduced greatly, however, no trend in diffuse P loss has been detected. In spite of the overall reduction in P discharge, the ecological condition of most lakes and coastal waters does not comply with the objectives set by regional authorities. Thus, in order to achieve 'good ecological status' of surface waters, as required by the EU Water Framework Directive, there is a future need to reduce diffuse P loss. Consequently, water district managers will need tools for assessing diffuse P losses at the catchment scale. They will also need tools to help them select for each specific catchment the appropriate measures to reduce P losses. We suggest that empirical phosphorus models can be an important part of such a tool. A number of international empirical phosphorus models are reviewed. The development, validation and application of six Danish empirical phosphor-us models for total phosphorus (TP), particulate phosphor-us (PP) and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) is described as a case study. Manageable parameters relating to agricultural practices are generally absent in the international models reviewed. In the Danish models such parameters play a relatively minor role compared to non-manageable parameters like soil type and hydrology. The importance of validating empirical models and of uncertainty assessments on model predictions is stressed. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This is compounded in southern and central UK by increasing pressures on water resources, which may be further enhanced by the potential effects of climate change. The EU Water Framework Directive requires an integrated approach to water resources management at the catchment scale and highlights the need for modelling tools that can distinguish relative contributions from multiple nutrient sources and are consistent with the information content of the available data. Two such models are introduced and evaluated within a stochastic framework using daily flow and total phosphorus concentrations recorded in a clay catchment typical of many areas of the lowland UK. Both models disaggregate empirical annual load estimates, derived from land use data, as a function of surface/near surface runoff, generated using a simple conceptual rainfall-runoff model. Estimates of the daily load from agricultural land, together with those from baseflow and point sources, feed into an in-stream routing algorithm. The first model assumes constant concentrations in runoff via surface/near surface pathways and incorporates an additional P store in the river-bed sediments, depleted above a critical discharge, to explicitly simulate resuspension. The second model, which is simpler, simulates P concentrations as a function of surface/near surface runoff, thus emphasising the influence of non-point source loads during flow peaks and mixing of baseflow and point sources during low flows. The temporal consistency of parameter estimates and thus the suitability of each approach is assessed dynamically following a new approach based on Monte-Carlo analysis. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In order to better understand the relationships between these processes and human activity in the Seine watershed, two models have been used in connection: A model describing nutrient (N, P, Si) transfer processes at the scale of the whole Seine Basin (RIVERSTRAHLER [Billen, G., Gamier, J., Ficht, A., Cun, C., 2001. Modelling the response of water quality in the Seine River Estuary in response to human activity in the watershed over the last 50 years. Estuaries 24, 977-993]), allowing human activity (agricultural practices, waterscape management, urban wastewater management, etc.) to be related to fluxes delivered to the sea. The models are validated by their ability to reproduce observed trends of interannual variations of nutrients delivered by the Seine during the last 50 years, as well as the response of the marine system in terms of diatoms and dinoflagellate development, for which data are available from 1976 to 1984 for the former and from 1987 to 1997 for the latter. The results show clearly that dry years, where silica inputs show a deficit with respect to nitrogen and phosphorus, are those where summer blooms of dinoflagellates are particularly pronounced. Various scenarios of human activity in the watershed are simulated by the two models, including a reconstitution of the 'pristine' state, a historical state corresponding to the situation at the end of the 18th century, as well as several scenarios corresponding to the present situation with alternative policies of wastewater nitrogen and/or phosphorus treatment.

Its population counts 2 million inhabitants of which 70% are concentrated in the downstream part of the basin. It has a high industrial activity and an intensive agriculture. The Marne River water supplies drinking water production to a large number of Parisians. A diversion reservoir (350 X 10(6) m(3)) is used mainly to sustain summer low flows. On the basis of field observations and experimental studies, a hydrological and ecological model of this river system was built using the Riverstrahler approach (Billen, G., Gamier, J., Hanset, Ph., 1994. Modelling phytoplankton development in whole drainage networks: the riverstrahler model applied to the seine river system. Hydrobiologia 289, 119-137; Gamier, J., Billen, G., Coste, M.. 1995. Seasonnal succession of diatoms and Chlorophyceae in the drainage network of the river Seine: observations and modelling. Limnol. Oceanogr. 40, 750-765). The modelling strategy was to consider separately nine sub-basins and the main branch, to which was coupled a model of the reservoir. The point and diffuse sources of nutrients were analysed over more than 10 years (1991-2001) taking into account the role of exchangeable phosphorus (Nemery (2003). Origine et devenir du phosphore dans le continuum aquatique dela Seine, des petis basins a l'estuaire. Role du phosphore echangeable sur l'eutrophisation. These Univ. Paris 6, p. 258; Nemery, J., Gamier, J., Morel, C., 2004. Phosphor-us budget in the Marne watershed (France): urban vs. diffuse sources, dissolved vs. particulate forms. Biogeochemistry (in press)). The model was validated through its ability to reproduce available water quality, observations. Different realistic scenarios of future reduction of phosphorus load were tested, in various hydrological conditions (dry and wet years). Phytoplankton development can be slightly reduced by a further 85% abatement of phosphorus in all the wastewater treatment plants of the basin, but a reduction both of diffuse and point phosphorus sources would be necessary to further decrease eutrophication.

J	Wade, AJ; Neal, C; Whitehead, PG; Flynn, NJ				Wade, AJ; Neal, C; Whitehead, PG; Flynn, NJ			Modelling nitrogen fluxes from the land to the coastal zone in European systems: a perspective from the INCA project	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						Europe; water quality; hydrochemistry; nitrogen; INCA project; ELOISE	MULTIPLE SOURCE ASSESSMENT; STREAM WATER; INTEGRATED NITROGEN; NUTRIENT POLLUTION; CATCHMENTS INCA; CLOUD-WATER; PHOSPHORUS; DYNAMICS; UNCERTAINTY; GROUNDWATER	This paper describes the results and conclusions of the INCA (Integrated Nitrogen Model for European CAtchments) project and sets the findings in the context of the ELOISE (European Land-Ocean Interaction Studies) programme. The INCA project was concerned with the development of a generic model of the major factors and processes controlling nitrogen dynamics in European river systems, thereby providing a tool (a) to aid the scientific understanding of nitrogen transport and retention in catchments and (b) for river-basin management and policy-making. The findings of the study highlight the heterogeneity of the factors and processes controlling nitrogen dynamics in freshwater systems. Nonetheless, the INCA model was able to simulate the in-stream nitrogen concentrations and fluxes observed at annual and seasonal timescales in Arctic, Continental and Maritime-Temperate regimes. This result suggests that the data requirements and structural complexity of the INCA model are appropriate to simulate nitrogen fluxes across a wide range of European freshwater environments. This is a major requirement for the production of coupled fiver-estuary-coastal shelf models for the management of our aquatic environment. With regard to river-basin management, to achieve an efficient reduction in nutrient fluxes from the land to the estuarine and coastal zone, the model simulations suggest that management options must be adaptable to the prevailing environmental and socio-economic factors in individual catchments: 'Blanket approaches' to environmental policy appear too simple.

The model is applied to a number of agricultural fields under a range of different land management scenarios. The model output highlights the importance of land management features such as tramlines, tracks and field drains in concentrating flow towards receiving waters and in increasing the risk of the delivery of pollutants derived from diffuse agricultural sources to watercourses. The model allows scenario analysis of the likely impact of flow path mitigation on diffuse nutrient loads. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To reliably find out the efficiency of different methods in changing hydrological conditions, long-term experiments are of invaluable importance. Here the effects of various cultivation methods on total suspended solids (TSS) and P concentrations in and the volume of -plough layer runoff (PLR) were studied in a sloping experimental field in southwest Finland during a 9-year period. Yearly means of PLR and flow-weighted mean concentrations from the treatment plots were compared with a control, winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) treatment (WW), of which the values assigned were equal to 1. No major differences were found in PLR for cultivation methods up and down slope, except for the cross-ploughing treatment (0.49). Normal ploughing and cultivation treatments produced the highest TSS concentrations (1.38 and 1. 18, respectively), whereas values between 0.44 and 0.53 were measured for three treatments with reduced (or no) tillage. Particle-bound P (PP) concentrations closely followed those of TSS. Dissolved reactive P (DRP) showed contrasting behaviour, with the greatest treatment effects from the three reduced tillage treatments (1.58-2.29). This study showed that by changing over from intensive autumn tillage to permanent vegetation cover, erosion and PP loss were markedly decreased. Methods employing no autumn tillage and leaving an undisturbed soil surface during winter showed particularly high reductions in loading. The simultaneous increase in DRP loss is an undeniable drawback that should be resolved separately. This study, as a part of a wider complex of integrated studies, will be utilized in a decision-making tool for the assessments of loading effects and load reduction possibilities in terms of cultivation methods.

In eastern Skagerrak, reductions in eutrophication are planned through reduction of nitrogen inputs, but it is unclear how this can be achieved. One possible method is the cultivation of filter-feeding organisms, such as blue mussels, which remove nitrogen while generating seafood, fodder and agricultural fertilizer, thus recycling nutrients from sea to land. The expected effect of mussel farming on nitrogen cycling was modeled for the Gullmar Fjord on the Swedish west coast and it is shown that the net transport of nitrogen (sum of dissolved and particulate) at the fjord mouth was reduced by 20%. Existing commercial mussel farms already perform this service for free, but the benefits to society could be far greater. We suggest that rather than paying mussel farmers for their work that nutrient trading systems are introduced to improve coastal waters. In this context an alternative to nitrogen reduction in the sewage treatment plant in Lysekil community through mussel farming is presented. Accumulation of bio-toxins has been identified as the largest impediment to further expansion of commercial mussel farming in Sweden, but the problem seems to be manageable through new techniques and management strategies. On the basis of existing and potential regulations and payments, possible win-win solutions are suggested.

Some of these problems originated from point contamination sources and widespread contaminant outlet sources which are observed in every country. The major elements and chemical loads of surface water have been dominated by constituents derived directly or indirectly from human activities and/or industrial practices that have increased additives in the last several decades. The point sources of contamination may result from the direct wastewater discharges to the dam sites, which are considered to be the most commonly encountered water pollution problems. One of these problems is the eutrophication process which usually occurs in the static water mass of lakes and other surface water reservoirs. This process may be caused by the continuous increase of nitrogen and phosphorus contents and decrease of O-2 level in water causing an anaerobic condition which may stimulate algae-growth flow in these water bodies, consequently reducing the quality of water. Of course, there are many research methods for determining the various kinds of water pollution. In this research, the hydrochemical parameters were evaluated to estimate the types of pollution sources, the level of pollution, and its environmental impacts on the Tahtali dam reservoir.

Marine water quality results showed no regular trend. The mean monthly values of temperature, pH, turbidity, suspended solid, salinity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand and ammonia nitrogen were in the range of 22.64 +/- 0.4 to 29.05 +/- 1.37 degrees C; 7.65 +/- 0.04 to 7.81 +/- 0.13; 28.8 +/- 14.7 to 64.2 +/- 32.0 NTU; 283.5 +/- 81.8 to 356.0 +/- 159.7 mg/L; 29.78 +/- 7.18 to 29.78 +/- 1.04 ppt; 4.67 +/- 0.50 to 6.01 +/- 1.02 mg/L; 5.41 +/- 1.92 to 7.56 +/- 2.1 mg/L; and 0.25 +/- 0.07 to 0.63 +/- 0.49 mg/L, respectively. The results of correlation analysis showed that biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) was inversely correlated dissolved oxygen (DO) and poorly correlated with all other parameters. Turbidity and suspended solid were moderately correlated with each other while salinity was moderately correlated with other water quality parameters. In factor analysis, four factors were drawn out of the eight variables, which represented 74% of the variance of the original data. Factor I was related to suspended solid and turbidity. Factor II represented mainly temperature and DO showing inverse relation between these two. Factor III implied the degree of pollution at any monitoring station. Factor IV included pH and salinity. It could be concluded that the factor model represented almost all the variables.

Benthivorous fish may play an important role in internal nutrient loading. Ruffe are highly specialised, feeding exclusively on bottom animals; thus all nutrients released via their feeding are derived from the bottom and are new to the water column. The fish can also release nutrients from the sediment through resuspension while searching for food. 2. The aim of this study was to estimate experimentally in the laboratory the effect on water quality of resuspension and nutrient release by ruffe and bottom animals (chironomids). 3. Ruffe released nutrients during 8 h experiments as follows: total P 1.4, dissolved PO4 0.6, total N 24.0 and NH4-N 15.9 mug g(-1) WW h(-1). A decreasing trend in mass-specific release was observed over time, probably because of starvation. The mass-specific release of total N and NH4-N decreased as the mean weight of fish increased. The mean ratio of excreted N : P was 32. 4. In 26 h experiments with sediment and both ruffe and chironomids, ruffe increased nutrient concentrations and turbidity values significantly but chironomids had an effect only on turbidity. Neither ruffe nor chironomids affected the ratio of inorganic N : P concentrations. An interaction between ruffe and chironomids was found for turbidity. 5. According to these results, benthivorous fish may increase nutrient concentrations in the water column and need to be taken into account when estimating internal loading.

The developing bloom was first detected from a web-based alert provided by a network of real-time remote monitoring (RTRM) platforms indicating elevated dissolved oxygen and pH levels in upper reaches of the estuary. RTRM data were used to augment shipboard sampling, allowing for an in-depth characterization of bloom initiation, development, movement, and dissipation. Prolonged drought conditions leading to elevated salinities, and relatively high nutrient concentrations from upstream inputs and other sources, likely pre-disposed the upper estuary for bloom development. Over a 7-month period (October 2001-April 2002), the bloom moved toward the northern shore of the mesohaline estuary, intensified under favorable conditions, and finally dissipated after a major storm. Bloom location and transport were influenced by prevailing wind structure and periods of elevated rainfall. Chlorophyll a within bloom areas averaged 106 +/- 13 mug L-1 (mean +/- 1 S.E.; maximum, 803 mug L-1), in comparison to 20 +/- 1 mug L-1 outside the bloom. There were significant positive relationships between dinoflagellate abundance and TN and TP. Ammonium, NO3-, and SRP concentrations did not decrease within the main bloom, suggesting that upstream inputs and other sources provided nutrient-replete conditions. In addition, PAM fluorometric measurements (09:00-13:00 h) of maximal PSII quantum yield (F-v/F-m) were consistently 0.6-0.8 within the bloom until late March, providing little evidence of photo-physiological stress as would have been expected under nutrient-limiting conditions. Nitrogen uptake kinetics were estimated for P minimum during the period when that species was dominant (October-December 2001), based on literature values for N uptake by an earlier P minimum bloom (winter 1999) in the Neuse Estuary. The analysis suggests that NH4+ was the major N species that supported the bloom. Considering the chlorophyll a concentrations during October and December and the estimated N uptake rates, phytoplankton biomass was estimated to have doubled once per day. Bloom displacement (January-February) coincided with higher diversity of heterotrophic dinoflagellate species as P. minimum abundance decreased. This research shows the value of RTRM in bloom detection and tracking, and advances understanding of dinoflagellate bloom dynamics in eutrophic estuaries. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Chen, XJ; Sheng, YP				Chen, XJ; Sheng, YP			Three-dimensional modeling of sediment and phosphorus dynamics in Lake Okeechobee, Florida: Spring 1989 simulation	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							TRANSPORT	Lake Okeechobee is a large and shallow freshwater body in south Florida. Due to the shallowness of Lake Okeechobee, the nutrient dynamics are strongly influenced by hydrodynamic processes (circulation and wind-induced waves) and sediment transport processes. To study water quality and the effects of hydrodynamic and sediment transport processes on nutrient dynamics in the lake, a three-dimensional simulation system that closely couples hydrodynamic and sediment transport processes with nutrient dynamics was developed and used. In this paper, we present, a three-dimensional, coupled hydrodynamics-sediment-nutrient model for Lake Okeechobee. The coupled model was used to simulate a four-week survey conducted in spring 1989 in Lake Okeechobee. By comparing model results to measured field data, it is shown that the coupled model system is able to simulate weekly sediment and phosphorus dynamics in Lake Okeechobee. Model applications demonstrated that the resuspension flux of phosphorus from the lake bottom is significantly higher than the molecular flux during resuspension events and can cause increases of phosphorus concentrations in the water column. Sensitivity runs of the model show that both the advective/diffusive transport and the algal uptake promote the release of phosphorus from suspended sediments and thus affect the phosphorus budget in the lake and the net resuspension flux of phosphorus from the lake bottom.

Changes in land use were mapped using archived Landsat data and computerised classification techniques. Land use change has been rapid in recent history with 16% of the region transformed in the last 22 years. Total nitrogen and phosphorus loads were estimated using an export coefficient model. The analysis demonstrates an increase in modelled nitrogen and phosphorus loadings from 1980 to 2002. Whilst such increases were suspected from past anecdotal and ad-hoc evidence, our modelling estimated the magnitude of such increases and thus demonstrated the enormous potential of using remote sensing and GIS for monitoring regional scale environmental processes.

The total chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrogen (TN), and phosphorus (TP) loads from rivers and ditches that provide input to the bay were approximately 2.8 x 10(4), 2.5 x 10(4), and 5.9 x 10(2) kg day(-1), respectively. Wastewater discharge from industrial complexes was the greatest contributor to pollutant loads in the inner part of the bay. COD values in the inner part of the bay were greater than 3.0 mg l(-1), and exceeded Korean seawater quality grade III limits. A residual cur-rent was simulated, using a hydrodynamic model, to have a slightly complicated pattern in the inner part of the bay, ranging from 0.001 to 8 cm s(-1). In the outer part of the bay, the simulated current flowed out to the South Sea with a southward flow at a maximum of 15 cm s(-1). The results of the ecological model simulation of COD levels showed high concentrations, exceeding 4 mg F 1, in the southwest of the Myodo, an area of wastewater discharge, and lower levels, approaching less than 1 mg l(-1), closer to the outer part of the bay. Engineering countermeasures to reduce the organic and inorganic material loads from point sources by more than 45 % were required to keep the COD levels below 2 mg l(-1) (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Computer modeling can help identify agricultural areas with high potential P transport. Most models use a constant extraction coefficient (i.e., the slope of the linear regression between filterable reactive phosphorus [FRP] in runoff and soil P) to predict dissolved P release from soil to runoff, yet it is unclear how variations in soil properties, management practices, or hydrology affect extraction coefficients. We investigated published data from 17 studies that determined extraction coefficients using Mehlich-3 or Bray-1 soil P (mg kg(-1)), water-extractable soil P (mg kg(-1)), or soil P sorption saturation (%) as determined by ammonium oxalate extraction. Studies represented 31 soils with a variety of management conditions. Extraction coefficients from Mehlich-3 or Bray-1 soil P were not significantly different for 26 of 31 soils, with values ranging from 1.2 to 3.0. Extraction coefficients from water-extractable soil P were not significantly different for 17 of 20 soils, with values ranging from 6.0 to 18.3. The relationship between soil P sorption saturation and runoff FRP (mu g L-1) was the same for all 10 soils investigated, exhibiting a split-line relationship where runoff FRP rapidly increased at P sorption saturation values greater than 12.5%. Overall, a single extraction coefficient (2.0 for Mehlich-3 P data, 11.2 for water-extractable P data, and a split-line relationship for P sorption saturation data) could be used in water quality models to approximate dissolved P release from soil to runoff for the majority of soil, hydrologic, or management conditions. A test for soil P sorption saturation may provide the most universal approximation, but only for noncalcareous soils.

J	McDowell, RW; Stewart, I				McDowell, RW; Stewart, I			Phosphorus in fresh and dry dung of grazing dairy cattle, deer, and sheep: Sequential fraction and phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance analyses	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							SOIL ORGANIC PHOSPHORUS; ANIMAL MANURES; SPECTROSCOPY; FORMS; NMR; ASSIGNMENTS; EXTRACTS; EDTA	Knowledge of phosphorus (P) fractions in dung of animals (dairy cattle, deer, sheep) grazing pasture is important for soil fertility and the potential for P transport in runoff and subsequent surface water quality deterioration. We used sequential fractionation and P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine P forms in fresh and air-dried (to simulate field conditions during grazing) dung. Sheep dung was richest in P (8 g kg(-1)), and cattle dung poorest (5.5 g kg(-1)). Data for sequential fractionation indicated that most P was extractable by water (15-36%) and bicarbonate (36-45%) in fresh dung, and shifted toward recalcitrant, HCl (12-28%), and residual P forms (15-31%) with drying. Organic P concentration in dung was poor (maximum of 15% of total P), probably due to the poor concentration of phytate in pasture. The P-31 NMR spectra of NaOH-EDTA extracts supported this by detecting a low concentration of monoesters (9-19% of total P in extracts), of which phytate is a major component. The P-31 NMR data also showed that changes in organic P concentration with drying could be due to the degradation of diesters. Data indicate the decreasing bioavailability of dairy cattle, deer, and sheep dung with drying and the need to consider this effect with respect to P returns for soil fertility and the potential for runoff.

J	Maitre, W; Cosandey, AC; Parriaux, A; Guenat, C				Maitre, W; Cosandey, AC; Parriaux, A; Guenat, C			A methodology to estimate the denitrifying capacity of a riparian wetland	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							GROUNDWATER NITRATE REMOVAL; STREAM WATER-QUALITY; BUFFER ZONES; SHALLOW GROUNDWATER; HARDWOOD FOREST; DENITRIFICATION; SOIL; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; NITROGEN	Numerous studies have shown that riparian wetlands can play an important role in reducing nitrate concentrations before the ground water discharges into streams. Denitrification has been identified as an important process for this removal. Several approaches have been proposed to predict the denitrifying removal capacity of a riparian wetland, but no widely used tool exists to precisely quantify this capacity at the landscape scale. We propose such a methodology based on modeling the spatial variation of soil-water interactions in the entire riparian wetland. Mean values of denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) within three soil-denitrifying classes were 604, 212, and 24 ng N g(-1) h(-1) for Classes 3, 2, and 1, respectively. The study area, having a ground surface of about 15 000 ml, was underlain by an aquifer with a calculated volume of 60 000 m(3), less than 10 000 m(3) of which corresponded to active denitrifying horizons (Classes 2 and 3). By volume, approximately 30% of Class 3 and 70% of Class 2 were interacting with ground water. The denitrifying removal capacity of our wetland was calculated to be about 1.8 kg N m(-2) yr(-1). The calculated denitrifying capacity of our site was less than expected. This is due to the fact that not all ground water interacts with the horizons having the highest denitrifying capacity. Thus, we show that whatever the system is, specific local pedological and hydrogeological conditions and their interactions are paramount in controlling the denitrification process.

J	Haggard, BE; Stanley, EH; Storm, DE				Haggard, BE; Stanley, EH; Storm, DE			Nutrient retention in a point-source-enriched stream	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						effluent; nitrogen; phosphorus; nitrification; nutrient uptake; retention; wastewater treatment plants	PHOSPHORUS LIMITATION; WATER-QUALITY; DESERT STREAM; RIVER; NITROGEN; DYNAMICS; NITRIFICATION; EFFLUENT; SYSTEM; FOREST	The capacity of a 3(rd)-order Ozark Plateau stream (Arkansas, USA) to take up (or remove) nutrient inputs from a rural wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was examined using nutrient spiraling methods. Short-term nutrient additions of ten are used to assess nutrient uptake length, where an exponential decline in the concentration of the added nutrient reflects gross nutrient uptake. We applied this quantitative framework using WWTP effluent as a stream nutrient addition, and estimated net nutrient uptake length (S-net), mass transfer coefficient (v(fnet)), and uptake rate (U-net) in Columbia Hollow, Arkansas. Water samples were collected at a reference site upstream of the WWTP input and at 6 sites downstream of the WWTP (0.3-2.7 km). Input from the WWTP significantly increased discharge, temperature, conductivity, soluble reactive P (SRP), and NH4-N, and decreased pH and NO3-N 0.3 km downstream from the point source. When P additions from the WWTP were low, stored SRP was released from the stream reach to maintain high water-column concentrations. Dissolved inorganic N was not retained in Columbia Hollow Most or all of the NH4-N added from the point source was converted to NO3-N, resulting in net nitrification rates of 7 to 31 g NO3-N m(-2) d(-1). The relationship between dilution-corrected concentrations and distance from the WWTP input indicated no significant nutrient retention, or that several stream kilometers were required before N and P were taken up. U-net typically was >7- to 10-fold higher and v(f-net) estimates were 10- to 100-fold lower than values reported for undisturbed streams, indicating low relative nutrient demand. Rather than acting as a nutrient sink, Columbia Hollow appeared to be acting as a short-term storage zone for P and a transformer of N. Thus, the effect of this rural WWTP on the stream was profound, distorting N and P cycling in Columbia Hollow.

J	Engstrom, DR				Engstrom, DR			Long-term changes in iron and phosphorus sedimentation in Vadnais Lake, Minnesota, resulting from ferric chloride addition and hypolimnetic aeration	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						iron addition; hypolinmetic aeration; sedimentation; phosphorus inactivation; internal loading	PB-210	Changes in iron (Fe) and phosphorus (P) cycling in Vadnais Lake, Minnesota, resulting from ferric chloride addition and hypolimnetic aeration are evaluated by repeat sampling of bottom sediments over a 13-year period: in 1985 (pre-treatment), and in 1990 and 1998 (post-treatment). Lead-210 derived accumulation rates for Fe, Mn, total-P, and P-fractions are combined with input/output monitoring to construct chemical mass-balances for each of the three time periods. Iron injections/aeration caused large and sustained reductions in water-column total-P by increasing phosphorus removal to the sediments and preventing its recycling during stratification. Annual whole-lake phosphorus sedimentation rose from 1.26 to 1.52 t between 1985 and 1990, equivalent to a doubling of in-lake retention of external P loads (from 19% to 38%). Most of the increase is represented in the labile Fe-bound fraction. The measured sedimentary fluxes for 1985 and 1990 are similar to those calculated by difference from inflow/outflow data, whereas measured P sedimentation in 1998 (2.43 t-yr(-1)) is three times higher than that estimated from input/output calculations. These results suggest surface enrichment by upward P diffusion within the sediment column. Present-day Fe accumulation rates (24 t-yr(-1)) are 33% greater than those immediately preceding treatment and 14% greater than pre-settlement fluxes (21 t-yr-1). The 6 t-yr-1 increase in Fe accumulation between 1985 and 1998 is roughly equal to the rate of iron injection to Vadnais Lake. Fifty-four tons of iron addition to the Lambert Creek tributary between 1990 and 1998 have also enriched littoral sediments in Fe, P, and Mn near the creek's outfall. These engineering solutions have substantially improved water quality in Vadnais Lake, but continued hypolimnetic aeration will be required to prevent internal phosphorus loading from the large reservoir of labile sedimentary P that has accumulated since treatment began.

J	Kato, T				Kato, Tasuku			Development of a water quality tank model classified by land use for nitrogen load reduction scenarios	PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Diffuse pollutant sources; Nitrogen cumulative load; Nitrogen effluent load; Scenario prediction; T-N; Watershed management		Water quality in the watershed mainly used for agriculture is degraded by nutrients from fertilizers and animal wastes. These diffuse (non-point) sources have accumulated in soils and been released into the river system for the long-term. In this paper, a water quality tank model classified by land use is modified for the accumulation, and total nitrogen (T-N) is simulated over 40 years in the Yamada River basin within the Lake Kasumigaura watershed, Japan. For considering the nitrogen balance, the model has a database comprising statistical data such as population, land use, rain, fertilizer, and animal waste; it calculates cumulative load in soils and dissolved load separately. The model simulated the measured data with relative error of 15% for runoff and 7% for T-N. Five scenarios for the reduction of cumulative load were developed as a countermeasure plan: soil washing, slow-release fertilizer, fertilizer application reduction, cover crop, and animal waste reduction. The results show that T-N first decreases and then increases after 30 years in the case of the slow-release fertilizer scenario and that T-N is reduced by 30% after 40 years in the case of the 100% animal waste reduction scenario.

A number of measures have been used to reach balance between P inputs and outputs in agricultural systems, with the goal of achieving improved P use efficiency, sustained high crop yields and reduced P losses. This paper discusses how this goal may be achieved. Results from a Swedish long-term fertility experiment combined with results of a P leaching study using a selection of soils from the fertility experiment are used to evaluate the effects of a balanced P system on yields, soil P levels and P leaching. Three P fertilizer application strategies are compared (zero P, replacement P, and a treatment where surplus P fertilization was used to achieve a rapid increase in the soil P status). The replacement P strategy appeared to be the most sustainable system but P fixation in this system must be accounted for. When surplus P rates were applied, increased crop yields were counterbalanced by poorer use efficiency and P accumulation in soil. Topsoil P content was a poor predictor of P leaching. Instead, balancing P inputs and outputs represents a first step in the management of P losses, but additional, site-specific measures are required to counteract site-specific factors responsible for P losses.

J	Veith, TL; Sharpley, AN; Weld, JL; Gburek, WJ				Veith, TL; Sharpley, AN; Weld, JL; Gburek, WJ			Comparison of measured and simulated phosphorus losses with indexed site vulnerability	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						field-scale modeling; nonpoint source; Pennsylvania Phosphorus Index; risk; SWAT	BMP PLACEMENT; STRATEGIES; MODEL; OPTIMIZATION; WATERSHEDS; POLLUTION	Nonpoint-source losses of agricultural phosphorus (P) at field and watershed scales must be quantified to facilitate selection and placement of P control measures. Quantification of P loss has been pursued through field monitoring, simulation models, and risk assessment indices. However, the intended users of these methods differ, impacting each method's functional design and ease-of-use. For example, the Pennsylvania P Index, a risk assessment tool for planners, requires less discipline-specific knowledge and more readily available data than the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a complex, watershed-level, research-based simulation model. This study compared measured losses of P from the outlet of a 39.5 ha mixed land use watershed (FD-36) in south-central Pennsylvania with watershed-level losses predicted by SWAT Measured watershed exports of dissolved P (0.06 kg ha(-1)) and total P (0.24 kg ha(-1)) during the 7-month sampling period were similar in magnitude to SWAT-predicted losses (0.05 and 0.73 kg ha(-1), respectively). Additionally, the study compared field-level P losses predicted by SWAT with field-level vulnerabilities to P loss derived by the P Index. The P Index and SWAT categorized 73% of the 22 fields similarly in terms of vulnerability to P loss, with Pearson correlation significant at p = 0.07; all except one of the remaining six fields were over- or underpredicted by a single risk category. Results indicate that while actual P loss from FD-36 was small, three fields contributed a major proportion of this loss. Additionally, this study suggests that the P Index can provide land managers with a reliable assessment of where P loss occurs within a watershed, thus allowing more effective placement and selection of conservation practices, which lead toward improved downstream water quality.

It is an enhanced version of the nitrogen (N) simulation model, DRAINMOD-N, that simulates a more complete N cycle, adds a carbon (C) cycle, and operates at different levels of complexity. Processes considered in the model include atmospheric deposition, application of mineral N fertilizers including urea and anhydrous ammonia (NH3), soil amendment with organic N (ON) sources including plant residues and animal waste, plant uptake, organic C (OC) decomposition and associated N mineralization/immobilization, nitrification, denitrification, NH3 volatilization, and N losses via subsurface drainage and surface runoff. Nitrogen pools considered in the model are nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), ammoniacal nitrogen (NHx-N) and ON. DRAINMOD-N II includes a submodel that simulates C dynamics in the soil-plant system using a C cycle similar to that of the CENTURY model. A simplified approach is used to simulate temporal changes in soil pH; consequently, the model determines the composition of the NHx-N pool and, if necessary, changes its operation mode. DRAINMOD-N II simulates N reactive transport using a finite difference solution to a multiphase form of the one-dimensional advection-dispersion- reaction equation.

Field-scale hydrology and nutrient dynamics are predicted by DRAINMOD in both models. In the first model (DRAINMOD-DUFLOW), field-scale predictions are coupled to the canal/stream routing and in-stream water quality model DUFLOW, which handles flow routing and nutrient transport and transformation in the drainage canal/stream network. In the second model (DRAINMOD-W), DRAINMOD was integrated with a new one-dimensional canal and water quality model. The hydrology and hydraulic routing components of the models were tested using data from a 2950 ha drained managed forest watershed in the coastal plain of eastern North Carolina. Both models simulated the hydrology and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) loading of the watershed acceptably. Simulated outflows and NO3-N loads at the outlet of the watershed were in good agreement with the temporal trend for five years of observed data. Over a five-year period, total outflow was within 1% of the measured value. Similarly, NO3-N load predictions were within 1% of the measured load. Predictions of the two models were not statistically different at the 5% level of significance.

SWIM is a continuous-time semi-distributed ecohydrological model, integrating hydrological processes, vegetation, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and sediment transport at the river basin scale. Its spatial disaggregation scheme has three levels: (1) basin, (2) sub-basins and (3) hydrotopes within sub-basins. The model was extensively tested and validated for hydrological processes, nitrogen dynamics, crop yield and erosion (mainly in mesoscale sub-basins of the German part of the Elbe River basin). After appropriate validation in representative sub-basins, the model can be applied at the regional scale for impact studies. Particular interest in the global change impact studies is given to effects of expected changes in climate and land use on hydrological processes and agro-ecosystems, including water balance components, water quality and crop yield. This paper (a) introduces the reader to the class of process-based ecohydrological catchment scale models, (b) introduces SWIM as one such model, and (c) presents two examples of impact studies performed with SWIM for the federal state of Brandenburg (Germany), which overlaps with the lowland part of the Elbe drainage area. The impact studies provide a better understanding of the complex interactions between climate, hydrological processes and vegetation, and improve our potential adaptation to the expected changes.

J	Moatar, F; Meybeck, M				Moatar, F; Meybeck, M			Compared performances of different algorithms for estimating annual nutrient loads discharged by the eutrophic River Loire	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						river flux; accuracy; precision; nutrients; phosphorus; nitrate; Loire	SEDIMENT RATING CURVES; SUSPENDED-SEDIMENT; SAMPLING STRATEGIES; NITROGEN; QUALITY; PHOSPHORUS; LOSSES; FRANCE; SERIES; MODEL	Good estimates of pollutant fluxes are required for Earth systems sciences and water quality management. The gradual accumulation of water quality data records over the past few decades has increased the value of these data for examining long-term trends. On many major rivers, however, infrequent sampling of most pollutants makes flux estimates and their analysis difficult. This paper explores the performance of different methods for estimating nutrient fluxes. The objective is to assess the accuracy (bias) and precision (dispersion) of annual nutrient fluxes based on monthly sampling, which is the frequency with which 80% of French water quality surveys have been carried out since 1971. The study is based on a data set of nutrient concentrations surveyed at high frequency during a 5 year pilot study (1981-85) at the Orleans station in the middle reaches of the River Loire, France. The mean specific fluxes were 641 (nitrate-N), 96 (total-P) and 37 kg year(-1) km(-2) (orthophosphate-P). For each year, the data set was then 'resampled' by randomly simulating 12 sampling dates. 100 simulated monthly samplings were generated, upon which seven estimation methods were tested. The evaluations indicate that, when concentrations of specific substances in large rivers exhibit seasonal variation, a simple method based on linear interpolation between samples taken at approximately monthly intervals is advocated. With the monthly sampling interval, the precision (confidence level of 95%) of annual nutrient fluxes obtained by the appropriate methods was 13% for nitrates, 20% for total-P, 26% for orthophosphates, and 34% for particulate-P. The frequency of water quality surveys required to obtain an annual nutrient flux with 10% precision was around 15 days for nitrate, 10 days for orthophosphate-P and total-P, and about 5 days in the case of particulate-P.

The relationships between Chlorophyll-a and 16 chemical, physical and biological water quality variables in amlidere reservoir (Ankara, Turkey) were studied by using principal component scores (PCS) in multiple linear regression analysis (MLR) to predict Chlorophyll-a levels. Principal component analysis was used to simplify the complexity of relations between water quality variables. Score values obtained by PC scores were used as independent variables in the multiple linear regression models. Two approaches were used in the present statistical analysis. In the first approach, only five selected score values obtained by PC analysis were used for the prediction of Chlorophyll-a levels and predictive success (R-2) of the model found as 56.3%. In the second approach, where all score values obtained from the PC analysis were used as independent variables, predictive power was turned out to be 90.8%. Both approaches could be used to predict Chlorophyll-a levels in reservoirs successfully. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We tested if there is a consistent relationship between crustacean species richness, assemblages, and abundance and trophic indices such as total phosphorus and chlorophyll a. We also examined if these patterns differ between regions. Cumulative species richness and assemblages varied among regions. The greatest number of crustacean species was found in the temperate oligotrophic region with the largest number of lakes sampled. However, cumulative species richness was similar in temperate and subtropical-tropical regions when comparing subsets with a similar number of lakes and reservoirs. The relationships between species richness and latitude or trophic status were difficult to assess owing to imbalance among regions in number of lakes and reservoirs sampled and to biogeography and fish predation potential influences. Trophic status was associated with changes in abundance of all major crustacean zooplankton groups. Eutrophic ecosystems supported greater crustacean abundances at all latitudes. However, cladocerans and cyclopoids were more abundant in eutrophic lakes and reservoirs, whereas calanoids were more abundant in temperate oligotrophic lakes. Total phosphorus was found to be a better predictor of the biomass of major crustacean groups than chlorophyll a in all regions.

To construct continental-scale N budgets, we produced maps of N deposition fluxes from site-network observations for the United States and Western Europe. Increases in the rates of N cycling for these two regions of the world are large, and they have undergone profound modification of biospheric-atmospheric N exchanges, and ecosystem function. The maps are necessarily restricted to the network measured quantities and consist of statistically interpolated fields of aqueous NO3- and NH4+, gaseous HNO3 and NO2 (in Europe), and particulate NO3- and NH4+. There remain a number of gaps in the budgets, including organic N and NH3 deposition. The interpolated spatially continuous fields allow estimation of regionally integrated budget terms. Dry-deposition fluxes were the most problematic because of low station density and uncertainties associated with exchange mechanisms. We estimated dry N deposition fluxes by multiplying interpolated surface-air concentrations for each chemical species by model-calculated, spatially explicit deposition velocities. Deposition of the oxidized N species, by-products of fossil-fuel combustion, dominate. the U.S. N deposition budget with 2.5 Tg of NOy-N out of a total of 3.7-4.5 Tg of N deposited annually onto the conterminous United States. Deposition of the reduced species, which are by-products of farming and animal husbandry, dominate the Western European N-deposition budget with a total of 4.3-6.3 Tg N deposited each year out of a total of 8.4-10.8 Tg N. Western Europe receives five times more N in precipitation than does the conterminous United States. Estimated N emissions exceed measured deposition in the United States by 5.3-7.81 Tg N, suggesting significant N export or under-sampling of urban influence. In Europe, estimated emissions better balance measured deposition, with an imbalance of between -0.63 and 2.88 Tg N, suggesting that much of the N emitted in Europe is deposited there, with possible N import from the United States. The sampling network in Europe includes urban influences because of the greater population density of Western Europe. Our analysis of N deposition for both regions was limited by sampling density. The framework we present for quantification of patterns of N deposition provides a constraint on our understanding of continental biospheric-atmospheric N cycles. These spatially explicit wet and dry N fluxes also provide a tool for verifying regional and global models of atmospheric chemistry and transport, and they represent critical inputs into terrestrial models of biogeochemistry.

However, numerous spatial factors can confound the interpretation of correlative analyses between land cover and stream indicators, particularly at broad spatial scales. We used a stream-monitoring data set collected from the Coastal Plain of Maryland, USA to address analytical challenges presented by (1) collinearity of land-cover class percentages, (2) spatial autocorrelation of land cover and stream data, (3) intercorrelations among and spatial autocorrelation within abiotic intermediaries that link land cover to stream biota, and (4) spatial arrangement of land cover within watersheds. We focused on two commonly measured stream indicators, nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and macroinvertebrate assemblages, to evaluate how different spatial considerations may influence results. Partial correlation analysis of land-cover percentages revealed that simple correlations described relationships that could not be separated from the effects of other land-cover classes or relationships that changed substantially when the influences of other land-cover classes were taken into account. Partial Mantel tests showed that all land-cover percentages were spatially autocorrelated, and this spatial phenomenon accounted for much of the variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages that could naively be attributed to certain classes (e.g., percentage cropland). We extended our use of partial Mantel tests into a path-analytical framework and identified several independent pathways between percentage developed land and instream measurements after factoring out spatial autocorrelation and other confounding variables; however, under these conditions, percentage cropland was only linked to nitrate-N. Further analyses revealed that spatial arrangement of land cover, as measured by areal buffers and distance weighting, influenced the amount of developed land, resulting in a threshold change in macroinvertebrate-assemblage composition. Moreover, distance-weighted percentage cropland improved predictions of stream nitrate-N concentrations in small watersheds, but not in medium or large ones. Collectively, this series of analyses clarified the magnitude and critical scales of effects of different land-cover classes on Coastal Plain stream ecosystems and may serve as an analytical framework for other studies. Our results suggest that greater emphasis should be placed on these important spatial considerations; otherwise, we risk obscuring the relationships between watershed land cover and the condition of stream ecosystems.

J	Wang, Y; Choi, W; Deal, BM				Wang, Y; Choi, W; Deal, BM			Long-term impacts of land-use change on non-point source pollutant loads for the St. Louis metropolitan area, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						urbanization; LEAM; runoff; non-point-source pollution; L-THIA	URBAN FUTURES MODEL; SURFACE WATERS; RUNOFF; PHOSPHORUS; MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE; URBANIZATION; NITROGEN; RIVER; PENNSYLVANIA	A land-use-change simulation model (LEAM) and a non-point-source (NPS) water quality model (L-THIA) were closely coupled as LEAMwq in order to determine the long-term implications of various degree of urbanization on NPS total nitrogen (TN), total suspended particles (TSP), and total phosphorus (TP) loads. A future land-use projection in the St. Louis metropolitan area from 2005 to 2030 using three economic growth scenarios (base, low, and high) and a long-term precipitation dataset were used to predict the mean annual surface runoff and mean annual NIPS pollutant loads in the region. Results show mean annual TN increases of 0.21%, 0.13%, and 0.14% by 2030 compared to 2000 under the base, high, and low scenarios, respectively. TSP and TP showed similar trends with different magnitudes. Corresponding changes in annual mean surface runoff were shown to be lower than expected, which might be attributed to the small-scale conversion pattern of land uses. In the most dramatic change (high growth) scenario, the runoff would increase across time but at varying rates, and temporal pollutant loads would result in a more complicated pattern than in the other scenarios. This is attributed to the complex interactions between event mean concentrations of pollutants and the magnitude of changes in land-use acreages. By integrating L-THIA with LEAM, LEAMwq was found to be a useful planning tool to illustrate in a quick and simple manner how future water quality is connected to decision-making on future land-use change.

The project has been imagined and built in a pluridisciplinary approach and framework. The approach developed corresponds to a cost/effectiveness assessment of several BMPs in several European watersheds, also including the study of their acceptability by farmers. Thanks to the integrated assessment of existing and potential BMPs, a selection grid contributes to provide assistance to regulators on how to conduct environmental, economic and sociological analyses for helping decision makers. Water quality problems encountered and dealt with in this project include nitrate, phosphorus, sediment, pesticide loads and acid water concerns. Thus, the developed framework allows for a large range of hydrological and economic models, depending on the environmental problem detected in each watershed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim was to estimate the nutrient fluxes for different socio-economic scenarios at catchment and coastal zone level of the Po catchment (Northern Italy) with reference to the Water Quality Objectives reported in the Water Framework Directive (WFD 2000/60/CE) and also in Italian legislation. Emission data derived from different sources at national, regional and local levels are referred to point and non-point sources. While non-point (diffuse) sources are simply integrated into the nutrient flux model, point sources are irregularly distributed. Intensive farming activity in the Po valley is one of the main Pressure factors Driving groundwater pollution in the catchment, therefore understanding the spatial variability of groundwater nitrate concentrations is a critical issue to be considered in developing a Water Quality Management Plan. In order to use the scattered point source data as input in our biogeochemical and transport models, it was necessary to predict their values and associated uncertainty at unsampled locations. This study reports the spatial distribution and uncertainty of groundwater nitrate concentration at a test site of the Po watershed using a probabilistic approach. Our approach was based on geostatistical sequential Gaussian simulation used to yield a series of stochastic images characterized by equally probable spatial distributions of the nitrate concentration across the area.

A major part of the flux of P to eutrophic lake sediments is organically bound or of biogenic origin. This P is incorporated in a poorly described mixture of autochthonous and allochthonous sediment and forms the primary storage of P available for recycling to the water column, thus regulating lake trophic status. To identify and quantify biogenic sediment P and assess its lability, we analyzed sediment cores from Lake Erken, Sweden, using traditional P fractionation, and in parallel, NaOH extracts were analyzed using (31)p NMR. The surface sediments contain orthophosphates (ortho-P) and pyrophosphates (pyro-P), as well as phosphate mono- and diesters. The first group of compounds to disappear with increased sediment depth is pyrophosphate, followed by a steady decline of the different ester compounds. Estimated half-life times of these compound groups are about 10 yr for pyrophosphate and 2 decades for mono- and diesters. Probably, these compounds will be mineralized to ortho-P and is thus potentially available for recycling to the water column, supporting further growth of phytoplankton. In conclusion, P-31 NMR is a useful tool to asses the bioavailability of certain P compound groups, and the combination with traditional fractionation techniques makes quantification possible.

J	Yang, XD; Dong, XH; Gao, G; Pan, HX; Wu, JL				Yang, XD; Dong, XH; Gao, G; Pan, HX; Wu, JL			Relationship between surface sediment diatoms and summer water quality in shallow lakes of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						canonical correspondence analysis (CCA); diatoms; middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River; shallow lakes; water quality	CANONICAL CORRESPONDENCE-ANALYSIS; TOTAL PHOSPHORUS CONCENTRATION; ENVIRONMENT; MODEL; REGRESSION; ECOLOGY	The relationship between surface sediment diatoms and summer water quality was investigated at 49 lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Lakes ranging from oligomesotrophic to hypereutrophic were examined, providing an obvious nutrient gradient. With the shift from mesotrophic to eutrophic levels, diatom multi-ecotypes dominated by epiphytic and facultative planktonic taxa were replaced by nutrient-tolerant planktonic taxa, such as Cyclotella meneghiniana Skvortzow, C. atomus Hustedt, Cyclostephanos Round, and Stephanodiscus Ehrenberg etc., reflecting the nutrient changes in the lake. The relationship between diatoms and summer water quality indices was explored further using numeric analysis. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with forward selection and a Monte Carlo permutation test revealed that of all 25 summer water environmental variables, total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a (Chl a), Secchi depth (SD), dissolved inorganic phosphorus, Cl-, SO42-, Mg2+, CO32-, and water depth were significant variables (P<0.05) in explaining diatom distributions. Of these, TP, Chl a, SD, and Cl-, were the most important variables. The result of the correlation analysis also showed that a significant correlation exists among these variables, implying that these indices are either interconnected or independent in explaining the diatom data. For phosphorus-limited sites, TP was the most significant variable affecting the diatoms, also affecting changes in Chl a, SD, and iron concentrations. The independence of Chl a may be related to algal competition induced by lake eutrophication, resulting in the feedback to diatom community. In addition to TP, SD can be related to sediment disturbance by wave action and the growth of macrophytes in large shallow lakes. These relationships between diatom ecotypes and water quality provide the basis for a future quantitative reconstruction of historic lake nutrient evolution in the study area and will also provide a wealth of modem ecological knowledge that can be used to interpret fossil diatom records.

J	Saunders, MC; Sullivan, TJ; Nash, BL; Tonnessen, KA; Miller, BJ				Saunders, MC; Sullivan, TJ; Nash, BL; Tonnessen, KA; Miller, BJ			A knowledge-based approach for classifying lake water chemistry	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						knowledge-based systems; knowledge-engineering methodology; lake water chemistry; NetWeaver	AIR	Knowledge-based systems are computer models that facilitate reasoning such that human experience and expertise can be represented and made available to non-specialists. In this paper we describe the application of a knowledge-engineering methodology, using the NetWeaver (TM) software, to the problem of lakewater acid-base chemistry assessment. We present, and document with examples, the structure, arguments, and criteria values of a knowledge-based decision support system for classifying lakes in five acid-sensitive regions of the United States. We also discuss the significance of this software tool for federal land managers in the management of aquatic resources in national parks, national wildlife refuges, and wilderness areas to protect against water quality degradation associated with atmospheric deposition of sulfur and nitrogen. The Lake Chemistry knowledge bases have undergone repeated testing by members of a lake chemistry domain expert panel. There is agreement among the panel that these regional models provide accurate classifications of lakewater chemistries. The graphical and executable rendering of knowledge bases within NetWeaver (TM) greatly facilitates the knowledge engineering process, as it permits the inclusion of the domain expert(s) in the knowledge representation process and hence encourages greater participation in the design of the final knowledge-based model. In addition, the inclusion of fuzzy arguments, against which data values can be compared, greatly reduces the potential for combinatorial explosion that often occurs in expert systems that rely on categorical data interpretation, while at the same time providing a robust description of complex systems. It is our expectation that adoption of this approach, and others like it, will stimulate further development of knowledge-based systems for agriculture, natural resource management, and other complex decision support arenas.

J	Sullivan, TJ; Saunders, MC; Tonnessen, KA; Nash, BL; Miller, BJ				Sullivan, TJ; Saunders, MC; Tonnessen, KA; Nash, BL; Miller, BJ			Application of a regionalized knowledge-based model for classifying the impacts of nitrogen, sulfur, and organic acids on lakewater chemistry	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						lakewater chemistry; decision support system; knowledge-based model; netweaver	LAKES; ACIDIFICATION; DEPOSITION; WATER	To maintain healthy ecosystems, it is increasingly imperative that federal land managers be prepared to monitor and assess levels of atmospheric pollutants and ecological effects in national parks, wildlife refuges, and wilderness areas. Atmospheric deposition of sulfur and/or nitrogen has the potential to damage sensitive terrestrial, and especially aquatic, ecosystems and can affect the survival of in-lake and in-stream biota. Federal land managers have a need to assess, at the individual park or wilderness area level, whether surface water resources are sensitive to air pollution degradation and the extent to which they have been impacted by atmospheric deposition of sulfur or nitrogen or influenced by other complicating factors. The latter can include geologic sources of sulfur, natural organic acidity, and the influence of disturbance and land use on water quality. This paper describes a knowledge-based decision support system (DSS) network for classifying lakewater resources in five acid-sensitive regions of the United States. The DSS allows federal land managers to conduct a preliminary assessment of the status of individual lakes prior to consulting an acid-base chemistry expert. The DSS accurately portrays the decision structure and assessment outcomes of domain experts while capturing interregional differences in acidification sensitivity and historic acid deposition loadings.

LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY			English	Article						landscape metrics; land use; monitoring; neutral landscape models; non-point source pollution; nutrient loading model; percolation theory; random maps; spatial models; spatial sensitivity analysis; water chemistry	LAND-USE CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; NITROGEN; QUALITY; MODELS; DENITRIFICATION; CATCHMENT; NUTRIENT; FOREST; EXPORT	The percentage of a watershed occupied by agricultural areas is widely used to predict nutrient loadings and in-stream water chemistry because water quality is often linked to non-point sources in a watershed. Measures of the spatial location of source areas have generally not been incorporated into such landscape indicators although empirical evidence and watershed loading models suggest that spatially explicit information is useful for predicting loadings. I created a heuristic grid-based surface-flow model to address the discrepancies between spatially explicit and non-spatial approaches to understanding watershed loading. The mean and variance in loading were compared among thousands of simulated watersheds with varying percentages of randomly located source and sinks. The variability in loading among replicate landscapes was greatest for those landscapes with similar to 65% source areas. This variance peak suggests that considering the spatial arrangement of cover types is most important for watersheds with intermediate relative abundances of sources and sinks as the wide variety of different spatial configurations can lead to either very high or very low loading. Increasing the output from source pixels (relative to the amount absorbed by sink pixels) among different landscapes moved the peak in variance to landscapes with lower percentages of sources. A final scenario examined both broad- and fine-scale heterogeneity in source output to disentangle the relative contributions of spatial configuration, percentage of source covers, and heterogeneity of sources in governing variability in loading. In landscapes with high percentages of source pixels, fine-scale heterogeneity in source output was responsible for a greater portion of the total variability in loading among different watersheds than was spatial arrangement. These results provide several testable hypotheses for when spatial and non-spatial approaches might be most useful in relating land cover to water chemistry and suggest improvements for the spatial sensitivity analyses of eco-hydrologic watershed models.

J	Whitehead, PG; Cosby, BJ; Prior, H				Whitehead, PG; Cosby, BJ; Prior, H			The Wheal Jane wetlands model for bioremediation of acid mine drainage	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						acid mine drainage; bioremediation; metals; water quality; wetlands; modelling; Wheal Jane mine	MULTIPLE SOURCE ASSESSMENT; CATCHMENTS INCA; NITROGEN MODEL; WATER-QUALITY	Acid mine drainage (AMD) is a widespread environmental problem associated with both working and abandoned mining operations. As part of an overall strategy to determine a long-term treatment option for AMD, a pilot passive treatment plant was constructed in 1994 at Wheal Jane Mine in Cornwall, UK. The plant consists of three separate systems, each containing aerobic reed beds, anaerobic cell and rock filters, and represents the largest European experimental facility of its kind. The systems only differ by the type of pretreatment utilised to increase the pH of the influent minewater (pH <4): lime dosed (LD), anoxic limestone drain (ALD) and lime free (LF), which receives no form of pretreatment. Historical data (1994-1997) indicate median Fe reduction between 55% and 92%, sulphate removal in the range of 3-38% and removal of target metals (cadmium, copper and zinc) below detection limits, depending on pretreatment and flow rates through the system. A new model to simulate the processes and dynamics of the wetlands systems is described, as well as the application of the model to experimental data collected at the pilot plant. The model is process based, and utilises reaction kinetic approaches based on experimental microbial techniques rather than an equilibrium approach to metal precipitation. The model is dynamic and utilises numerical integration routines to solve a set of differential equations that describe the behaviour of 20 variables over the 17 pilot plant cells on a daily basis. The model outputs at each cell boundary are evaluated and compared with the measured data, and the model is demonstrated to provide a good representation of the complex behaviour of the wetland system for a wide range of variables.

Studies were conducted from October 2000 to September 2001. During this period, the parameters chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), NO2-, NO3-, NH4+ and PO43- were measured, employing standard methods of analysis. The results were subjected to principal component analysis (PCA) for the estimation of the underlying variable correlations and were further explored by means of cluster analysis. The values of the above parameters were also compared with those awkward in the Fresh Water Fisheries Directive (78/659/EEC). It was found that the phosphate content was much higher than the upper limiting criteria for eutrophication for salmonid waters, whereas nitrate levels were lower than the permissible criteria according to the Nitrates Directive 91/676/EEC for drinking water. The inorganic nutrient load was mostly attributed to sites that drain agricultural areas, especially during winter and spring. The organic matter was due to urban activities during autumn.

Using high-resolution discharge and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) data from three small catchments ( up to 42 km(2)), SRP loads are calculated by applying two different rating curves. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to determine monitoring strategies for optimizing the number of water samples, their distribution between periods of low and high discharge, and the duration of composite sample collection. Trends in SRP load are isolated from natural variations by applying the discharge time series of 1 year each to annually changing rating curves. By applying this approach to various monitoring data sets, collected over the past 15 years, downward trends in SRP leaching of up to - 3% yr(-1) are detected. We describe how to determine the number of annual samples required to detect trends in nutrient load, depending on monitoring duration, available resources, and the magnitude of the expected trend.

Such a turbid (Case 2) water area, with its unique optical properties, often requires a parametrization to local conditions. Water quality algorithms are also sensitive to other naturally occurring phenomena, such as temporal variations in the atmospheric properties. Therefore, adequate reference data are essential for the estimation of water quality algorithm accuracy. In this study, a comparison with Sea-viewing Wide Field of view Sensor (SeaWiFS) data and high-frequency flow-through fluorometer measurements is made. These so-called 'ship of opportunity' data are measured with an automated continuous sampling system onboard several merchant and passenger ships in the Baltic Sea (SOOP, the Alg@line-system). The study is concentrated on the monitoring of spring blooms in the years 1999 and 2000. By combining Alg@line observations with satellite instrument observations, the strengths of both data sources are obtained. The Alg@line-fluorometer data ensure a sufficient amount of field samples to parametrize remote sensing chl-a algorithms. Information with a full spatial coverage on chl-a fluctuations can be obtained through the use of remote sensing data.

It was found that DOC removal was independent of the unsaturated vadose zone depth except during the initial flooding period when the effluent was injected into each column. From tests to study the nitrate profile, it was found that the pattern of nitrification was dependent on the depth of the unsaturated zone during the initial periods of SAT flooding. However, no further nitrification occurred at the end of the flooding since the injection of the effluent continued to provide a high loading concentration to the SAT columns. The lack of phosphate removal in this study indicates that its removal is more dependent upon the soils and aquifer characteristics than on the depth of unsaturated zone.

In this study, we use MLP to estimate chlorophyll-a concentrations from marine reflectance measures. The optical data were assembled from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) Bio-optical Algorithm Mini-workshop (SeaBAM). Most bio-optical algorithms use simple ratios of reflectance in blue and green bands or combinations of ratios as parameters for regression analysis. Regression analysis has limitations for nonlinear function. Neural network, however, have been shown better performance for nonlinear problems. The result showed that accuracy of chlorophyll-a concentration using MLP is much higher than that of regression method. Nevertheless, using all of the five bands as input can derive the best performance. The results showed that each band could carry some useful messages for ocean color remote sensing. Only using band ratio (OC2) or band switch (OC4) might lose some available information. By preprocessing reflectance data with the principle component analysis (PCA), MLP could derive much better accuracy than traditional methods. The result showed that the reflectance of all bands should not be ignored for deriving the chlorophyll-a concentration because each band carries different useful ocean color information.

In this study, the impact of AS soils occurrence and hydrological changes on water quality were determined for 21 rivers (catchment sizes between 96-4122 km(2)) running through an AS soil hotspot area in western central Finland. Water samples, collected at the outlet, during eight selected events, were analysed for pH, dissolved organic carbon, electrical conductivity (EC) and 32 chemical elements. Based on the correlation with percentage arable land in the catchments (a rough estimate of AS soil occurrences, as up to 50% of the arable land is underlain with these soils), it was possible to categorize variables into those that are enriched in runoff from such land, depleted in runoff from such land (only one element), and not affected by land-use type in the catchments. Of the variables enriched in runoff from arable land, some were leached from AS soils during high-water flows, in particular (aluminium, boron, beryllium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, lithium, manganese, nickel, sulphur, silicon, thorium, thallium, uranium, and zinc) and others occurred in highest concentrations during lower flows (calcium, EC, potassium, magnesium, sodium, rubidium and strontium). Molybdenum and phosphorus were not leached from AS soils in larger amounts than from other soils and thus related to other factors connected to the arable land. Based on the concentrations of potentially toxic metals derived from AS soils, the 21 rivers were ranked from the least (Lestijoki River, Lapvaartinjoki River and Perhonjoki River) to the most (Sulvanjoki River, Voyrinjoki River and Maalahdenjoki River) heavily AS soil impacted. It has been decided that Voyrinjoki is to be dredged along a ca. 20 km distance. This is quite alarming considering the high metal concentrations in the river.

Benefits include promoting pest-suppression, soil and water quality, nutrient cycling efficiency, and cash crop productivity. Costs of adopting cover crops include increased direct costs, potentially reduced income if cover crops interfere with other attractive crops, slow soil warming, difficulties in predicting N mineralization, and production expenses. Cover crop benefits tend to be higher in irrigated systems. The literature is reviewed here along with Michigan farmer experience to evaluate promising cover crop species for four niches: Northern winter (USDA Hardiness Zones 5-6), Northern summer (Zones 5-6), Southern winter (Zones 7-8), and Southern summer (Zones 7-8). Warm season C-4 grasses are outstanding performers for summer niches (6-9 Mg ha(-1)), and rye (Secale cereale L.) is the most promising for winter niches (0.8-6 Mg ha(-1)) across all hardiness zones reviewed. Legume-cereal mixtures such as sudangrass (Sorghum sudanese L.)-cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) are the most effective means to produce substantial amounts (28 Mg ha(-1)) of mixed quality residues. Legume covers are slow growers and expensive to establish. At the same time, legumes fix N, produce high quality but limited amounts (0.5-4 Mg ha(-1)) of residues, and enhance beneficial insect habitat. Brassica species produce glucosinolate-containing residues (2-6 Mg ha(-1)) and suppress plant-parasitic nematodes and soil-borne disease. Legume cover crops are the most reliable means to enhance cash crop yields compared with fallows or other cover crop species. However, farmer goals and circumstances must be considered. If soil pests are a major yield limiting factor in cash crop production, then use of brassica cover crops should be considered. Cereal cover crops produce the largest amount of biomass and should be considered when the goal is to rapidly build soil organic matter. Legume-cereal or brassica-cereal mixtures show promise over a wide range of niches.

Superimposed upon this critical situation, because of the increasing urban wealth in these countries, there is a strong trend of increased consumption of meat, and pork in particular. The consequence of this trend will be increased agricultural pollution, resulting not only from greater use of chemical fertilizer, but also from manure spread on land as fertilizer that may enter freshwater and marine ecosystems causing extensive eutrophication and decreased water quality. The application of transgenic technologies to improve the digestive efficiency and survival of food animals, and simultaneously decreasing their environmental impact is seen as an opportunity to enhance sustainability of animal agriculture without continued capital inputs. Transgenes expressed in pigs that have potential include, for example, genes coding for phytase, lactalbumin and lactoferrin. At the University of Guelph, Escherichia coli phytase has been expressed in the salivary glands of the pig. Selected lines of these pigs utilize plant phytate phosphorus efficiently as a source of phosphorus and excrete faecal material with more than a 60 percent reduction in phosphorus content. Because of their capacity to utilize plant phytate phosphorus and to produce less polluting manure they have a valuable trait that will contribute to enhanced sustainability of pork production in developing countries, where there is less access to either high quality phosphate supplement or phytase enzyme to include in the diet.

Open-channel ecosystems receive direct surface and subsurface inflow from agricultural land and act as potential conduits of considerable loads of nutrients, sediment, pathogens, and pesticides to small streams and larger rivers. Our objective was to design, build, and evaluate a drainage channel research facility for examining water quality impacts of water management in open-channel. An open-channel research facility incorporating a paired design was constructed during 2002 near Lumberton, Minnesota. A 200-m reach of existing drainage channel was converted into a system of four parallel channels. The facility was equipped with water level control devices and instrumentation for flow monitoring and water sample collection on upstream and downstream ends of the system. Flow hydrographs were created by simulating flow generated by pumping waterfront an adjacent pond. Channel morphology was described by measuring longitudinal channel bottom elevation and cross-sectional channel profiles. Hydrographs from simulated flow events during year one indicated that the paired open channels responded similarly to changes in inflow. Variability in hydrologic response between the open-channels was attributed to differences in open-ditch channel bottom elevation and vegetation density. Research facility system performance exceeded expectations. Potential future benefits of this research include improved biological diversity and integrity of open-channel ecosystems, reduced flood peaks and increased flow during critical low-flow periods, improved and more efficient nitrogen retention within the open-channel ecosystem, and decreased maintenance cost associated with reduced frequency of channel maintenance.

J	McDowell, RW				McDowell, RW			The effectiveness of coal fly-ash to decrease phosphorus loss from grassland soils	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH			English	Article						sediment; overland flow; particulate P; grazing; pasture; cropland	COMBUSTION PRODUCT AMENDMENTS; BY-PRODUCTS; WATER REPELLENCY; ORGANIC-MATTER; INFILTRATION; MOBILIZATION; RAINFALL; EROSION; QUALITY; GYPSUM	Phosphorus (P) loss from soils can impair surface water quality. A study was conducted to test the efficacy of fly-ash to decrease phosphorus loss in 11 grassland soils. A preliminary toxicity and leaching experiment indicated that heavy metal concentrations (As, Cd, Pb, Se) in leachate and pasture from a soil treated with ash up to 50 mg/kg were not different from the control (unamended soil). Heavy metal concentrations in the ash were generally below limits for maximum concentrations in soil. Following incubation of fly ash at a rate of 20 mg/kg for 3 months with 11 grassland soils packed into boxes, overland flow was generated by simulated rainfall on each boxed soil. Analysis of overland flow indicated that in 2 semi-arid soils, P loss decreased due to decreased particulate P (PP) loss and low organic C concentration (<20 g/kg) that facilitated soil dispersion and slaking and increased soil strength. However, in 4 other soils (including 3 volcanic-ash soils with organic C > 70 g/kg), P loss increased due to increased soil pH from 6 to 7 where P is most soluble. In all soils, despite an increase in P in recalcitrant soil P fractions, increased soil pH stimulated soil C and P mineralisation (decreased organic C by, on average, 4.1 g/kg), decreased soil organic P, and increased inorganic P in labile fractions. It is concluded that the application of fly-ash from this source should not be used as an amendment to decrease P loss in pastures where soil pH is commonly <6.0, but could provide useful both as a supplement to lime and in mitigating P loss in cropping soils.

Evaluation of the data shows that the area is characterized by high nutrients and low productivity and chlorophyll carbon. Evaluation indicates that further identification of the small-sized phytoplankton is needed. The data is then incorporated in a 3-D ecological numerical model to simulate the lower trophic level prevailing in the area. Hydrodynamic conditions are needed for the model as they were developed in an earlier study. The simulation is done for both the summer and winter seasons utilizing four data sets for parameter stabilization and calibration. Phytoplankton and zooplankton are both simulated with time and space in response to variable effluent fluxes of nutrients and organic matters. Other simulated parameters include nutrients, DOC, POC, COD, and DO. The model proves to be a good toot for evaluating the ecological conditions of coastal areas under different effluent loads.

It simulates physical transport using the concept of tidal flushing, includes one of the most sophisticated representations of eutrophication processes in water column and benthic sediment, and employs an innovative solution scheme that is simple, accurate, and computationally efficient. The predictive capability of the water column portion of TPWQM was demonstrated through successful calibration and validation of the model with extensive data sets collected from Lynnhaven Bay, Virginia. The model's general applicability was examined for four other Virginia coastal basins. One value (0.3) of the returning ratio, the only calibration parameter for physical transport, is applicable to all five coastal basins and probably would be adequate for other Virginia coastal basins without further calibration. The values of kinetic parameters determined for Lynnhaven Bay are applicable to at least two of the other four coastal basins. The model underpredicts chlorophyll-a, total carbon, and total phosphorus in two of the tested basins, which is more likely the result of underpredicted nonpoint source loads than the inaccuracy of the kinetic coefficients. Therefore, the set of kinetic coefficients may be applicable to all the Virginia coastal basins with basin-specific refinement in the estimation of nonpoint source loads.

Laboratory incubations are conducted at each location with a minimum of three soils, three temperatures, two wetting/drying regimes, and two manure treatments. A soil from the central United States (Catlin silt loam, fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Oxyaquic Argiudoll) is used as an internal reference across all locations. Incubation data are compiled across locations to develop generalized predictions of manure nitrogen mineralization (Nmin). Field validation data are then obtained by monitoring nitrogen (N) transformations in manure-amended soil cores equipped with anion exchange resin to capture leached nitrate. This field data will be used to compare laboratory-based predictions with field observations of Nmin in each soil, climatic zone, and manure type represented. A Decision Support System will then be developed for predicting manure N mineralization across ranges in soil, climate, and manure composition. Protocols used by this research team are provided to 1) document the procedures used and 2) offer others detailed information for conducting research on nutrient transformation processes involving collaboration across locations or complementary research between laboratory and field environments.

The lake provides resources that are fundamental for the local population and national economies. Inshore areas are particularly sensitive to changes in land use, wetland management and wetland vegetation. The highly heterogeneous inshore waters of Lake Victoria present a wide range of optical environments, from strongly humic environments to highly turbid areas and to areas of massive algal blooms. In the present study, the spatial analysis of the light field along the Ugandan and Kenyan coast was analysed using a series of spectroradiometers, simultaneously with chemical and biological measurements. By combining both the high spatial resolution data from the water column, with the satellite derived spatially explicit information about the coastline characteristics, it was possible to examine the relation between wetland coverage and water quality. The extinction coefficients in the visible wavelengths showed higher extinction in wetland-bordered areas for wavebands necessary for chlorophyll photosynthesis, reducing the euphotic depth available for phytoplankton growth.

How to evaluate the effect of environmental pollution to water pollution is difficult. In the paper, evaluating water pollution is to evaluate environmental pollution indirectly. The indexes, nitrogen, phosphorus and biochemical oxygen demand are the three main super scales of water quality in Jiulong River Watershed, to provide theoretical decision for managers is necessary. The paper divides the Jiulong River Watershed into 114 pieces/districts, through the statistical analysis of the water pollution, we established a pollution degree function based on cluster, correlation analysis, principal component analysis, factor analysis and the data standardization, the model could evaluate the status of water pollution correctly, the value of the pollution degree function is an all-around reflection of environmental pollution. The results stated that the environmental status of northwest and southwest are very serious, we also give a visional figure of the districts' pollution distribution. Adopting the model, we can prevent pollution from upgrading and sustain economic development for Jiulong River Watershed.

The objective of this study was to develop time series models describing stream water phosphorus concentration dependence on seasonal variation in stream base flows, short-term flow fluctuations, antecedent flow conditions, and rainfall. Stream water SRP concentrations varied on average by +/-18% or +/-5.7 mu g/L from one week to another, whereas TP varied +/-48% or +/-32.5 mu g/L from one week to another. On average, SRP constituted about 47% of TP. Stream water SRP concentrations followed a simple sine-wave annual cycle with high concentrations during the low-flow summer period and low concentrations during the high-flow winter period in three of the four study sites. These trends are probably due to seasonal variation in the relative contributions of groundwater and subsurface flows to stream flow. In forested Issaquah Creek, SRP concentrations were relatively constant throughout the year except during the fall, when a major salmon spawning run occurred in the stream and SRP concentrations increased markedly. Stream water SRP concentrations were statistically unrelated to short-term flow fluctuations, antecedent flow conditions, or rainfall in each of the study streams. Stream water TP concentrations are highly variable and strongly influenced by short-term flow fluctuations. Each of the processes assessed had statistically significant correlations with TP concentrations, with seasonal base flow being the strongest, followed by antecedent flow conditions, short-term flow fluctuations, and rainfall. Times series models for each individual stream were able to predict similar to 70% of the variability in the SRP annual cycle in three of the four streams (r(2) = 0.57-0.81), whereas individual TP models explained similar to 50% of the annual cycle in all streams (r(2) = 0.39-0.59). Overall, time series models for SRP and TP dynamics explained 82% and 76% of the variability for these variables, respectively. Our results indicate that SRP, the most biologically available and therefore most important phosphorus fraction, has simpler and easier-to-predict seasonal and weekly dynamics.

However, availability of nitrogen and phosphorus from sludge-amended soils and their transfer in runoff may lead to eutrophication of downstream surface water. The aim of this study is to establish and compare the effect of two different sludges on these transfers: an anaerobically digested and thermically stabilised sludge (Seine-Aval treatment plant, sludge no. 1), and a limed sludge (Saint-Quentin treatment plant, sludge no. 2). Experiments were performed on 12 sloping micro-plots ( 1 m x 1 m) submitted to sludge spreading and controlled rainfall simulation. Runoff water was sampled and analysed for concentrations in nitrogen species and phosphorus. Results showthat spreading of sludge no. 1 increased both ammonium nitrogen ( mean of 1.1 mg L-1 N - NH4 vs. 0.2 mg L-1 N - NH4 for control micro-plots) and particulate phosphorus concentrations ( mean of 2 mg L-1 P vs. 1.1 mg L-1 P for control micro-plots) in runoff water. On the other hand, sludge no. 2 did not induce any significant effect on nutrient concentrations in runoff. These results are related to chemical composition and physical treatment of sludges. This study underlines the existence of a short-term risk of nutrient mobilisation by runoff after sludge spreading on soil, and the need to check precisely the impact of this practice on water quality.

A process which consisted of 100 mg/L DGB adsorbent, polyaluminum chloride as a coagulant, sedimentation, sand filtration and soil aquifer treatment for groundwater recharge was selected. This process could greatly decrease UV-254, Color-436 of the secondary effluent, and partially remove DOC and Adsorbable Organic Halogens (AOX). Disinfection by chlorination with the dosage of 6-8 mg/L inactivated significantly total bacteria and total coliform in the DGB adsorbent treated water, however, AOX increased obviously, indicating a high potential of forming disinfection byproducts. The DGB adsorbent treated water had a good water quality and can be used for non-potable purposes. After the tertiary treatment combined with simulated soil columns, the concentrations of nitrogen and many heavy metals were reduced to the levels below the national drinking water standard. The results of the Ames test showed that this secondary effluent had a high level of mutagenicity. And the given tertiary process partially removed mutagenic substances.

Contour maps and profile maps were constructed to describe the spatial distribution of SOM and TN in order to identify the influences of flood frequency on them. Results showed that spatial distributions of both SOM and TN were very similar in soil profiles (0-120 cm) of the five areas, decreasing gradually with depth except an accumulation peak in the flooded floodplain (B area). Also, the accumulation peak in the soil profile of B area was relevant to water table, nitrogen leaching, denitrification and mineralization. However, their horizontal distributions in surface soils (0-10 cm) were different in the five areas. Although the flood could bring the deposit of nutrients and sands, the highest content of SOM or TN did not appear in B area but in the floodplain with certain flood frequency. For example, SOM content (6.76%) in 5-year floodplain wetland was highest, and the highest content of TN (3666.4 mg/kg) appeared in 1-year floodplain wetland. However, SOM and TN contents in soils of B area were 4.08% and 2605.4 mg/kg, respectively. Soil clay content, wetland plant (Phragmites australis) litter inputs, soil moisture and water table greatly affected the spatial distribution of SOM and TN in floodplain wetlands. The ratios of carbon to nitrogen of wetland soils in this region were relatively lower than those in paddy soils. SOM and TN contents were significantly correlated with total phosphorus (TP) contents in floodplain wetlands except the 100-year floodplain wetland, but they were significantly influenced by soil pH values only in B area. Denitrification and ammonia volatilization were the main mechanisms resulting in nitrogen loss of surface soils in B area. Flood frequency significantly influenced the ecological functions such as nutrient retention and water quality maintenance of floodplains. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Demars, BOL; Harper, DM; Pitt, JA; Slaughter, R				Demars, BOL; Harper, DM; Pitt, JA; Slaughter, R			\Impact of phosphorus control measures on in-river phosphorus retention associated with point source pollution	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article							THAME CATCHMENT; WATER-QUALITY; LAND-USE; EXPORT; TRANSPORT; DYNAMICS; UK; OXFORDSHIRE; NUTRIENTS; LOIS	In-river phosphorus retention alters the quantity and timings of phosphorus delivery to downstream aquatic systems. Many intensive studies of in-river phosphorus retention have been carried out but generally on a short time scale (2-4 years). In this paper, monthly water quality data, collected by the Environment Agency of England and Wales over 12 years (1990-2001), were used to model daily phosphorus fluxes and monthly in-river phosphorus retention in the lowland calcareous River Wensum, Norfolk, UK. The calibrated model explained 79% and 89% of the observed variance before and after phosphorus control, respectively. A split test revealed that predicted T P loads were in good agreement with observed T P loads (r(2)=0.85), although TP loads were underestimated under high flow conditions. During relatively dry years, there was no net export of phosphorus from the catchment. High retention of phosphorus occurred, particularly during the summer months, which was not compensated for, by subsequent higher flow events. This was despite a relatively modest critical discharge (Q) above which net remobilisation occur. Phosphorus removal from the effluent at two major STWs (Sewage Treatment Works) reduced phosphorus retention but not the remobilisation. This may indicate that the presence of impoundments and weirs, or overbank flows may have more control on the phosphorus dynamics under high flow conditions. Further phosphorus remedial strategies will be necessary to prevent downstream risks of eutrophication occurring independently of the unpredictable variability in weather conditions.

Although physicochemical properties of sea water and inland water are slightly different, they are similar enough for hyperspectral remote sensing to become an alternative tool for inland lakes monitoring. A field campaign was conducted in the spring and summer 2004 in Michigan, USA. A total of 191 water samples were collected at multiple depths from 46 lakes and were analyzed for Chlorophyll-a, suspended solids, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, Secchi disk transparency, light conditions, and temperature pro files. Geographic locations of the sample sites were recorded, and over 5,000 lake reflectance measurements were collected using it field spectroradiometer. The hyperspectral data were used to specify the regions of wavelengths that best respond to changes of water quality parameters. Principal components analysis (PCA) and regression technique were used to examine the relationship between water quality parameters and spectral reflectance. The quantitative relationship between remotely sensed variables and water quality indicators can be potentially used to extrapolate point-based water quality measurements to large spatial extents for an improved water quality assessment.

One problem of concern globally, is eutrophication of lakes and streams, caused primarily by increasing surface water runoff with high concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and suspended sediments (SS). High concentration N, P, and SS contaminated runoff enhances primary productivity in lake, which causes algal blooms on the surface, blocks light penetration to deeper waters, reduces oxygen level, and alters the entire cycle of the food chain. However, Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) variation, and associated human activities, such as agricultural practices, that affect water quality in the ecosystem are not thoroughly studied. Understanding the relationships among terrestrial LULC, N, P, and SS loading in aquatic ecosystems is essential in order to properly manage the landscape to ensure water quality. With the increasing availability of high spatial resolution and frequent temporal coverage images from satellites, in this case using ETM+, we were able to characterize LULC changes and to assess the quantity of agricultural, urban, and forested lands. Although several water quality predictive models are available, most of them are either scale dependant, or have extensive input data requirements. In this study, we constructed the NPSSIM (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Sediment Simulation) predictive model to predict Total Nitrogen (TN), Total Phosphorous (TP), and Total Suspended Solid (TSS) concentrations in lakes based on surrounding LULC types and patterns to gain an understanding of the relationship between lake water quality parameters and the broader landscape.

Timely application and quantification of the amount of manure applied throughout the grass-growing season can reduce the loss of nutrients into ground or surface water while improving the quality and quantity of grass harvested. During the 2001 and 2002 growing seasons, we measured the effects of different manure application rates on grass yields, grass nutritive value, and soil chemistry on a dairy farm. On-farm estimates of manure N were combined with yield estimates and forage quality measures to evaluate the effects of varying levels of manure application. Yield estimates, N content of grass, and the amount of N in soil and manure were monitored at each cutting for plots amended at different manure application rates. There are three major outcomes of this evaluation: (i) new grass seedings were at higher risk of elevated levels of nitrate N in forage; (ii) increased forage nitrate N at harvest was associated with malfermented silage and increased levels of ammonia N, which resulted in less efficient use of metabolizable protein for milk production; and (iii) increased understanding of N cycling between manure, soil, and plant provided an opportunity to reduce purchased fertilizer.

The P in these manure-impacted soils can be labile even years after abandonment and under conditions normally associated with high P stability. Failure of P to stabilize with time compounds the environmental consequences of dairy manure disposal, especially on sandy soils. The objectives of this study were to compare chemical characteristics of active and abandoned dairy manure-impacted soils and minimally impacted soils and to assess the continuous release of P in relation to sparingly soluble salts using repeated water extractions, X-ray diffraction, and speciation modeling of column leachates. Soil samples from Ap horizons were collected from nine highly manure-impacted (total P > 1000 mg P kg(-1) soil) areas on four active and five abandoned dairies and four minimally impacted soils (total P < 200 mg P kg(-1) soil). Soil extracts were analyzed for electrical conductivity (EC), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), Ca, Mg, Na, and K. The EC of the soil solutions decreased as active dairy > abandoned dairy > minimally impacted soils. Release of Mg and SRP were significantly correlated (r(2) = 0.68) and did not decline after abandonment; Ca release was not correlated with SRP (r(2) = 0.01), and declined significantly (P < 0.05) after abandonment. Speciation data from column leachates suggested that Mg-P phases and/or the most soluble Ca-P phases could control P solution activities. An implication of this study is that P stabilization via crystallization of calcium phosphates (even at near-neutral pH) may be preempted by Mg-P association. Thus, mechanisms to minimize P release may require P-retaining soil amendments or management of animal rations to eliminate Mg-P formation.

J	Schwartz, L; Shuman, LM				Schwartz, L; Shuman, LM			Predicting runoff and associated nitrogen losses from turfgrass using the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							NITRATE-NITROGEN; PHOSPHORUS; SIMULATIONS; PESTICIDE; NUTRIENT; DRAINAGE	Nitrogen fertilizers are used to maintain optimum turfgrass quality, but off-site movement of this primary nutrient can affect water quality. We conducted a 4-yr study (1998-2001) designed to measure nitrate N runoff from turfgrass, gathering data to be used in the model. The process-based Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) was used to predict nitrate associated with runoff from turfgrass. The measurements were made on 12 sloped (5%), 25-m(2) plots of 'Tifway' bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.], managed as golf course fairways and exposed to natural and simulated rainfall. Surface runoff volume and nitrate N loads were monitored after applying simulated rainfall at an average intensity of 27.4 mm h(-1). The irrigation occurred (25 or 50 mm) 4 through 168 It after treatment with various rates of N fertilizers for 1998-2001. RZWQM adequately simulated water runoff volumes (<19%; nonsignificant, paired t test) in the first three (normal or wet) years, but overpredicted (70%) in the fourth, dry year. RZWQM overpredicted nitrate N loads by a factor of 1.3 for the first three years (nonsignificant), and by a factor of almost 6 for the fourth year (highly significant). These overpredictions occurred when the runoff volumes and N loads were very small. The research has shown that refinements to RZWQM are needed for turfgrass management applications.

Marshes are effective for denitrification, with first order areal annual rate constants centered on thirty-four meters/year. Performance improves at higher water temperatures, with a modified Arrhenius temperature factor of 1.090. Performance also increases with increasing hydraulic efficiency, created by prevention of short-circuiting, and reflected in values of the tanks-in-series parameter N > 5. Higher efficiencies are associated with submergent and emergent soft tissue vegetation, and lower efficiencies with unvegetated open water and forested wetlands. Hydraulic loadings of 2-7 cm/day can produce 30% nitrate load reductions, over the temperature range 6-20 degrees C. Carbon availability limits denitrification at high nitrate loadings, however, wetlands produce carbon in sufficient quantities to support the loads anticipated in the upper midwest. The conversion of agricultural lands to treatment wetlands focused on nitrate reduction is termed nitrogen (N) farming. (D.H. Hey, Nitrogen farming: harvesting a different crop. Restoration Ecology, 2002, 10 (1), 1-11). A demonstration project is indicated to address local issues and scale-up considerations. Such a project would require thorough monitoring for the purpose of optimizing and refining design models. Significant ancillary benefits of ecological diversity and wildlife habitat are certain to accompany the project, but are of secondary importance until the water quality functions are demonstrated. Regulatory issues include permitting and wetland classification. Economic issues include proper pricing of services and methods of revenue generation. Resolution of these potential difficulties may require modification of existing policies and institutions.

In this study, the feasibility of using chitosan, a multifunctional environmentally friendly biopolymer, at different molecular weights to simultaneously remove various pollutants from the discharge of an eel culture pond is evaluated. Experimental results indicated chitosan with a high molecular weight was best at removing turbidity, suspended solids, and biological and chemical oxygen demand (BOD and COD). In contrast, chitosan of a low molecular weight excelled at removing NH3 and PO43- from wastewater. Additionally, chitosan with a high molecular weight did well at eliminating suspended solids of various particle sizes relative to chitosan with a low molecular weight. The best performance of chitosan in removing turbidity, suspended solids, BOD, COD, NH3, pO(4)(3-), and bacteria was 87.7 %, 62.6 %, 52.3 %, 62.8 %, 91.8 %, 99.1 %, and 99.998 % removal, respectively. When chitosan with a high molecular weight was added at 12 mg/L, the quality of treated wastewater successfully complied with government discharge standards. Furthermore, the relatively low bacteria amount in the wastewater after treatment with chitosan was confirmed by both the plate count method and molecular analysis technique.

Lake Erie total phosphorus loading analysis and update: 1996-2002	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH			English	Article						phosphorus; load estimation; Lake Erie; point source; nonpoint source	TRENDS; BASIN	The Lake Erie basin remains one of the most intensely monitored areas in the Great Lakes, largely because of continued interest by government agencies and the public in its trophic status. Total lake phosphorus loading estimates require data from three essential pathways: tributaries, point sources, and the atmosphere. Point source and atmospheric deposition monitoring results are available to allow continued estimation of these components. Several key watersheds are still being monitored, making some tributary load estimation possible. The problem is to make estimates for unmonitored areas, which are now substantially greater than encountered previously. Except for 2 years, the total annual load estimates for 1996-2002 (11,584, 16,853, 12,710, 6,608, 8,456, 7,333, and 9,733 metric tonnes per year, respectively) were near or substantially below the target load set by the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 11,000 metric tonnes per year. The estimates for 1997 and 1998 markedly exceeded the target load due mainly to elevated tributary loads because of heavy precipitation. The margin of error or half-width of approximate 95% confidence intervals varied from 4% to 11% of the total estimated load depending on year. Detailed tables of the yearly (1996-2002) estimates are provided, as well as summaries by Lake Erie sub-basin for 1981-2001.

Since 1990, some apparent trends in nutrient concentrations have been inconsistent with the predictions of models originally used to guide Lake Erie water quality management. We performed time trend analysis on total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a (Chl a), and dissolved reactive silica (DRS) measurements collected during spring and summer in the central basin of Lake Erie between 1983 and 2002. Three distinct time trends in basin-specific, station-averaged open-water TP concentrations were observed over the 20-year period: 1983-1989 decreases, 1990-1997 increases, and 1997-2001 decreases. Exceptionally high levels of turbidity and TP were observed in spring 2002, possibly reflecting increasing frequency of winter storm events. Open-water concentrations of TP declined during the 1980s as annual TP loadings to Lake Erie declined below the 11,000 metric ton target level that had been expected to reduce central basin eutrophication. This was accompanied by a significant increase in available silica and in Chl a concentrations. During the period 1990-2002, when dreissenid mussels were abundant, spring TP concentrations increased but summer TP concentrations declined. Unexpected increases in spring central basin concentrations of DRS (exceeding 1 mg/L) were observed. During the same period, Chl a concentrations declined in the spring and rose slightly during summer.

Blooms of Microcystis, a toxin-producing blue-green alga, became re-established in the bay after the zebra mussel invasion. Microcystis blooms had all but been eliminated in the early 1980s with controls on external phosphorus loadings, but have re-occurred in the bay most summers since 1992. An apparent paradox is that these recent Microcystis blooms have not been accompanied by increases in external phosphorus loadings. An ecosystem model was used to investigate whether the re-occurrence of Microcystis could be due to changes caused by zebra mussels that impacted phytoplankton community structure and/or internal phosphorus dynamics. The model was first used to establish baseline conditions in Saginaw Bay for 1991, before zebra mussels significantly impacted the system. The baseline model was then used to investigate: (1) the composite impacts of zebra mussels with average 1991-1995 densities; (2) sensitivity to changes in zebra mussel densities and external phosphorus loadings; and (3) three hypotheses on potential causative factors for proliferation of blue-green algae. Under the model assumptions, selective rejection of blue-green algae by zebra mussels appears to be a necessary factor in the enhancement of blue-green production in the presence of zebra mussels. Enhancement also appears to depend on the increased sediment-water phosphorus flux associated with the presence of zebra mussels, the magnitude of zebra mussel densities, and the distribution of zebra mussel densities among different age groups.

In recent years, there has been a perception that water quality has deteriorated in northern regions of the lake, with all increase in the frequency and intensity of toxin-producing cyanobacterial blooms. However, given the lack of long-term data these trends are difficult to verify. As a first step, we examine spatial and seasonal patterns in water quality in this highly complex lake on the Canadian Shield. Further, we examine surface sediment diatom assemblages across multiple sites to determine if they track within-take differences in environmental conditions. Our results show that there are significant spatial patterns in water quality in LOW. Principal Component Analysis divides the lake into three geographic zones based primarily on algal nutrients (i.e., total phosphorus, TP), with the highest concentrations at sites proximal to Rainy River. This variation is closely tracked by sedimentary diatom assemblages, with [TP] explaining 43% of the variation in diatom assemblages across sites. The close correlation between water quality and the surface sediment diatom record indicate that paleoecological models could be used to provide data on the relative importance of natural and anthropogenic sources of nutrients to the lake.

Despite this, trends of eutrophication are currently widespread due to recent intensification in agriculture. In order to better identify baseline productivity and establish long-term trends in lake trophic status, diatom-based transfer functions for productivity-related parameters were developed. Water quality data and surface sediment diatom assemblages from 53 lakes across the North and South Islands of New Zealand were analysed to determine species responses to the principal environmental gradients in the data set. Repeat sampling of water chemistry over a 12-month period enabled examination of species responses to annual means as well as means calculated for stratified and mixed periods. Variables found to be most strongly correlated with diatom species distributions were chlorophyll a (Chl a), total phosphorus (TP), dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), ionic concentration (measured as electrical conductivity (EC)) and pH. These variables were used to develop diatom-based transfer functions using weighted averaging regression and calibration (simple, tolerance down-weighted and with partial least squares algorithm applied). Overall, models derived for stratified means were weaker than those using annual or isothermal means. For specific variables, the models derived for the isothermal mean of EC (WA-tol r(jack)(2) = 0.79; RMSEP = 0.15 log(10) muS cm(-1)),the annual mean of pH (WA r(jack)(2) = 0.72; RMSEP = 0.25 pH units) and the isothermal mean of Chi a (WA r(jack)(2) = 0.71; RMSEP = 0.18 log(10) mg m(-3) Chi a) performed best. The models derived for TP were weak in comparison (for the annual mean of TP: WA r(jack)(2) = 0.50; RMSEP = 0.24 log(10) mg m(-3) TP) and residuals on estimates for this model were correlated with several other water quality variables, suggesting confounding of species responses to TP concentrations. The model derived for the isothermal mean of DRP was relatively strong (WA-tol r(jack)(2) = 0.78; RMSEP = 0.17 log(10) mg m(-3) DRP); however, residual values for this model were also found to be strongly correlated with several other water quality variables. It is concluded that the poor performance of the TP and DRP transfer functions relative to that of the Chi a model reflects the coexistence of nitrogen and phosphorus limitation within the lakes in the data set.

Intensive nutrient-management practices for potato cultivation have led to increased concerns about nitrate leaching in these soils. Studies on nitrogen (N) uptake characteristics of potato roots have shown that N fertilizers are applied in excess of the optimal rate for maximum yield. This paper discusses all current and relevant research on nutrient and water management issues that have lead to improved nitrogen use efficiency for successful potato production and minimized groundwater impacts. Specific topics within the nutrient-management section include mineral fertilizers, nutritional requirements, N uptake and the root system, slow and controlled-release fertilizers, organic sources of nutrients, and nitrification inhibitors. Research on alternate methods of irrigation currently in use and available for potato production is discussed. Application of prediction models to optimize all the components for sustaining both economical and environmental goals is also discussed, with an emphasis on the immediate need for linking nutrient management traditionally aimed at crop yields with the preservation of water quality in all future research programs.

J	Gitau, MW; Gburek, WJ; Jarrett, AR				Gitau, MW; Gburek, WJ; Jarrett, AR			A tool for estimating best management practice effectiveness for phosphorus pollution control	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						best management practice (BMP) effectiveness; BMP tool; cumulation; analyses	WATER-QUALITY IMPACTS; NUTRIENT LOSSES; SEDIMENT; RUNOFF; CONSERVATION; NITROGEN; MANURE; GRASS	A best management practice (BMP) tool was developed as a part of an effort to address the phosphorus (P) pollution and associated eutrophication problem affecting the Cannonsville Reservoir, part of the New York City water supply system. P reaching the reservoir is thought to emanate from runoff from the surrounding farms, mainly as a result of manure spread on these farms. Efforts to address the problem have involved implementation of BMPs on the watersheds; however, the effectiveness of these practices is not known. This, study establishes a means of estimating BMP effectiveness, based on data available in the literature, and develops a tool that allows users to obtain BMP effectiveness estimates for their respective site soil and slope conditions. The tool offers stand-alone capabilities and has the potential to be linked to a GIS. An example is presented to illustrate toot application for effectiveness-based BMP selection, with a focus on a farm within the New York City watersheds.

J	Torbert, HA; Harmel, RD; Potter, KN; Dozier, M				Torbert, HA; Harmel, RD; Potter, KN; Dozier, M			Evaluation of some phosphorus index criteria in cultivated agriculture in clay soils	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						manure management; phosphorus; rainfall simulation; surface runoff; water quality	GULF-OF-MEXICO; BIOAVAILABLE PHOSPHORUS; NUTRIENT RUNOFF; POULTRY LITTER; MANAGEMENT; QUALITY; CARBON; MANURE; SCALE; EUTROPHICATION	There are growing concerns regarding the fate of nutrients from land application of animal waste. In recent years, phosphorus (P) indices have been developed to provide information regarding nutrient loss potentials from animal waste application methods and topography. However, in many cases, these P indices have not been fully tested, especially in cultivated agriculture. Three factors commonly utilized in soil P indices for manure management are manure rate, manure incorporation, and slope. Rainfall simulations were conducted to examine the impact of these three factors on runoff losses of P on heavy clay soils under cultivated agriculture. Four manure litter (turkey titter) application rates (0, 4.5, 9.0, and 13.5 Mg ha(-1) (0, 2, 4, and 6 tons ac(-1))) were applied on two different slopes (5 and 9 percent) on a Heiden clay (fine, smectitic, thermic Udic Haplusterts). The litter was surface applied to a corn (Zeo mays L.) production area, with or without incorporation. The four application rates were also applied to a permanent bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.) pasture on a 5 percent slope. A rainfall simulator was used to generate water runoff for 30 minutes from 1.5 by 2.0 M (5 by 6.5 ft) plots. Runoff samples were analyzed for runoff volume, sediment, sediment nitrogen (N) and P, dissolved ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), and PO4-P. The results were analyzed using regression analysis techniques based on application rates. The dissolved NO3-N concentration was not affected by either litter incorporation or slope in the cultivated sites, but was greatly increased with increasing litter application rate in the pasture sites. Increased losses of dissolved NH4-N and PO4-P were observed with increasing litter application rate, with a significant reduction in tosses observed when litter was incorporated. However, increased slope did not significantly impact the level of runoff losses of dissolved NH4-N and PO4-P.

Evaluation of P indices is necessary to provide the basis of modification and improvement of their usefulness as P management tools. In this study, the ability of the Texas P index to estimate P loss potential was evaluated by comparison with measured annual P loads over three years on four new pasture and six new cultivated litter application sites in the Texas Blackland Prairie. The Arkansas and Iowa P indices were also evaluated. The Texas and Iowa versions were able to provide reasonable estimates of P toss potential as illustrated with significant linear relationships (p < 0.01) between P index values and measured annual P loads. In general, the P index values, Mehlich 3 soil test P, and poultry litter application rate were better correlated with dissolved P concentrations and loads (r(2) ranged from 0.12 to 0.91) than with total P and particulate P loads (r(2) ranged from 0.00-0.31). A major source of error in P index toad estimations was their inability to capture variability in annual soil erosion. This source of error was dramatically reduced by using measured erosion instead of estimated annual average erosion (average r(2) values increased from 0.24 to 0.58). White these results illustrate a potential for the P indices to make relative P loss assessments, research on incentives to prevent buildup of soil P levels, linkages between P levels in soils and receiving waters, and other important issues related to the use of P indices is warranted.

Quantitative study of gilvin production is difficult since gilvin is not a well defined substance. In the present study, leaf litter from four common tree species of south- western Australia were exposed to rainy weather for 183 days and leachate properties were monitored. The gilvin leaching from litter was estimated using a ' humic acid ( HA) equivalent ' concept, derived by drawing an analogy between the spectrophotometric properties of gilvin and that of humic acid. Gilvin (g(440), m(-1)) was leached from litter primarily during the first few weeks after the commencement of the wet season. On average, 13% less gilvin was leached under ' flooded ' conditions compared with ' non- flooded ' conditions. Litter leaching in the presence of soil caused a significant time lag ( about a month) for the peak load to occur, and reduced the total gilvin in the leachate through soil-litter interactions. Banksia menziesii leaves produced little gilvin, equivalent to 6.6% of that leached from the flooded gum. The Eucalyptus species, such as flooded gum and jarrah, common in wooded catchments in the region, appeared to be a major player producing yellow-coloured substances under annual rainfall conditions in south- western Australia.

J	Faithful, J; Finlayson, W				Faithful, J; Finlayson, W			Water quality assessment for sustainable agriculture in the Wet Tropics - A community-assisted approach	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference for Reef Research	MAR, 2004	Townsville, AUSTRALIA			Wet Tropics; nutrients; sediment; agricultural runoff; urban stormwater; flux	ACCUMULATION; CATCHMENT; SEDIMENT; RIVER; LAND	A number of studies in north Queensland over the past two decades have concluded that large amounts of nutrients and sediments are exported from agricultural watersheds, particularly during wet season rainfall events. With the co-operation of a number of growers, runoff from Queensland Wet Tropics banana and cane farm paddocks in two distinct tropical river catchments was examined to provide an estimate of nutrient and sediment concentrations and export, with comparison to water quality of flow through a small urban lakes system. Median total nitrogen concentrations in cane drainage runoff (3110 mu g N/L) were higher than for banana paddock drainage (2580 mu gN/L), although the maximum concentration was recorded from a banana paddock (20,900 mu g N/L). Nitrogen losses during post-event drainage flow were supplemented by high proportions of NOx (nitrate + nitrite) sourced from groundwater inputs. Banana paddocks had the highest maximum and median total phosphorus and TSS concentrations (5120 and 286 mu gP/L, and 7250 and 75 mg/L respectively) compared to the cane farms (1430 and 50 mu gP/L, and 1840 and 14 mg/L respectively). The higher phosphorus and TSS concentrations in the banana runoff were attributed to higher paddock slopes and a greater proportion of exposed ground surface during the wet season. Highest nutrient and TSS concentrations corresponded with samples collected near the peak discharge periods; however, the rising stage of the drainage flows, where the highest nutrient and TSS concentrations are often reported, were difficult to target because of the manual sampling strategy used. This study shows that high concentrations of nutrients and TSS occur in the runoff from cane and banana paddocks. Median total nitrogen, total phosphorus and TSS concentrations in flow through the urban lakes were 369 mu g N/L, 16 mu g P/L and I I mg/L, respectively. Flux estimates of 9.2 kgN, 0.8 kgP and 126 kgTSS/ha were determined for drainage runoff from a banana paddock during a single intensive storm event. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The current study compares water quality data (phytoplankton abundance and water clarity) from remote sensing with field sampling (continuous underway profiles of water quality and fixed site sampling) at different spatial scales in the Great Barrier Reef north of Mackay (20 degrees S). Five transects (20-30 km long) were conducted from clean oceanic water to the turbid waters adjacent to the mainland. The different data sources demonstrated high correlations when compared on a similar spatial scale (18 fixed sites). However, each data source also contributed unique information that could not be obtained by the other techniques. A combination of remote sensing, underway sampling and fixed stations will deliver the best spatial and temporal monitoring of water quality in the Great Barrier Reef. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In the case of nutrients, however, benthic organisms and communities are largely responding to materials which have cycled through and been transformed by pelagic communities dominated by rnicro-algae (phytoplankton), protozoa, flagellates and bacteria. Because GBR waters are characterised by high ambient light intensities and water temperatures, inputs of nutrients from both internal and external sources are rapidly taken up and converted to organic matter in inter-reefal waters. Phytoplankton growth, pelagic grazing and remineralisation rates are very rapid. Dominant phytoplankton species in GBR waters have in situ growth rates which range from similar to 1 to several doublings per day. To a first approximation, phytoplankton communities and their constituent nutrient content turn over on a daily basis. Relative abundances of dissolved nutrient species strongly indicate N limitation of new biomass formation. Direct (N-15) and indirect (C-14) estimates of N demand by phytoplankton indicate dissolved inorganic N pools have turnover times on the order of hours to days. Turnover times for inorganic phosphorus in the water column range from hours to weeks. Because of the rapid assimilation of nutrients by plankton communities, biological responses in benthic communities to changed water quality are more likely driven (at several ecological levels) by organic matter derived from pelagic primary production than by dissolved nutrient stocks alone.

J	Islam, MS				Islam, MS			Nitrogen and phosphorus budget in coastal and marine cage aquaculture and impacts of effluent loading on ecosystem: review and analysis towards model development	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN			English	Article						nutrient budget; effluent nutrient loading; cage aquaculture; nitrogen; phosphorus; FCR; mariculture	NET-PEN CULTURE; ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT; RAINBOW-TROUT; ORGANIC ENRICHMENT; CHEMICAL FLUXES; MASS BALANCES; WATER-QUALITY; FISH CULTURE; RED TIDE; POLLUTION	Being an essentially open system, cages are usually characterized by a high degree of interaction with environment and cage systems are highly likely to produce large bulk of wastes that are released directly into the environment. Therefore, large-scale cage aquaculture development has been put into question and concerns have been raised that cage aquaculture produces large bulk of wastes that are rich in organic matter and nutrients and are released into coastal and nearshore environment. Recent information on cage aquaculture nutrient budget is scarce and most published reports are dated. This paper reviews cage aquaculture nutrient budget and nutrient loadings and propose a model for nutrient (nitrogen, N and phosphorus, P) budget in a hypothetical cage aquaculture farm with values of feed loss, FCR (feed conversion ratio) and nutrient contents in feed and fish taken from published literature in order to calculate the amount (kg) of N and P produced and released to the environment for each ton of fish produced. The paper proposes, in addition, a critically analyzed nutrient budget based on the dry matter conversion rate instead of the usual feed conversion rate. The conceptual model shows that 132.5 kg N and 25.0 kg P are released to the environment for each ton of fish produced; these values are as high as 462.5 kg N and 80.0 kg P when calculated on the basis of dry matter conversion rate instead of usual feed conversion rate. Thus, the annual global N and P loadings from cage aquaculture (10,000 tons fish and 3000 tons dry matter) are 1325 tons N and 250 tons P and 1387.5 tons N and 240.0 tons P based on usual feed conversion rate and dry matter conversion rate respectively. The paper also proposes, by analyzing the existing data, an FCR-based regression model for predicting nutrient loadings for a given diet. Finally, attempt was made to calculate the annual global loading and release of N and P from cage aquaculture to the coastal and marine environment, the potential impacts of nutrient loading on the ecosystem were discussed and critical points to be considered for minimizing nutrient output in cage aquaculture were suggested.

The derivation of the functional groups consists of a classification of phytoplankton primarily based on taxonomy with some refinements by easily accessible properties and an aggregation of these classes into five functional groups based on an analysis of seasonal Occurrence in three lakes. The calibrated model qualitatively represents the pattern of the functional groups shown in the data from Lake Zurich. It was shown that modelling of observed functional groups in Lake Zurich is possible, as well as modelling of total algae. The sum of the biomasses of all functional groups is more robust to changes in kinetic parameters than the biomasses of the groups. Thus, the division of total biomass into functional groups makes the model results more sensitive to kinetic parameters. This indicates higher prediction uncertainty with respect to functional groups than with respect to total biomass. Light intensity and edibility are the most important influence factors in the model. Also sedimentation velocity turned out to have a large influence on the model results.

Use of Recurrent ANN and Hybrid EA for the Prediction of Phytoplankton Abundance and Succession Before and After Eutrophication Control of Two Shallow Lakes	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			Recurrent supervised ANN; hybrid evolutionary algorithms; rule sets; forecasting; eutrophication control; phytoplankton succession	NEURAL-NETWORK	Eleven years of water quality time-series of the two Dutch lakes Veluwemeer and Wolderwijd were subject to predictive modelling by recurrent supervised artificial neural networks (RNN) and hybrid evolutionary algorithms (HEA). The modeling aimed at forecasting changes of the phytoplankton community in response to the control of external nutrient loadings and fish abundances as consecutively implemented to both lakes since 1979. The water quality time-series of both lakes were structured for the RNN and HEA modeling in order to reflect following three different management periods by both training and validation datasets: no management (1976-1978), lake flushing and waste water treatment (1979 onwards) and lake flushing, waste water treatment and food web manipulation (1991-1993). This approach facilitated a comparative analysis for the two lakes and the three management periods. Firstly recurrent RNN achieved reasonably accurate results for 5-days-ahead forecasting of abundances of blue-green algae Oscillatoria and green algae Scenedesmus in both lakes. Secondly hybrid evolutionary algorithms (HEA) achieved similar good forecasting results but also provided model representations for both algae species in the form of rule sets. HEA has been designed to evolve both the structure of rule sets as well as the parameter values imbedded in the rule sets by means of a genetic algorithms. With regards to the different approaches for eutrophication management the modeling results have shown that only the combination of external nutrient control with food web manipulation has changed the lakes from hypereutrophic to mesotrophic conditions reflected by the change from the dominance of blue-green algae Oscillatoria to the dominance of green algae Scenedesmus. Even though both modeling techniques have forecasted the succession of two functional algal groups represented by Oscillatoria and Scenedesmus only HEA provides rule sets for the explanation of these ecological changes. The results revealed that phosphorus limitation by means of seasonal lake flushing and wastewater treatment in combination with increased zooplankton grazing by food-web manipulation diminished the abundance of the harmful Oscillatoria but enhanced the abundance of harmless Scenedesmus. These findings consent well with literature findings e. g. by Benndorf (1995) that the eutrophic lakes requires primarily efficient nutrient control that secondarily can be finetuned by food-web manipulation.

Ordination, clustering and forecasting of phytoplankton dynamics in the Myponga drinking water reservoir by means of supervised and non-supervised artificial neural networks	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			Algal blooms; artificial neural networks; drinking water reservoir; forecasting; ordination and clustering		In order to minimize water quality problems caused by cyanobacteria blooms, it is desirable to either operationally control or prevent them. Computational modelling using artificial neural networks (ANN) is one way to contribute to both. It enables not only the forecasting of growing algal population abundances several days in advance, but also a better understanding of both processes and environmental conditions that accelerate algal growth and response behaviour of algal populations to different management. Appropriate measures can then be determined and implemented to control the growth of algal populations before they reach bloom proportions. A new approach using both supervised artificial neural networks (SNN) and non-supervised artificial neural networks (NSNN) was applied as a framework to explore 20 years of water quality time-series from the Myponga Reservoir, South Australia, for knowledge discovery and forecasting of phytoplankton dynamics. The Myponga Reservoir has a history of summer blooms of the toxic cyanobacteria Anabaena. Anatoxin-a, produced and released by Anabaena, not only disintegrates aquatic food chains bottom up but also imposes costs for water treatment and restrictions on water consumption. In order to prevent summer algal blooms in the Myponga Reservoir artificial mixing has been implemented as an operational control measure since the 1980s. In the present study, firstly recurrent SNN demonstrated their capability to perform 7-days-ahead forecasting of timing and magnitudes of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) for two years of unseen data, which were different in management. Secondly, the combination of ordination by NSNN and sensitivity analysis by SNN revealed relationships between water temperature, PO(4)-P and NO(3)-N concentrations and Chl-a dynamics. Finally, ordination and clustering of four 2-year-periods of water quality time series, which differed in intensity and methods of artificial mixing, provided insights into effects of management on chemical and biological water quality properties. Results of the Chl-a forecasting by SNN demonstrated that using PO(4)-P, NO(3)-N, water temperature and turbidity as input variables only allowed forecasting of basic trends in Chl-a dynamics. The integrated application of NSNN and SNN demonstrated that qualitative relationships between water quality parameters discovered by ordination and clustering could be quantitatively determined by sensitivity analyses. It revealed specific temperature and nutrient ranges that favour phytoplankton growth. NSNN applied to the more complex task of examining water quality changes between periods of years with different management regimes indicated that both seasonal shifts as well as changed magnitudes of nutrients, metals and Chl-a occurred in response to periods with stratification and changed mixing strategies. It can be concluded from this study that the combined applications of SNN and NSNN provide a useful framework not only for forecasting phytoplankton dynamics but also explaining complex ecological relationships driving these dynamics. The so gained information can facilitate early warning and improve causal understanding of algal blooms.

Using E2 To Model The Impacts Of Bushfires On Water Quality In South-Eastern Australia	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			catchment modelling; E2; water quality; bushfire; land use change		Approximately 1.3 million ha of forested and agricultural land in eastern Victoria, Australia, was burnt by bushfires in early 2003. The impact of these fires on the water quality in rivers and storages has the potential to be significant. This paper describes a modelling process to assess the impacts of the fires on water quality of receiving waters and river systems in the fire-affected catchments. More specifically, this study set out to; 1. Construct and parameterise models using the E2 catchment modelling framework to represent the flow, and sediment and nutrient loads for the water storages and river systems in fire-affected catchments in eastern Victoria. 2. Assess the likely impacts of the fires on loads of total suspended sediments (TSS), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in the water storages and rivers of the fire-affected catchments. E2 is a modelling framework that provides a flexible approach to whole-of-catchment modelling. It allows the creation of integrated models through the process of selection and linkage of component models. E2 may be configured to predict flow and constituent sediments and nutrient loads at any point in a river network over time. Digital elevation models (DEM) of the four catchments were imported into E2, and sub-catchment boundaries were delineated. Rainfall surfaces derived from spatial interpolation of ground-based observation data onto a 5 km x 5 km grid was pre-processed to provide a weighted average daily rainfall for each sub-catchment. Data of long term mean monthly potential evapotranspiration (PET) was also used as inputs to the rainfall-runoff models. Model parameters were determined by calibration against observed flows at stream gauging stations. Digitised landuse layers were reclassified in E2 to form three functional units (FU's); Forest, Agriculture and Other. A second digitised landuse layer incorporating the burnt areas was imported into the model to create a 'burnt' scenario. Values of constituent concentration (for dry weather concentration, DWC, and event mean concentration, EMC) were applied to each FU so that predicted loads equalled the loads calculated from pre- and post-fire water quality data at monitoring stations within each catchment. Pre- and post-fire loads of TSS, TN and TP predicted by the model at points of interest (catchment outlets and water storages) were then compared in terms of the relative long term changes (rather than absolute changes) in loads. These predictions of load increases carry important assumptions and limitations including; outputs are long term averages, no allowance has been made for changes in streamflow, for recovery of vegetation, or for the storage, deposition or remobilisation of sediments and nutrients. Furthermore, there are uncertainties with the constituent data used to calibrate the model, assumptions were made when assigning values of DWC and EMC to FU's, and assumptions were made on behaviour of constituents in water storages. Proportional increases in loads at the catchment outlets were generally smaller than increases observed at the water quality monitoring sites. These differences reflect the proximity of the monitoring stations to the burnt areas, the total percentage of catchment burnt, and the amount of rainfall. The model predicted that, compared to pre-fire conditions, the Ovens, Kiewa, Hume and Snowy catchments would deliver, on average, approximately 27 times greater TSS, 4.9 times greater TN, and 7.9 times the amount of TP.

Using a Catchment Water Quality Model to Quantify the Value of an Ecosystem Service	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			Catchment modelling; EMSS; ecosystem services; water quality models		The development of catchment modelling tools has gained considerable momentum through the Cooperative Research Centre for Catchment Hydrology's Catchment Modelling Toolkit. This repository of models (see www.toolkit.net.au) allows the modeller to select the most appropriate tools with which to best represent their catchment and associated constituent processes. While this has improved the ability to predict catchment runoff and pollutant loads, it has also presented an opportunity to use these tools in ways they may not have been initially designed for. The application of these models and their further development has usually been driven by the need to support decision-making processes by land management agencies. The outcomes of the water quality models however, which typically represent constituent generation and transport processes, are usually only one of a range of factors considered in those processes and usually the one with the most science and predictive accuracy. Whilst this may be sufficient for some agencies, it is also considerable more appropriate to present economic and social implications of the implementation of management actions. Ecosystem services and their valuation are seen as a potential solution to the economic descriptors required in decision-making processes. Ecosystem services have been defined as the transformation of natural assets into things that can be attributed with an economic value. The implementation of management actions can therefore be ascribed an economic value if they are seen introducing or enhancing an existing ecosystem service. In the case of the project described, the implementation of riparian revegetation could be associated with savings in water treatment costs where that revegetation was effective in reducing suspended sediment loads being delivered to downstream water treatment plants. The Lockyer Creek catchment in South East Queensland is dominated by agricultural activities and is heavily extracted. The riparian zone has largely been cleared as part of those activities and large quantities of water are extracted from waterways within the catchment. As such, Lockyer Creek itself flows rarely, however when it does flow, it is responsible for delivering significant quantities of suspended sediment and associated turbidity to the raw water supply of the Mt Crosby potable water treatment plants. Water treatment costing data was obtained for the treatment plants at Mt Crosby however the use of this data was constrained due to its commercial sensitivity. Analysis of this data however, showed that a statistical relationship was valid between raw water supply turbidity and monthly treatment cost. This relationship was then used to determine likely costs savings due to the suspended solids mitigation of effective riparian vegetation to demonstrate the likely value, as savings in water treatment cost, of the ecosystem service that may be provided by the vegetation within the Lockyer Creek Catchment. The EMSS model was one tool available with which to undertake the analysis of riparian vegetation in reducing suspended sediment loads. Developed by the Cooperative Research Centre for Catchment Hydrology, the EMSS is a node-link style catchment model which can predict suspended solids, nitrogen and phosphorus at any point within a waterway or catchment. To determine the value of the ecosystem service provided by riparian vegetation, results from EMSS were used to determine reduction in total suspended solids concentrations from the implementation of riparian revegetation in all streams within the catchment. This showed likely savings in water treatment cost up to $20,000 per month and could therefore be attributed as the ecosystem service value of having 100% of the riparian zones within the Lockyer Creek catchment being effective for reduction of suspended solids. The use of catchment models such as EMSS have shown that having access to a toolkit of models provides the basis of predictive modelling to support more holistic decision-making rather than simply the water quality predictions that these models have been design for.

Implementing the Riparian Nitrogen Model to assess the role of riparian buffers in the Maroochy Catchment	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			modelling; riparian buffers; water quality; denitrification; nitrate	NITRATE; DENITRIFICATION; DYNAMICS; SCALE; ZONE	Riparian zones can provide a protective buffer between streams and adjacent land-based activities by removing nitrate from shallow groundwater flowing through them. Catchment-scale water-quality models are useful tools for predicting catchment behaviour under various climatic conditions and land-use scenarios. In this paper, we use the Riparian Nitrate Model (RNM) to investigate the potential role for riparian zones in the Maroochy catchment to reduce nitrate loads to streams. The RNM operates as a filter (plug-in) module within E2; the latter is a node-link catchment-scale model capable of predicting the hydrologic behaviour of catchments. We model sub-catchment processes in E2 by a combination of three types of processes: runoff generation, constituent generation, and filtering. Firstly, rainfall-runoff is modelled using SIMHYD, which has already been successfully applied in Australian catchments. Secondly, we use a simple constituent (or contaminant; nitrate in this case) generation model; this model uses two generation-processes, namely, the event mean concentration applied to surface flow, and the dry weather concentration applied to base flow. Thirdly, the RNM is used to estimate the removal of nitrate via denitrification as shallow groundwater interacts with riparian soils. The RNM is most suitably applied in riparian buffers belonging to low-and middle-order streams; we consider the removal of nitrate in perennial middle-order streams via two mechanisms: firstly, as base flow intercepts the root zone before discharging into a stream, and secondly, as stream water is temporarily stored in the bank during flood events. The nitrate load removed via each mechanism is estimated using 1(st) order decay kinetics. The kinetics vary with the depth to groundwater, flood event size and duration, slope and width of the riparian zone, vegetation type, denitrification potential, and soil hydraulic parameters. In this paper we investigate the sensitivity of nitrate loads in streams to various model parameters and then demonstrate the impacts of re-vegetation and/or land clearing in the catchment. Sensitivity analysis for the base flow component has shown that as the distribution of denitrification potential (which correlates with availability of dissolved carbon) down the soil profile becomes more non-linear, it becomes more sensitive to rooting depth. Denitrification during bank storage is reduced dramatically as the floodplain slopes up to 3 degrees; the sensitivity increases during larger flood events. The modelling results for the Maroochy catchments have shown that the optimum rooting depth is 2-3 m and that increasing the riparian buffer width beyond 10 m results in minimal benefits. For the current denitrification rates used in this paper, the riparian buffers have the capacity to remove up to 20% of the nitrate load in the Maroochy sub-catchments. Normalising the potential nitrate removal capacity in a sub-catchment with respect to total length of the stream network enables us to quantify the capacity of a unit length of riparian buffer to remove nitrate; this attribute can then be used to prioritise riparian restoration, i.e., maximise the benefits per dollar spent. The modelling exercise also resulted in maps that identify Maroochy sub-catchments that will most likely benefit from re-vegetation and others that will be most adversely affected by land clearing activities.			david.rassam@csiro.au	Pagendam, Daniel E/B-1683-2010; Rassam, David/B-4617-2009	Pagendam, Daniel E/0000-0002-8347-4767; 			ARGENT RM, 2005, E2 USER GUIDE; Band LE, 2001, HYDROL PROCESS, V15, P2013, DOI 10.1002/hyp.253; BROLGER P, 1999, 0399 LWRRDC; Burt TP, 2002, J HYDROL, V265, P129, DOI 10.1016/S0022-1694(02)00102-6; Chiew F.

A Decision Support System For Integrated River Basin Management Of The German Elbe	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			DSS; River Basin Management; Water Quality; Integrated Modelling		Water resources management on the river-basin scale as requested by the European Water Framework Directive is a highly complex task: not only the complex network of interdependencies of elements of the natural, ecological and socio-economical systems and their linkage but also the interests of various stakeholder groups must be taken into account. For this purpose a decision support system for integrated river basin management of the German part of the Elbe river basin (Elbe-DSS) has been developed, which involves taking into account water quantity, chemical quality, and ecological status of surface waters. Starting from identification of user needs by repeated consultation of stakeholders a list of management objectives, measures, and external scenarios turned out, which was taken as the basis for the DSS development. A comprehensive system analysis was carried out to meet the various spatial and temporal scales when dealing with hydrologic, ecologic, economic, and social aspects related to water quantity, quality and ecological status (Matthies et al. 2005). The system is build up by integrating only already existing models and data. System and software design are strongly oriented on management tasks: starting from selected management objectives the effects of external scenarios of climate, agro economic and demographic change, and selected measures to achieve the desired state of good water quantity and quality can be investigated. Analysis tools are integrated to assist the user in evaluating the various management options. The system is implemented by using DSS-generator Geonamica (R) developed by Research Institute of Knowledge Systems (RIKS) (Hahn and Engelen 2000), which is also used in other DSS projects (Oxley et al. 2004). The implemented measures on catchment scale can be classified into the groups 'reduction of pollution from urban areas', 'modification of agricultural land allocation', 'changes in agricultural practices and 'political and legislative requirements concerning nutrient surplus'. This paper focuses on water quality related questions on the catchment level. The effects of selected management options on the management objective 'reduction of nutrient loads' are presented to demonstrate how the DSS can be used for strategic management tasks as well as for participation and negotiation processes. The results indicate the different effects of each simulated measure on nitrogen and phosphorus inputs and concentrations in the river system. It could also be shown that efficiency of measures tend to show varying spatial patterns. The same holds for the simulated climate change scenarios where positive or negative effects depend on local and regional conditions. In the final version tools for economical evaluation of measures will also be implemented to assess cost effectiveness of management options.

Modeling Impacts Of Forest Management Practices On Water And Nitrogen Fluxes Within A First-Order Catchment	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			ammonium; boreal; clear-cutting; ditch network maintenance; DON; nitrate	SOIL; HYDROLOGY; DYNAMICS; CARBON	Forest management practices such as clear-cutting, site preparation, ditching, and ditch network maintenance increase nitrogen (N) load to streams. In environmentally sustainable forestry, water protection actions are required to decrease the nutrient loading. These include e. g. use of uncut buffer zones between a clear-cut area and a waterbody, sedimentation ponds in the ditch network and overland flow fields. In practical forestry, there is an increasing need for developing design criteria for effective protective actions. Clearly, the efficiency of a protective construction depends on a complex interaction between the catchment, the treatment area, atmosphere, vegetation, microbes and soil. We constructed a modeling tool (KUNTO) by integrating hydrological, ecological and water quality models. KUNTO describes a forested first-order catchment as a two-dimensional simplification (Fig. 1). The area of the first-order catchments may vary from tens of hectares to a few square kilometers. Boreal forested catchments usually contain upland mineral soil areas and peatland areas. Peatland areas can be ditched to enhance forest growth. The development of KUNTO aims at combining computation schemes that describe the most important processes controlling the N export from a catchment. The models associated with KUNTO describe hydrological processes above the soil surface and along the hillslope. Net primary production and litter input to soil are described for trees and ground vegetation. Decomposition of organic matter on upland mineral soil and on peatsoil are assessed with separate submodels. Nitrification, denitrification, N uptake and transport with surface and ground waters, retention of N in soils, immobilisation of N into litter and logging residues are also calculated. Water and N input from different parts of the catchment are fed into an outlet stream or ditch network, where erosion, transport of suspended solids and sedimentation are calculated. With KUNTO we can assess the impacts of cutting, site preparation, ditching and ditch network maintenance on N export to water bodies and on catchment N fluxes. Furthermore, we can assess efficiency of buffer zones and sedimentation ponds. [GRAPHICS] Figure 1. In KUNTO, the catchment is described as a two dimensional simplification: Upland mineral soil and pristine peatland areas form a hillslope extending from catchment border to the outlet. Ditched peatland areas are represented as single columns connected to the ditch network.

Uncertainty Transformation in Ecological Simulation Models	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			Model uncertainty; Sensitivity analysis; Compartment model; Water flow; Water quality		Being simplified representations of reality, simulation models can never be perfect and their results are always somewhat uncertain. That is why quantification of model uncertainty is important during interpretation of simulation results in decision making process. Uncertainty describes deviations of simulated ecosystem's characteristics from known or observed values. Several sources contribute to such deviations including those associated with main model components such as forcing functions, mathematical formulae, parameters and universal constants and intrinsic model features. Model uncertainty can be evaluated based on its linear estimate under the assumption that all sources of uncertainty are independent. Traditional approaches to investigating model uncertainty consider individual sources whose contribution to the uncertainty can be quantified for a given task. Although the result is incomplete it helps to improve the understanding of the model and increase the confidence in simulation results. One of the most investigated sources of model uncertainty is errors in a model's supporting data. The paper describes this type of uncertainty and how it is transformed into simulation results. Propagation of this type of model uncertainty through the model was investigated based on a simulation model developed for water quality assessment in the mouth of a large river. The model was created using simulation framework which consists of at least two independent modules. Each module describes specific groups of processes, e. g., hydrological processes or hydrochemical and hydrobiological processes. Interactions of processes from different groups are modeled by passing simulation results from one module to another. The hydrodynamic module is built as channel junction computational network based on equations of continuity and momentum in integral form. Each junction in this module corresponds to a homogeneous compartment of water quality module where chemical and biological processes take place. The water quality module describes phytoplankton dynamics, organic matter and nutrients transformation and uptake. These processes are modeled by ordinary differential equations. Channels carry interactions of compartments, that involve water and ingredients exchange. Simulations were aimed at detection of crucial parameters of the ecosystem and evaluation of uncertainty in simulation of phytoplankton biomass during vegetation. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to reveal the most critical parameters of hydrodynamic and water quality modules. It appeared that hydrodynamic module is sensitive to the lower boundary condition of the modeled portion of the river. Variations of this condition within 10% caused up to 60% variations in water redistribution between river branches. In general, it is expected that if model components are sensitive to some subcomponents, then model state variables are also sensitive to these components. Therefore, the high uncertainty of the hydrodynamic module raised an expectation that water quality characteristics in the investigated portion of the river, and particularly phytoplankton biomass, are also simulated with a high level of uncertainty caused by errors in lower boundary hydrodynamic condition. Simulation experiments showed, however, that propagated variations in water flow characteristics were reduced to 2% deviations of phytoplankton biomass in water quality module. The case study presented illustrates the ability of one module of the model to absorb the uncertainty of another module. A similar effect can be observed for another dynamic model built upon differential equations, and applied within the same or similar framework. The structural stability of the module accepting parameters supplied by other modules (from the same model) can improve simulation results significantly.

Neural Network Based Sensitivity Analysis of Natural Resource Models	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			Sensitivity analysis; Artificial neural networks; Natural resource modelling; Water resources management		The management of hydrologic catchments typically faces the challenge of keeping a reasonable balance between water quality demands and farming restrictions. In order to handle this problem it is most important to identify farming areas whose land use have a high influence on the nutrient leaching into the receiving stream. This identification can be regarded as a sensitivity analysis (SA). Changes in the land use of farming areas with high sensitivity usually promise an adequate relation between costs and benefits. In order to indentify sensitive farming areas, the processes responsible for nitrogen cycling and transport must be modelled first. Then a sensitivity analysis of the resulting model can be performed. Unlike a SA of a model's output towards a small number of calibration parameters, this task is of exceptional complexity. Not only is the number of parameters that have to be considered proportional to the number of spatial model entities and thus possibly much higher. A SA regarding spatially distributed parameters becomes even more complicated if dependencies between parameters in our case the catchment topology - must be considered. In this case all parameters have to be looked at simultaneously which leads to a massively multidimensional SA. For the catchment the problem arises when accounting for the lateral transport of water and nitrogen between farming areas. The simulation of these tranport processes is of high importance when looking at water and substances in mesoscale catchments. We have developed a neural network based methodology (goal directed distributed SA - GDSA) which is suited to solve this problem. Given a distributed natural resource model that is suited to simulate nitrogen cycling and transport our GDSA comprises two steps: First a representation of the natural resource model is contributed in the form of a special neural network (HydroNet). Then the computational properties of the HydroNet are used to make a sensitivity analysis of the network model and thus of the natural resource model. In order to show the power of the GDSA approach, we applied it to the problem of reducing nitrogen leaching from farming areas into a drinking water reservoir. As a first step, the model WASMOD (water and substance simulation model) was used to simulate the processes responsible for nitrogen cycling and tranport in a distributed manner. Then the resulting model was mapped onto the HydroNet in order to apply our neural network based SA method. The results of the GDSA application to the WASMOD model show that our HydroNet is capable of representing the relationship between the distributed fertilization inputs to farming areas and the nitrogen discharge to the receiving stream nearly as well as WASMOD. The average yearly nitrogen outputs from single areas and the whole catchment calculated by the HydroNet deviate only marginally from those calculated by the physically based model WASMOD. The GDSA was also able to correctly predict those model entities that have a high influence to the nitrogen discharge modelled by WASMOD. We also compared our GDSA approach to two conventional approaches for the solution of the above-mentioned management problem. The comparison shows that it is necessary to incorporate topological information because it has a major influence on the quality of the results. GDSA therefore seems to be a good choice of method in cases where many interdependent parameters have to be accounted for.

Study Present Measurement Strategies And The Application Of The SWAT Model For Its Suitability To The European Water Framework Directive (EU-WFD) Within A Large-Scale Catchment In Germany	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			European Water Framework Directive; Water Quality assessment; SWAT		The European Water Framework Directive (EU-WFD), implemented in the year of 2000, requires the general ecological protection and a minimum chemical standard to be achieved in all European surface waters based on the watershed scale. All member states of the EU mandate to develop river basin management action plans to achieve these goals within the year of 2015. In Germany, this procedure is regulated by several administrative units through the legislation of federation and state laws defining different stages of responsibility. Thereby the administration is positioned by the spatial scale of 10 major water basins (Danube, Rhine, Maas, Ems, Weser, Elbe, Eider, Oder, Schlei/Trave and Warnow/Peene). Being part of the Elbe River system the 843 km(2) Gera catchment was selected for a pilot study. The study was announced by the 'Thuringian environmental, agency' (TLUG) to develop a method to target the aims of the EU-WFD for establishing a good water quality within one of the main tributaries of the Elbe River. The Gera basin is located in the Thuringian middle mountain range area of Germany. Physiographic and climatic factors, such as topography, landuse and soils as well as precipitation varying strongly. They are resulting in a highly complex of variable water and nutrients turnover processes. One of the main water quality problems occuring in the Gera basin is related to nutrients. Therefore the main goal of this pilot study was to assess the suitability of the available data bases for achieving the goals of the EU-WFD in case of nitrogen. The study was applied for the Gera catchment by (i) Evaluation of the feasibility of the present data related monitoring system for providing spatial informations on the detecting of local water quality areas and their relation to sources of pollution; (ii) Applying the SWAT model to regionalise areas contributing a high release of nitrogen to the Gera River by utilising basin related spatial informations; (iii) Investigation and assessment of comparability of monitoring and model application for accomplishing the goals of the EU-WFD. In summary it can be concluded that the present monitoring system of the Gera River system has to be improved (frequency and number of gauging stations) for Phase II of the EU-WFD according to the proposed areas through applying the SWAT model. Although it has to be pointed out that modeling results have to be improved this application has tested to be suitable for identifying key system properties of spatial and temporal variability of nutrient release within the catchment. This knowledge is of highly importance if dealing with the development and the assessment of management action plans according to the Phase III of the EU-WFD.

An Approach To Assess And Manage Nutrient Loads In Two Coastal Catchments Of The Eurobodalla Region, NSW, Australia	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			water quality; nitrogen; phosphorus; catchment modelling; nutrient export; nutrient budget	RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODEL; GRAZED PASTURE; NITROGEN; PHOSPHORUS; FRAMEWORK; IMPACTS	This paper describes a research programme to estimate nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sediment event-based loads in the Moruya and Tuross River catchments of the New South Wales south coast. The research programme is designed within the context of an integrated catchment modelling framework (CatchMODS), to assess relative contributions from diffuse sources of nutrient and sediment export loads, and provide information for catchment management. In particular, the relative potential risk to water quality from dairying in the Eurobodalla region is being evaluated using a farm-scale nutrient budget approach. Predominant land uses in the Moruya and Tuross River catchments are conservation and production forests, national parks, cattle grazing, and dairy production. There is little information on the quality of water entering the catchment estuaries, particularly during storm events when the majority of sediment and nutrients is transported to estuaries. The use of catchment models is commonly required to assist catchment managers to investigate water quality impacts at a catchment scale due to cost restrictions and data availability. To assess nutrient and sediment loads and enable management to achieve sustainable practices, the CatchMODS model is linked with a field-based data collection programme including water quality sampling to estimate suspended sediment, and total and dissolved nutrient loads on an event basis. Potential sources of nutrients in the catchments are likely to include diffuse forest and agricultural inputs and gully erosion. Diffuse source pastoral agriculture has been linked to decreases in water quality and recreational use of surface waters. To assess the potential impact of dairying, an evaluation of nutrient inputs and outputs, including leaching/runoff losses using a nutrient budget approach for a typical dairy farm in the Eurobodalla region, was undertaken. The Overseer (R) nutrient budget model was used. Farms were divided into relatively homogeneous management areas, namely irrigated-block, non-irrigated and effluent-application areas for use in the model. The model produces nutrient budget inputs and outputs for a range of nutrients for the farm as a whole and for each individual management block. Initial results in this paper indicate N fertiliser usage on the dairy farms in this region is relatively low. Results indicate whole-farm long-term dairy farm leaching losses were 11 kg N/ha/year, which are considered low relative to other published studies. The overall whole-farm long-term leaching/runoff losses for P were estimated at 1.4 kg P/ha/year. Predicted whole-farm N concentration in drainage water at current average fertiliser usage is 3 ppm. This concentration is less than the guideline maximum for drinking water, although environmental acceptability depends on the sensitivity of receiving waters. In contrast, the simulated drainage N concentrations are greater than the guideline for lowland rivers in southeast Australia. Further evaluation of soil information, nutrient management and subsequent implications for water quality in the catchments as a whole is being investigated.	[Drewry, John J.; Newham, Lachlan T.

Estimating The Importance Of Topological Routing For Modelling Water And Nitrogen Transport At Catchment Scale	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			Nitrogen transport; Watershed modelling; Water quality; Water management	DYNAMICS	The catchment management of reservoirs for drinking water supply not only requires knowledge about the nitrogen discharge of every agricultural field. In order to recommend changes in land use management it is much more important to evaluate its influence to the nitrogen concentration in the reservoir. In order to achieve this the influence of processes that take place during transport must be considered. The transport of mineral nitrogen is associated with water fluxes in the landscape i.e. transport is closely linked to the discharge components surface runoff, interflow and groundwater flow. In the case of surface runoff and interflow, nutrients are passed to subsequent areas where they can be processed by soil processes and plant uptake. These effects are well investigated mainly for riparian zones but not for the hill slope. In order to estimate the influence of lateral transport processes we applied the Water and Substance Model (WASMOD) (Reiche 1996), which explicitly simulates routing between single model units down to the receiving stream. We simulated two scenarios for a mesoscale catchment. In the first scenario, the routing was properly simulated by the model. In the second case we cut the routing and directed the discharge directly to the receiving stream. To evaluate the effects of these two scenarios we compared the modelled runoff and nitrogen load to measured data on the catchment scale. Additionally, we compared the model results to measured soil suction at two hill slope catenas equipped with 48 tensiometers. The comparison of the modelled scenarios showed that the water and nitrogen loads were affected by the routing in different manners. In the case of water, we found only minor differences between the two versions. In general the results of the version with routing are slightly better. This holds for every considered parameter. For the case with routing the soil moisture is higher than in the case without routing. These higher values fit better to the measured data. In the case of runoff we gain only a small improvement by the use of routing while its dynamic is quite similar. In the case of nitrogen the results were quite different. In the scenario without routing, the loads were significantly overestimated (by 90 %), whereas in the scenario with routing only a slight overestimation (by 11.9 %) was found. The dynamic of the nitrogen load was slightly improved with routing as well. The reason for this big difference in the nitrogen load is the possible plant uptake in the downstream polygons on one hand. On the other hand, the conditions of the model were generally wetter in the case with routing. This higher wetness led to higher denitrification losses because denitrification takes place under anaerobic conditions which are more frequently found under wet conditions. These findings show that the consideration of topological routing between the model units is of high importance. This is especially true for nutrient transport models. Therefore, the consideration of watershed management problems that deal with water quality issues strongly requires the use of hydrologic models that are able to simulate topological processes.

Integrating Modelling And Field-Based Analysis For Improving Catchment-Scale Pollutant Management: An Application Of The Catchmods Model In The Moruya River Catchment	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			Sediment modelling; Nutrient concentrations; CatchMODS; Pollutant management	PHOSPHORUS; SEDIMENT; EXPORT; SOIL	Water quality decline is a significant environmental issue in Australia and many other countries. Much emphasis has been placed on nutrient management especially for phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) in an attempt to reduce their loss to water bodies. Identifying nutrient sources and their transport potential can assist catchment managers to recognise critical nutrient sources and to devise management interventions for their control. High concentrations of ammonia and phosphate have been observed in the available water quality data for the Moruya River, indicating the potential risk of eutrophication (AMOG Consulting, 2003). Stream bank erosion has been identified as a major erosion problem for the Moruya Estuary and is a potentially significant source of nutrients. However, the impacts of stream bank erosion on sediment output and nutrient loss have not been well quantified and the costs of stream bank management have not been adequately assessed. This study demonstrates the use of an integrated modelling and field sampling approach to improve identification of nutrient sources. The Catchment-scale Management Of Diffuse Sources model (CatchMODS) was used to estimate suspended sediment yields under a variety of management change scenarios in the Mogendoura Creek subcatchment of the Moruya River, NSW. Nutrient source strengths were determined from field and laboratory analysis of soil nutrient concentrations (total N and total P). Soil samples were collected from different land uses (dairying, beef grazing and forest) and from actively eroding areas (gullies and stream banks). By incorporating the nutrient field data and modelled sediment yields, the annual particulate nutrient inputs under each of the management change scenarios were estimated. Scenarios were investigated representing the current (business-as-usual) situation, the effects of afforestation and the effects of various channel erosion management measures. Results show that stream bank erosion is the largest sediment and particulate nutrient input to the subcatchment. Currently, stream bank erosion is estimated to contribute over 2000 t/yr of suspended sediment yield, followed by gully erosion (336 t/yr) and hill slope erosion (2.3 t/yr). Stream bank, gully, and hill slope erosion contribute differently to nutrient loss. More than 85% of the N and P loss is estimated to come from stream bank erosion, mainly due to the high rate of suspended sediment delivery. Severe gullies contribute 12% of the N and P loss. The remainder of erosion types are estimated to contribute only 3% of total particulate nutrient loss. Accordingly, management practices applied to riparian areas, employing either engineering or revegetation techniques, are thought to be the most effective and also the most economical way to reduce nutrient-associated water quality impacts. Land use change, such as converting pasture to forest, was found to have a very limited effect on reducing nutrient transfer. The opportunity cost of losing income from grazing, however, is high. Nevertheless, for catchments which have lower levels of erosion and more intensive land uses, such as dairying, the recommended management interventions may be quite different. The paper demonstrates the advantages of combining modelling and field work for improving water quality management.	[Fu, B.; Newham, L. T. H.; Field, J.

Estimating Sediment and Nutrient Loads in Gippsland Lakes Catchments Using E2 Modelling Framework	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			Gippsland Lakes Catchments; Sediment and nutrient loads; E2 modelling framework		The deterioration of water quality in Gippsland Lakes, indicated by severe algal blooms, and influenced by the flow of nutrients from the Lakes catchments, has received increasing attention. For priority setting on appropriate management actions, a clear understanding is needed of spatial and temporal dynamics of sediment and nutrient fluxes in the catchments of Gippsland Lakes. A number of studies have been performed over recent years to investigate the sources and amounts of nutrient and sediment load entering the Gippsland Lakes (e.g. Grayson et al., 2001; Grayson and Argent, 2002). Following the establishment of various targets for load reductions to the Gippsland Lakes, attention has now turned to assessment of amelioration and load reduction options. The work reported here is a part of a larger undertaking of DPI Victoria to quantify the impacts of selected 'Best Management Practices' on water quality in the Gippsland Lakes catchments, which uses Bayesian techniques to investigate the impact of grazing and fertiliser management on loads generated from irrigated and non-irrigated farmland. This work builds upon an investigation using the CSS modelling system (Grayson and Argent, 2002) on flow and loads into Gippsland Lakes, and aimed to provide the capability required to support the catchment-scale assessment of the impacts of farm-scale management actions. To achieve this, the model structure and code base were updated using a new modelling system and two new component models, created for the Gippsland Lakes application, were developed. Flow and constituent loads (Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Total Phosphorous (TP) and Total Nitrogen (TN)) were simulated for the catchments of Gippsland Lakes using the E2 software, from the Catchment Modelling Toolkit (www.toolkit.net.au). E2 is a flexible catchment modelling software that supports construction of a range of models of different complexity using an approach built around selection and/or creation of particular component models. In this case, the Gippsland Lakes E2 model runs on a monthly time-step using twenty years of data covering high, medium and low flow years. Stream discharge and water quality loads are simulated using historic climate data, land use, and management information. The sources of sediment and nutrient loads are identified. E2 provides the capability to have different component models for flow, constituent generation and filtering for each functional unit (FU). The FUs within each sub-catchment are identified according to land use, and monthly flow and constituent loads are calculated for each FU. The loads from FUs within each sub-catchment are lumped to form sub-catchment loads, which are then transferred downstream through a node-link structure. Following Grayson and Argent (2002), model outputs are available for major catchments (Latrobe, Thomson/Macalister, Avon, Mitchell, Nicholson and Tambo), for Western catchments, for Eastern catchments, and for the "whole of Gippsland Lakes". As part of model testing, evaluation of results for specific sub-catchments as well as "whole of catchment" were undertaken. These results for major catchments of the Gippsland Lakes were compared with those of the CSS modelling system. Compared to the CSS model, E2 was generally found to be at least as robust or better. Long-term average annual loads were well predicted but there were many inconsistencies for months. Overall, the modelling results provide confidence that the model does capture the basic temporal and spatial variability of the system well. Point source data were not included in the E2 modelling reported here, as point source loads have changed significantly over recent years. Apart from this difference, the E2 system used similar data, timesteps and complexity and so has a similar level of certainty to the results of Grayson and Argent (2002). Their caution therefore continues to hold, i.e. the model should (therefore) be used for making relative assessments of the impact of various management actions to reduce long-term average nutrient and suspended loads.			durga.kandel@mdbc.gov.au		Argent, Robert/0000-0001-5822-8970			CHIEW FHS, 2002, 022 COOP RES CTR; GRAYSON R, 2002, 102 CEAH; Grayson R.

Multi-Objective Calibration Of A River Water Quality Model For The Elbe River, Germany	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			River water quality modelling; automatic model calibration; data information content	IDENTIFIABILITY; SENSITIVITY; UNCERTAINTY; OPTIMIZATION	There is a growing need to use river water quality models for the development of river basin management plans. Substantial uncertainties exist in the identification of river water quality models which partially relates to parameter uncertainties and the information content of calibration data. The specific objectives of this study were to i) assess the parameter identification] of a river water quality model using the Parameter Estimation Program (PEST), and ii) evaluate the dependencies between available calibration data and model prediction using a cross-validation procedure. The investigation was conducted based on five extensive flow time related longitudinal surveys with 14 sampling locations along a 536 km free-flowing reach of the German part of the Elbe River. The five surveys represent seasonal development of algal biomass and nutrient concentration under a wide range of boundary conditions like low flow conditions, high global radiation and nutrient limiting algal growth conditions. The nonlinear parameter estimator PEST was used for the multi-objective calibration of the deterministic river water quality model QSIM. Calibration runs were conducted using five different data sets and all their possible combinations. Cross-validation of the model was carried out using the remaining 4, 3, 2 and 1 data sets not included in the calibration process. To identify the 'optimal' parameters for the River Elbe, the river water quality model was calibrated using all five longitudinal surveys. The results show good agreement between measured and simulated values for all variables (Chl a, NO3, O-2, dissolved phosphorus (DP), dissolved Si). Considering the z-distribution of normalized residuals for all five output variables, we found a good approximation of the normal distribution (Figure 1). This indicates that the multi-objective model calibration leads to a well-defined model for the Elbe River. Hence, we have confidence that the PEST multi-objective calibration procedure is able to identify an optima for all eight parameters used for model calibration. [GRAPHICS] The Elbe case study also showed that calibration with a single survey data set leads to substantial errors if these parameters are applied to deviating boundary conditions. These uncertainties can be decreased with an increased calibration database. The overall performance of the validation improves only substantially when increasing the number of calibration data sets from one to two data sets. It can be concluded that the PEST optimization tool is very efficient using a comparably small number of optimization runs for model calibration. In the presented case study at least two longitudinal data sets of differing boundary conditions should be used for calibration of the primary production and nutrient modules of the QSIM model. The results of this study will help model users e. g. at environmental agencies to evaluate the uncertainties in river water quality models and to define appropriate data collections and monitoring schemes to achieve a sufficient accuracy of model predictions.

Modelling The Water Quality Impacts Of Forest Roads At The Catchment Scale	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			water pollution; forest tracks; soil erosion; erosion prediction		The aim of this study was to estimate the magnitude of the contribution of forest roads to catchment in-stream exports of sediment and nutrients in the context of natural background levels from forests in SE Australia. The conceptual approach adopted in this study was to assume that the total load of sediment and nutrients from a forested catchment with roads can be apportioned to two sources; roads-related sources and non-roads related sources. The experimental approach to quantify these sources is shown in Figure 1. [GRAPHICS] A 13,451 ha forested catchment in SE Australia was instrumented for one year to quantify total in-stream exports of total suspended sediment (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP). 101 road-stream crossings were mapped and characterised in detail within the catchment to identify the properties of these road sections that connect directly to the stream network. Sediment and nutrient generation rates from different forest road types were quantified using permanent instrumentation and rainfall simulation. Sediment and nutrient generation rates, mapped stream crossing information, annual rainfall and traffic data were used to estimate annual loads of TSS and TP from each stream crossing in the catchment. The annual sum of these loads was compared to the measured total catchment exports to determine the proportional contribution of roads within the catchment. The results showed that the unsealed road network delivered an estimated 50 t of the 1449 t of TSS exported from the catchment, or about 3.5 % of the total sediment load from the forest. The unsealed road network delivered a maximum of 22 kg of the 1469 kg of TP from the catchment, or less than 1.5% of the total load from the forest. The lower proportional contribution of TP resulted from a low ratio of TP to TSS for the road-derived sediment. The contribution of unsealed roads to the export of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) from the catchment could not be determined quantitatively, however the available data suggests roads are a minor source. The data indicate that in this catchment improvement of stream crossings will yield only small benefits in terms of net catchment exports of TSS and TP, and no benefit in terms of TDN. These results are for a catchment with minimal roading-related mass movement, and extrapolation of these findings to the broader forested estate requires further research. It should also be noted that, even in the case where catchment scale impacts are minimal, pollutant impacts may still be substantial at the local scale of the individual stream reach, a scale of impact not addressed in this paper.

Application Of A 'Whole-Of-Catchment' Model To The Port Phillip Bay Catchment, Australia	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			E2; Catchment Modelling; Port Phillip Bay; Western Port Bay; AWBM		The quality of water travelling through the catchment of, and entering, Port Phillip and Western Port Bays is of considerable interest from ecological and management perspectives. Management agencies for the Port Phillip catchment have to plan for a target reduction of 1000 tonne of nitrogen entering the Bay by 2006, and reduction in sediment loads in Western Port are of similar concern. There are a variety of methods by which nutrient and sediment reduction can be achieved, ranging from direct intervention at point sources, to reductions in and filtering of diffuse loads. This paper reports on development of a coarse whole-of-catchment model for the Port Phillip and Western Port catchments using the E2 catchment modelling system. A monthly modelling system was used, generating runoff from 68 sub-catchments, 37 of which have outlets with coincident water flow and quality data (Figure 1). [GRAPHICS] Sub-catchment functional units (FUs) were defined by landuse, with basic landuses being nature conservation, 'protected', minimal use, grazing, forestry, dryland, irrigated, built urban and water bodies. The AWBM catchment runoff model was calibrated both by sub-catchment, with lumped landuses, and by landuse across all sub-catchments. The sub-catchment basis was found to give more accurate results, due somewhat to the system used for calculation of landuse based flows from multi-landuse catchments. Twenty years of monthly flow were simulated. Flow was found to be reasonably well predicted, with Nash-Sutcliff criteria (Coefficient of Efficiency) values varying from 0.16 to 0.85, with a median across 37 gauged catchments of 0.60. Water quality estimation was confounded by the requirement to combine generation and filtering to match loads calculated at monitoring stations, as well as by the selection of techniques for estimating monitored load. Appropriate selection of generation and filtering values allowed load estimates to match those of previous studies. Despite some limitations in information retrieval and reporting, the E2 framework was found to provide a flexible and expandable approach to catchment modelling that should provide good service to future catchment decision making needs in the Port Phillip and Western Port catchments.

In the heavily loaded site (long-term pig-slurry distribution in adjacent fields) the average total-N concentration in shallow groundwater decreased from 11.8 mg L-1 at the field edge to 2.36 mg L-1 at the end of 40-years-old riparian Alnus incana stand (80% removal). The total-P content decreased from 0.17 to 0.07 mg L-1 (56% removal). At the site with low loading the average removal of total-N and total-P was 48% and 80%, respectively. In grey alder forests of both transects the budgets of N and P fluxes were established. In the older forest the N demand of alders was estimated as high as 148 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), being 213 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) in the younger one. The demand of P was 11.4 and 16.0 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. In both transects, the N demand was highest in the grey alder part, whereas the Elytrigia repens-Urtica dioica grassland strip and the Filipendula ulmaria-Aegopodium podagraria meadow strip showed the highest phosphorus demand. Considering all inputs and outputs, the N and P removal efficiency in grey alder stands seems to slow down down with increasing stand/tree age. In the same time, immobilization of N in soil is increasing. This suggests that grey alder buffer communities should be managed by regeneration cutting. It removes part of nutrients and helps to keep N and P removal rate high.

Therefore, the processes occurring within wetland systems affect down stream water quality as water and associated nutrients such as phosphorus (P) are typically transported from upland areas to aquatic systems. This review will describe some of the common forms of P found in wetland soils/sediments and the processes responsible for P transformation and translocation. Phosphorus can enter a wetland as organic and inorganic fractions. Calcium (Ca) compounds determine the availability of inorganic P in alkaline soils white, in acidic soils iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) controls P solubility. Inorganic P has four main fractions of decreasing bioavailability. Phosphorus sorption is one of the main processes involved in inorganic P biogeochemistry in wetland soils/sediments. Sorption is controlled by the concentration of phosphate in soil porewater and solid phases. Maximum sorption capacity of a soil can be determined using empirical models. Typically, soils only sorb P when added P in solution has a higher concentration than soil porewater. Phosphorus precipitation involves the reaction of phosphate ions with metallic cations forming solid precipitate. Inorganic P forms dominate the bioavailable fractions, whereas organic P fractions typically dominate the total P content of wetland soils/sediments. Organic P compounds can also be fractionated in decreasing order of bioavailability. At the wetland ecosystem-scale processes involved in long term P retention include: sorption on wetland substrates and the accumulation and subsequent accretion of new soil/sediment material.

Traditional measurement of water quality, requiring laborious laboratory work, is expensive and time consuming. Hyperspectral measurement can offer fast and easy way for estimating trophic status. Hyperspectral data on 7-8, March, 2004 and water chemical data from 1997 to 2003 was used for retrieval of water quality parameters. The quantification of spectra with water quality parameters: chlorophyll a, suspended solids, total nitrogen(TN), total phosphorus(TP), chemical oxygen demand(COD), secchi depth(SD) were regressed. Results showed that the reflectance ratio of R702/R685, R620/R531 and R554/R675 had high correlations with the concentration of chlorophyll a, suspended solids and total phosphorus respectively; TN, COD can be calculated from TP or Chl a for good relations between them; SD is negatively correlated with suspended solids concentration, total phosphorus (TP) (less than 0.25 mg/L) linearly correlated with logarithm chlorophyll a concentration; trophic status index (TSI) exponentially correlated with COD concentration.

Images are displayed as 24 bit RGB images of the water surface using selected channels. Example model outputs are presented in this paper for a hyperspectral Monte Carlo and a hyperspectral layered analytical iterative model of radiative transport within turbid shallow water types. Images at the selected wavelengths or channels centered at 490, 530 and 680 nm suggests the two models provide quite similar results when displayed as RGB images. The techniques are demonstrated to the problem of extracting synthetic targets from hyperspectral synthetic images in the presence of water surface wave, using spectral wave models. The most sensitive parameters for generating realistic images are water depth and bottom reflectance in clean natural and optically shallow waters. Also presented are platforms for use in ports, harbors, inlets and waterways developed and designed for current and future monitoring to insure sustainable safe shallow water environments.

Models can contribute in understanding the sources and the processes responsible for pollution, and identifying the areas of concern. A variety of methods have been used to model the nitrogen pressure in river basins. In this study we describe a comparison between two methodologies: a statistical model and the physically-based SWAT model. The two models were calibrated on the Wash catchment (UK), 8900 km(2). The nitrogen losses from land to surface waters and the source apportionment of riverine nitrogen load were estimated by the two approaches, and the results were compared. Moreover their potentiality for evaluating management strategies was analysed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As there are recent concerns regarding water quality deterioration caused by phosphorus originating from re-wetted peatlands, the aim of this study was to develop a simple method based on existing data to conduct a risk analysis estimating minimum and maximum phosphorus export rates from the study area (993 ha) towards the river Trebel. Especially in the temporarily unsaturated zone of the peatland, high phosphorus concentrations were measured, while the water quality of the river was 'moderately polluted' according to the German water quality classification. Two approaches were applied: First, the geostatistics software Surfer (R) was utilised to derive an areal estimate of half-yearly groundwater contours, fluxes and transport rates on the basis of groundwater level data of 33 dipwells. Second, daily groundwater levels from a hydrological model applying the Boussinesq equation to geological cross-sections were used to calculate specific discharges and transport rates along transects following the general flow direction. With the software Surfer, the general hydrological conditions of the study area and the calculated phosphorus fluxes were plausibly illustrated. Daily transport rates calculated on the basis of the Boussinesq model were dynamic on a very low level, while flow directions frequently pointed towards the peatland. Even when assuming worst case conditions, very low phosphorus export rates (< 0.001-0.003 kg SRP ha(-1) a(-1)) from the study area via groundwater were estimated with both approaches. According to these results, there is no acute danger of water quality deterioration caused by remobilised phosphorus from this re-wetted peatland. Even though there is no phosphorus export or eventually accumulation within the peatland under favourable conditions, monitoring should continue. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Two horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands were designed to receive organic loading rate below 50 kg/ha/d and hydraulic loading rate of 480 m(3)/ha/d from a primary facultative pond. Two rectangular shaped units each 11.0 in long, 3.7 in wide and 1.0 m deep and bottom slope of 1% were constructed and filled with 6-25 mm diameter gravel pack to a depth of 0.75 in. Each unit was planted with Phraginites mauritianus with an initial plant density of 29,000 plants/ha. The plants were allowed to grow for about four months before sampling for water quality parameters commenced. Samples were collected daily for about three months. Dissolved oxygen, pH and temperature were measured in situ and ammonia, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, nitrates, nitrite and Chemical Oxygen Demand were measured in the laboratory in accordance with Standard Methods. The mathematical model took into account activities of biomass suspended in the water body and biofilm on aggregates and plant roots. The state variables modelled include organic, ammonia, and nitrate-nitrogen, which were sectored in water, plant and aggregates. The major nitrogen transformation processes considered in this study were mineralization, nitrification, denitrification, plant uptake, plant decaying, and sedimentation. The forcing functions, which were considered in the model, are temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen. Stella 11 software was used to simulate the nitrogen processes influencing the removal of nitrogen in the constructed wetland. One of the two-wetland units was used for model calibration and the second unit for model validation. The model results indicated that 0.872 gN/m(2) d was settled at the bottom of the wetland and on gravel bed and roots of the plants. However, 0.752 gN/m(2) d (86.2%) of the settled nitrogen was regenerated back to the water body, which means that only 13.8% of the settled nitrogen was permanently removed. Denitrification and nitrification were responsible for transformation of 0.436 gN/m(2) d and 0.425 gN/m(2) d, respectively. Uptake of nitrogen by plants was 0.297 gN/m(2) d out of which 0.140 gN/m(2) d was returned to the water body as plants decay. It was found that the major pathways leading to permanent removal of nitrogen in a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland system in descending order are denitrification (29.9%), plant uptake (10.2%) and net sedimentation (8.2%).

J	Smal, H; Kornijow, R; Ligeza, S				Smal, H; Kornijow, R; Ligeza, S			The effect of catchment on water quality and eutrophication risk of five shallow lakes (Polesie Region, Eastern Poland)	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						shallow lakes; nutrient loads; water chemistry; soil types; catchment use; eutrophication	SYSTEM MASURIAN LAKELAND; LANDSCAPE; PHOSPHORUS; EXPORT; BASIN	The nutrient loads from the terrestrial catchments, (based on the distribution of soils and their use) were estimated, compared with that deriving from the atmosphere, and analysed from the view point of the present lake water quality (pH, transparency, electrical conductivity, total suspended solids, concentrations of TN, TP, Ca, Mg, K and Na). Five shallow (mean depth 0.9-3.4 m) and small (area < 100 ha) lakes were selected in Leczna-Wlodawa Lakeland, a part of Polesie region (Eastern Poland). The contribution of the atmospheric deposition of N and P to the total loads (both from air and the land) varied greatly between the lakes (2-48% and 1-40%, respectively) while that of other elements did not exceed 16%. The lake catchments differed substantially in the percentage of soil types and their use. The most fertile soils were used as arable fields and the least fertile were afforested. The load of N and P in g m(-2) of a lake surface per year ranged from 2.1 to 55.5 and 0.05-1.33, respectively. Average (May-October) concentrations of TN and TP in the lake waters varied from 0.92 to 1.70 mg dm(-3) and 27.1-238.9 mu g dm(-3), respectively. There was a strong linear correlation between the percentage of particular soil types, nutrient inputs to the lakes and their concentrations in the lake waters, especially for the TN and TP. In addition, the physical and chemical properties of lake water depended significantly upon ratio between lake surface and cachtment area, as well as on lake morphometry. The eutrophication hazard of the lakes, evaluated according to Vollenweider's criteria, was the highest for the lakes where the forests and grasslands occurred in the smallest proportions in the catchments, and the contribution of the fertile, cultivated soils was the highest.

One field in the north west showed a clear spatial structure of soil texture. Spatial yield data for three years were used to validate the model. Stable high and low yield areas were derived from simulations over 32 years. The more homogeneous textured field in the south-east of Germany showed spatial yield patterns mainly due to the relief. Simulations of 21 years showed small areas of low yield while in most of the field, the response was indifferent from year to year. Model results indicated small problematic areas on both fields with nitrate concentrations of the seepage above 50 mg NO3 l(-1) under conventional fertilization. Fertilizer scenarios were used to estimate the amount of maximum annual nitrogen fertilization to meet drinking water quality standards.

The basin is characterized by arid and semi-and climate, the Loess Plateau, and industrially developing and highly cultivated area. It has been suffering from water shortage and heavy sediment transport. Appropriate allocation of water resources is of importance in the basin for development and sustainability. Appropriate allocation of water resources would bring better ecosystem and higher sustainability with wise water use, efficient water reuse, and discharge of wastewater after appropriate treatment. Allocation of water resources to the sectors; agriculture, industry, daily lives, and ecosystem, is a matter of policy and economy. Water use with high efficiency is of technology and of social systems, and water reuse is of technology, health risk, and economy. In order to reach more appropriate allocation, what have to be done are to construct an integrated modeling on water quality mid quantity in an objective area and to simulate future figures in the area. Since polluted water, even if it is fresh water, does not become water resources, water quality is of necessity for water reuse. In this study, an integrated water quantity and quality model is developed to apply to the Weilie basin, the major tributary of the Yellow River, as an objective area. The model consists of two sub-models, a water circulation sub-model and a water quality sub model, which are based on the GBHM2 model (geomorphology-based hydrological model 2) and the Streeter-Phelps model with the 1-D diffusion term, respectively. In order to make water reuse with high efficiency possible, discharging points are also identified. The pattern of precipitation, surface flow rates, the groundwater flow level, and evapotranspiration rates are taken into consideration in it. The amount of evapotranspinition is estimated with the Penman-Monteith method and with hourly changes of temperature and precipitation. Parameterization and determination of boundary and initial conditions are done by use of GIS data, satellite images, observation data on site, and statistical data by the central and local Chinese Governments. The units of discharged Pollutants and water consumption are developed based on relevant statistical data for simulation. This model constructed is available to simulate the rates of evapotranspiration, penetration, runoff, and river flow rates, especially peak flow rates. Simulated BOD, DO, nitrogens, phosphorus and suspended solids in the Weihe River agreed well with measured ones. It is estimated that water quality in the Weihe River would be improved when the ratio of wastewater treatment reaches 80%/	[Kusuda, Tetsuya] Kyushu Univ, Dept Urban Environm Engn, Fukuoka 812, Japan	Kusuda, T (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ, Dept Urban Environm Engn, Fukuoka 812, Japan.

Although constructed wetlands are extensively used today, the precise mechanisms responsible for removal of organic matter and nutrients and the factors responsible for performance variations are not fully understood. One of the reasons for this fact is the lack of studies in pilot or laboratory-scale systems, where these factors could be examined better through controlled experiments. With this in mind, we have designed, constructed and are operating now in our laboratory five small-scale subsurface flow constructed wetlands of dimensions 3 m long, 0.75 m wide and 0.5 m deep each. The five wetlands have three different porous media and two vegetation types. The aim is to identify the effects of vegetation type, porous medium type and other factors on the performance of these systems, and derive appropriate experimental parameters and models describing the function of these systems under Mediterranean climate conditions. The units received synthetic wastewater from January 2004 until July 2004 with 14 days residence time and from August 2004 until March 2005 with 8 days residence time. Water quality samples were collected at the inlet, two points along each unit and the outlet of each unit, and were analyzed in the laboratory for BOD, COD, TKN, ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, TP, and ortho-phosphate. Typical BOD removal varied from 80 to 95% depending on season. In general, the performance of the units in BOD, COD, TKN and phosphorus removal depends on temperature, vegetation type and porous medium type. This paper presents the results of the first year of operation of these pilot units.

Application of the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model in the Ronnea catchment of Sweden	Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology, Vol A - Oral Presentations, Pts A and B	Proceedings of the International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology	SEP 01-03, 2005	Rhodes Isl, GREECE	Global Network Environm Sci & Technol, Univ Aegean, Dept Environm Studies		hydrological modeling; water resources management; water quality		The subject of this article is the estimation of quantitative (hydrological) and qualitative parameters in the catchment of Ronnea (1800Km(2), located in south western Sweden) through the application of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). SWAT is a river basin model that was developed for the U.S.D.A. Agricultural Research Service, by the Blackland Research Center in Texas. The SWAT model is a widely known tool that has been used in several cases world-wide. It has the ability to predict the impact of land management practices on water, sediment and agricultural chemical yield in large complex watersheds. The present work investigates certain capabilities of the SWAT model which have not identified up to now. More in specific, the main targets of the work carried out are the following: Identification of the existing hydrological and qualitative conditions Preparation - Processing of data required to be used as input data of the model Hydrological calibration - validation of the model, in 7 subbasins of the Catchment of Ronnea Estimation and evaluation of the simulated qualitative parameters of the model All available data were offered by the relevant Institutes of Sweden, in the framework of the European program EUROHARP. The existing conditions in the catchment of Ronnea, are described in detail including topography, land uses, soil types, pollution sources, agricultural management practices, precipitation, temperature, wind speed, humidity, solar radiation as well as observed discharges and Nitrogen and Phosphorus substances concentrations. Most of the above data were used as input data for the application of SWAT model. Adequate methods were also used to complete missing values in time series and estimate additional parameters (such as soil parameters) required by the model. Hydrological calibration and validation took place for each outlet of the 7 subbasins of Ronnea catchment in an annual, monthly and daily step. The calibration was achieved by estimating parameters related to ground water movement and evaluating convergence between simulated and observed discharges by using mainly the Nash & Sutcliffe coefficient (NTD). Through the sensitivity analysis, main parameters of the hydrological simulation, were detected. According to the outputs of the SWAT model, the water balance of Ronnea catchment was also estimated. Hydrological calibration and validation is generally considered sufficient in an annual and monthly step. Hydrological calibration - validation in daily step, generally does not lead to high values of the NTD indicator. However, when compared to results obtained by the use of SWAT in Greece, a relatively high value of NTD is achieved in one subbasin. Finally, a comparison between the simulated and observed concentrations of total Phosphorus and Nitrogen was carried out.

The impact of tropical deforestation on river chemical pollution	Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology, Vol A - Oral Presentations, Pts A and B	Proceedings of the International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology	SEP 01-03, 2005	Rhodes Isl, GREECE	Global Network Environm Sci & Technol, Univ Aegean, Dept Environm Studies		tropical deforestation; hydrologic modeling; watershed management; water pollution; SWAT; Costa Rica		Understanding how deforestation affects river water quality is essential in any comprehensive effort to manage watersheds and regulate land use. The main objective of this study was to provide a quantitative description of the impact of converting tropical forests into pastures for cattle grazing in terms of the sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations at the outlet of a river basin located in North West Costa Rica. This project also aimed at testing the possible environmental consequences of land-use management policies for that watershed. Twenty years of daily precipitation, maximum and minimum temperatures, and digital elevation, land cover and soil maps were used with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to model the watershed. SWAT had not been utilized to specifically model the potential effects of deforestation and related policies on river water quality in a tropical country in the way it was used in this project. A flow balance calibration was performed by comparing results to published measurements, and a regression coefficient of 0.9886 was obtained for the best-fit line of the predicted vs. measured flows. Graphs for sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus concentration vs. percent area of the watershed under pasture were plotted and the results showed an expected monotonic increase in pollutants as deforestation increased. Contaminant levels at the main river outlet for the entire watershed as grassland were between 3 and 8 times higher than for the total area as forest, which could put at risk the drinking water supply and the tourism-based economy of the region. Keeping the current percent area under grassland constant but restricting pastures to the less fragile and more fertile lands could decrease the sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations at the main watershed outlet by more than 35%, 12% and 21%, respectively, as compared to the predicted pollutant concentrations for the current land cover distribution. The effect of varying stocking rates was also tested and this resulted in lower sediment and nitrogen run-off for areas with higher pasture yields and animal loads in which confined operations are used part of the year. The phosphorus concentration, however, varied only slightly, suggesting that in the absence of fertilization the broken terrain, uneven precipitation patterns, land cover and soil types are the main predictors of phosphorus contamination, not grazing intensity itself. The current drive by the government of Costa Rica to promote agricultural intensification could therefore be beneficial for the environment, provided that manure is managed appropriately during the animal confinement period.

Later, the site has been designated as an environment conservation zone because of ecological and landscape values, while tourist activities have been developed around the reservoir. Irrigation of agricultural land, hydroelectric production, drinking water supply, tourism, ecosystem water quality and scenery conservation have evidently been conflicting targets for many years. Good management would require a multi-criteria decision making. Historical data show that the irregular water release has resulted in a great annual fluctuation of the reservoir water level. This situation could be improved by a rational management of abstractions. Apparently, higher release leads simultaneously to more power production and to irrigation of a larger agricultural land. Moreover, demands for electricity and for irrigation are partially competing to each other, due to different optimal time schedules of releases. On the other hand, higher water release leads to lower water level in the reservoir and, therefore, it decreases the beauty of the scenery and deteriorates the trophic state of the lake. Such degradation affects the tourist potential as well as the quality of drinking water supplied by the reservoir. A multi-criteria approach uses different scenarios for the minimum permissible water level of the reservoir, if a constant annual release is applied. The minimum level concept is a simple and functional tool, because it is understood by people, easily certified and incorporated into regulations. The quantity of water that would be yearly available is a function of the minimum level allowed. The water quality depends upon the trophic state of the lake, mainly the concentration of chlorophyll-a, which determines the state of eutrophication and is estimated by water quality simulation models, taking into account pollutant loads such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The value of the landscape is much depending on the water level of the lake, because for lower levels a dead-zone appears between the surface of the water and the surrounding vegetation. When this dead zone is large, it seems lifeless and the lake appears partially empty, Quantification of this visual effect is not easy, but it is possible to establish a correspondence between the aesthetic assessment of the scenery and the minimum allowed reservoir level. Using results from hydrological analysis, water quality models and landscape evaluation, it seems possible to construct a multi-criteria table with different criteria described against alternatives and with a plot of three relative indices against the minimum level allowed. However, decision making has to take into account the fact that comparison or merging of indices corresponding to different criteria analysis encompasses a degree of arbitrariness. More objective decisions would be possible if different benefits and costs were measured in a common unit. Moreover, management will be sensitive to different social pressures.

Aeration/stripping of 1-butylmercaptan in aqueous environment	Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology, Vol A - Oral Presentations, Pts A and B	Proceedings of the International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology	SEP 01-03, 2005	Rhodes Isl, GREECE	Global Network Environm Sci & Technol, Univ Aegean, Dept Environm Studies		aeration; stripping; 1-Butylmercaptan; mass-transfer; chemical equilibrium	AERATION	Many applications in water quality management have a common key water quality parameter, dissolved oxygen, resulting to the critical role of aeration. In municipal and industrial wastewater the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) cause several concerns including a direct threat to humans, partly due to their emission from treatment tanks, especially where aeration is applied. pH, temperature and Henry's Law govern VOCs' speciation and consequently their emission characteristics. Limited data and simplifications of available mass-transfer models pose obstacles to a realistic approach, especially in the presence of a chemical equilibrium, for example in the case of thiols. In the present study the importance of oxygen transfer and stripping of a VOC (1-Butylmercaptan) on aeration's overall effectiveness are examined separately. Clean water oxygenation and stripping of thiol to an inert gas (nitrogen) were studied aiming to investigate the effect of chemical equilibrium violation between ionic and neutral form of the target compound in neutral and alkaline solutions. Using appropriate mass transfer relationships (dynamic method), experimental data were analyzed for the determination of overall (k(L,OL) alpha) of oxygen. Correlating k(L,OL) alpha with the corresponding mass transfer coefficient of 1-Butylmercaptan in neutral solutions (calculated according the model proposed by Matter-Muller et al. 1981), a value of ratio beta(y) of 0,57 is found, close to the reported values of other VOCs with the same values of Henry's constant. A coupled differential algebraic equation system, based on mass balances and assuming non-equilibrium conditions during stripping, was developed. Reaction parameter k(2) was calculated with non-linear least-squares analysis. The model predicts satisfactorily the experimental data and it provides a useful tool for the semi batch stripper design in situations where a chemical equilibrium is involved. At pH values below 8,5 thiol concentration falls exponentially whereas above 10,5 it tends to linearity. The bubble equilibrates and thiol transferred depends upon solubility and not diffusivity. Especially after depletion of initial neutral compound, transport depends upon neutral/ionic form speciation. The effectiveness of stripping 1-Butylmercaptan, at a given pH, is mainly determined by a proportionality constant considered as "fugacity capacity". This is determined by hydrophobicity (i.e. low solubility and high limiting activity coefficient) rather than pure-component volatility (i.e. vapour pressure or boiling point). High limiting activity coefficient promotes thiol emission due to established vapor-liquid equilibrium, while the low reaction parameter k(2), controls neutral thiol quantity. At high pH, where ionic form predominates, experimental data showed that stripping was almost independent of the gas flow rate applied. A strong sensitivity of the model to uncertainty of y(infinity) was found: y* controls emission rate and through this the dynamic variations of neutral/ionic concentration profiles whereas reaction rate law parameter k(2) controls the neutral/ionic transformation and it is the crucial quantity which governs the process at high pH values.

Lakes represent, a major source of such freshwater, but are coming under increasing pressure through exploitation for agriculture, industry, drinking water and hydroelectricity generation. This is particularly the case in tropical, countries. This chapter presents a case study, Lake Chapala, the largest lake in Mexico. The primary tributary of Lake Chapala is the Lerma River. Much of the flow of this tributary is used in a non-conservative fashion upstream for agricultural and industrial purposes. Large quantities of domestic, agricultural, and industrial sewage from,the. entire Lerma-Chapala basin still flow untreated into the watershed and eventually to the lake, resulting in excessive inputs of phosphorus, (P). High nutrient concentrations in the lake have led to degraded water quality, resulting in growths of floating aquatic vegetation of bulrush and water hyacinth, as well as blue-green algae. Spatial and temporal P distributions in the lake during the past 24 years have been discussed in relation to the hydrologic changes. A method based on the bathymetric features of the lake estimates the amount of total P in the lake. It has been well established in the case of temperate lakes that the most effective long-term measure for the control of eutrophication in a water body is a reduction in the input of external nutrients. In tropical shallow lakes, internal recycling of phosphorus from sediments represents a significant long-term input. Determining the nutrient balance of any lake or reservoir constitutes a very important tool to understand its chemical and biological processes. Equally, the knowledge of existing relationships between hydrological variables, nutrient concentrations, and primary productivity can help in determining the best way of restoration where eutrophication problems are involved. These relationships are discussed in this chapter.

They use piscivore stocking and/or zooplanktivore removal to enhance zooplankton grazing on algae. Their success depend on intense trophic cascade interactions along a linear food chain from piscivores to visual zooplanktivores, herbivorous zooplankton and phytoplankton. Piscivore cascading effects down to phytoplankton requires a substantial grazing pressure by large Daphnia, the key invertebrate herbivores, when relaxed from zooplanktivory. In contrast, tropical lakes have a weak, zooplankton-phytoplankton link due to the lack of Daphnia and prevalence of large algae, mostly inedible by zooplankton, particularly cyanobacteria that may form efflorescences. Their more complex pelagic food webs make the fish-algae relationships less predictable. Dominant planktivores are filter-feeding omnivores that consume large algae in addition to zooplankton and detritus. Most omnivores have benthic habits (e.g., Nile tilapia and common carp), whereas only few are pelagic feeders (e.g., silver carp). Not limited by resources, filter-feeding planktivores often reach high biomasses and enhance internal nutrient cycling, thus promoting algal growth. Because of these peculiarities, biomanipulation in the Tropics should target the control of cyanobacteria by enhancing filter feeding by pelagic planktivores and/ or reducing nutrient loading by benthic omnivores. We present results of laboratory trials (10-50-L, aquaria), in situ experiments (2.5-6.5-m(3) mesocosms, 1,000-m(2) littoral lilmnocorrals), an overall acoustic fish stock assessment, and a massive accidental fish kill (300 tons) to demonstrate the applicability of fish manipulation within CAESB Restoration Program of Lago Paranoa, the reservoir of Brasilia. We use them to test a biomanipulation approach based on the reduction of the benthic tilapia overpopulatioon (Oreochromis niloticus plus Tilapia rendalli) and stocking of pelagic silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) to reduce phosphorus loading and thus control the occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms (Microcystis aeruginosa, Botryococcus spp., Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii). We also explore the benefits of stocking herbivorous grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) to control excessive macrophytes growth, as well as implementing environment-friendly silver carp cage culture and promoting sport fishery of native piscivores (tucunare Cichla ocellaris, dourado Salminus maxillosus, surubim, Pseudoplatystoma coruscans) to improve water quality. We discuss the potential and effectiveness of food-web manipulations for the restauration of shallow eutrophic tropical lakes, emphasizing their peculiarities, e.g. the importance of omnivory and internal nutrient cycling favoring nitrogen limitation.

The area of "La Ribera", the last part of the river, is where the main part of the use is located. Due to these demands and their returns this area presents several important water quality problems such as low concentration of dissolved oxygen and high concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorous, etc. This paper explains the link between a water quality model and a simulation model in order to improve the water quality of this part of the river maintaining the guarantees of the demands of the system. The first step was building a water quality model of the low part of the river with the module QUAL2E. A model of 8 constituents-conductivity, suspended solids, CBOD, dissolved oxygen, ammonium, nitrate, nitrites and phosphorous was developed, calibrated and tested. By the other side, a simulation model for the entire Mcar basin was available. This model was developed using the SIMGES module. SIMGES is part of the Decision Support System AQUATOOL. With the goal of improving the water quality on the river, an application has been developed to connect both models. Several wastewater treatment and management alternatives can be combined and tested with the application. The simulation model estimates the flows and returns in the river that can then be used as input for the water quality model. The results of the water quality model represent the efficiency of each alternative. This approach allows us to achieve the best alternative that assures the water quality physical-chemical conditions for aquatic life and the lower impact over the guarantees of the demands.

These forms of nutrient enrichment can lead to eutrophication problems within an estuarine area. Although eutrophication of water bodies is a natural process, it can be greatly accelerated by artificial nutrient enrichment, i.e. nutrient enrichment caused by man's actions. These unnatural increases in a water body's nutrient content can lead to the development of eutrophic conditions with increased plant growth and the occurrence of planktonic algal blooms. However, by using effective management tools, artificial nutrient enrichment may be controlled in such a way as to minimise its environmental impacts on a waterbody. Cork Harbour is an estuary located on the southwest coast of Ireland. At present a number of industrial and domestic outfalls discharge into the harbour, resulting in nutrient enrichment and increased productivity. One area in particular in the northwest of the harbour, the Lee Estuary/Lough Mahon area, has been classed as eutrophic by the Irish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It is proposed to construct a new secondary treatment facility in the Lough Mahon area which will collect a number of existing outfalls, treat their wastes and discharge into Lough Mahon. This paper presents a selection of the findings of a numerical model study carried out to assess the changes, if any, in the trophic status of the Lee Estuary/Lough Mahon area as a result of the proposed treatment facility.

Some problems arise from the fact that wastewater flow rate corresponds to 6-8 m(3)/s, and this flow rate, which is normally high enough to guarantee a good degree of mixing, can be reduced in some periods of the year at the connection point to approximately the same previously mentioned numerical value because of the withdrawal of water to a plant where it is used for hydroelectric production. These aspects have been evaluated in different periods, before and after insertion of a specific section for the removal of biological nitrogen. Some evaluations have been performed on the basis of regular monitoring data concerning the plant effluent characteristics and the quality of the river; a statistical analysis was performed of the correlation of the two data sets, while taking different hydrological aspects of the river into account. A modellistic approach, which is useful to define the capacity of the river for removing the emitted nitrogen, has also been studied. As a final result it was, on the one hand, possible to verify the effective improvement in quality of the river in connection with the increased efficiency due to the treatment and, on the other, to verify the heavy limit on the quality of the river water due to the low dilution ratio at the connection point.

If this occurs in a closed area, the water quality deteriorates, e.g. inducing eutrophication. A sewer system has already been constructed in almost all large cities, but there are problems like Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) or Separate Sewer Overflow (SSO). Pollutant runoff from nonpoint sources has been investigated under wet weather conditions by field observation in the Dejima River basin in Japan. Based on the observed data, the detachment rate of pollutants has been estimated in detail, and correlated with not only the condition of the watershed, but also a rainfall time series consisting of antecedent rainfall and the current event. This paper shows that the wash-off rate of pollutants under wet weather conditions can be predicted exactly by considering the relevant factors.

Within the mid-Appalachian region of Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia, watersheds dominated by Pottsville and Allegheny sandstone (PVA), Catskill, Chemung, and Pocono shale and sandstone (CCP), and Mauch Chunk shale and Greenbrier limestone (MCG), respectively, exhibited significantly different low, intermediate, and high mean stream nitrate concentrations. Soil pH, soil percent N concentration (%N), soil C:N mass ratio, soil exchangeable Ca, watershed slope, and the occurrence of white ash (Fraxinus americana L.), sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis L.) were related significantly to bedrock geology type as well as stream nitrate levels. Other factors such as past land disturbances (fire and agriculture) and stand age (old-growth) typically were associated with only one bedrock geology type. However, within a bedrock geology type, past agriculture and the presence of old-growth forest may be important in explaining stream nitrate concentrations on an individual watershed basis. The basal area of black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.), a species that enhances soil nitrogen levels via nitrogen fixation, showed a moderate positive correlation with stream nitrate concentrations. Bedrock geology explained the most variation in winter (49%) and summer (32%) stream nitrate concentrations. Bedrock geology may have been a better predictor of stream nitrate concentrations than soil chemistry, because the geologic variation was better assessed at the regional scale of this study compared to soil chemistry, which varies at the micro-scale due to topographic, vegetation, microbial, and climatic influences. Results of this study suggest that bedrock geology is an important factor to consider when assessing forest nitrogen dynamics at a broad landscape scale.

HLA facilitates interoperability among different simulations and simulation types and promotes reuse of simulation software modules. It was originally developed for military applications but the platform is finding increasing applicability for civilian purposes. The models from the Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP5) were implemented in HLA to extend its Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis capabilities. The models include DYNHYD (hydrodynamics), EUTRO (phytoplankton and nutrient dynamics) and TOXI (sediment and micropollutant transport). The uncertainty analysis investigated the impact of errors in the hydrodynamic parameters (weir discharge and roughness coefficients) and boundary conditions (upstream and tributary discharge) on the uncertainty in the water quality output variables. It was found that the contribution of the hydrodynamic parameter error to the water quality output uncertainty is comparable to that obtained from the error in the water quality parameters. The error in the boundary condition input data is also an important contributor to model uncertainty.

With high environmental concerns and limited financial resources, good water quality has to be reached in the most cost effective way. This paper discusses the use of a linear programming model to optimize the cost and effectiveness of the abatement of nitrogen emissions for the Grote Nete river basin (Belgium). The following abatement measures are considered: waste water treatment, a subsidized reduction of pigs, and manure processing. It is found that a good water quality in the Grote Nete will involve an annual cost of at least e6 million until 2015.

The model is designed to assess the short-term fate of organic contaminants in two compartments (bulk water and benthic sediment), taking into account the effect of nutrient dynamics. The biodegradation submodel was refined using a microcosm (artificial river) study and Linear Alkylbenzene Sulphonate (LAS) as an example. Based on data generated during the microcosm study, the model was calibrated and validated in both steady state (continuous constant load) and dynamic (pulse load) conditions. The results show that the simulated data set agrees well with the measured data set. Furthermore, thorough investigation of the model output sensitivity to the model inputs was made, and the results show that the fate of LAS is sensitive to the following model input variables: ammonia nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, microbial biomass and readily biodegradable soluble COD, and the model parameters mainly related to the biodegradation submodel. The model provides good understanding of the interaction between conventional pollutants and organic contaminants fate in rivers.

Monthly flow allocation from upstream dam is important for downstream NH3-N control. In this study, water quality models based on multiple regression (MR) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods were developed to support dam operations through providing forecasted NH3-N concentrations. The models were calibrated with 7 years of monthly data, and verified with another 3 years of independent data. In the models, the NH3-N concentration for next time step is dependent on dam outflow, river water quality such as alkalinity, temperature, and NH3-N of previous time step. During the calibration phase, the ANN models compared to MR models showed a better agreement with observed data as indicated with small RMSE and high R-2 values. However, in the verification phase, the performance of ANN models was decreased and showed a little difference to MR models. From the model comparisons, it is recommended for both ANN and MR models to include the autocorrelation of NH3-N concentrations up to 3-lag months to avoid overestimation during low flow season.

In this study, three models, a hydrodynamic (DYNHYD), a eutrophication model (EUTRO), and a sediment and micro-pollutant transport model (TOXI), were coupled together in the High Level Architecture (HLA) platform. DYNHYD dynamically simulates the propagation of a wave through a river reach one-dimensionally by solving the full dynamic wave equation. Important parameters that describe the river morphology are the roughness coefficient and the weir discharge coefficient. EUTRO simulates the phytoplankton-nutrient dynamics in water bodies with variables and parameters that regulate the process in this cycle. Examples of some of the more important parameters are the oxygen reaeration, phytoplankton growth or nitrification rates. TOXI was implemented to simulate the transport of sediments and heavy metals in which the most important transformation process of the metals was sorption. It is the aim of this study to see the effect that hydrodynamic parameters such as weir discharge and roughness coefficients have on water quality constituents, such as chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen and levels of ammonium and dissolved zinc.

J	Novotny, V				Novotny, V			The next step - incorporating diffuse pollution abatement into watershed management	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Editorial Material						diffuse pollution; keynote presentation; models; restoration; water quality		The majority of adverse changes in watersheds impairing water quality occurred over a period of thirty to more than one hundred years. In many areas over a period of about 80 years more than 90% of the wetlands were drained, cultivated and converted to agricultural and urban uses. This conversion changed the redox status of the soils and soil cover with a concurrent large increase of suspended solids, dissolved organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphate loads from the watersheds located in the affected regions. The question whether these adverse changes are reversible by reduction or discontinuation of excessive inputs of pollutants came to light and has been analyzed recently after the political changes in Eastern Europe. Reliable dynamic long term models that Would describe interactions between nutrient inputs, outputs, storage etc., have not been developed yet. It is becoming apparent that it may take longer for the watersheds to recover after nutrient loads to surface and groundwater are reduced if remedial measures are gradually implemented.

A large set of data, reflecting the temporal and spatial variability of microalgae and hydrochemical parameters in Western Black Sea waters (WBS), collected in 2001-2002 (EU 5th FP project "daNubs"), allows us to compare the present-day ecosystem functioning to previous ones and to certainly conclude on positive signs of relaxation. The years 2001 and 2002 were without ample, negative biological and hydrochemical events in the WBS. Nutrient general trend was a decreasing one since the late 1980s, and inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations were frequently below the method detection limits during summer autumn periods of 2001-2002. The shelf waters were properly oxygenated. The phytoplankton community was producing biomass in a decreasing tendency, especially obviously since 1995. Simultaneously, there was an increase in Si:P and Si:N molar ratios and concurrent increase in the diversity of mass algal species (mainly diatoms) but only a few of them generated exceptional blooms. Reduction of the ratios between phytoplankton and zooplankton biomasses became evident. The observed ecological status in 2001-2002 confirms that the Black Sea is no longer a reference point for progressive water quality deterioration.

The main purposes of this study are to apply constructed wetlands for the protection of water reservoirs and to reuse wastewater. Experiments were carried out at continuous flow reactors. The effects of the type of plants on the removal were investigated by using emergent (Canna, Cyperus, Typhia spp., Phragmites spp., Juncus, Poaceae, Paspalum and Iris.), submerged (Elodea, Egeria) and floating (Pistia, Salvina and Lemna) marsh plants at different conditions. During the study period HLRs were 30, 50, 70, 80 and 120 L m(2) d(-1) respectively. The average annual NH4-N, NO3-N, organic N and TN treatment efficiencies in SSF and FWS wetlands are 81% and 68%, 37% and 49%, 75% and 68%, 47% and 53%, respectively. Nitrification, denitrification and ammonification rate constant (k(20)) values in SSF and FWS systems have been found as 0.898 d(-1) and 0.541 d(-1), 0.488 d(-1) and 0.502 d(-1), 0.986 d(-1) and 0.908 respectively.

Trin. ex Steud. (Common Reed) and filter media of different adsorption capacities in a cold climate. Seven of the twelve filters received inflow water spiked with heavy metals. For one year, hydrated copper nitrate and hydrated nickel nitrate were added to sieved gully pot liquor to simulate contaminated primary treated storm water runoff. The inflow concentrations for dissolved copper, nickel and nitrate-nitrogen were approximately 1.0, 1.0 and 1.45 mg/l, respectively, which represent mean loading rates of 0.063 g/m(2)/d for Filters 2 and 7 to 11, and 0.115 g/m(2)/d for Filter 12. For these filters receiving metals, an obvious breakthrough of dissolved nickel was recorded after road gritting and salting during winter. Sodium chloride was responsible for nickel leaching. Reductions of copper, nickel, biochemical oxygen demand and suspended solids were frequently insufficient compared to international secondary wastewater treatment standards. Moreover, the overall filtration performance for all filters was similar.

Here, we examine the possibility of using a statistical model for source apportionment and retention of nutrients in a large transboundary drainage basin (44,000 km(2)). The model approach uses non-linear regression for simultaneous estimation of e.g. source strength, i.e. export coefficients to surface waters, for the different specified land-use or soil categories and retention coefficients for pollutants in a drainage basin. The model was tested on data from water quality stations with corresponding sub-basin data, i.e., land cover, point sources and atmospheric deposition, from the Estonian part of the Lake Peipsi drainage basin. The model showed that it was statistically possible to derive reliable export coefficients (i.e. unit-area loads) for nitrogen on agricultural land and forests. Moreover, it was shown with simple empirical functions that lake retention was approximately 30-35% for both nitrogen and phosphorus and that the riverine retention was low for both nitrogen and phosphorus (approx. 10%). Results show that the MESAW model is a simple and powerful tool for simultaneous estimation of sources and retention of nutrient loads in a river basin.

Constructed wetlands may be appropriate technologies for treating the domestic wastewater Generated by small communities in central Mexico. To assess the removal of pollutants from wastewater, we constructed a pilot-scale treatment wetland in the small community of Santa Maria Nativitas in the Rio Texcoco watershed. The system, consisting of sedimentation terraces, stabilization pond, subsurface flow wetland (SSFW) and vertical flow wetland (VFW), removed > 80% of TSS. COD and nitrate from domestic sewage. Removal of ammonium was less efficient at about 50%. This study also showed that ornamental flowers with high economic value planted in the SSFW performed as well as cattail (Typha angustifolia) in removing TSS and nitrogen. The treated water was suitable for irrigation, which could help to alleviate the scarcity of water in the Rio Texcoco watershed. Modeling exercises indicated that the pilot-scale wetland could be readily adapted to treat sewage from six families. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The physical part of the model allows describing the appearance and disappearance of the vertical thermal stratification, taking into account change in the water level and several depths for outflows. It is therefore well-suited to reservoir modelling. The biochemical part is based on a stoichiometric composition of the organic compounds which allows a rigorous computation of the elemental mass balance from the stoichiometric coefficients of the biochemical transformation processes. The model was applied to a reservoir over a 10-year-long period. During this period a restoration process of the reservoir was initiated mainly thanks to a substantial reduction of the phosphorus inputs. After having selected the identifiable set of parameters, the model was calibrated using trial and error and a Monte Carlo analysis using 6 months of data (bi-monthly vertical profiles of phytoplankton biomass, nutrients and dissolved oxygen) and was validated over two other study periods (about I year with similar available data and 3 years of data collected 6 years after the calibration period). The results show that despite the difficulties in identifying the "true" values of parameters, the model was able to reproduce the data even in different nutrients loading conditions and enables to evaluate the progress of the restoration process. The model results show that the reduction of phosphorus loading into the reservoir had a significant influence on the calculated oxygenation conditions, but only had a slight impact on Microcystis aeruginosa dominance in the reservoir.

The technique that optimally assimilates the two data sources is based on Bayes' theorem. The method considers the spatial accuracy characteristics of both transect and satellite data. The mathematical formulation of the method is generally applicable. Hence it can be applied to other environmental monitoring problems as well. This investigation demonstrates its feasibility for water quality mapping. The characteristic under investigation is chlorophyll (chl a) concentration, which is currently operationally monitored in the Baltic Sea at shipborne Alg@line transects, using flow-through fluorometer sampling systems. In order to optimally extrapolate transect observations the developed method benefits from the full spatial coverage of spaceborne optical spectroradiometer data. The results show that the estimation accuracy of regional chl a concentration during the spring bloom period substantially improves as satellite observations are assimilated to transect data. The assimilation results show significantly higher accuracies than those obtained using either extrapolated transect data or stand-alone retrieval algorithms for satellite data.

Dulse provides food for the abalone and improves water quality by removal of excreted ammonia. The system can be balanced by determining the effects of light intensity on dulse production and comparing these rates with dulse consumption by abalone of different sizes. In addition, uptake of ammonia by dulse under different light intensities can be balanced against excretion rates of abalone of different sizes. Dulse production rather than ammonia uptake is the limiting factor for rearing abalone in this system. An estimated 21-31 times more area is required for dulse production to meet abalone food requirements compared to that required for removal of excreted ammonia. Dulse production rates and light utilization efficiencies are high compared with those of other marine plants, such as kelp, and comparable to those of the most productive terrestrial crops. The availability of high, year-round light intensities is a key factor in determining the economic commercial value of such co-culture systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Summerfelt, ST; Sharrer, MJ				Summerfelt, ST; Sharrer, MJ			Design implication of carbon dioxide production within biofilters contained in recirculating salmonid culture systems	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Aquacultural-Engineeting-Society Issues Forum	NOV 03-05, 2003	Seattle, WA	Aquacultural Engn Soc		biofilter; carbon dioxide; ammonia; recirculating; aquaculture		The objectives of this research were (1) to experimentally quantify the dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) production within a biofilter (2) to use stoichiometry to estimate the CO2 production that would be expected across the biofilter due to nitrification and heterotrophic oxygen (O-2) demand (3) to compare the relative amounts of CO2 produced by the biofilter bacteria to the CO2 produced by the fish that are cultured in the recirculating system, and (4) to discuss implications for recirculating system design that must be considered when it is recognized that a large fraction of the CO2 produced in a recirculating system is produced by the biofilter. During this study, the fluidized-sand biofilter in the commercial-scale recirculating salmonid culture system at the Conservation Fund Freshwater Institute (Shepherdstown, West Virginia) produced 4.1 +/- 0.2 mg/L of CO2 while removing 0.51 +/- 0.02 mg/L total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) and removing 3.8 +/- 0.2 mg/L dissolved O-2. Taking into account the overall stoichiometric relationship between the ammonium, bicarbonate, and oxygen consumed and the cell mass, nitrate, water, and carbonic acid produced during nitrification and nitrifier synthesis, nitrifying bacteria consume 4.6 mg/L of oxygen while producing approximately 5.9 mg/L of CO2 for every 1 mg/L of TAN consumed. In addition, the estimated respiration of heterotrophic bacteria within the biofilter, as determined by the measured decrease in dissolved oxygen concentration across the biofilter minus the estimated DO consumption due to nitrification, accounts for another 1.38 mg/L of CO2 production for every 1 mg/L of DO consumed in the biofilter. Accounting for both TAN and DO removal measured across the biofilter, the biofilter's CO2 production can be estimated as 5.0 +/- 0.3 mg/L, which is reasonably close (approximately 20% greater) to the CO2 production that was measured experimentally. Because the fish produced 6.9 +/- 0.4 mg/L of CO2 that was measured during the same period, then the biofilter actually accounts for 37% of the total CO2 produced within this recirculating salmonid system. Therefore, the CO2 stripping unit should be placed immediately after the biofilter simply as common sense to optimize water quality. If the stripping unit were placed before the biofilter, then the fish would experience a CO2 concentration that would be at least 20% greater than if the stripping unit were placed immediately after the biofilter.

Research was conducted in the recirculating system located at the Conservation Fund Freshwater Institute (Shepherdstown, West Virginia), which contains a UV channel unit to treat 100% of the 4750 L/min recirculating water flow with an approximately 90 mW s/cm(2) UV irradiation dose. However, the majority of ozone destruction data was collected using a second UV irradiation unit that was used to treat a side-stream flow of water pumped from the commercial-scale recirculating system's LHO sump. The water flow in this side-stream was adjusted to 85, 170, 255, and 330 L/min (i.e., approximately 1.8-7.4% of the entire recirculating flow) so as to produce a range of different water retention times within the UV irradiation unit (i.e., 6.7, 3.3, 2.2, and 1.7 s, respectively) and thus produced UV irradiation doses of 153.3 +/- 2.1 mW s/cm(2), 80.4 +/- 2.6 mW s/cm(2), 49.3 +/- 0.6 MW s/cm(2), and 35.6 +/- 0.3 MW s/cm(2), respectively. The results show that dissolved O(3) removal across the UV irradiation unit could be modeled using first order kinetics and was dependent upon the inlet 03 concentration and the retention time within the irradiation chamber. At a temperature of 13-15 degreesC, UV irradiation doses of 80.4 2.6 mW s/cm(2) and 153.3 2.1 mW s/cm(2) consistently removed 100% of the dissolved O(3) When the inlet O(3) concentration was less than or equal to0.30 mg/L. A UV irradiation dose of 49.3 0.6 mW s/cm(2) consistently removed 100% of the dissolved O(3) when the inlet O(3) concentration was less than or equal to0.10 mg/L. A UV irradiation dose of 35.6 +/- 0.3 mW s/cm(2) could not remove 100% of the dissolved O(3) even at inlet O(3) concentration of less than or equal to0.10 mg/L. When dissolved O(3) data was averaged for each UV dosage applied, then approximately 91 +/- 2%, 81 +/- 5%, 77 +/- 1%, and 58 +/- 5% of the dissolved O(3) was removed when passed through UV dosages of 153.3 +/- 2.1 mW s/cm(2), 80.4 +/- 2.6 mW s/cm(2), 49.3 +/- 0.6 mW s/cm(2), and 35.6 +/- 0.3 MW s/cm(2), respectively. Note that the mean dissolved O(3) concentrations entering the UV unit were 0.64 +/- 0.09 mg/L, 0.51 +/- 0.10 mg/L, 0.41 +/- 0.06 mg/L, 0.43 +/- 0.07 mg/L, respectively, for the conditions just described.

The results show that DOM reacted with Hg(II) rapidly, and the complexation reached pseudo-equilibrium within 20 s. Maximum excitation/emission (Ex/Em) wavelengths shifted towards the longer wavelengths, indicating that DOM structure changed during its interaction with Hg(II). Using fluorescence quenching titrations, complexing parameters, conditional stability constants and the percentage of fluorophores participating in the complexation, were estimated by the modified Stern-Volmer equation. The experimental and field survey results suggest that the Hg-DOM complexation in various streams was related to water quality parameters, e.g. DOC, Cl-, and cation concentrations, and was strongly affected by UV irradiation.

J	Denys, L				Denys, L			Relation of abundance-weighted averages of diatom indicator values to measured environmental conditions in standing freshwaters	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						indicator values; Bacillariophyceae; water quality; phytobenthos; standing waters; Belgium	INFERENCE MODELS; EUTROPHICATION; LAKES; PH; ASSEMBLAGES; MOISTURE; STREAMS; INDEX; WA	Abundance-weighted averages of diatom indicator values for pH, salinity, organic nitrogen availability, oxygen saturation, saprobity and trophic status according to van Dam et al. [Neth. J. Aquat. Ecol. 28 (1994) 117] were calculated for surface sediment and epiphytic diatom assemblages in 186 standing waters distributed throughout Flanders, Belgium, and tested against environmental variables measured in the water column, covering water chemistry, trophic status and organic load. With exception of the pH indication, most scores related rather poorly to variables which they are assumed to reflect and correlated even more strongly to non-target variables. For instance, the trophic indication provided a measure of pH and base status rather than of nutrient levels or phytoplankton productivity. Relations to measured variables differed according to the pH regime. Correction for uneven distribution of indicator values in the species pool usually yielded little improvement and was detrimental in some cases. Compared to epiphyton, weighted averages of species indicator values derived from sediment assemblages tended to be higher in water bodies yielding the most elevated indication scores. Except for the pH and salinity indication, differences between weighted averages pertaining to these different habitats were often considerable. Limitations to the use of abundance-weighted averages of diatom indicator values for environmental monitoring and assessment of lentic waters are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Septic Tank Impacts on Ground Water Quality and Nearshore Sediment Nutrient Flux	GROUND WATER			English	Article							DOMESTIC WASTE-WATER; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; COASTAL EMBAYMENT; DISPOSAL SYSTEMS; NITROGEN LOSSES; SURFACE WATERS; PHOSPHORUS; TRANSPORT; DISCHARGE; CONTAMINATION	Field studies were conducted at three coastal plain sites to characterize inorganic nutrient and fecal coliform bacteria ground water quality and intertidal sediment nutrient fluxes under the influence of residential septic tank effluent. Mean drainfield DIP (dissolved inorganic phosphorus) and DIN (dissolved inorganic nitrogen) concentrations varied between 294 to 336 and 4494 to 5391 mu mol/L, respectively, with mean fecal coliform bacteria densities ranging from 10(5.04) to 10(6.29) MPN (most probable number) /100 mL. DIP and fecal coliform bacteria exhibited a high degree of attenuation with shoreline concentrations at or near background levels. In contrast, septic tank nitrogen loadings to shallow ground water were significant and resulted in mean shoreline DIN concentrations similar to 50 to 100 times greater than adjacent surface water concentrations. Mean site sediment DIP and DIN flux to surface waters varied from 1.1 to 1.6 and 52 to 135 mu mol/m(2)/hr, respectively. Whereas DIP sediment fluxes were similar to reported values for sites adjacent to forested and agricultural lands, DIN fluxes were elevated compared to forested lands and near the lower end of the range reported for agricultural lands within the southern Chesapeake Bay region. Maximum measured sediment DIN flux was 1514 mu mol/m(2)/hr. Estimated waste water nitrogen loading to shallow ground water (5.7 to 10.7 kg/household/yr) was significant and with 0.5 to 1 acre lot sizes, comparable to water table nitrogen loadings from dominant row-crop land use in the mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain. Given the trends in population growth in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and other coastal regions, nitrogen loads from septic tanks to these systems should also be expected to increase.

J	Cooper, DM				Cooper, DM			Some effects of sampling design on water quality estimation in streams	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES			English	Article						kriging; Plynlimon; sampling design; stream water quality	CONSTITUENT LOADS; TRENDS; WALES; MODEL; STRATEGIES; CATCHMENTS; PLYNLIMON; NITROGEN; UK	Stream sampling programmes for water quality estimation constitute a statistical survey of a correlated population. The properties of parameter and other estimates made from sample values from such programmes are set in the context of statistical sampling theory. It is shown that a model-based rather than a design-based approach to statistical analysis is usually appropriate. The influence of model structure and sampling design on the robustness and suitability of estimation procedures is investigated, and relationships with kriging are demonstrated. Methodology is discussed with reference to data from a UK sampling programme.

J	Dahl, M; Pers, BC				Dahl, M; Pers, BC			Comparison of four models simulating phosphorus dynamics in Lake Vanern, Sweden	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article						lake; phosphorus; model; scenarios; simulation	EUTROPHICATION	This paper compares four water quality models applied to Lake Vanern, Sweden. The comparison is focused on phosphorus, the primary limiting nutrient in Lake Vanern. Two of the models, FYRISA and HBV-NP, are simple and were developed as parts of catchment models. Two other models, called LEEDS and MOM are more comprehensive lake models. The models were calibrated using data from the period 1985-1992 and validated using data from the period 1993-2000. The fit to calibration data is similar for the FYRISA, HBV-NP, and LEEDS models, and slightly worse for the BIOLA model. All models fit the validation data almost as well as the calibration data. The models behaviour was tested in two representative scenarios. An increase of emissions by 40% from a pulp and paper mill has a negligible effect on the water quality, while a decrease in phosphorus load by 14% (accomplished by better waste-water treatment in rural households) gives a considerable decrease in phosphorus concentration in the lake. Still, the results of the scenarios vary between the models.

J	Sumagaysay-Chavoso, NS; San Diego-McGlone, ML; David, LT				Sumagaysay-Chavoso, NS; San Diego-McGlone, ML; David, LT			Environmental capacity of receiving water as basis for regulating intensity of milkfish (Chanos chanos Forsskal) culture	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY			English	Article							NITROGEN; EUTROPHICATION; AQUACULTURE; MANAGEMENT; ESTUARIES; QUALITY; IMPACTS; MODEL	This paper presents the results of the assessment of the environmental condition of a receiving water and demonstrates how the environmental capacity of the system can be estimated based on effluent discharge from milkfish ponds and water criteria from scientific literature and other studies. An estuary (average volume, 295 333 m(3); average depth, 1.9 m) in Punta Pulao, Dumangas, Iloilo, Philippines served as discharge and irrigation system for commercial milkfish ponds and experimental/verification ponds owned by the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center. Total ammonia nitrogen, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, and chlorophyll a (chl a) were determined monthly (during spring tide) for 4 months. Samples were taken at low and high tides that coincided with the draining and flooding of ponds, respectively. Monthly concentrations of these water quality variables generally increased from the first to fourth month of sampling (April-July 2001) during low tide. Very slight increases were observed during high tide. The magnitude of changes in the diurnal patterns of phosphate, chl a, and dissolved oxygen appeared to be higher at spring tide than at neap tide. This indicates that the inflowing river at low tide (during spring tide) brought effluents containing high amounts of nutrients from ponds located upstream. The water, salt, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), and phosphate (DIP) budgets of the entire estuary were determined following the one-box model by LOICZ-IGBP (2000, LOICZ biochemical budgeting procedure: a tutorial pamphlet. L. T. David, M. L. San Diego-McGlone, C. J. Crossland and S. V. Smith (Eds). Publ. for LOICZ International Project Office, the Netherlands, 29 pp.). The budgets indicate that the system is net heterotrophic and nitrogen (N) fixing during the dry months, but that there could be no environmental impact during the rainy months because of short water exchange time. Results further suggest that the system is a source of N and phosphorus (P) during the dry and rainy months; the condition is largely influenced by the high amount of nutrient inputs in to the river. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine relationship between nutrient concentrations in the system and total DIN or DIP input to the system at low tide. Environmental capacity in terms of the maximum amount of DIN or DIP input to the system was predicted using regression analysis and following set criteria for nutrients, i.e. nitrite, nitrate, and phosphate. At present, the estuarine water quality has already reached its environmental capacity during the dry months. About 945 ha of commercial milkfish ponds are operating upstream, mostly as extensive systems. If these ponds are converted to semi-intensive or intensive systems, it is recommended that the pond area be reduced to 122 ha if the DIP criterion is to be followed so as not to exceed the environmental capacity. Exceeding this environmental capacity may affect production through reduction of fish growth, occurrence of diseases, and fish mortalities.

To assist with effective management of cyanobacterial growth, numerical models that are either site specific or universally applicable can be employed. An artificially destratified reservoir was modelled with the coupled hydrodynamic-ecological numerical model DYRESM-CAEDYM. The validation site was Myponga Reservoir, South Australia, a highly managed drinking water supply reservoir. Chemical dosing (CuSO4) and artificial mixing via an aerator and two raft-mounted mechanical surface mixers ( hereafter referred to as surface mixers) are used at Myponga to manage the growth of the scum-forming cyanobacterium Anabaena circinalis. The dominant phytoplankton community was adequately modelled, and combinations of the various management options were simulated whereupon informed operational strategies could be implemented. Without any intervention, permanent stratification would occur and the growth of Anabaena circinalis would peak above 3 mu g L-1, producing geosmin that would exceed the taste and odour threshold (10 ng L-1); with the individual use of the aerator or surface mixers, growth of Anabaena circinalis was significantly reduced to below 1 mu g L-1.

A self-designed rainfall simulator was used. In situ rainfall simulations were used to: (1) compare the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous in different land use/land covers and (2) evaluate the flux of nitrogen and phosphorous export from runoff and sediment in various types of land use/land covers. Three duplicated experiments were carried out under rain intensity of 2 mm/min, each lasting 32 minutes on a 3 m(2) plot. Characteristics of various species of nitrogen and phosphorous in runoff and sediment were investigated. The results showed that the concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorous (TP) were greatest in runoff from mulberry trees and smallest from pine forest. The TN and TP export was mainly from suspended particulate in runoff. TN and TP exports from the top 10 cm layer of five types of land use/land covers were estimated as high as 4.66 to 9.40 g/m(2) and 2.57 to 4.89 g/m(2), respectively, of which exports through sediment of runoff accounted for more than 90 percent and 97 percent. The rate of TN and TP exports ranged from 2.68 to approximately 14.48 and 0.45 to approximately 4.11 mg/m(2)/min in runoff; these rates were much lower than those of 100.01 to approximately 172.67 and 72.82 to approximately 135.96 mg/m(2)/min in the runoff sediment.

J	Reginato, M; Piechota, TC				Reginato, M; Piechota, TC			Nutrient contribution of nonpoint source runoff in the Las Vegas Valley	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						nonpoint source pollution; Geographic Information Systems; modeling; storm water management; watershed management; surface water hydrology	SYSTEM	A Geographic Information System (GIS) based nonpoint source runoff model is developed for the Las Vegas Valley, Nevada, to estimate the nutrient loads during the years 2000 and 2001. The estimated nonpoint source loads are compared with current wastewater treatment facilities loads to determine the nonpoint source contribution of total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and total suspended solids (TSS) on a monthly and annual time scale. An innovative calibration procedure is used to estimate the pollutant concentrations for different land uses based on available water quality data at the outlet. Results indicate that the pollutant concentrations are higher for the Las Vegas Valley than previous published values for semi-arid and and regions. The total TP and TN loads from nonpoint sources are approximately 15 percent and 4 percent, respectively, of the total load to the receiving water body, Lake Mead. The TP loads during wet periods approach the permitted loads from the wastewater treatment plants that discharge into Las Vegas Wash. In addition, the GIS model is used to track pollutant loads in the stream channels for one of the subwatersheds. This is useful for planning the location of Best Management Practices to control nonpoint pollutant loads.

J	Herb, WR; Stefan, HG				Herb, WR; Stefan, HG			Temperature stratification and mixing dynamics in a shallow lake with submersed macrophytes	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						heat transfer model; shallow lake; stratification; submersed rnacrophytes; water temperature; wind mixing	SIMULATION-MODEL; PHYTOPLANKTON; MECHANISMS; SEDIMENT	This paper describes an investigation of temperature stratification and vertical mixing in lacustrine macrophyte beds. Field measurements in a shallow lake show pronounced diel temperature dynamics, driven by surface heat transfer. The temperature stratification data also indicate a significant dependence of vertical mixing characteristics on macrophyte stand height. While natural convective mixing during night-time cooling was rather uniform between measurement sites, wind-driven mixing during the day was significantly attenuated in dense, full-depth macrophyte beds, resulting in increased stratification and higher maximum surface temperatures. An unsteady, one-dimensional heat transfer model has been formulated to simulate temperature dynamics in shallow lakes with submersed macrophytes. Surface mixed layer dynamics are successfully modeled at time scales down to 1 hour, using an integral energy model formulated to include the effect of light attenuation and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation by submersed macrophytes. The results of this study have implications for the management of water quality and ecology of shallow lakes, as variation of thermal stratification and mixing likely has corresponding effects on the transport of dissolved oxygen and nutrients.

J	Cameron, KC; Di, HJ				Cameron, KC; Di, HJ			Nitrogen leaching losses from different forms and rates of farm effluent applied to a Templeton soil in Canterbury, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH			English	Article						farm; effluent; nitrate; leaching; urine; waste; nitrification inhibitor; pasture; water quality	DAIRY SHED EFFLUENT; NITRIFICATION INHIBITOR; PASTURE SOIL; AMMONIUM FERTILIZER; FLOOD IRRIGATION; GRAZED GRASSLAND; OXIDE EMISSIONS; COW URINE; LYSIMETER; SPRAY	The leaching losses of nitrogen from a range of farm effluents and wastes, including pig slurry, dairy pond sludge, farm-dairy effluent, and cow urine are compared on a Templeton fine sandy loam. At similar rates of application, leaching losses decreased in the following order: cow urine>pig slurry>farm-dairy effluent>dairy pond sludge. The susceptibility to leaching is determined by the forms of the N in the waste, and a high N :C ratio alone is not an adequate predictor of leaching intensity. Nitrate is most susceptible to leaching, followed by ammonium and organic forms of N. Splitting the applications of effluent into two or four portions applied at different times reduced the overall quantity of nitrate leached by c. 30%, depending on the waste. Similarly, reducing the overall rate from 400 to 200 kg N/ha also reduced the N leaching loss by c. 30%, depending on the particular waste. It is recommended that the land application of farm waste be based on a knowledge of the propensity of different kinds of wastes to contaminate groundwater, especially with nitrate-N. An effective mitigation technology to reduce nitrate leaching from grazed pasture soils is to treat the soil, including cow urine areas, with a nitrification inhibitor, e.g., dicyandiamide (DCD), which has been found to reduce nitrate leaching losses by 60%, decrease nitrous oxide emissions by over 75%, and increase pasture yield by over 10%.

J	Martin, AJ; Pedersen, TF				Martin, AJ; Pedersen, TF			Alteration to lake trophic status as a means to control arsenic mobility in a mine-impacted lake	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						arsenic; eutrophication; lake; diagenesis; mining; remediation	NORTHWESTERN ONTARIO; SEDIMENTS; AREA; EUTROPHICATION; PHOSPHORUS; WASHINGTON; REDUCTION; POREWATER; TAILINGS; WATERS	The relationship between lake trophic status, sedimentary redox conditions and As mobility was examined in mine-impacted Balmer Lake, Canada. Under the current redox regime, the reductive dissolution of As-bearing Fe(III) oxyhydroxides occurs in close proximity to the sediment-water interface, resulting in the remobilization of dissolved As in the shallow porewaters to values as high as 8.5 mg L-1. The shallow depth of the oxic zone limits the extent to which As can be re-sorbed in the interfacial horizons, and as a result, a proportion of the remobilized As escapes into the water column where it poses a water quality concern. Examination of the relationship between summer average chlorophyll a and total P at spring overturn in the lake water column demonstrates that Balmer Lake is currently eutrophic as a result of mining-derived inputs of P (domestic waters) and N (blasting residues and cyanide breakdown products). The results suggest that actively pushing the system towards oligotrophy by reducing non-natural P loadings to the system will decrease rates of in situ production and associated sediment oxygen demand, which will in turn result in increased thickness of the aerobic zone and enhanced As scavenging. Such conclusions are supported by porewater data which indicate that the flux of As to the water column is significantly reduced when the Fe(III) redox cline is situated at deeper sediment depths, In the absence of detailed P-loading data, it is recommended that P inputs be reduced to similar to10% of the estimated pre-mining P loading of similar to200 kg yr(-1). This implies reducing the collective P-loadings from the two mine sites adjacent to the lake from the approximate current value (similar to150 kg yr(-1)) to similar to20 kg yr(-1). It is proposed that establishment of oligotrophy in the lake should significantly mitigate the current level of dissolved As in lake waters. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A mass balance indicates that the basin retains about 50% of gross N inputs, mostly in terrestrial components of the landscape, and the loss and retention of total nitrogen ( TN) in the aquatic environment was about 9% of stream loading. Uptake lengths of PO(4) and NH(4) were measurable in headwater streams, but NO(3) uptake was below detection ( minimum detection limit = 0.05 muM). Retention or loss of NO(3) was observed in a main stem reach bordered by wetland habitat. Nitrate removal in urban headwater tributaries was because of water withdrawals and denitrification during hypoxic events and in ponded wetlands with long water residence times. A mass balance using an entire river network indicates that basin-wide losses due to aquatic denitrification are considerably lower than estimates from several recent studies and range from 4 to 16% of TDN in stream loading. Withdrawals for domestic use restrict the runoff of headwater catchments from reaching the main stem during low base flow periods, thereby contributing to the spatial and temporal regulation of N export from headwater tributaries.

Turfgrass clipping samples were obtained from commercial golf course purring greens and their reflectance were measured using a dual-type spectroradiometer under artificial illumination 3 h and 51 h after mowing. The reflectance values in green band (520 to 580 nm) and the NIR band (770 to 1050 nm) increased as the nitrogen content increased. Four wavelength bands at 550, 680, 770, and 810 nm were selected to develop and compare several regression models with varying number of variables. All models performed well (R-2 > 0.82) and predicted the nitrogen content with reasonable standard error of prediction (SEP) values (SEP < 0.62%)for the data taken 3 h after mowing. However file data taken 51 h after mowing on the same samples did not yield good results (R-2 < 0.60: SEP > 1.04%). A discriminant analysis showed that the regression model with two wavelength variables performed as well as the models with a higher number of variables. A simple reflectance sensor using even only one photodiode and bandpass filter can be developed to predict or classify the nitrogen content of turfgrass clippings when the reflectance data are taken within several hours of mowing.

The physical model is a modified ECOM-si version with inclusion of flooding/draining process over the intertidal salt marsh. The water quality model is a modified WASP5 with inclusion of nutrient fluxes from the bottom sediment layer. The coupled model was driven by tidal forcings at the open boundary in the inner shelf of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB) and real-time river discharge at the upstream of the estuary. The initial condition for salinity was specified using the field measurement data taken along the estuary. The water quality components were assumed as constant values everywhere at the initial., with assumption that the spatial and temporal variations of these variables were caused by physical-biological-chemical interactions under strong tidal mixing environment. The model-predicted concentrations of inorganic nutrients (ammonium, nitrate plus nitrite, and ortho-phosphorus), chlorophyll-a, and dissolved oxygen (DO) in an along-estuary transect were in reasonable agreement with observational data. Process studies suggest that the intertidal salt marsh acts as a main sink for particulate materials and a major consumer of DO. The low DO concentration in the Satilla River Estuary was mainly due to high sediment oxygen demand (SOD) over the intertidal salt marsh. This feature is the nature of the estuarine-salt marsh ecosystem with nothing related to anthropogenic activities. Tidal mixing-induced bottom resuspension process played a critical role in supplying the nutrients in the water column in addition to the nitrification process. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Water quality model predictions as well as nutrient bioassays indicate that a 30% reduction in N will result in a 15% reduction in phytoplankton biomass (as chlorophyll a) in the NRE. Using previously published NRE light extinction coefficient component data and NRE irradiance data, we calculated that the average NRE compensation depth (<1% surface irradiance) would deepen by 13cm following a 15% reduction in phytoplankton biomass. Hydrographic and bathymetry data were used in a Geographical Information System to plot the resulting increase in euphotic sediment surface area based on the predicted change in the compensation depth. The newly created euphotic sediment surface area represents 4.47 X 10(6) m(2) which is 20% larger than the average sediment surface area in the euphotic zone during the study period (1998-2000). Previous NRE work revealed that euphotic sediment in the NRE support autotrophic benthic microalgal communities (BMC) that alter oxygen and nutrient fluxes. To further quantify this effect, we conducted a series of light versus dark incubations of NRE sediments collected from above (shallow euphotic areas < 1 in water depth) and below (deep aphotic areas > 3.5 m water depth) the compensation depth. Sediment oxygen demand (SOD), nutrient flux and organic matter content were significantly lower in shallow water cores compared to their deep-water counterparts. Furthermore, the illuminated shallow cores demonstrated a 45% decrease in SOD compared to shallow cores incubated in the dark. The combined effect of the projected increase in BMC habitat coupled with the reduction in SOD and nutrient flux associated with BMC represents an overlooked and potentially important benefit of reduced N inputs that could accelerate water quality recovery in the NRE.

J	Lal, R				Lal, R			Soil carbon sequestration to mitigate climate change	GEODERMA			English	Review						greenhouse effect; soil restoration; conservation tillage; mulch fanning; cover cropping; the global C cycle	ORGANIC-MATTER CONTENT; RESIDUE MANAGEMENT; CHANGE COMMITMENTS; CROPPING SYSTEMS; LAND MANAGEMENT; ATMOSPHERIC CO2; EUROPEAN SOILS; NITROGEN; EROSION; AGRICULTURE	The increase in atmospheric concentration of CO2 by 31% since 1750 from fossil fuel combustion and land use change necessitates identification of strategies for mitigating the threat of the attendant global warming. Since the industrial revolution, global emissions of carbon (C) are estimated at 270 +/- 30 Pg (Pg = petagram = 10(15) g = 1 billion ton) due to fossil fuel combustion and 136 55 Pg due to land use change and soil cultivation. Emissions due to land use change include those by deforestation, biomass burning, conversion of natural to agricultural ecosystems, drainage of wetlands and soil cultivation. Depletion of soil organic C (SOC) pool have contributed 78 +/- 12 Pg of C to the atmosphere. Some cultivated soils have lost one-half to two-thirds of the original SOC pool with a cumulative loss of 30-40 Mg C/ha (Mg = megagram = 106 g = 1 ton). The depletion of soil C is accentuated by soil degradation and exacerbated by land misuse and soil mismanagement. Thus, adoption of a restorative land use and recommended management practices (RMPs) on agricultural soils can reduce the rate of enrichment of atmospheric CO2 while having positive impacts on food security, agro-industries, water quality and the environment. A considerable part of the depleted SOC pool can be restored through conversion of marginal lands into restorative land uses, adoption of conservation tillage with cover crops and crop residue mulch, nutrient cycling including the use of compost and manure, and other systems of sustainable management of soil and water resources. Measured rates of soil C sequestration through adoption of RMPs range from 50 to 1000 kg/ha/year. The global potential of SOC sequestration through these practices is 0.9 +/- 0.3 Pg C/year, which may offset one-fourth to one-third of the annual increase in atmospheric CO2 estimated at 3.3 Pg C/year. The cumulative potential of soil C sequestration over 25-50 years is 30-60 Pg. The soil C sequestration is a truly win-win strategy. It restores degraded soils, enhances biomass production, purifies surface and ground waters, and reduces the rate of enrichment of atmospheric CO2 by offsetting emissions due to fossil fuel.

The objective of this study is to examine how effectively various nutrient-reduction measures can improve water quality in Mikawa Bay, central Japan. Both hydrodynamic and water quality variables were simulated using a model which includes a series of hydrodynamic equations and 13 mass conservation equations related to water quality, such as chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, etc. The calculated spatial distribution and temporal variations of the chlorophyll-a, nutrient, dissolved oxygen, as well as temperature and salinity, showed generally good agreement with field observations. Analysis of various nutrient-reduction measures suggested that nutrient reduction from sediment resuspension can more effectively reduce chlorophyll-a compared with nutrient loading reduction through rivers from land areas. For suppression of alga growth in Mikawa Bay, control of inorganic nitrogen, especially that of NH4, was a key factor. That is why a decrease in nutrient resuspension from sediment was more effective for reducing chlorophyll-a, since nitrogen resuspension occurred mostly in the form of NH4.

J	Zheng, FL; Huang, CH; Norton, LD				Zheng, FL; Huang, CH; Norton, LD			Surface water quality - Effects of near-surface hydraulic gradients on nitrate and phosphorus losses in surface runoff	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							EROSION PROCESSES; SOIL-PHOSPHORUS; TRANSPORT; NITROGEN; EUTROPHICATION; MANAGEMENT; UPLAND	Phosphorous (P) and nitrogen (N) in runoff from agricultural fields are key components of nonpoint-source pollution and can accelerate eutrophication of surface waters. A laboratory study was designed to evaluate effects of near-surface hydraulic gradients on P and N losses in surface runoff from soil pans at 5% slope under simulated rainfall. Experimental treatments included three rates of fertilizer input (control [no fertilizer input], low [40 kg P ha(-1), 100 kg N ha(-1)], and high [80 kg P ha(-1), 200 kg N ha(-1)]) and four near-surface hydraulic gradients (free drainage [FD], saturation [Sa], artesian seepage without rain [Sp], and artesian seepage with rain [Sp + R]). Simulated rainfall of 50 min h(-1) was applied for 90 min. The results showed that near-surface hydraulic gradients have dramatic effects on NO3-N and PO4-P losses and runoff water quality. Under the low fertilizer treatment, the average concentrations in surface runoff from FD, Sa, Sp, and Sp + R were 0.08, 2.20, 529.5, and 71.8 mg L-1 for NO3-N and 0.11, 0.54, 0.91, and 0.72 mg L-1 for PO,P, respectively. Similar trends were observed for the concentrations of NO3-N and PO4-P under the high fertilizer treatment. The total NO3-N loss under the FD treatment was only 0.01% of the applied nitrogen, while under the Sp and Sp + R treatments, the total NO3-N loss was 11 to 16% of the applied nitrogen. These results show that artesian seepage could make a significant contribution to water quality problems.

J	Schroeder, PD; Radcliffe, DE; Cabrera, ML				Schroeder, PD; Radcliffe, DE; Cabrera, ML			Rainfall timing and poultry litter application rate effects on phosphorus loss in surface runoff	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							MICROBIAL BIOMASS; WATER-QUALITY; SOIL; NITROGEN; MANURE	Phosphorus (P) in runoff from pastures amended with poultry litter may be a significant contributor to eutrophication of lakes and streams in Georgia and other areas in the southeastern United States. The objectives of this research were to determine the effects of litter application rate and initial runoff timing on the long-term loss of P in runoff from surface-applied poultry litter and to develop equations that predict P loss in runoff under these conditions. Litter application rates of 2, 7, and 13 Mg ha(-1), and three rainfall scenarios applied to 1- X 2-m plots in a 3 X 3 randomized complete block design with three replications. The rainfall scenarios included (i) sufficient rainfall to produce runoff immediately after litter application; (ii) no rainfall for 30 d after litter application; and (iii) small rainfall events every 7 d (5 min at 75 mm h(-1)) for 30 d. Phosphorus loss was greatest from the high litter rate and immediate runoff treatments. Nonlinear regression equations based on the small plot study produced fairly accurate (r(2) = 0.52-0.62) prediction of P concentrations in runoff water from larger (0.75 ha) fields over a 2-yr period. Predicted P concentrations were closest to observed values for events that occurred shortly after litter application, and the relative error in predictions increased with time after litter application. In addition, previously developed equations relating soil test P levels to runoff P concentrations were ineffective in the presence of surface-applied litter.

The trend analysis of ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and reactive phosphorus (RP) yielded rather different results. The decrease in ammonia nitrogen concentration, in particular, in the basin influenced by severe industrial discharges, is accurately described by a negative exponential model. The nitrate concentration did not show significant interannual trends, while wide seasonal variations have been detected. Reactive phosphorus concentration increased until the end of the 1970s at the stations close to the industrial area as well as in those influenced by river discharges and by sewages of the city of Venice. The sudden decrease that followed was most likely related with environmental policies, namely the improvement of wastewater purification treatments and the regulation of phosphorus use in detergents.

A preliminary analysis is presented that tests the effectiveness of P index predictions using linkages to sediment and surface water P concentrations. The field P status in the Elk Creek watershed is described according to P inputs by land managers, soil characteristics, and sediment and water quality analyses. The watershed is partitioned into contributing areas, and the available P in soils shows an increase in concentration in the downstream direction. The P index ratings also show an increase in vulnerability for P loss from soil to surface waters in the lower part of the watershed. The rankings are in agreement with the intensity of land use, and this is reflected in the increase in predominance of the source factors as the main contributor to the D index ratings. In spite of complex process interaction associated with sediment movement, the stream sediment showed similar trends to the soils and P index ratings. Increases in total P in wet-season stream water at the outlet of the watershed may indicate the downstream cumulative effects predicted by the P index ratings.

J	Zou, R; Lung, WS				Zou, R; Lung, WS			Robust water quality model calibration using an alternating fitness genetic algorithm	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE			English	Article							PHOSPHORUS; LAKES; EUTROPHICATION; OXYGEN	Presented herein is a robust approach to calibrating water quality models for water quality management using sparse field data. The calibration procedure adopts genetic algorithms (GAs) to inversely solve the governing equations, along with an alternating fitness method to maintain solution diversity. The proposed approach is illustrated with a total phosphorus model of the Triadelphia Reservoir in Maryland. A series of deterministic and stochastic alternating fitness GA schemes are implemented and compared with a standard GA. Significantly higher diversity is observed in the solutions obtained by the alternating fitness method than by the standard process. The diversified solutions obtained by the alternating fitness GA method are then classified into several patterns using a parameter pattern recognition model. The best solutions to each pattern are then chosen for further projection analyses, which generate a range of prediction results that provide decision makers with information for formulating sound pollution control schemes.

J	Grismer, ME; Hogan, MP				Grismer, ME; Hogan, MP			Simulated rainfall evaluation of revegetation/mulch erosion control in the lake tahoe basin - 1: Method assessment	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						rainfall simulation; grass revegetation; subalpine environment; semiarid; sediment source control	HILLSLOPE SURFACE PROTECTION; CONTROL-SYSTEMS; AVAILABLE DATA; SOIL-EROSION; RUNOFF	Revegetation of road cuts and fills is intended to stabilize those drastically disturbed areas so that sediment is not transported to adjacent waterways. Sediment has resulted in water quality degradation, an extremely critical issue in the Lake Tahoe Basin. Many revegetation efforts in this semiarid, subalpine environment have resulted in low levels of plant cover, thus failing to meet project goals. Further, no adequate physical method of assessing project effectiveness has been developed, relative to runoff or sediment movement. This paper describes the use of a portable rainfall simulator (RS) to conduct a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of a variety of erosion-control treatments and treatment effects on hydrologic parameters and erosion. The particular goal of this paper is to determine whether the RS method can measure revegetation treatment effects on infiltration and erosion. The RS-plot studies were used to determine slope, cover (mulch and vegetation) and surface roughness effects on infiltration, runoff and erosion rates at several roadcuts across the basin. A rainfall rate of approximate to60 mm h(-1), approximating the 100-yr, 15-min design storm, was applied over replicated 0.64 m(2) plots in each treatment type and over bare-soil plots for comparison. Simulated rainfall had a mean drop size of approximate to2(.)1 mm and approximately 70% of 'natural' kinetic energy. Measured parameters included time to runoff, infiltration, runoff/infiltration rate, sediment discharge rate and average sediment concentration as well as analysis of total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and dissolved phosphorus (TDP) from filtered (0(.)45 mum) runoff samples. Runoff rates, sediment concentrations and yields were greater from volcanic soils as compared to that from granitic soils for nearly all cover conditions. For example, bare soil sediment yields from volcanic soils ranged from 2-12 as compared to 0-33 g m(-2) mm(-1) for granitic soils. Pine-needle mulch cover treatments substantially reduced sediment yields from all plots. Plot microtopography or roughness and cross-slope had no effect on sediment concentrations in runoff or sediment yield. RS measurements showed discernible differences in runoff, infiltration, and sediment yields between treatments. Runoff nutrient concentrations were not distinguishable from that in the rainwater used. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

Bulk tank milk was sampled to determinate physical and chemical characteristics and somatic cell count (SCC), mastitis percentage and milk production (liters/cow/day). Besides that, samples of feeds and water used for drinking and cleaning were collected. There were not significant differences between months for milk production, crioscopy, percentages of fat, total solids, non protein nitrogen and SCC, but true protein percentages were higher on October and November, and casein showed higher values on October, November, March and April. Total solids were higher on December. Acidity varied in same way as mastitis percentage, higher on November and May. Negative relations between milk production and percentage of fat, percent of mastitis and somatic cell count were detected, while a positive one was verified between milk production and lactose percentage. Milk obtained during the year showed differences between months for protein fraction, acidity, solids non fat and percentage of mastitis. Water quality did not change among collection months and it was acceptable for drinking and cleaning.

Additionally, cost implications of establishing and maintaining environmentally effective BMPs are often a crucial factor in selecting and adopting BMPs. This article considers both water quality and economic concerns and presents a methodology developed for determining cost-effective farm- or watershed-level scenarios through optimization. This optimization technique uniquely incorporates three existing tools: a genetic algorithm (GA), a watershed-level nonpoint-source model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool, SWAT), and a BMP tool. The GA combines initial pollutant loadings from SWAT with literature-based pollution reduction efficiencies from the BMP tool and with BMP costs to determine cost-effective watershed scenarios. The methodology was successfully applied to a 300 ha farm within the Cannonsville Reservoir watershed, a phosphorus (P) restricted reservoir within New York City's water supply system. An average reduction in dissolved P of 60% over the lifetime of the BMPs was set as the pollutant target. A baseline scenario was established to represent practices on the farm before BMP implementation. The most cost-effective scenario for the farm, under the presented methodology, achieved a cost-effectiveness of 0.6 kg dissolved P reduction per dollar spent per year Additionally, the methodology determined alternative scenarios for the farm, which met the pollution reduction criterion cost-effectively. The methodology, as developed, is extendable to multi-farm or watershed-level evaluations.

J	Lyon, SW; Walter, MT; Gerard-Marchant, P; Steenhuis, TS				Lyon, SW; Walter, MT; Gerard-Marchant, P; Steenhuis, TS			Using a topographic index to distribute variable source area runoff predicted with the SCS curve-number equation	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						variable source area hydrology; curve number; topographic index; runoff prediction	EVALUATING PARTIAL AREAS; PHOSPHORUS TRANSPORT; SOIL-MOISTURE; WATER-QUALITY; TOPMODEL; MODEL; FLOW; PATTERNS; RAINFALL	Because the traditional Soil Conservation Service curve-number (SCS-CN) approach continues to be used ubiquitously in water quality models, new application methods are needed that are consistent with variable source area (VSA) hydrological processes in the landscape. We developed and tested a distributed approach for applying the traditional SCS-CN equation to watersheds where VSA hydrology is a dominant process. Predicting the location of source areas is important for watershed planning because restricting potentially polluting activities from runoff source areas is fundamental to controlling non-point-source pollution. The method presented here used the traditional SCS-CN approach to predict runoff volume and spatial extent of saturated areas and a topographic index, like that used in TOPMODEL, to distribute runoff source areas through watersheds. The resulting distributed CN-VSA method was applied to two subwatersheds of the Delaware basin in the Catskill Mountains region of New York State and one watershed in south-eastern Australia to produce runoff-probability maps. Observed saturated area locations in the watersheds agreed with the distributed CN-VSA method. Results showed good agreement with those obtained from the previously validated soil moisture routing (SMR) model. When compared with the traditional SCS-CN method, the distributed CN-VSA method predicted a similar total volume of runoff, but vastly different locations of runoff generation. Thus, the distributed CN-VSA approach provides a physically based method that is simple enough to be incorporated into water quality models, and other tools that currently use the traditional SCS-CN method, while still adhering to the principles of VSA hydrology.

There are several reported examples of the transient leakage of nitrate-N to surface waters from eastern US forests that have sustained outbreaks of defoliating insects, such as the introduced gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) larva. Previous research has suggested that annual nitrate-N leakage from disturbed forests can be modelled using an empirically derived unit nitrogen export response function (UNERF) model. The model represents annual nitrate-N export as a linear deterministic process in both space and time and is analogous to a unit hydrograph. The goal of the present study was to verify and apply a regionalized, lithology-based UNERF model that references the geographic distribution of bedrock class and the timing and extent of gypsy moth defoliation of forests in the non-glaciated highlands of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Despite an inability to verify the model for most individual watersheds within the study area, the model was able to reproduce the statistical distribution of annual nitrate-N export to streams that comprised our target population. During water year 1991 (the year following peak defoliation) the model results indicated that regional annual nitrate-N export had transiently increased by nearly 1500% from a baseline rate of about 0.1 kg ha(-1) to a peak value approaching 1.5 kg ha(-1). We thus conclude that natural vegetation disturbance is an important mechanism by which dissolved nitrogen is leaked from forested lands to small streams, rivers, and Chesapeake Bay. The present study also illustrates how simple, empirically derived linear systems approaches like the UNERF model can be successfully applied to problems where regionalization is a primary goal.

J	Yoon, TI; Lee, HS; Kim, CG				Yoon, TI; Lee, HS; Kim, CG			Comparison of pilot scale performances between membrane bioreactor and hybrid conventional wastewater treatment systems	JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE			English	Article						MBR; nutrients removal; biological and chemical processes	BIOLOGICAL PHOSPHORUS REMOVAL; SOLIDS RETENTION TIME; COAGULATION; PARAMETERS; EUTROPHICATION; NITRIFICATION; CLAY	A number of municipal wastewater treatment systems were developed to improve effluent water quality, however economic aspects should be considered. In this study, one of the membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems that have recently attracted much attention was compared to combined biological and chemical processes (CBCP), focusing on effluent water qualities and economic assessment. A HANT(R), modified MBR system. was composed of anoxic/anaerobic/oxic/anoxic stages with hollow fiber membrane, while the CBCP was consisted of anoxic and oxic steps with addition of clinoptilolite powder followed by rapid coagulation process. Both treatment systems showed enhancing efficacy in removing organic compounds and suspended solids. Due to membrane separation in the HANT(R), solids retention times (SRT) was increased up to 50 days. Such long SRT control along with high biomass concentration could enable to achieve nearly complete nitrification, where nitrogen removal was stably attained, as high as at average of 71.7%. However, effluent total phosphorus (TP) concentration in the HANT(R) hardly met the requirement limiting eutrophication, which moreover presented instable effluent TP concentrations since biological phosphorus removal immediately reflected from temporarily varying influent COD/P ratio. In contrast, the CBCP presented more improvements on COD and TP removals as compared to the HANT(R), because it well functionally employed long SRT control in biological process in conjunction with post-coagulation process in the CBCP. Especially, effluent TP concentration was averaged at 0.04 mg/l in the CBCP, extremely lower than that in the HANT(R). It indicated that additional measure in the system, simply manipulating coagulants dosing, could lower its effluent concentration as low as 0.02 mg/l to limit eutrophication. From economic assessment, the CBCP was superior to the HANT(R). The CBCP showed capital investment of 204 $ m(-3) lower than that of the HANT(R), and operating cost was estimated at 0.048 $ m(-3) less than that of the HANT(R). The major factor largely attributing to less economical for the MBR was originated from both membrane price and its life expectancy. In present, the MBR system was investigated to be less economical, whose effluent water quality furthermore could not be greatly improved compared to that of conventional biological and chemical process. However. in near future, MBR systems would have economical competitiveness, which could facilitate it with supreme technology for wastewater treatment, considering the trend in reducing membrane price and enhancing membrane service life.

Physico-chemical and biological properties of bloom-infested waters were monitored during the bloom period lasting five days. The bloom appeared as a green streak along the entire coastline of Minnie Bay, with cell counts of 17 x 10(3) cells/l. The bloom appeared as a sudden spurt in cell number and persisted for a period of 49 h. The antibacterial properties of extracts from this algal species were also investigated. Conspicuously, the bloom inhibited the common resident phytoplankton species. Total suspended solids showed a marked increase during day-one of bloom compared to ambient levels. The bloom appeared to be limited by dissolved inorganic nitrogen species availability. The differential growth of phytoplankton reveals the involvement of specific trigger factors for such blooms. From the present viewpoint, micro-scale studies on hydrobiological factors preceding the onset of bloom would reveal what cycle of events lead to a bloom and the causal factors of such blooms. However, prediction of occurrence of such blooms and in situ measurements are practical difficulties to be addressed. Since a similar bloom was reported earlier in 2001, it is worthwhile to keep a watch and investigate as to whether there is any anthropogenic or environmental cause for the recurrence of the bloom.

J	Gnauck, A				Gnauck, A			Interpolation and approximation of water quality time series and process identification	ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						chemometrics; water quality time series; interpolation; approximation; process identification	SAMPLING FREQUENCY; RIVER; TREND	Data records with equidistant time intervals are fundamental prerequisites for the development of water quality simulation models. Usually long-term water quality data time series contain missing data or data with different sampling intervals. In such cases "artificial" data have to be added to obtain records based on a regular time grid. Generally, this can be done by interpolation, approximation or filtering of data sets. In contrast to approximation by an analytical function, interpolation methods estimate missing data by means of measured concentration values. In this paper, methods of interpolation and approximation are applied to long-term water quality data sets with daily sampling intervals. Using such data for the water temperature and phosphate phosphorus in some shallow lakes, it was possible to identify the process of phosphate remobilisation from sediment.

J	Summerfelt, ST; Davidson, JW; Waldrop, TB; Tsukuda, SM; Bebak-Williams, J				Summerfelt, ST; Davidson, JW; Waldrop, TB; Tsukuda, SM; Bebak-Williams, J			A partial-reuse system for coldwater aquaculture	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						reuse; recirculating; aquaculture; Artic char; rainbow trout	CULTURE; FISH	A model partial-reuse system is described that provides an alternative to salmonid production in serial-reuse raceway systems and has potential application in other fish-culture situations. The partial-reuse system contained three 10 m(3) circular 'Cornell-type' dual-drain culture tanks. The side-wall discharge from the culture tanks was treated across a microscreen drum filter, then the water was pumped to the head of the system where dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) stripping and pure oxygen (O-2) supplementation took place before the water returned to the culture tanks. Dilution with make-up water controlled accumulations of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN). An automatic pH control system that modulated the stripping column fan 'on' and 'off' was used to limit the fractions of CO2 and unionized ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N). The partial-reuse system was evaluated during the culture of eight separate cohorts of advanced fingerlings, i.e., Arctic char, rainbow trout, and an all female brook trout x Arctic char hybrid. The fish performed well, even under intensive conditions, which were indicated by dissolved O-2 consumption across the culture tank that went as high as 13 mg/L and fish-culture densities that were often between 100 and 148 kg/m(3). Over all cohorts, feed conversion rates ranged from 1.0 to 1.3, specific growth rates (SGR) ranged from 1.32 to 2.45% body weight per day, and thermal growth coefficients ranged from 0.00132 to 0.00218. The partial-reuse system maintained safe water quality in all cases except for the first cohort-when the stripping column fan failed. The 'Cornell-type' dual-drain tank was found to rapidly (within only 1-2 min) and gently concentrate and flush approximately 68-88% (79% overall average) of the TSS produced daily within only 12-18% of the tank's total water flow. Mean TSS concentrations discharged through the three culture tanks' bottom-center drains (average of 17.1 mg/L) was 8.7 times greater than the TSS concentration discharged through the three culture tanks' side-wall drains (average of 2.2 mg/L). Overall, approximately 82% of the TSS produced in the partial-reuse system was captured in an off-line settling tank, which is better TSS removal than others have estimated for serial-reuse systems (approximately 25-50%). For the two cohorts of rainbow trout, the partial-reuse system sustained a production level of 35-15 kg per year of fish for every 1 L/min of make-up water, which is approximately six to seven times greater than the typical 6 kg per year of trout produced for every 1 L/min of water in Idaho serial-reuse raceway systems.

J	Elrashidi, MA; Mays, MD; Peaslee, SD; Hooper, DG				Elrashidi, MA; Mays, MD; Peaslee, SD; Hooper, DG			A technique to estimate nitrate-nitrogen loss by runoff and leaching for agricultural land, Lancaster county, Nebraska	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS			English	Article						groundwater quality; nitrate loss; nitrate risk potential; subsurface leaching; surface runoff; water percolation	GROUNDWATER; MANAGEMENT; PHOSPHORUS; MOVEMENT; IMPACTS	Nitrate-nitrogen (N) loss from agricultural land to natural water resources is an issue for both crop production and water quality. The objective of this study was to develop a technique to evaluate and map nitrate-N loss by surface runoff and subsurface leaching for agricultural land. The technique implemented water loss calculated by the National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) runoff equation and a percolation model to predict nitrate-N loss for soils with different types of land cover. The technique was applied on agricultural land in Lancaster County, Nebraska, which covers 22 1,000 ha near the eastern edge of the Great Plains. The Soil Survey Report was used to identify I I major soil series that comprise 83% of acreage in the county. Predicted nitrate runoff loss from soils ranged from 0.84 to 6.20kg/ha/y for fallow, 0.83 to 5.97kg/ha/y for cropland, and 0.80 to 5.29kg/ha/y for grassland. For most soils nitrate loss by leaching was greater than that by runoff. The average loss predicted by leaching was 8.75, 7.01, and 3.73 kg/ha/y for fallow, cropland, and grassland, respectively. Nitrate concentration predicted in runoff water from three crop-covered soils exceeded the threshold of 10mg/L, while most soils generated leaching water with nitrate exceeding 10mg/L. The county-level average of nitrate predicted in runoff (6.55mg/L) and leaching water (11.8mg/L) emphasized a need of nutrient management plan to reduce N loss from cropland. The Geographical Information Systems (GIS) were applied to map water loss and nitrate risk potential (NRP) for surface and groundwater contamination in the county.

The Main Channel site near the mouth of Elkhorn Slough was sampled from February to September 2001. Azevedo Pond, a shallow tidal pond bordering agricultural fields further inland, was sampled from December 1999 to July 2001. Nitrate concentrations were recorded hourly while salinity, temperature, depth, oxygen, and turbidity were recorded every 30 min. Nitrate concentrations at the Main Channel site ranged from 5, to 65 muM. The propagation of an internal wave carrying water from similar to100 m depth up the Monterey Submarine Canyon and into the lower section of Elkhorn Slough on every rising tide was a major source of nitrate, accounting for 80-90% of the nitrogen load during the dry summer period. Nitrate concentrations in Azevedo Pond ranged from 0-20 muM during the dry summer months. Nitrate in Azevedo Pond increased to over 450 muM during a heavy winter precipitation event, and interannual variability driven by differences in precipitation was observed. At both sites, tidal cycling was the dominant forcing, often changing nitrate concentrations by 5-fold or more within a few hours. Water volume flux estimates were combined with observed nitrate concentrations to obtain nitrate fluxes. Nitrate flux calculations indicated a loss of 4 mmol NO3 m(-2) d(-1) for the entire Elkhorn Slough and I mmol NO3 m(-2) d(-1) at Azevedo Pond. These results suggested that the waters of Elkhorn Slough were not a major source of nitrate to Monterey Bay but actually a nitrate sink during the dry season. The limited winter data at the Main Channel site suggest that nitrate was exported from Elkhorn Slough during the wet season.

Common purposes are regulatory, source and sink understanding, and trend observations. Water quality monitoring involves monitoring system design; sampling site instrumentation; and sampling, analysis, quality control, and assurance. Sampling is a process to gather information with the least cost and least error. Various water quality sampling schemes have been applied for different sampling objectives and time frames. In this study, a flow proportional composite sampling scheme is applied to variable flow remote canals where the flow rate is not known a priori. In this scheme, historical weekly flow data are analyzed to develop high flow and low flow sampling trigger volumes for auto-samplers. The median flow is used to estimate low flow sampling trigger volume and the five percent exceedence probability flow is used for high flow sampling trigger volume. A computer simulation of high resolution sampling is used to demonstrate the comparative bias in load estimation and operational cost among four sampling schemes. Weekly flow proportional composite auto-sampling resulted in the least bias in load estimation with competitive operational cost compared to daily grab, weekly grab sampling and time proportional auto-sampling.

In the present study, the Hydrological Simulation Program FORTRAN (HSPF) is used to simulate transport of N in the Ipswich River basin in Massachusetts and to evaluate the effect of future land use scenarios on the water quality of the river. Model results show that under a land use change scenario constructed with restrictions from environmental protection laws, where 44 percent of the forest in the basin was converted to urban land, stream nitrate concentrations increased by about 30 percent of the present values. When an extreme land use scenario was used, and 100 percent of the forest was converted to urban land, concentrations doubled in comparison to present values. Model simulations also showed that present stream nitrate concentrations might be four times greater than they were prior to urbanization. While pervious lands with high density residential land use generated runoff with the highest N concentrations in HSPF simulations, the results suggested that denitrification in the riparian zone and wetlands coupled with the hydrology of the basin are likely to control the magnitude of nitrate loads to the aquatic system. The simulation results showed that HSPF can predict the general patterns of inorganic N concentrations in the Ipswich River and tributaries. Nevertheless, HSPF has some difficulty simulating the extreme variability of the observed data throughout the main stem and tributaries, probably because of limitations in the representation of wetlands and riparian zones in the model, where N processes such as denitrification seem to play a major role in controlling the transport of N from the terrestrial system to the river reaches.

J	Lepisto, L; Holopainen, LL; Vuoristo, H				Lepisto, L; Holopainen, LL; Vuoristo, H			Type-specific and indicator taxa of phytoplankton as a quality criterion for assessing the ecological status of Finnish boreal lakes	LIMNOLOGICA			English	Article						phytoplankton composition; type-specific taxa; indicator taxa; indicator parameters; Water Framework Directive; ecological status	SWEDISH FOREST LAKES; VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION; DOMINANCE; FINLAND	Key issues in the implementation of the Water Framework Directive are classification of lakes using biological quality parameters and type-specific reference conditions. This work is one of three studies considering different metrics of phytoplankton in the classification of ecological status. Phytoplankton was studied in a total of 55 Finnish boreal lakes, including 32 reference lakes. We tested the suitability of taxonomic composition and abundance of phytoplankton groups for biological classification. We also preliminarily determined the type-specific taxa for the studied lakes. The type-specific taxa for reference conditions are coincidently the indicator species/taxa for high ecological status. Interestingly, some taxa type-specific for impacted oligo-humic lakes proved to be the type-specific taxa for humic reference lakes. The pressure of human impact was observed not only as increase of biomass but also as changes in the species composition. The phytoplankton composition indicated the ecological status of impacted lakes moderately well. There was some variation in the indications given by different algal groups, probably due to the preliminary class boundaries used. However, the preliminary combination of indicative parameters to estimate the ecological status of the studied impacted lakes was in general in accordance with earlier classification of water quality in Finnish lakes.

J	Dodds, WK; Oakes, RM				Dodds, WK; Oakes, RM			A technique for establishing reference nutrient concentrations across watersheds affected by humans	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS			English	Article							NITROGEN	Establishing reference nutrient conditions for rivers and streams is necessary to assess human impact on aquatic ecosystems and protect water quality and biotic integrity. Several methods have been proposed: ( 1) percentiles from statistical distributions of all rivers and streams in a region or dataset, ( 2) reference stream approaches, and ( 3) modeling river networks from existing reference streams. We propose an additional statistical method to estimate the influence of anthropogenic land uses on lotic nutrient concentrations. First, we quantify regional variation by using analysis of covariance, where total nitrogen or total phosphorus is the dependent variable, region is the categorical predictor, and percentage of anthropogenic land use ( e. g., cropland, urban land) is the covariate. This allows for the aggregation of regions if there is not a significant regional effect, or if there is a significant regional effect, identifies the need to analyze regions separately. Second, we develop multiple linear regression models with best-model techniques in which anthropogenic land-use classifications are the independent variables, and the logarithms of in-stream nutrient concentrations are the dependent variables. The intercept of these regression models (i.e., expected nutrient concentration in the absence of human activities assuming linear extrapolation to the origin) represents the reference nutrient concentrations. This analysis suggests that larger percentages of cropland and urban land have strong positive influences on in-stream nutrient concentrations, both in eastern Kansas and across the conterminous United States. The most appropriate method for regions may depend on the relative availability of reference sites and other data sources. The covariance/reference approach offers a potential method for regions with limited numbers of reference sites.

Realisation of both goals requires changes to the water management adapted to the site-specific geohydrological conditions. The effect of raised groundwater levels and extensive land use on the water quality of heavily vegetated and groundwater-fed ditches was investigated in a riparian peatland located in the River Eider Valley (a nationally important wetland case study area). The water quality of the selected representative ditches was regularly assessed at different discharge levels during different flow obstruction cover periods. The hydraulic residence time was predominantly a function of the ditch geometry and the overall flow obstruction. A better understanding of the effect of ditch vegetation on the temporal flow patterns and the hydraulic residence times is of high environmental interest, especially for improving nutrient standards in lowland rivers such as the River Eider. Within-ditch vegetation and other hydraulic flow obstructions such as accumulated silt and organic debris increased the hydraulic residence time and led to an improvement of the water quality (e.g. reduction in nitrate content) along the ditch. While ortho-phosphate and ammonia concentrations were acceptable to German water quality standards, nitrate-nitrogen concentrations were frequently elevated due to high discharges despite high flow obstruction cover. Further findings show that the lower stretches of the ditches were flooded by the River Eider due to the absence of a macrophyte-mowing scheme that led to increased water levels during late summer.

J	Jackson, C; Preston, N; Thompson, PJ				Jackson, C; Preston, N; Thompson, PJ			Intake and discharge nutrient loads at three intensive shrimp farms	AQUACULTURE RESEARCH			English	Article						discharge load; nutrient; shrimp farm; nitrogen; phosphorus; total suspended solids	AUSTRALIA; PONDS; AQUACULTURE; NITROGEN; WATER	This study was conducted to help provide a framework for Australian regulation of shrimp farm siting and discharges. Monitoring of farm water usage, and intake and discharge water quality was conducted at three commercial intensive shrimp farms, chosen to represent different operating environments, latitudes, cultured species and management styles. Weekly samples were taken over 3 years, for 3-12 months at each farm, to investigate intake and discharge concentrations and loads of total suspended solids (TSS), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Mean water exchange was 1.4 ML ha(-1) day(-1) (about 10% day(-1)) at the first farm studied and 0.5 ML ha(-1) day(-1) (about 3.6% day(-1)) at the others. Farm mean discharge concentration varied as follows: TSS, from 36.9 to 119 mg L-1; TN, from 2.1 to 3.1 mg L-1 and TP, from 0.22 to 0.28 mg L-1. Farm mean intake concentrations were from 11% to 91% of equivalent mean discharge concentration (for TN at Farm B and TSS at Farm C respectively). Mean net discharge loads, related to area of production ponds at each farm, varied as follows: TSS, from 4.8 to 85.7 kg ha(-1) day(-1); TN, from 1 to 1.8 kg ha(-1) day(-1) and TP, from 0.11 to 0.22 kg ha(-1) day(-1). The highest net loads of TSS, TN and TP were all from the farm with the highest water exchange rate, located on a coastal river, and studied during a year of high rainfall with associated poor water quality. These results can be used to help predict likely discharge characteristics for new shrimp farms, and provide a benchmark against which to evaluate future improvements in shrimp farm environmental management.

J	Sporre-Moeny, JL; Lanyon, LE; Sharpley, AN				Sporre-Moeny, JL; Lanyon, LE; Sharpley, AN			Low-intensity sprinkler for evaluating phosphorus transport from different landscape positions	APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE			English	Article						nonpoint source pollution; phosphorus; water quality	RAINFALL SIMULATOR; WATER-QUALITY; SIZE; RUNOFF	High intensity rainfall causes a greater proportion of total phosphorus (P) in runoff to be particulate P (PP) than low-intensity rainfall. Traditional conservation practices have been implemented to control PP; however, dissolved ortho-P (DP) losses have been more difficult to reduce. Dissolved ortho-P losses may occur under different rainfall conditions, from different landscape locations, and from areas with different management histories than PP. To evaluate P lost in runoff from multiple landscape positions simultaneously, a low-intensity sprinkler was developed. The design criteria included: <12.7-mmh(-1) application rate; low operating pressure; fine drop size; uniform volume distribution; low cost; and ease of transport, setup, and operation. An inverted full cone sprayer nozzle operating at 6.9 X 10(4) Pa, delivering 8.2 min h(-1), was mounted within a 1.8- X 1.8- X 1.3-m polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe frame. The coefficient of uniformity for application was 0.97 and the mean drop size diameter was 0.51 mm. In a field evaluation of the sprinkler DP concentrations were greater from the summit and backslope than from the footslope. Although there was no difference in DP or TP loads (concentration X volume), the trend in DP load losses was greatest from the backslope (130 mug m(-2)), followed by the summit/shoulder (89 mug m(-2)), and then the footslope (28 mug m(-2)). The sprinkler performed effectively in field tests, but the results suggest that more research is necessary to better understand DP losses from different landscape positions under low-intensity rainfall.

This study, compiles a comprehensive data set of DOC concentration records for UK catchments to evaluate trends and test whether observed increases are ubiquitous over time and space. The study analysed monthly DOC time series from 198 sites, including 29 lakes, 8 water supply reservoirs and 161 rivers. The records vary in length from 8 to 42 years going back as far as 1961. Of the 198 sites, 153 (77%) show an upward trend in DOC concentration significant at the 95% level, the remaining 45 (23%) show no significant trend and no sites show a significant decrease in DOC concentration. The average annual increase in DOC concentration was 0.17 mg C/l/year. The dataset shows: (i) a spatial consistent upward trend in the DOC concentration independent of regional effects of rainfall, acid and nitrogen deposition, and local effects of land-use change; (ii) a temporally consistent increase in DOC concentration for period back as far as the 1960s; (iii) the increase in DOC concentration means an estimated DOC flux from the UK as 0.86 Mt C for the year 2002 and is increasing at 0.02 Mt C/year. Possible reasons for the increasing DOC concentration are discussed.

J	Clerk, S; Selbie, DT; Smol, JP				Clerk, S; Selbie, DT; Smol, JP			Cage aquaculture and water-quality changes in the LaCloche Channel, Lake Huron, Canada: a paleolimnological assessment	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article							HYPOLIMNETIC ANOXIA; PHOSPHORUS RELEASE; ONTARIO; OXYGEN; SHALLOW; MODELS; RATES; BAY	Lake eutrophication due to cage aquaculture is an area of concern in Ontario; however, without knowledge of pre-impact conditions, it is difficult to determine the extent and magnitude of environmental change. Paleolimnological techniques were used to estimate water-quality conditions prior to, during, and briefly following aquaculture operation in the LaCloche Channel, Lake Huron. Past oxygen and nutrient levels were inferred from assemblages of chironomids and diatoms, respectively, to determine whether recent low-oxygen and nutrient-rich conditions were related to cage aquaculture in operation from 1989 to 1998. Chironomid assemblages exhibited trends consistent with decreased hypolimnetic oxygen levels, with reductions in oxic-type profundal taxa and increased relative abundances of littoral communities. Diatom assemblages reflected a period of nutrient enrichment by increased relative abundances of meso-eutrophic taxa. Improvements in water quality are inferred from assemblages of diatoms in surface sediments, which may correspond to the cessation of fish-farming activities in 1998. In contrast, no sign of deep-water oxygen recovery is recorded by chironomids. These trends are consistent with eutrophication, and suggest that the LaCloche Channel was sensitive to nutrient loading from the cage-aquaculture operation. This study demonstrates the potential of using paleolimnological techniques to track water-quality changes associated with cage farming.

The main purpose of this study was to develop an empirical model to detect algal blooms phenomenon in the Techi reservoir, Taiwan. We used ratios of logarithm transformed radiance values from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data to establish statistical relationships to dinoflagellate densities. The procedure used a forward selection method to develop multiple linear regression models. The selected independent variables matched the dinoflagellate algal cell densities to build the bloom prediction model. The result showed that the bloom prediction model can predict the algal bloom phenomenon with 74% accuracy in this study. The major limits were the spectral sensitivity and spatial resolution of the scanning device. If we can acquire greater spectral sensitivity and spatial resolution in the remote sensing data, we can attain higher model accuracy.

Continuous monitoring and intensive sampling studies overlapped with an array of pulsed weather events that impacted physical, chemical, and biological attributes of this region. We quantified the effects of three events representing a range of characteristics (duration, amount of precipitation, storm intensity, wind direction) on the hydraulic connectivity, nutrient and sediment dynamics, and vegetation structure of the SE Everglades estuarine ecotone. These events included a strong winter storm in November 1996, Tropical Storm Harvey in September 1999, and Hurricane Irene in October 1999. Continuous hydrologic and daily water sample data were used to examine the effects of these events on the physical forcing and quality of water in Taylor Creek. A high resolution, flow-through sampling and mapping approach was used to characterize water quality in the adjacent bay. To understand the effects of these events on vegetation communities, we measured mangrove litter production and estimated seagrass cover in the bay at monthly intervals. We also quantified sediment deposition associated with Hurricane Irene's flood surge along the Buttonwood Ridge. These three events resulted in dramatic changes in surface water movement and chemistry in Taylor Creek and adjacent regions of Florida Bay as well as increased mangrove litterfall and flood surge scouring of seagrass beds. Up to 5 cm of bay-derived mud was deposited along the ridge adjacent to the creek in this single pulsed event. These short-term events can account for a substantial proportion of the annual flux of freshwater and materials between the mangrove zone and Florida Bay. Our findings shed light on the capacity of these storm events, especially when in succession, to have far reaching and long lasting effects on coastal ecosystems such as the estuarine ecotone of the SE Everglades.

The effect of the seagrass bed on conditions inside compared to outside the bed varied seasonally and could be related to bed biomass and development. During spring (April to June), the rapidly growing seagrass bed was a sink for nutrients, suspended inorganic particles, and phytoplankton, whereas during the summer, as bed dieback progressed, resuspension and release of nutrients were observed. Reductions in suspended particle concentrations and light attenuation were generally not measurable until bed biomass exceeded 50-100 gdm/m(2) or 25-50% vegetative cover. During April, when nitrate levels in adjacent channel waters were observed to be highest (>10 muM), rapid uptake, equivalent to 48% of nitrogen requirements for seagrass growth, reduced inorganic nitrogen standing stocks by 73% within the bed compared to outside of it. An unvegetated site that previously supported seagrass demonstrated little capacity to reduce measurable levels of suspended particles or nutrients, and resuspension of bottom sediments contributed to higher levels of suspended particle concentrations and turbidity in the unvegetated shallows compared to adjacent waters. The capacity of seagrass beds to improve local water-quality conditions, such as turbidity and nutrients, during the spring when suspended particle concentrations are highest may be key to their continued long-term survival in this lower bay region. High levels of spring turbidity, which have been related to seagrass declines in this area, can be mediated by dense seagrass structure, but largely unvegetated areas are unlikely to modify conditions to permit survival of first-year recruits or transplants through the summer. Therefore, water-quality conditions that are suitable for recovery are likely greater than those required for continued survival of existing seagrass beds. Given this, statistically derived estimates of water-quality conditions or habitat requirements that are usually obtained from measurements in areas adjacent to existing seagrass beds should be used with caution.

The present study attempts to verify the suitability of a nonpoint source pollution model, the Agricultural NonPoint Source model, for the Huai Nong Prong watershed in Southeastern Thailand. Extensive fieldwork was carried out to collect data and information needed for the model preparation and application. The study has revealed that simulated runoff volume, sediment, and nutrient yield from the watershed with mixed land use and relatively high slopes match favorably with observed data. For the ten rainfall events simulated, the coefficient of performance, a measure of model efficiency (equal to zero for a perfect match), was 0.09, 0.47, 0.09, and 0.03 for runoff volume, sediment yield, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus, respectively. The model, however, could not accurately simulate peak flow rates, suggesting the need for changes in the modeling approach or governing equations and relationships to calculate peak discharges in a tropical environment.

J	Bergstrom, L; Kirchmann, H				Bergstrom, L; Kirchmann, H			Leaching and crop uptake of nitrogen from nitrogen-15-labeled green manures and ammonium nitrate	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							SOIL; MINERALIZATION; FERTILIZER; FIELD; CORN	Green manures can be used as an N source for agricultural crops as a substitute for inorganic N fertilizers. The effects of using green manures on leaching and uptake of N by spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) were evaluated in a 2-yr lysimeter study. Ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) labeled with N-15 were applied in May of the first year at 160 kg total N ha(-1). Simultaneously, (NH4NO3)-N-15-N-15 was applied at 80 kg N ha(-1) to additional lysimeters and others were left without N additions (control). During the second year, all lysimeters, except the control, received 80 kg N ha(-1) as unlabeled NH4NO3. The cumulative, average loads of total N leached during the two years were: 37 (control), 62 (NH4NO3), 50 (ryegrass manure), and 73 (red clover manure) kg ha(-1). The differences among the treatments were not significant (P > 0.05), but the control had significantly smaller (P < 0.05) leaching loads than the treatments. About 24% of ryegrass- and red clover-derived N and 43% of NH4NO3 were removed through spring barley grain and stover during the two growing seasons. Thus, the N use efficiency in barley was substantially larger when grown with inorganic N fertilizer than when grown with green manure. Viewed in combination with the tendency for larger N leaching loads under red clover manure, claims about water quality benefits of legume-based green manures should be evaluated with regard to the timing of N release and demand for N by the plant.

We investigated the effect of adding phytase and reducing supplemental P in poultry diets and composting poultry manures, with and without Fe and Al amendments, on P in manures, composts, and runoff. We used four diets: normal (no phytase) with 0.4% supplemental P, normal + phytase, phytase + 0.3% P, and phytase + 0.2% P. Adding phytase and decreasing supplemental P in diets reduced total P but increased water-extractable P in manure. Compared with manures, composting reduced both total P, due to dilution of manure with woodchips and straw, and water-extractable P, but beyond a dilution effect so that the ratio of water-extractable P to total P was less in compost than manure. Adding Fe and At during composting did not consistently change total P or water-extractable P. Manures and composts were surface-applied to soil boxes at a rate of 50 kg total P ha(-1) and subjected to simulated rainfall, with runoff collected for 30 min. For manures, phytase and decreased P in diets had no significant effect on total P or molybdate-reactive P loads (kg ha(-1)) in runoff. Composting reduced total P and molybdate-reactive P loads in runoff, and adding Fe and Al to compost reduced total P but not molybdate-reactive P loads in runoff. Molybdate-reactive P in runoff (mg box(-1)) was well correlated to water-extractable P applied to boxes (mg box(-1)) in manures and composts.

Substrates released either nitrate, phosphate, both nutrients, or no nutrients, and were colonized during a five week period. Periphyton biomass did not respond to nutrient addition at any of the sites, while the densities of chironomids and other collector-gatherers showed significant responses to nutrient manipulation. At both rural sites and one urban site, the density of collector-gatherers showed a positive response to phosphate addition. Despite a six-fold range of phosphate (from 5 to 36 mug/l) and relatively invariant nitrate levels (ca. 3 mg/l) across sites, average concentrations of dissolved nutrients in streamwater at baseflow did not predict the pattern of response to nutrient addition. The numerical response of invertebrates to nutrient amendment suggests that the invertebrate fauna of both urban and rural streams are effective in controlling algal biomass and that even at moderately high concentrations, nutrients can limit benthic food webs.

J	Pote, DH; Grigg, BC; Blanche, CA; Daniel, TC				Pote, DH; Grigg, BC; Blanche, CA; Daniel, TC			Effects of pine straw harvesting on quantity and quality of surface runoff	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						agroforestry; erosion; pine-straw harvesting; nutrient loss; runoff; water quality	INTENSITY	Pine needles (straw) are an attractive landscape mulching material that protects the soil surface against erosion, conserves soil moisture, moderates soil temperature, and inhibits weed growth; yet it retains a loose, open structure that allows air, fertilizer, and water to easily penetrate the soil surface. Such characteristics have made pine straw a valuable commodity, but the loss of those mulching benefits from pine forests has raised concerns about effects on watersheds where pine straw is harvested. For example, pine straw absorbs the impact of raindrops and slows the speed of runoff, so its removal may increase soil erosion and nutrient losses, and decrease water-holding capacity of the forest floor. To test this hypothesis, three pine-straw harvesting practices and a control treatment (no straw harvest) were compared to determine harvesting effects on water, soil, and nutrient losses in runoff. The 24 Plots (six replications of each treatment) were constructed in an established (16 yrs) loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stand that had tree spacing of 3.0 m by 1.5 m (10 ft by 5 ft), and basal area of 41.3 m(2) ha(-1) (180 ft(2) ac(-1)). Each plot (2 m by 1 m or 6.6 ft by 3.3 ft) had four percent slope, aluminum borders, and a runoff collector. Simulated rainfall was applied [5 cm h(-1) (2 in h(-1))] to produce 20 minutes of runoff from each plot. Annual pine straw harvesting clearly increased runoff, soil erosion from 0.5 to 91.6 kg ha(-1) (0.4 to 81.7 lb ac(-1)), and losses of phosphorus (P), carbon (C), and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (N) in runoff; but these losses were partially controlled by less-frequent harvesting, and declined to control levels when pine straw had accumulated for two years.

J	Havens, KE; Nurnberg, GK				Havens, KE; Nurnberg, GK			The phosphorus-chlorophyll relationship in lakes: Potential influences of color and mixing regime	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						phosphorus-chlorophyll regression; color; mixing regime; predictive models	TROPHIC STATE; FLORIDA LAKES; PHYTOPLANKTON; PREDICTION; RESERVOIRS; NITROGEN	We used summer epilimnetic means from a large dataset (369 lakes from North America, Europe, Asia, and New Zealand) to examine whether color or mixing regime significantly influence the log-log relationship between chlorophyll a (Chl a) and total phosphorus (TP) in lakes. We found no significant difference in regression models for clear (color < 10 Pt units) vs. humic takes (color > 20 Pt units), even when data were screened so that both types of lakes were represented by the same range of TP. Likewise, there was no significant difference in regression models for mixed vs. thermally stratified lakes. Knowing that a particular lake is clear vs. humic, or mixed vs. stratified, therefore is not helpful in developing a predictive model of Chl a from TP. However, when we simultaneously considered water color and mixing regime, a potentially useful feature was identified. Mixed humic lakes have a somewhat lower (significant at p = 0.10) ratio of Chl a / TP than mixed clear water lakes, whereas no such difference exists between humic and clear water lakes that are thermally stratified. Likewise, when we plotted the Chl a / TP ratio vs. color, there was a negative slope for mixed takes, but no significant relationship for stratified lakes. We suggest that in stratified humic lakes, which are often sheltered deep systems with a high Osgood Ratio, phytoplankton can compensate for reduced underwater irradiance by migrating toward the water surface, whereas in mixed humic lakes, that response is not possible. Lake managers dealing with mixed humic lakes might expect a lower yield of Chl a / TP than in mixed clear water lakes. Further research is needed to test this hypothesis. In any case, caution is warranted when applying such results to lake management, because given the numerous effects of high P inputs (e.g., changes in benthic invertebrate communities, biological oxygen demand, and sediment metabolism) it is unwise to focus solely on the Chl a response to protect water quality.

J	Anderson, MA				Anderson, MA			Impacts of metal salt addition on the chemistry of Lake Elsinore, California: 1. Alum	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						alum; chemistry; Lake Elsinore		A series of laboratory studies were conducted to evaluate the impacts of alum addition on the water chemistry of Lake Elsinore. Lake Elsinore is a warm, shallow, polymictic and eutrophic lake, located in southwest Riverside County in Southern California, that is plagued with chronic poor water quality conditions due in part to large internal nutrient loadings. The lake also possesses a high pH and high alkalinity. Control of internal phosphorus loading by alum was considered as a possible control method, although most alum applications have been made in relatively soft water lakes. The changes in water chemistry resulting from alum and high-acid alum treatments were quantified for 3 different Al doses (9, 13 and 18 mg L-1). The high alkalinity in the lake limited the capacity for alum at the 9 mg L-1 Al dose to reduce the equilibrium pH below 8.7. High acid alum formulations and higher Al doses were somewhat more successful at lowering the pH, however. For example, Al doses of 9 mg L-1+20% H2SO4 and 18 mg L-1 (no free acid) were able to lower the pH to approximately 8.5. The highest dose and free-acid content (18 mg L-1+20% H2SO4) was most effective, lowering the pH to about 8. Dissolved Al concentrations varied strongly as a function of Al dose, percent free acid in the high-acid alum formulations, and time. Dissolved Al concentrations increased with increasing pH, and approached (or exceeded) 2 mg L-1 in some samples, but generally remained below levels predicted by the solubility of amorphous Al(OH)(3). pH and dissolved Al concentrations both varied markedly over time, due to kinetic limitations to CO2 outgassing. Dissolved Al concentrations monitored in longer-term core experiments decreased over time, suggesting transformation of amorphous, high-solubility Al phase(s) to more crystalline, lower-solubility phases. The high Al solubility and potential toxicity makes alum treatment inappropriate for Lake Elsinore and other strongly alkaline lakes.

The objective of this study was to use undisturbed soil monolith lysimeters to quantify the effectiveness of treating a grazed pasture soil with a nitrification inhibitor, trade name eco-n(TM) (active ingredient-dicyandiamide, DCD), in decreasing NO3- leaching losses from a deep sandy Templeton soil (Udic Haplustept) with a mixture of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and white clover (Trifolium repens) pasture. Simulated rainfall was applied in the winter to supplement the natural rainfall to the 75th percentile of local rainfall records, and spray irrigation was applied in the summer. The treatment of the soil with eco-n decreased NO3--N leaching from 85 to 20-22 ka N ha(-1) yr(-1) (equivalent to 74-76% reduction) for the dairy cow urine N applied in the autumn at the rate of 1000 kg N ha-1. This reduced annual average NO3--N concentration under the urine patch from 25 to 7 mg N litre(-1). The eco-n treatment also reduced Ca2+ leaching by 38-56% and Mg leaching by 21-42%. Ammonia volatilisation was not affected by the eco-n treatment. In addition, the eco-n treatment increased herbage dry matter yield in the urine patch areas by 33%, from 15.9 t ha(-1) yr(-1) without eco-n to 18.2 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in the single eco-n application in May and to 21.1 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in the May Plus August eco-n treatment. Treating grazed pasture soil with eco-n is thus not only beneficial to the environment by reducing NO3- leaching but also has economic benefits by increasing nutrient use efficiency and pasture production.

J	Davies-Colley, RJ; Nagels, JW; Smith, RA; Young, RG; Phillips, CJ				Davies-Colley, RJ; Nagels, JW; Smith, RA; Young, RG; Phillips, CJ			Water quality impact of a dairy cow herd crossing a stream	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH			English	Article						bacteria; Escherichia coli; environmental management; indicators; livestock; water quality	FLOOD EVENTS; BACTERIA	The water quality impact of a herd of 246 dairy cows crossing a stream ford was documented. Two cow crossings produced plumes of turbid water associated with very high concentrations of faecal indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli) and high suspended solids (SS) and total nitrogen (TN). On the first crossing, towards the milking shed, the cows were tightly-bunched and produced a sharp spike of contamination (E. coli peaking at 50 000 cfu/100 ml). After milking, the cows wandered back across the stream as individuals or small groups, and contaminants were less elevated, albeit for a longer period. Light attenuation, measured continuously by beam transmissometer, correlated closely with E. coli, SS, and TN, permitting the total yield of these contaminants to be estimated. Contaminant yields for the two crossings were very similar, suggesting that time taken and whether or not cows are herded may not greatly influence water quality impact. The cows defecated c. 50 times more per metre of stream crossing than elsewhere on the raceway. This study has shown that cattle accessing stream channels can cause appreciable direct water contamination, suggesting that excluding cattle from streams will have major water quality benefits.

J	Chu, TW; Shirmohammadi, A; Montas, H; Sadeghi, A				Chu, TW; Shirmohammadi, A; Montas, H; Sadeghi, A			Evaluation of the SWAT model's sediment and nutrient components in the piedmont physiographic region of Maryland	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						nutrients; sediment; SWAT model; water quality; watershed scale	WATER-QUALITY; RIVER-BASIN; SIMULATION	Mathematical watershed-scale models are among the best tools available for analyzing water resources (quantity and quality) issues in spatially diverse watersheds since continuous water quality monitoring is expensive and spatially impractical in mixed land use watersheds. However models without appropriate validation may lead to misconceptions and erroneous predictions. This study used six years of hydrologic and water quality data to calibrate and validate the capability of SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model in assessing nonpoint source pollution for a 346 ha watershed in the Piedmont physiographic region. The evaluation of the hydrology component of SWAT completed in a previous study pointed out that SWAT has no mechanism to account for subsurface flow contributions from outside the watershed. For this evaluation, all nutrient loadings leaving the watershed were adjusted to subtract the chemical transport via subsurface flow contributions from outside the watershed. Evaluation results indicated a strong agreement between yearly measured and simulated data for sediment, nitrate, and soluble phosphorus loadings. However simulations of monthly sediment and nutrient loadings were poor. Overall, it was concluded that SWAT is a reasonable watershed-scale model for long-term simulation of different management scenarios. However its use on storm-by-storm or even on monthly basis may not be appropriate for watersheds with similar physiography and size. Additionally, ignoring the subsurface contribution of water and chemicals from outside the watershed into the watershed aquifer could cause significant errors in model prediction.

The drainage basins of Shibetsu River (Shibetsu area) and Bekkanbeushi River (Akkeshi area) in eastern Hokkaido, Japan were selected for a case study, and the evaluation of water quality was up-scaled to the regional level in Hokkaido by using the Arcview/GIS and statistical information. Water sampling was carried out in August 2001 and May 2002 in the Shibetsu and Akkeshi areas, respectively. The proportions of major land uses in drainage basins such as upland field, forest, urban area, wetland and wasteland for each sampling site were estimated by using topographic maps scaled at 1:25 000. The linear regression results showed that the correlation between NO3-N concentration and the proportion of upland in the drainage basins was highly and positively significant for both the Shibetsu area (r = 0.84, n = 57) and the Akkeshi area (r = 0.71, n = 73) at <0.001 significance level. The regression coefficients or impact factors of river water quality were 0.015 and 0.0052 for the Shibetsu and Akkeshi areas, respectively. A comparison of these results with that of the previous study results in Hokkaido indicated that the impact factors were highest for intensive livestock farming areas (0.040), medium for mixed agriculture and livestock farming (0.020-0.030), and the lowest for grassland-based dairy cattle and horse farming areas (0.0052-0.015). The results of a simple regression analysis showed that the impact factors had a significant positive correlation with the cropland surplus N (r = 0.93, P < 0.01), chemical fertilizer N (r = 0.82, P < 0.05), and manure fertilizer N (r = 0.76, P < 0.05), which were estimated by using the N budget approach. Using the best-correlated regression model, impact factors for all cities, towns and villages of the Hokkaido region were estimated. The NO3-N concentrations for all major rivers in Hokkaido were predicted by multiplying the estimated impact factors by the proportion of uplands. The regression analysis indicated that the predicted NO3-N concentrations were significantly correlated (r = 0.62, P < 0.001, n = 203) with the measured NO3-N concentrations, reported previously. It can be concluded that estimating the proportions of upland fields in drainage basins, and calculating cropland surplus N enables us to predict river water quality with respect to NO3-N concentration.

J	Schilling, K; Zhang, YK				Schilling, K; Zhang, YK			Baseflow contribution to nitrate-nitrogen export from a large, agricultural watershed, USA	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						nitrate-nitrogen; stream discharge; baseflow; chemical loads; hydrograph; agricultural hydrology	PHOSPHORUS; FLOW; TRANSPORT; POLLUTION; LOADS; RIVER	Nitrate-nitrogen export from the Raccoon River watershed in west-central Iowa is among the highest in the United State and contributes to impairment of downstream water quality. We examined a rare long-term record of streamflow and nitrate concentration data (1972-2000) to evaluate annual and seasonal patterns of nitrate losses in streamflow and baseflow from the Raccoon River. Combining hydrograph separation with a load estimation program, we estimated that baseflow contributes approximately two-thirds (17.3 kg/ha) of the mean annual nitrate export (26.1 kg/ha). Baseflow transport was greatest in spring and late fall when baseflow contributed more than 80% of the total export. Herein we propose a 'baseflow enrichment ratio' (BER) to describe the relation of baseflow water with baseflow nitrate loads. The long-term ratio of 1.23 for the Raccoon River suggests preferential leaching of nitrate to baseflow. Seasonal patterns of the BER identified the strong link between the baseflow nitrate loads and seasonal crop nitrogen requirements. Study results demonstrate the utility of assessing the baseflow contribution to nitrate loads to identify appropriate control strategies for reducing baseflow delivery of nitrate.

Here we demonstrate that the sediment record of biotic indicators can be used to quantitatively reconstruct nutrient concentrations preceding the short time span covered by monitoring records. We generated a diatom-based weighted-averaging partial least squares transfer function model for total dissolved nitrogen with a prediction accuracy of 0.09 mug L-1 (log(10) units). The model was applied to sediment core data from Laajalahti Bay, an urban embayment in Helsinki, Finland, where its performance was validated against a similar to 30 yr record of water-quality data and known land-use changes in the watershed. The model tracked well the trends in the nutrient record, although it underestimated very high nutrient concentrations in this highly impacted embayment. The generally good agreement between the actual and predicted values implies that the approach has considerable potential in assessing background nutrient concentrations in coastal waters.

J	Tseng, KF; Wu, KL				Tseng, KF; Wu, KL			The ammonia removal cycle for a submerged biofilter used in a recirculating eel culture system	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						biofilter; maintenance; ammonia removal; performance model; recirculating system; eel culture	AEROBIC-ANOXIC PROCESS; NITROGEN REMOVAL; NITRIFICATION PROCESS; TEMPERATURE; REACTOR; FILTERS; BIOMASS; PH	Ammonia removal by a submerged biofilter varied in a cyclic manner with the growth and detachment of biofilm on the medium. Maintaining an active biofilm in a biofilter is required and is usually achieved by backwashing. In order to predict the time to be washed a laboratory scale system was designed and constructed to investigate the effects of operating parameters-temperature, ammonia and suspended solids concentrations-on the performance of biofilters. The results indicated that the ammonia removal rate per unit surface area of medium (specific ammonia removal rate, SNR) increased initially at the start of the operation, until it reached a maximum value. It maintained this maximum removal rate over a period, and then decreased sharply thereafter. The experimental results were used to develop a series of equations describing the relationship between ammonia removals and operating conditions (initial ammonia removal rate, temperature, concentrations of ammonia and suspended solids in influent). These equations were used to predict the biofilter performance in a commercial recirculating eel culture system. The observed values were within the 90% confidence interval of the model. Thus, the model allows a filter designer to select a backwash frequency that will maintain a stable water quality in recirculating aquaculture systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Jones, JR; Knowlton, MF; Obrecht, DV; Cook, EA				Jones, JR; Knowlton, MF; Obrecht, DV; Cook, EA			Importance of landscape variables and morphology on nutrients in Missouri reservoirs	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES			English	Article							LAURENTIAN GREAT-LAKES; STREAM WATER-QUALITY; LAND-USE; SURFACE WATERS; TOTAL PHOSPHORUS; CHLOROPHYLL; NITROGEN; EXPORT; EUTROPHICATION; PREDICTION	The proportion of cropland cover in the catchments of Missouri reservoirs, a surrogate for non-point-source nutrient loss from agricultural watersheds, accounts for some 60%-70% of the cross-system variance in long-term averages of total phosphorus and total nitrogen (n = 126, ln transformation for nutrients and logit for cropland). The addition of dam height and an index of flushing rate improved r(2) values to similar to77% for both nutrients. Even among reservoir catchments with >80% grass and forest cover, cropland accounted for most of the variation in nutrients. Reservoir nutrients showed a strong negative relation to forest cover. Relations between grass cover and nutrients were positive but weak, and grass had no significant statistical effect once cropland was taken into account. Residual analysis suggests that urban reservoirs would have about twice the nutrient level of reservoirs in non-cropland basins (forest and grass). The increase in nutrients with the proportion of cropland and the decrease with forest cover have previously been documented in Missouri streams.

J	Nunes, PALD; Van den Bergh, JCJM				Nunes, PALD; Van den Bergh, JCJM			Can people value protection against invasive marine species? Evidence from a joint TC-CV survey in the Netherlands	ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS			English	Article						congestion; contingent valuation; exotic marine species; harmful algal blooms; marine management; mixed models; monetary valuation; recreation use values; travel-cost method	PHYTOPLANKTON; SEA	Harmful algal-bloom species (HABs) are invasive exotic species that are primarily introduced in North European waters through ballast water of ships. Some produce important damages to the marine ecosystem such as the red tides that cause a massive destruction of marine living resources, including fish and bottom-living animals. Others are responsible for the production of thick foams with repellent odors and the coloration of the beach water, causing important damages on beach recreation. This article reports a monetary valuation study of a marine protection program. This program focuses on the prevention of HABS along the coastline of the Netherlands. It entails the construction of a ballast water disposal treatment in the Rotterdam harbor and the implementation of a monitoring program of the water quality in the open sea along the North-Holland beaches. The valuation study is based on a questionnaire undertaken at Zandvoort, a famous Dutch beach resort. The economic value of the marine protection program includes non-market benefits associated with beach recreation, human health and marine ecosystem impacts. Both contingent-valuation and travel-cost methods are used. These valuation techniques have not yet been applied to value HABs damages. The valuation results indicate that the protection program makes sense from an economic perspective as long as its cost is, in any case, less than 225 million euro, and possibly less than 326 million euro, depending on how survey refusals are dealt with.

The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of the possible effect of changing external forcing conditions on the functioning of estuarine ecosystems. In densely populated areas, anthropogenic nutrient enrichment and consequent alteration of nutrient biogeochemical cycles have already had a big impact on these ecosystems. The average yearly discharge of the upper Schelde estuary increased nearly threefold over the period 1996-2000, from 28 m(3) s(-1) in 1996 to 73 m(3) s(-1) in 2000. The continuously rising discharge conditions over the five-year period were used as a reference situation for possible future effects of climate on ecological functioning through increase of discharge. At high discharges, nutrient (NH4+, NO3-, dissolved silica and PO43-) concentrations in the tidal fresh- and brackish water showed a decrease of up to 50% while total discharged nutrient loadings increased up to 100%. Opposite effects of increasing discharge on NH4+, NO3- and dissolved silica concentrations in summer and winter, resulted in the flattening out of seasonal cycles for these nutrients. Under high discharge conditions, silica uptake by diatom communities was lowered. Dissolved silica loadings to the coastal area increased concurrently with total silica loadings upstream. Salt intrusion to the marine parts of the estuary decreased. This resulted in a downstream shift of the salinity gradient, with lower salinity observed near the mouth.

We used fossil diapausing eggs extracted from Pb-210-dated sediment cores to reconstruct historical changes in the Daphnia community of Lake Naivasha, a climate-sensitive lake in Kenya which over the past 200 years has experienced a series of well-documented natural and anthropogenic environmental changes. 2. Contiguous sampling and analysis of four cores yielded ephippial capsules of eight Daphnia species. Only two of these had been recorded previously in live collections from Lake Naivasha, and one species is new to science. The four more common species (Daphnia barbata, D. laevis, D. magna, and D. pulex) show striking differences in abundance patterns and population dynamics through time. Four other species (D. lumholtzi, D. curvirostris, D. longispina s.l., and Daphnia sp. nov. type Limuru.) appear to have been present only occasionally. Nevertheless, between 1895 and 1915 seven species of Daphnia inhabited Lake Naivasha simultaneously. 3. Despite considerable natural environmental change associated with climate-driven lake-level fluctuations, the Daphnia community of Lake Naivasha has been severely affected by human activities over the past century, especially the introduction of exotic fishes and water-quality changes because of agricultural soil erosion. The recent reappearance of large-bodied Daphnia species (D. magna, D. barbata, D. lumholtzi, Daphnia sp. nov. type Limuru) after 20-110 years of absence can be explained by their release from fish predation, following a dramatic increase in turbidity caused by excess clastic sediment input from eroded catchment soils. The small-bodied species D. laevis has fared less well recently, presumably because the benefit of lowered predation pressure is counteracted by more pronounced negative effects of increased turbidity on this species and loss of submerged macrophyte beds which formerly served as predation refuge. 4. Our results suggest that, despite considerable environmental instability and the absence of specialised zooplanktivores, top-down control of fish on large zooplankton is important in Lake Naivasha. Predation pressure from fish has led to clear-cut shifts in local Daphnia species composition, but failed to drive the larger taxa to extinction.

The river waters are supplied mainly from Chalk-fed aquifer sources and are, therefore, of a calcium-bicarbonate type. The major, minor and trace element chemistry of the rivers is controlled by a combination of atmospheric and pollutant inputs from agriculture and sewage sources superimposed on a background water quality signal linked to geological sources. Water quality does not vary greatly over time or space. However. in detail, there are differences in water quality between the Pang and Lambourn and between sites along the Pang and the Lambourn. These differences reflect hydrological processes, water flow pathways and water quality input fluxes. The Pangs pattern of water quality change is more variable than that of the Lambourn. The flow hydrograph also shows both a cyclical and 'uniform pattern' characteristic of aquifer drainage with, superimposed, a series of 'flashier' spiked responses characteristic of karstic systems. The Lambourn, in contrast, shows simpler features without the 'flashier' responses, The results are discussed in relation to the newly developed UK community programme LOCAR dealing with Lowland Catchment Research. A descriptive and box model structure is provided to describe the key features of water quality variations in relation to soil, unsaturated and groundwater flows and storage both away from and close to the river.

J	Kennedy, MP; Murphy, KJ				Kennedy, MP; Murphy, KJ			Indicators of nitrate in wetland surface and soil-waters: interactions of vegetation and environmental factors	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article						bio-indicators; surface water; water quality; wetland vegetation	RIVER KENNET; PLANT; CATCHMENTS; GRADIENTS; NITROGEN; HABITAT; QUALITY	This paper describes a new bio-indicator method for assessing wetland ecosystem health: as such, the study is particularly relevant to current legislation such as the EU Water Framework Directive, which provides a baseline of the current status Of Surface waters. Seven wetland sites were monitored across northern Britain, with model construction data for predicting, eco-hydroloplical relationships collected from five sites during 1999, Two new sites and one repeat site were monitored during 2000 to provide model test data. The main growing season for the vegetation, and hence the sampling period, was May-August during both years. Seasonal mean concentrations of nitrate (NO3-) in surface and soil water samples during 1999 ranged from 0.01 to 14.07 mg N 1(-1), with a mean value of 1.01 mg N 1(-1). During 2000, concentrations ranged from trace level (<0.01 m- N 1(-1)) to 9.43 mg N 1(-1), with a mean of 2.73 mg N 1(.)(-1) Surface and soil-water nitrate concentrations did not influence plant species composition significantly across representative tall herb fen and mire communities. Predictive relationships were found between nitrate concentrations and structural characteristics of the wetland vegetation, and a model was developed which predicted nitrate concentrations from measures of plant diversity, canopy structure and density of reproductive structures. Two further models, which predicted stem density and density of reproductive structures respectively, utilised nitrate concentration as one of the independent predictor variables. Where appropriate, the models were tested using data collected during 2000. This approach is complementary to species-based monitoring, representing a useful and simple too] to assess ecological status in target wetland systems and has potential for bio-indication purposes.

J	Bastrup-Birk, A; Gundersen, P				Bastrup-Birk, A; Gundersen, P			Water quality improvements from afforestation in an agricultural catchment in Denmark illustrated with the INCA model	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article						afforestation; arable land; forest hydrology; INCA; modelling; nitrogen; nitrate leaching	NITROGEN MODEL; FOREST SOIL; VEGETATION; VARIABILITY; CARBON; OAK	Intensive agricultural land use across Europe has altered nitrogen (N) budget of catchments substantially, causing widespread N pollution of freshwater. Although the N cycle in forests has changed due to increased N deposition, most Forest soil waters in Europe have low nitrate concentrations. The protective function of forests on water quality has led to increasing interest in the planting of new forests on arable land as a measure to protect valuable or sensitive freshwater resources. The paper illustrates the effects of afforestation on water and N cycling using the Integrated Nitrogen Catchment (INCA) model. The model was calibrated on the Horndrup catchment in the eastern part of Jutland, Denmark, which is dominated by agricultural land use but also covered by 18% of forest land. The dynamics of nitrate concentrations in the stream water were simulated successfully by INCA over a three-year period. The simulation of the dynamics of nitrate concentrations in the soil water is closely linked to the simulation of the hydrological dynamics and especially to the rainfall. The best fit was achieved for both arable and forest land during the wettest year of the study period. The model was then used to simulate the effect of afforestation of a catchment dominated by agriculture on N fluxes with seepage and runoff. Scenarios of whole catchment conversion to forest were run, based on observations of evapotranspiration and N deposition from other Danish sites. The simulated conversion to mature forest reduced runoff by 30-45% and reduced the nitrate concentrations in the soil water by 50-70%. The simulated effect of afforestation on N leaching was an almost direct reflection of the change in the N input: substantial changes in the plant demand and soil N dynamics over the afforestation period were not simulated. To simulate the N dynamics over longer time-scales, appropriate for the study of afforestation, it is suggested that the INCA model be run with transient scenarios and linked to more detailed plant and soil models.

J	Durand, P				Durand, P			Simulating nitrogen budgets in complex farming systems using INCA: calibration and scenario analyses for the Kervidy catchment (W. France)	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article						diffuse pollution; nitrate; climate change; model	AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES; MODEL	The integrated nitrogen model INCA (Integrated Nitrogen in Catchments) was used to analyse the nitrogen dynamics in a small rural catchment in Western France. The agrosystem studied is very complex, with: extensive use of different organic fertilisers, a variety of crop rotations, a structural excess of nitrogen (i.e. more animal N produced by the intensive farming than the N requirements of the crops and pastures), and nitrate retention in both hydrological stores and riparian zones. The original model features were adapted here to describe this complexity. The calibration results are satisfactory, although the daily variations in stream nitrate are not simulated in detail, Different climate scenarios. based on observed climate records, were tested all produced a worsening of the pollution in the short term. Scenarios of alternative agricultural practices (reduced fertilisation and catch crops) were also analysed, suggesting that a reduction by 40% of the fertilisation combined with the introduction of catch crops would be necessary to stop the degradation of water quality.

J	Davies, H; Neal, C				Davies, H; Neal, C			GIS-based methodologies for assessing nitrate, nitrite and ammonium distributions across a major UK basin, the Humber	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article						GIS; nitrate; nitrite; ammonium; catchment characteristics	LAND-OCEAN INTERACTION; RIVER WATER-QUALITY; NORTH-SEA; NITROGEN; CATCHMENT; CHEMISTRY; MANAGEMENT; PHOSPHORUS; EUROPE; LOADS	The distributions of nitrate, nitrite and ammonium at various monitoring sites across the Humber basin (area 24 000 km(2)) were examined within a Geographical Information System (GIs) framework. This basin contains diverse characteristics, from areas of high population and industry to rural and arable regions. The Humber River is a major provider of nutrient fluxes to the North Sea from the UK. Within the GIs analysis, the distributions of mean and mean flow weighted concentrations, flux and flux per unit area, were investigated. Empirical relationships between land characteristics and water quality for the whole catchment draining to each water quality monitoring site were established. Thirty-eight catchments were chosen for this analysis, with areas ranging from 46 km(2) to 8225 km(2). These catchments are distributed across the Humber, encompassing the different conditions across the basin, thus allowing relationships between water quality and catchment characteristics to be used to estimate the nitrogen concentrations and flux throughout the basin river network. The main water quality data source was the Land Ocean Interaction Study (LOIS) dataset. The Environment Agency of England and Wales water quality datasets were used to infill areas of sparse LOIS monitoring network density within the Humber. The work shows the feasibility of estimating nitrate and, to a lesser extent, nitrite and ammonium concentrations and fluxes across the river network based on land characteristics, using a GIs methodology. The estimations work particularly well for the main river channels. However, there are local anomalies which are more difficult to predict. Maps showing concentration variations at 500 m intervals along the Humber basin river networks are presented; these are of particular value for environmental managers and socio-economists.

New developments in the understanding of the factors and processes determining the concentrations and loads of nitrogen are outlined. The ability of the INCA model to simulate the hydrological and nitrogen dynamics of different European ecosystems is assessed and the results of the first scenario analyses investigating the impacts of deposition, climatic and land-use change on the nitrogen dynamics are summarised. Consideration is given as to how well the model has performed as a generic too] for describing the nitrogen dynamics of European ecosystems across Arctic, Maritime. Continental and Mediterranean climates, its role in new research initiatives and future research requirements.

J	Houlahan, JE; Findlay, CS				Houlahan, JE; Findlay, CS			Estimating the 'critical' distance at which adjacent land-use degrades wetland water and sediment quality	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY			English	Article						buffer zones; landscape; phosphorous; nitrogen; scale; sediments; wetland management; Ontario; Canada	MINNEAPOLIS ST-PAUL; CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; AGRICULTURAL PHOSPHORUS; NUTRIENT-ENRICHMENT; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; METROPOLITAN-AREA; BUFFER STRIPS; STREAM; NITROGEN; CHEMISTRY	Conversion of forested lands to agriculture or urban/residential areas has been associated with declines in stream and lake water quality. Less attention has been paid to the effects of adjacent land-uses on wetland sediment and water quality and, perhaps more importantly, the spatial scales at which these effects occur. Here we address these issues by examining variation in water and sediment nutrient levels in 73 southeastern Ontario, Canada, wetlands. We modeled the relationship between water and sediment nutrient concentrations and various measures of adjacent land-use such as forest cover and road density, measured over increasing distances from the wetland edge. We found that water nitrogen and phosphorous levels were negatively correlated with forest cover at 2250 meters from the wetland edge, while sediment phosphorous levels were negatively correlated with wetland size and forest cover at 4000 meters and positively correlated with the proportion of land within 4000 meters that is itself wetland. These results suggest that the effects of adjacent land-use on wetland sediment and water quality can extend over comparatively large distances. As such, effective wetland conservation will not be achieved merely through the creation of narrow buffer zones between wetlands and more intensive land-uses.

J	Nakasone, H; Yamamoto, T				Nakasone, Hideo; Yamamoto, Tomohisa			The impacts of the water quality of the inflow water from tea fields on irrigation reservoir ecosystems	PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Nitrate pollution; Denitrification; Aquatic ecosystem; Acidification of lake; Low pH		Authors observed that the nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration is approximately 30 mg/L and that the average pH value is 4.3 in a small river in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. Further, when there is heavy rain, the pH value of the river water decreases to below 3.5 at times. There is a small irrigation reservoir in the watershed. The reservoir receives this water and mixed with other river water, the pH in the reservoir reaches below 5.0 at times, making it impossible for fauna to survive there. This water is also used for paddy irrigation, however no damage to rice production was reported. The authors clarified the fact that the low pH and high NO3-N concentrations were brought about by the overuse of nitrogen fertilizers in tea fields. Further, the authors proposed a model, which can be used to estimate the pH value and the NO3-N concentration.

As benthic filter feeders capable of attaching to hard substrates, the magnitudes of their biomass and filtering activity in nearshore waters are without precedent. The dreissenid colonization has implications for the removal and fate of materials filtered from the water by the mussels and for the longer-term development of the nearshore benthic community and lake ecosystem. A conceptual model, the nearshore shunt, seeks to describe a fundamental redirection of nutrient and energy flow consequent to dreissenid establishment. The model explains some emergent problems in the Great Lakes, such as reemergence of Cladophora in some coastal zones while offshore P concentrations remain low, and highlights areas in need of more research. The source of particulate nutrient inputs to dreissenids and the fate of materials exported from the benthic community are critical to understanding the role of dreissenids in the lakes and assessing the applicability of current models for managing nutrients and fisheries. The nearshore shunt would require even more stringent P management for lakes strongly impacted by dreissenids to maintain nearshore water quality.

J	Collentine, D; Larsson, M; Hannerz, N				Collentine, D; Larsson, M; Hannerz, N			Exploiting decision heuristics and IT in the design of a DSS for voluntary agri-environmental programs	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						agri-environmental policy; BMP implementation; farm management; heuristics; SOILNDB	WATER-QUALITY; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; PROTECTION PRACTICES; NITROGEN; INFORMATION; POLLUTION; ADOPTION; SOIL; FARMERS; LOSSES	Low participation rates by farmers in voluntary agri-environmental programs may depend on rationally bounded ex ante estimates of the negative effect of program enrollment on farm income. Uncertainty and the presence of information transaction costs may lead to the use of heuristics by farmers to reduce adoption decision costs. This paper describes how LENNART, a net-based decision support system (DSS), has been designed to exploit the use of heuristics and provide low cost access to information. The model has been developed to evaluate the effects of agronomic measures on farm income and on the leaching of nutrients from cultivated fields.

The model is obtained by coupling a finite element hydrodynamic model, that computes the velocity fields of water, an energetic model to compute the water temperature fields, and an ecological model that simulates the dynamic of phytoplankton, zooplankton, nutrients (ammonia, nitrate and phosphate) organic detritus (organic nitrogen, organic phosphorous and CBOD) and dissolved oxygen. The transport model is a two-dimensional barotropic finite element model which allows for a better resolution of the lagoon morphology. The ecological model has been developed by starting from the ecological module EUTRO of WASP (Water Analysis Simulation System released by US EPA), and by adapting it to the peculiarity of the Lagoon of Venice. A reference condition has been identified by running a 1-year simulation under climatologic condition. Then, the sensitivity to physical forcing (tide and wind) and to the input of macronutrients has been investigated, by comparing model predictions of spatial and temporal evolution of major state variables and of an aggregate index of Water Quality Trophic Index (TRIX).

This approach uses the plant primary production rate to quantify the phytoplankton growth rate. The delta method, which is a piecewise analytical solution technique, is applied to determine the diurnal variation in plant primary production rate. The approach is tested by applying it to the Gumsuck stream in the Kyonggi-Do province in Korea. The optimization technique with constraints is used to obtain the best running results. Application of this approach shows that the values calculated using the method presented here are in good agreement with the measured values. Therefore, we conclude that this technique realistically simulates the daily variation of chlorophyll a.

J	Hatt, BE; Fletcher, TD; Walsh, CJ; Taylor, SL				Hatt, BE; Fletcher, TD; Walsh, CJ; Taylor, SL			The influence of urban density and drainage infrastructure on the concentrations and loads of pollutants in small streams	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						urbanization; stormwater runoff; impervious area; drainage connection; catchment; water quality	WATER-QUALITY; LAND-USE; URBANIZATION; CONSERVATION; POLLUTION; IMPACTS; ECOLOGY; RUNOFF; AREA	Effective water quality management of streams in urbanized basins requires identification of the elements of urbanization that contribute most to pollutant concentrations and loads. Drainage connection (the proportion of impervious area directly connected to streams by pipes or lined drains) is proposed as a variable explaining variance in the generally weak relationships between pollutant concentrations and imperviousness. Fifteen small streams draining independent subbasins east of Melbourne, Australia, were sampled for a suite of water quality variables. Geometric mean concentrations of all variables were calculated separately for baseflow and storm events, and these, together with estimates of runoff derived from a rainfall-runoff model, were used to estimate mean annual loads. Patterns of concentrations among the streams were assessed against patterns of imperviousness, drainage connection, unsealed (unpaved) road density, elevation, longitude (all of which were intercorrelated), septic tank density, and basin area. Baseflow and storm event concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), filterable reactive phosphorus (FRP), total phosphorus (TP) and ammonium, along with electrical conductivity (EC), all increased with imperviousness and its correlates. Hierarchical partitioning showed that DOC, EC, FRP, and storm event TP were independently correlated with drainage connection more strongly than could be explained by chance. Neither pH nor total suspended solids concentrations were strongly correlated with any basin variable. Oxidized and total nitrogen concentrations were most strongly explained by septic tank density. Loads of all variables were strongly correlated with imperviousness and connection. Priority should be given to low-impact urban design, which primarily involves reducing drainage connection, to minimize urbanization-related pollutant impacts on streams.

J	Pan, Y; Hom, J; Birdsey, R; Mccullough, K				Pan, Yude; Hom, John; Birdsey, Richard; Mccullough, Kevin			Impacts of rising nitrogen deposition on N exports from forests to surface waters in the Chesapeake Bay watershed	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Chesapeake Bay watershed; atmospheric nitrogen deposition; nitrate leaching loss; forests; PnET-CN; model validation	NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; LAND-USE; CARBON STORAGE; ECOSYSTEMS; NUTRIENT; CLIMATE; SATURATION; RESPONSES; HISTORY; CO2	In this study, we applied a process-based forest ecosystem model, PnET-CN, to estimate inorganic N (nitrate) loading and retention under chronic increases of atmospheric N deposition in the Chesapeake Bay (CPB) watershed. The results indicated that the average N leaching loss from forested lands in the CPB watershed is 1.23 kg N ha(-1) y(-1) at current N deposition levels, suggesting approximately 88% of N is retained by forest ecosystems. Total dissolved inorganic N exported from the forested watersheds was 11,617 Mg N yr(-1). The predicted rates of the nitrate losses are well validated by the United States Geological Survey - National Water-Quality Assessment data measured from the gauged stations for forested drainages within the CPB watershed, and are also compatible with the field data of N loads associated with forests in the CPB watershed. If N deposition were twice current levels, the retention by forests would drop to 81%. Total N leaching loss to surface waters would then increase more than threefold. A nonlinear increase in N loads from forests under the extreme scenario of atmospheric N deposition shows the symptom of N saturation and an accelerated decline of forest functioning to retain atmospheric N deposition in the CPB watershed with rising levels of nitrogen deposition.

In this study, land cover patterns and stocking rates were used as measures of agricultural development in two pasture and one native grassland catchment in New Zealand and were related to water quality in streams of various orders. The amount of pasture per subcatchment correlated well to total nitrogen and nitrate in one catchment and turbidity and total phosphorous in the other catchment. Stocking rates were only correlated to total phosphorous in one pasture catchment but showed stronger correlations to ammonium, total phosphorous and total nitrogen in the other pasture catchment. Winter and spring floods were significant sources of nutrients and faecal coliforms from one of the pasture catchments into a wetland complex. Nutrient and faecal coliform concentrations were better predicted by pastural land cover in fourth-order than in second-order streams. This suggests that upstream land use is more influential in larger streams, while local land use and other factors may be more important in smaller streams. These temporal and spatial scale effects indicate that water-monitoring schemes need to be scale-sensitive. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Runoff from unmanured, grassed field plots (1 m wide X 2 m long, 3-8% slope) and bare soil boxes (0.2 m wide and 1 m long, 3% slope) was compared using rainfall simulation (75 mm h(-1)) standardized by 30-min runoff duration (rainfall averaged 55 mm for field plots and 41 non for packed boxes). Packed boxes had lower infiltration (1.2 cm) and greater runoff (2.9 cm) and erosion (542 kg ha(-1)) than field plots (3.7 cm infiltration; 1.8 cm runoff, 149 kg ha(-1) erosion), yielding greater total phosphorus (TP) losses in runoff. Despite these differences, regressions of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in runoff and Mehlich-3 soil P were consistent between field plots and packed boxes reflecting similar buffering by soils and sediments. A second experiment compared manured boxes of 5- and 25-cm depths to determine if variable hydrology based on box depth influenced P transport. Runoff properties did not differ significantly between box depths before or after broadcasting dairy, poultry, or swine manure (100 kg TP ha(-1)). Water-extractable phosphorus (WEP) from manures dominated runoff P, and translocation of manure P into soil was consistent between box types. This study reveals the practical, but limited, comparability of field plot and soil box data, highlighting soil and sediment buffering in unamended soils and manure WEP in amended soils as dominant controls of DRP transport.

J	Tarkalson, DD; Mikkelsen, RL				Tarkalson, DD; Mikkelsen, RL			Runoff phosphorus losses as related to phosphorus source, application method, and application rate on a piedmont soil	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							POULTRY LITTER; BIOAVAILABLE PHOSPHORUS; INORGANIC FERTILIZER; AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF; MANURE-APPLICATION; NUTRIENT LOSSES; WATER-QUALITY; RAINFALL; TILLAGE; PLOTS	Land application of animal manures and fertilizers has resulted in an increased potential for excessive P losses in runoff to nutrient-sensitive surface waters. The purpose of this research was to measure P losses in runoff from a bare Piedmont soil in the southeastern United States receiving broiler litter or inorganic P fertilizer either incorporated or surface-applied at varying P application rates (inorganic P, 0-110 kg P ha(-1); broiler litter, 0-82 kg P ha(-1)). Rainfall simulation was applied at a rate of 76 min h(-1). Runoff samples were collected at 5-min intervals for 30 min and analyzed for reactive phosphorus (RP), algal-available phosphorus (AAP), and total phosphorus (TP). Incorporation of both P sources resulted in P losses not significantly different than the unfertilized control at all application rates. Incorporation of broiler litter decreased flow-weighted concentration of RP in runoff by 97% and mass loss of TP in runoff by 88% compared with surface application. Surface application of broiler litter resulted in runoff containing between 2.3 and 21.8 mg RP L-1 for application rates of 8 to 82 kg P ha-1, respectively. Mass loss of TP in runoff from surface-applied broiler litter ranged from 1.3 to 8.5 kg P ha(-1) over the same application rates. Flow-weighted concentrations of RP and mass losses of TP in runoff were not related to application rate when inorganic P fertilizer was applied to the soil surface. Results for this study can be used by P loss assessment tools to fine-tune P source, application rate, and application method site factors, and to estimate extreme-case P loss from cropland receiving broiler litter and inorganic P fertilizers.

Phytase enzyme and high available phosphorus (HAP) corn supplements to poultry feed are considered potential remedies to this problem because they can reduce total P concentrations in manure. However, less is known about their water solubility of P and potential nonpoint-source P losses when land-applied. This study was conducted to determine the effects of phytase enzyme and HAP corn supplemented diets on runoff P concentrations from pasture soils receiving surface applications of turkey manure. Manure from five poultry diets consisting of various combinations of phytase enzyme, HAP corn, and normal phytic acid (NPA) corn were surface-applied at 60 kg P ha(-1) to runoff boxes containing tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) and placed under a rainfall simulator for runoff collection. The alternative diets caused a decrease in manure total P and water soluble phosphorus (WSP) compared with the standard diet. Runoff dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) concentrations were significantly higher from HAP manure-amended soils while DRP losses from other manure treatments were not significantly different from each other. The DRP concentrations in runoff were not directly related to manure WSP. Instead, because the mass of manure applied varied for each treatment causing different amounts of manure particles lost in runoff, the runoff DRP concentrations were influenced by a combination of runoff sediment concentrations and manure WSP.

The use of compost or mulch blankets as a soil cover can help control soil erosion and provide sustainable alternatives to disposal for many biomass resources. The objective of this study was to investigate the amounts of runoff, erosion, and nutrient losses obtained under simulated rainfall using a variety of compost and mulch materials. Treatments included aged poultry titter, two different types of poultry litter compost, municipal solid waste compost, biosolids compost, food waste compost, yard waste compost, three different types of wood mulch, and bare soil. Results indicated that all of the treatments except for aged poultry litter were effective at reducing total solids loss in the runoff. Nutrient losses from most of the compost treatments, however, were higher than those from bare soil or mulch treatments. Treatments with lower respiration rates and nitrate-nitrogen concentrations tended to have less erosion and transport of solids. Nitrate-nitrogen content, respiration rates, soluble salt, sodium, and potassium contents were good indicators of ammonium and phosphorus losses.

J	Smith, RMS; Wheater, HS				Smith, RMS; Wheater, HS			Multiple objective evaluation of a simple phosphorus transfer model	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES			English	Article						phosphorus transfer model; non-point source pollution; Monte Carlo analysis; multiple objectives; uncertainty analysis	LAND-USE CHANGE; WATER-QUALITY; AGRICULTURAL LAND; HYDROLOGICAL PATHWAYS; SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS; MANAGEMENT; EXPORT; CATCHMENT; EUTROPHICATION; UNCERTAINTY	A simple phosphorus (P) transfer model of the Welland catchment, UK, is evaluated against multiple objective functions using a Monte Carlo approach that combines calibration, identifiability, sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. The model is based on simple conceptual rainfall-runoff and river routing components, combined with estimates of the daily non-point source load derived from annual landuse-based export coefficients, disaggregated as a function of the runoff. The model has limited data requirements, consistent with data availability, and is parsimoneous with respect to the number of parameters identified through inverse modelling. The best performing parameter sets capture the main aspects of the observed flow and total P (TP) concentrations and provide a suitable basis for a decision-support tool. However, a trade-off is evident between matching the observed flow peaks, flow recessions and TP concentrations simultaneously, highlighting some limitations of the model structure and/or calibration data. Model analysis indicates that daily non-point source load cannot be described as a function of near-surface runoff and land use alone, but that other influences, including seasonality, are important. However, further model development to improve performance is likely to introduce additional complexity (in terms of parameter numbers), and hence additional problems of parameter identifiability and output uncertainty, which in turn raises issues of the information content of the available data.

A segmented linear regression flow model was developed to compare mass-water transport and nutrient loadings to a major artery, the Neuse River Estuary (NRE), and to estimate mean annual versus storm-related volume delivery to the NRE and Pamlico Sound. Significantly less water volume was delivered by Hurricane Fran (1996), but massive fish kills occurred in association with severe dissolved oxygen deficits and high contaminant loadings (total nitrogen, total phosphorus, suspended solids, and fecal bacteria). The high water volume of the second hurricane season (Hurricanes Dennis, Floyd, and Irene in 1999) delivered generally comparable but more dilute contaminant loads, and no major fish kills were reported. There were no discernable long-term adverse impacts on water quality. Populations of undesirable organisms, such as toxic dinoflagellates, were displaced down-estuary to habitats less conducive for growth. The response of fisheries was species-dependent: there was no apparent impact of the hurricanes on commercial landings of bivalve molluscs or shrimp. In contrast, interacting effects of hurricane floodwaters in 1999 and intensive fishing pressure led to striking reductions in blue crabs. Overall, the data support the premise that, in shallow estuaries frequently disturbed by hurricanes, there can be relatively rapid recovery in water quality and biota, and benefit from the scouring activity of these storms.

J	de Paz, JM; Ramos, C				de Paz, JM; Ramos, C			Simulation of nitrate leaching for different nitrogen fertilization rates in a region of Valencia (Spain) using a GIS-GLEAMS system	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						GIS; GLEAMS; nitrate leaching; nitrogen fertilization	GROUNDWATER NITRATE; WATER-QUALITY; LOSSES; SOILS; MODEL; CONTAMINATION; VULNERABILITY; MANAGEMENT; POLLUTION; BALANCE	The groundwater loading effects of agricultural management systems (GLEAMS) model coupled to a GIS was used to evaluate the effect of different fertilization treatments on the total N leaching in a selected area of eastern Spain with intensive agriculture. Four nitrogen fertilization rates (traditional or base, base rate reduced by 20%, reduced by 50%, and the rate calculated by the N-min recommendation system for vegetables, and reduced by 70% for citrus) were evaluated at a regional scale to find the rate that minimized N leaching without reducing crop N uptake. Nitrate leaching maps were obtained for the different nitrogen rates studied. A great reduction of N leaching (up to 68% for vegetables, and 75% for citrus) was observed under the most reduced fertilization rates and this reduction was greater in areas irrigated with surface water in comparison to those irrigated with groundwater. The GIS-GLEAMS system was a useful tool to assess the N leaching at a regional scale for the different N management considered. For example, it was shown that the N-min recommendation system was the most efficient for vegetables, and for citrus the most efficient fertilization rate was the reduced 50%, that is similar to that recommended by the Code of Good Agricultural Practices. The areas irrigated with groundwater with high nitrate content had a high leaching rate, and the nitrate applied in irrigation water should be considered when planning the crop fertilization. A temporal analysis of the NO3-N in soil, N leaching, crop evapotranspiration and rainfall allowed to identify the influence of the soil NO3-N and the rainfall on nitrate leaching.

Recently, there is interest to calibrate agronomic soil tests to predict risk of P transport in runoff. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the relationships among three agronomic soil test P extraction methods (Olsen, Brayl, Mehlich3) and dissolved P in water (0.01 M CaCl2 extractable P) in five representative soils of tropical and subtropical areas in Puerto Rico and Florida. The soils were of the series Astatula (Entisol), San Anton (Mollisol), Caguabo (Inceptisol), Corozal (Ultisol), and Bayamon (Oxisol). Soils were amended with three inorganic P levels as triple super phosphate, three organic P levels as broiler litter, and their combinations in an incomplete factorial design for a total of 11 treatments. Soils were sampled during 46 weeks and soil test P was measured. Exploratory statistics were used to evaluate relationships among the variables. Relationships using the Astatula soil were studied separately as inherently high soil test P values influenced regressions greatly. A near 1:1 relationship between soil test P extracted using Brayl and Mehlich3, and Mehlich3 and Olsen extractants was obtained. In general, improved relationships were obtained using individual soils as soil pH and mineralogy influenced the amount of P extracted. Critical soil test concentrations to reach dissolved P concentrations of 1 mg P L-1 were (95% confidence intervals in parenthesis) 179 (174-185), 197 (190-207), and 252 (243-266)ppm for Olsen, Brayl, and Mehlich3 extractants, respectively for all soils combined excluding Astatula. The critical values obtained in combination with soil-landscape information can be used to establish guidelines for P management in agricultural soils.

Intensive field research in 2000 and 2001 indicated low dissolved oxygen concentration was restricted to the first 14 km of the river, which was deepened to 12 m for shipping, downstream of Stockton. The persistent low dissolved oxygen concentration in the shipping channel was not caused by physical stratification that prevented aeration from vertical mixing or respiration associated with high phytoplankton biomass. The low dissolved oxygen concentration was primarily caused by nitrification that produced up to 81% of the total oxygen demand. Stepwise multiple regression analysis isolated dissolved ammonia concentration and carbonaceous oxygen demand as the water quality variables most closely associated with the variation in oxygen demand. Between these two sources, dissolved ammonia concentration accounted for 60% of the total variation in oxygen demand compared with a maximum of 30% for carbonaceous oxygen demand. The Stockton wastewater treatment plant and nonpoint sources upstream were direct sources of dissolved ammonia in the channel. A large portion of the dissolved ammonia in the channel was also produced by oxidation of the organic nitrogen load from upstream. The phytoplankton biomass load from upstream primarily produced the carbonaceous oxygen demand. Mass balance models suggested the relative contribution of the wastewater and nonpoint upstream load to the ammonia concentration in the shipping channel at various residence times was dependent on the cumulative effect of ammonification, composition of the upstream load, and net downstream transport of the daily load.

J	Bowen, JL; Valiela, I				Bowen, JL; Valiela, I			Nitrogen loads to estuaries: Using loading models to assess the effectiveness of management options to restore estuarine water quality	ESTUARIES			English	Article							CAPE-COD; WAQUOIT BAY; ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION; COASTAL EUTROPHICATION; RESIDENCE TIME; INPUTS; EXPORT; PHOSPHORUS; FOREST; MASSACHUSETTS	Nitrogen (N) loading to estuaries has become a major concern for coastal planners. As urban development on coastal watershed continues, estuaries and bays are becoming more eutrophic, and cascading effects art! being felt at every trophic level. Managers and stakeholders need to have a suite of effective management tools that can be applied to coastal watersheds to minimize the effects of eutrophication. We applied an N loading model and an estuarine loading model to examine the effectiveness of a suite of potential management options that could be implemented in Waquoit Bay, Cape Cod, Massachusetts. This estuarine system is a case study in which we can explore the relative potential effectiveness of decreasing inputs from wastewater and fertilizer-derived N, diverting nitrogenous runoff from impervious surfaces, altering zoning ordinances, preserving forested tracts of land as well as freshwater and saltwater wetlands, harvesting macroalgae, dredging estuary channels, and exterminating waterfowl. From a combination of simulation results, assessment of the magnitude of loads from different sources, and through different land covers, and the additional consideration of feasibility we identified management options with high, intermediate, and low potential effectiveness. Improvement. of septic system performance, use of zoning regulations, preservation of forested tracts and freshwater bodies, and conservation of salt marshes emerged as the most promising avenues to manage N loads in our system. Installation of wastewater treatment plants, controlling fertilizer use, and harvesting macroalgae would potentially have intermediate success. Diversion of runoff from impervious surfaces, dredging, and extermination of waterfowl show little promise at reducing N loads. These conclusions potentially set priorities for decision-makers charged with the management of Waquoit Bay. The same procedures applied to another watershed-estuary system with different land covers and different estuarine features may differ. Evaluation studies like this need to be done for any particular site, since the watershed-estuary coupling and the loads delivered to the receiving estuary could differ. The Waquoit Bay case study provides an example of a protocol that leads to identification of the most promising management options.

In order to contribute to the development of an appropriate strategy to meet this need, the dynamics of the surface waters in the region were analysed using data from six Landsat TM/ETM + images from the late 1990s. Single images were enhanced by principal component transformation and multi-temporal image combination was based on unsupervised classification. The visual patterns discernible in the single images as well as the classification result of the multi-temporal data were compared with the reference data from long-term water quality analyses (Secchi disk depth and chlorophyll-a). The satellite images confirmed dynamic surface flow patterns in the region, indicating gradual and abrupt gradients in water quality, flow directions and forms. These patterns suggest short-term variability in the surface water quality within the region, presenting a challenge for water monitoring. The average Secchi depths increased gradually from the mainland coast until ca. 3-5 in near the open sea. The spatial distribution of chlorophyll-a was found to be more homogeneous, ca. 2-4 mug l(-1). The importance of evaluating the location of an in situ sampling site in relation to the surrounding hydrographic realm is pronounced in regions where field sampling and other monitoring methods remain insufficient in their ability to reflect water quality patterns credibly. In such areas, accurate and cost-effective water quality monitoring and forecasting require an integrated monitoring system, consisting of space and airborne surveillance, field surveys and hydrodynamic modelling.

The INCA model represents the key hydrological and N processes operating in catchments and simulates the daily dynamic behaviour as well as the annual fluxes. INCA has been applied to five years of data front the Hafren and Hore headwater sub-catchments (6.8 km(2) area in total) of the River Severn at Plytilimon and the model was calibrated and validated against field data. Simulation of afforestation is achieved by altering the uptake rate parameters in the model. INCA simulates the daily N behaviour in the catchments with good accuracy as well as reconstructing the annual budgets for N release following clearfelling a four-fold increase in N fluxes was followed by a slow recovery after re-afforestation. For comparison, INCA has been applied to the large (8380 km(2)) Bedford Ouse catchment to investigate the impact of replacing 20% arable land with forestry. The reduction in fertiliser inputs from arable farming and the N uptake by the forest are predicted to reduce the N flux reaching the main river system, leading to a 33% reduction in N-Nitrate concentrations in the river water.

J	Borsuk, ME; Stow, CA; Reckhow, KH				Borsuk, ME; Stow, CA; Reckhow, KH			Confounding effect of flow on estuarine response to nitrogen loading	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						eutrophication; models; streamflow; river systems; estuaries; water quality; north Carolina; nitrogen	NEUSE RIVER ESTUARY; NORTH-CAROLINA; NUTRIENT LIMITATION; PHYTOPLANKTON PRODUCTIVITY; WATER; MODEL; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS	The total maximum daily load (TMDL) concept provides the basis for regulating pollution load from riverine sources to impaired water bodies. However, load is comprised of two components: flow and concentration. These two components may have confounding, or even conflicting, effects on waterbody attributes of concern. This is particularly the case for dynamic, advective systems, such as estuaries. Resolving these components is critical for properly predicting the response of impaired systems to watershed management actions. The Neuse River Estuary in North Carolina is an example of such an impaired system. Nitrogen has been identified as the pollutant of concern, and the process of developing a TMDL for nitrogen is underway. We, therefore, analyze the extensive data that have been collected for the Neuse River and estuary to investigate spatiotemporal relationships between river flow, riverine total nitrogen (TN) inputs, water temperature, dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration, algal density, and primary productivity. Results support the belief that phytoplankton in the estuary are under substantial riverine control. However, the riverine TN concentration alone has only a minor role in determining estuarine chlorophyll a concentration. River flow has a stronger influence, likely through its effects on down-estuary nitrogen delivery, residence time, salinity, and turbidity. These results imply that using riverine nitrogen load as the metric to evaluate watershed nutrient management may not be appropriate. While nitrogen controls should reduce loads in the long term, in the short term, river flow is the dominant component of load and has the opposite effect of nitrogen on algae at the up-estuary locations.

A canonical correspondence analysis using four representative environmental variables, alkalinity (correlated with pH and conductivity), maximum phytoplankton chl a (CHLmax) (correlated with total P, total N, and chl), turbidity, and water color explained 21% of the variance in taxa distributions. The first two axes were significant and accounted for 77% of the variance in the periphyton-environmental relationship. The first axis was strongly related to alkalinity and color, which reflected geology and land use in the watersheds. The second axis was most correlated with CHLmax, and separation of lakes corresponded to their Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) trophic classification based on water chemistry. Eutrophic lakes were characterized by cyanobacteria taxa and Stigeoclonium sp. Diatoms and desmids were generally more abundant in oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes. Values for diatom trophic indices were poor indicators of trophic state. Weighted averaging regression and calibration techniques were used to develop transfer functions between 84 taxa and total P, total N, and CHLmax. The total P inference model predicted OECD trophic classification correctly for 84% of the lakes. Values for taxa preferences resulting from such models can provide the foundation for biomonitoring schemes using extant periphyton communities. The turnover time of periphyton taxa should integrate changes in environmental conditions at a temporal scale intermediate to surface-sediment fossil diatom assemblages and water column variables, which may be more appropriate for detecting annual changes.

Each station was sampled between 1 and 26 times (mean = 7.5, standard deviation = 6.0) during the ice free seasons without regard to tide. There was significant variance among stations in most parameters. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify the processes explaining the observed variance in water quality. Because of the high variability in specific conductance, stations were first grouped in a freshwater subset and an estuarine (brackish water) subset. For freshwater stations, most of the variance in water quality was explained by pH and total organic carbon, as well as high nutrient concentrations. These high nutrient concentrations, along with water salinity, which varies with flow and tides, are also important in determining water quality variability in brackish water. It is recommended that water quality parameters that were found to explain most of the variance by PCA be monitored more closely, as they are key elements in understanding the variability in water quality in the Richibucto drainage basin. Cluster analyses showed that high phosphorous and nitrate concentrations were mostly found in areas of peat runoff, tributaries receiving treated municipal effluent, and lentic zones upstream of culverts. Peat runoff was also shown to be acidic, whether it is runoff from a harvested area or a natural bog.

J	Keller, AA; Zheng, Y; Robinson, TH				Keller, AA; Zheng, Y; Robinson, TH			Determining critical water quality conditions for inorganic nitrogen in dry, semi-urbanized watersheds	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						TMDL; watershed modeling; low flow; runoff; loads; storm water; inorganic nitrogen	AUTOMATIC CALIBRATION; FLOW EVENTS; SWAT MODEL; RIVER; HSPF; SIMULATION; VALIDATION; POINT; BASIN	Traditional approaches to establishing critical water quality conditions, based on statistical analysis of low flow conditions and expressed as a recurrence interval for low flow conditions (e.g., 7Q10), may be inappropriate for drier watersheds. The use of 7Q10 as a standard design flow assumes year-round flow, but in these watersheds, 7Q10 is zero or very small. In addition, the increasing use of multiple year dynamic water quality models at daily time steps can supercede the use of steady state approaches. Many of these watersheds are also under increasing urbanization pressure, which accentuates the flashiness of runoff and the episodic nature of critical water quality conditions. To illustrate, the conditions in the Santa Clara River, California, are considered. A statistical analysis indicates that higher inorganic nitrogen concentrations correlate strongly with low flow. However, peaks in concentrations can occur during the first storms, particularly where nonpoint source contribution is significant. Critical conditions can thus occur at different flow regimes depending on the relative magnitude of flow and pollutant contributions from various sources. The use of steady state models for these dry semi-urbanized watersheds based on 7Q10 flows is thus unlikely to accurately simulate the potential for exceeding water quality objectives. Dynamic simulation of water quality is necessary, and as the recent intense storm event sampling data indicate, the models should be formulated to consider even smaller time steps. This places increasing demand on computational resources and datasets to accurately calibrate the models at this temporal resolution.

We investigated: (1) life history; (2) secondary production in benthic and hyporheic habitats; and (3) major energy sources contributing to nutrition and production of this species in a pristine forest stream. Most nymphal size classes were present throughout the year, and emergence extended over several months, peaking from February to April. Despite apparently having extended emergence and recruitment periods, Acanthophlebia exhibited a predominantly univoltine life history. Annual benthic production (calculated by the size-frequency method) was 0.318 g dry mass (DM) m(-2) year(-1), compared to 4.601 g DM m(-2) year(-1) in high-density benthic habitats at the tails of pools, and 34.476 g m(-3) year(-1) for colonisation baskets set at 15-45 cm deep in the substratum. On a habitat weighted basis averaged out over the entire sampling reach, it was estimated that 76% of annual production occurred in hyporheic habitats >10 cm below the streambed surface. Gut contents were dominated by fine particulate matter (FPM) less than or equal to75 mum and larger inorganic material on all dates in individuals from both benthic and hyporheic habitats. Fungi were relatively abundant in guts of benthic animals collected on some dates, whereas spores and pollen were relatively common food items in both habitats on occasions. Analysis of the trophic basis of production, based on gut contents and assumed assimilation and net production efficiencies, indicated that benthic secondary production was supported largely by fungi (48% of production) and FPM (37%), whereas FPM supported a higher level of hyporheic production (52%) than fungi (27%). Although stable carbon isotope values suggested dependence on epilithon, the enriched delta(15)N values for this food source implicated the involvement of a microbial loop whereby a substantial proportion of Acanthophlebia nutrition appeared to be derived from heterotrophs growing in FPM and epilithon that had assimilated dissolved organic carbon. This study has highlighted the significant role that hyporheic habitats can play in the ecology of Acanthophlebia populations in pristine native forest streams. Re-establishment of hyporheic function would appear to be an important component of stream restoration work to enable the successful recolonisation of Acanthophlebia populations at sites where they historically occurred.

J	Updegraff, K; Gowda, P; Mulla, DJ				Updegraff, K; Gowda, P; Mulla, DJ			Watershed-scale modeling of the water quality effects of cropland conversion to short-rotation woody crops	RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS			English	Article						ADAPT; nitrate; sediment; short-rotation woody crops; watershed models	AGRICULTURAL WATERSHEDS; PLANTATIONS; FILTERS; SYSTEMS	The conversion of cropland to the production of woody biomass, or short-rotation woody crops (SRWCs), has the potential to provide an economic alternative to Midwestern farmers, while simultaneously offering an environmental dividend in the form of reduced erosion and nutrient pollution of streams. However, notwithstanding a wealth of plot-scale and anecdotal data suggestive of these benefits, there are few watershed-scale integrated analyses on which to base regional policy decisions regarding incentives to convert fields to SRWCs. This study applied a field-scale runoff, sediment and nutrient transport model (Agricultural Drainage and Pesticide Transport, ADAPT) to a simulation of 10, 20 and 30% cropland conversion to SRWCs, grown on a 5-year rotation, in a representative Minnesota River sub-watershed. While the generation of a highly precise simulation would require extensive calibration of the model, its application with parameters previously calibrated to neighboring, similar watersheds provided reasonably robust results that indicated real differences resulting from cropland conversion. At the highest conversion level, mean annual runoff was reduced by up to 9%, sediment loads by 28% and nitrogen (N) loads by 15%, although total phosphorus (P) loads increased by 2% relative to the no-SRWC scenario. However, the relative benefits of conversion at the field level were contingent on soil type, drainage status and the alternative crop. These differences provide useful insights with respect to the targeting of possible conversion incentives.

J	Mullen, JD; Centner, TJ				Mullen, JD; Centner, TJ			Impacts of adjusting environmental regulations when enforcement authority is diffuse: Confined animal feeding operations and environmental quality	REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS			English	Article							INCOMPLETE ENFORCEMENT; WATER-QUALITY; POLLUTION; MANAGEMENT; PHOSPHORUS; STANDARDS; ECONOMICS	Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recently adjusted regulations governing confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), significantly increasing the number of regulated firms. A theoretical model is developed to analyze how changes to the number of regulated firms, monitoring effort, and compliance standards affect environmental quality. The model suggests increasing the number of regulated firms, ceteris paribus, has an ambiguous effect on environmental quality, and may actually reduce it. The impact of increasing compliance standards depends on how violations are prosecuted and sanctions are set. Greater monitoring effort increases environmental quality.

J	Laboski, CAM; Lamb, JA				Laboski, CAM; Lamb, JA			Impact of manure application on soil phosphorus sorption characteristics and subsequent water quality implications	SOIL SCIENCE			English	Article						phosphorus; sorption; manure application; degree of P saturation	PHOSPHATE ADSORPTION; RESIDUAL PHOSPHORUS; AVAILABILITY; SATURATION; KAOLINITE; EQUATION; RELEASE; MODEL; FATE	For nutrient management purposes, it is important to understand the impact of manure application on soil phosphorus (P) sorption characteristics and what it means with regard to potential environmental problems. The objectives of this study were (i) to determine whether previous manure applications impact P sorption capacity and strength; (ii) to characterize the relationship between water soluble-P (WSP) and degree of P saturation (DPS); and (iii) to characterize the relationship between WSP and P sorption capacity and strength. Phosphorus sorption isotherms were constructed for seven pairs of soils with and without a history of manure application. Within a soil series, P sorption isotherms were compared to determine the effects of manure application. Manure application increased sorption capacity significantly in the Nicollet soil series. Phosphorus sorption capacity was unchanged by manure application in the Waukegan soil series. Manure application reduced P sorption capacity in the Port Byron, Sanburn, Verndale, Ves, and Barnes soils. Phosphorus sorption strength decreased in five of the seven soil series after manure application. The degree of P saturation and soil test P were strongly linearly correlated to WSP. Water soluble-P was less than 1 mg L-1 when DPS was less than 21.7%. When manure application increased DPS to more than 26%, sorption strength was reduced; P was bound less tightly to the soil on low strength sorption sites, such that P was more readily available. Sorption strength was used to determine the soil test P level above which there is increased risk to water quality because of reduced sorption strength and subsequent increases in WSP; this occurred when Bray-P was greater than 60 mg kg(-1).

A simplified river water quality model was formulated based on a conceptual hydraulic sub-model and simplification of an existing river water quality model. The simplified water quality was derived from the River Water Quality Model No. 1, which is one of the most comprehensive basic river water quality models available in literature. The applicability of the simplified model in data limited situations was investigated using a case study of inorganic nitrogen ( nitrate and ammonia) in the Crocodile River ( South Africa). The model was calibrated and validated on the basis of independent data collected for four years (1987 - 1990). The results show that the model can adequately describe the seasonal dynamics of inorganic nitrogen in the Crocodile River. The sensitivity of the model output to the model inputs was also analysed, and the results indicate that the model is most sensitive to the microbial biomass (nitrifier) followed by hydraulic parameters. The relation of river flow versus concentration of inorganic nitrogen in the downstream section of the river was also examined in order to identify the main source and critical time for nitrate pollution.

A testable 3-D algal model for prediction of algal growth in turbulent surface waters was developed based on the Eulerian water quality model, HYDRO-3D. Out-door mesocosm experiments on the growth of the diatom Skeletonema costatum showed no evidence that diatom growth is significantly affected by light/dark fluctuations brought about by turbulent mixing, and no direct effects of turbulence on phytoplankton physiology were required in the algal model. The algal model was successfully calibrated and validated against mesocosm data and field data from Poplar Dock, London Docklands. Application of the model gave credible results for the hypothetical growth of S. costatum in Poplar Dock under a wide range of wind speeds and surface irradiances. However, differences between the results of a full 3-D simulation and a simplified I-D representation of Poplar Dock were minimal, and no clear conclusions could be drawn on the superiority of 3-D models over I-D models for simulation of complex flows in natural water bodies.

J	Panno, SV; Kelly, WR				Panno, SV; Kelly, WR			Nitrate and herbicide loading in two groundwater basins of Illinois' sinkhole plain	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						karst; agriculture; nitrate; pesticides; Illinois	CHROMATOGRAPHY MASS-SPECTROMETRY; WATER-QUALITY; NITROGEN; ATRAZINE	This investigation was designed to estimate the mass loading of nitrate (NO3-) and herbicides in spring water discharging from groundwater basins in an agriculturally dominated, mantled karst terrain. The loading was normalized to land use and NO3- and herbicide losses were compared to estimated losses in other agricultural areas of the Midwestern USA. Our study area consisted of two large karst springs that drain two adjoining groundwater basins (total area of 37.7 km(2)) in southwestern Illinois' sinkhole plain. USA. The springs and stream that they form were monitored for almost 2 years. Nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations at three monitoring sites were almost always above the background concentration (1.9 mg/l). NO3-N concentrations at the two springs ranged from 1.08 to 6.08 with a median concentration of 3.61 mg/l. Atrazine and alachlor concentrations ranged from <0.01 to 34 &mu;g/l and <0.01 to 0.98 mug/l, respectively, with median concentrations of 0.48 and 0.12 mug/l. respectively. Approximately 100,000 kg/yr of NO3-N, 39 kg/yr of atrazine, and 2.8 kg/yr of alachlor were discharged from the two springs. Slightly more than half of the discharged NO3- came from background sources and most of the 3 remainder probably came from fertilizer. This represents a 21-31% loss of fertilizer N from the groundwater basins. The pesticide losses were 3.8-5.8% of the applied atrazine, and 0.05-0.08% of the applied alachlor. The loss of atrazine adsorbed to the suspended solid fraction was about 2 k-/yr, only about 5% of the total mass of atrazine discharged from the springs. (C) 2004, Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	McIntyre, NR; Wheater, HS				McIntyre, NR; Wheater, HS			Calibration of an in-river phosphorus model: prior evaluation of data needs and model uncertainty	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY			English	Article						calibration; Monte Carlo phosphorus; model; data error	WATER-QUALITY; TRANSPORT; SEDIMENT	A simulation model of in-stream phosphorus mobilisation and transport, developed to predict monthly total phosphorus export from the upper Hun River (northeast China), is described. To evaluate alternative programmes for collection of in-river calibration data, a set of a priori computational experiments are devised. Initially, assuming that the model and boundary condition data are error-free, daily in-river phosphorus concentration data are synthesised, representing an idealised system response. Scenarios of error in the calibration and boundary condition data, and in the system conceptualisation are then imposed, as a hypothetical representation of the conditions under which the model will actually be calibrated and evaluated. The model is calibrated under the various conditions of error, and its predictive reliability is tested using an independent idealised data set. These controlled experiments allow evaluation of sampling programme design, of other controls on model reliability, and of needs for additional a priori investigations. The results indicate that the value of the calibration data is seriously compromised by the presence of error in the pollution load data, error in the model structure, and inherent parameter equifinality. While these controls are not generally very detrimental to model reliability under calibration conditions, in some cases they cause serious misrepresentation of forecasted phosphorus export. For the case study, it is concluded that the resources for monitoring need to be increased in order to achieve the sought modelling capability. In light of the limited resources, expectations of model performance should be reviewed, and a more robust approach to model uncertainty estimation adopted. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the strong interactions between pedo-climatic conditions and management, decision support systems are useful tools for selecting the more effective BMPs. An integrated non-point source (NPS) model-GIS system was designed to evaluate the production and environmental effects of alternative criteria of BMPs in the Mincio River Basin (NE-Italy). It is based on an integration of the CropSyst model (version 3.02.21) with a high informational level GIS developed in the Arc/Info environment. Three alternative criteria were evaluated: (1) obtaining maximum irrigation efficiency; (2) obtaining maximum nitrogen (N) fertilisation efficiency; (3) obtaining combined maximum irrigation and N fertilisation efficiency. The hypothetical criteria were compared applying multicriteria analysis of concordance/discordance to a set of agro-environmental indicators. The latter were obtained from field-scale CropSyst applications in the study area in the period 1994-2000. Application of the system required a preliminary 2-year validation phase of CropSyst on 12 experimental sites in the Basin that are heterogeneous in terms of climate, soil and management. The multi-criteria analysis considered the actors currently involved in the management of the Basin area: the farmer, environmentalist and politician. This application demonstrated that water flow control, through irrigation rationalisation, is the critical point for reducing pollution in the area. This allowed crop yield to be improved with a contemporary reduction in irrigation depths (50%) and nitrogen leaching (more than 50%). Irrigation rationalisation represents the best compromise between the farmers' production and livestock waste disposal requirements and the environmentalists' desire for water saving and protection. The GIS-CropSyst integration considers the different pedo-climatic and crop combinations and represents a valid support for territorial management and planning. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In this context, we parameterized the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production and then evaluated it along with the CERES-Wheat model to assess their potential as N management tools at Akron, Co. Both models were evaluated with data from five N treatments (0, 28, 56, 84, and 112 kg N ha(-1)) and three crop seasons (1987-1988, 1988-1989, and 1989-1990). Data from 1987-1988 zero-N treatment were used for model calibration, and the rest of the data were used for model validation. Genetic coefficients for winter wheat (cv. TAM 107) were developed for the CERES-Wheat model. The crop parameters required for the generic crop model of RZWQM were parameterized using information from the literature or by calibration. Both models were calibrated first for soil moisture and then for biomass and grain yield. Grain yield predictions had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 500 and 363 kg ha(-1), respectively, for CERES-Wheat and RZWQM. Aboveground biomass was predicted with RMSEs of 1247 and 1441 kg ha(-1), respectively. Long-term simulations of both RZWQM and CERES for winter wheat growth using historical weather data (1912-2001) showed that 56 kg ha(-1) N applied as broadcast incorporated is a viable N management option in eastern Colorado, taking into account the grain yield, crop N uptake, N leaching into groundwater, and residual soil N at harvest. Model simulations also showed that the wheat-fallow cropping system is less water use efficient than a continuous wheat system under rainfed agriculture in eastern Colorado.

Drought and increased nitrate (NO3-) leaching from agricultural land lead to oxidation of iron-sulphide (FeSx) in the subsoil, resulting in increased sulphate (SO42-) concentrations in the groundwater. In addition, increased atmospheric sulphur (S) deposition and leaching of SO42- from agricultural land have increased SO42- concentrations in the groundwater. Attempts to retain groundwater in desiccated wetlands by simply damming drainage ditches have resulted in greatly increased retention times of the water, die-back of the original vegetation and massive development of algae and lemnids in summer. In order to determine whether stagnation of SO42--rich groundwater plays an important role in eutrophication, nine bottomless enclosures were placed in the sediment of an open water body to block the supply of groundwater. Na2SO4 was added to three enclosures twice a year to simulate a minimised input of SO42--rich groundwater. In addition NaCl was added to three enclosures, while three enclosures were left untreated. (Pore) water quality and vegetation development were compared with those at seepage-fed sites outside the enclosures. The results show that stagnating SO42--rich groundwater led to increased SO42- reduction in the sediment, resulting in phosphate (o-PO43-) mobilisation from the sediment and eutrophication of the water layer, due to the interference of S2- with the iron-phosphorous cycle. This was accompanied by massive growth of common duckweed (Lemna minor) and filamentous algae and a decreased growth of broad-leaved pondweed (Potamogeton natans). The consistently high input of SO(4)2- via seepage did not lead to eutrophication. The results indicated that SO42- reduction rates at sites fed by seepage were very low. This was probably caused by the consistently high input of Fe and NO3- via the groundwater, which prevents reduction of SO42- by providing energetically more favourable electron acceptors. In fens with stagnating groundwater, Fe and NO3- will be rapidly depleted, stimulating SO42- reduction resulting in development of toxic S2- concentrations and eutrophication of the water layer.

This cycling may contain important information regarding the ecosystem's functioning and, if property interpreted, can represent a valuable predictive tool in ecosystems management. This paper describes a simple algorithm for extracting meaningful information from daily cycles using fuzzy pattern recognition techniques. The algorithm is organised in three parts: in the first, typical patterns are extracted front experimental data to form the knowledge-base upon which the algorithm operates. The second step is to condense the information contained in the knowledge-base into mathematical objects, referred to in the paper as fuzzy masks. The third step is the Set-Lip of an inferential set of fuzzy rules, using the fuzzy masks as antecedents. Depending on how the inference engine is structured, the algorithm Output can be viewed as an assessment of the current daily cycle with respect to a set of "typical" system behaviours and decisions can be made accordingly. Two applications are presented to demonstrate the algorithm. In the first a medium-scale wastewater treatment plant with minimum instrumentation is considered. Based on diurnal flow variations of the last 2 days. the algorithm determines the current treatment level in terms of sludge recycling. The other application is the prediction of the eutrophication level in a coastal lagoon. In this case, the algorithm considers the diurnal fluctuations of basic water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen, oxidation-reduction potential, pH and temperature to detect the possibility of a macroalgae bloom. In both cases. the algrithm provides information about the shift of the system from one trend to another on the basis of the analysis of diurnal cycles. The algorithm performance is assessed against practical situations and the results discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Simulations over 2 years of small (area = 5 km(2)) and shallow (average depth = 9 m) Prospect Reservoir (1988-1990), and large (volume = 2 km 3, area = 82 km(2), length = 50 kin) and deep (maximum depth = 90 m) Lake Burragorang (1992-1994) were validated with field data. The dominant fate processes of the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles in the water column of these reservoirs were identified with model output. CAEDYM was then coupled to a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (ELCOM) to simulate a flood underflow through Lake Burragorang. Advective transport was the dominant mechanism that caused biogeochemical variations during the flood, though settling was important for riverine-derived particulates. Validation of ecological models with both one- and three-dimensional hydrodynamics drivers and across multiple aquatic settings is advocated as an additional approach to limit ranges of biogeochemical parameters and assess ecological representations of lacustrine systems.

The model considers growth with carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen balance, death and lysis of bacteria, and conversion of less biodegradable organic carbon to assimilable organic carbon. Experimental data from two raw and two treated waters were used to test the model. The model describes the increase of live and dead bacterial cells in the water phase, and its output closely matches the experimental data. Such a model has the ability to characterize water nutrient status as well as to predict behavior of indigenous heterotrophic bacteria. The ability to predict bacterial population dynamics with respect to nutrients is beneficial for water treatment optimization. The model, based on microbiological measurements, helps to characterize treated water quality and project performance in terms of water quality into a distribution system.

J	Chung, JB; Kim, SH; Jeong, BR; Lee, YD				Chung, JB; Kim, SH; Jeong, BR; Lee, YD			Removal of organic matter and nitrogen from river water in a model floodplain	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							NITRATE DEPLETION; DENITRIFICATION; AQUIFER; INFILTRATION; GROUNDWATER; SOIL; SWITZERLAND; TRANSPORT; EXCHANGE; OXYGEN	A significant improvement in river water quality cannot be expected unless nonpoint-source contaminants are treated in addition to the further treatment of point-source contaminants. If river water is sprayed over a floodplain, the consequent water filtration through the sediment profile can simultaneously remove organic matter and nitrogen in the water through aerobic and denitrifying reactions. This hypothesis was tested using lysimeters constructed from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe (150 cm long, 15 cm in diameter) packed with loamy sand floodplain sediment. Water was applied to the top of the lysimeters at three different flow rates (48, 54, and 68 mm d(-1)). Concentrations of NO3 and dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and redox potential (Eh) in the water were measured as functions of depth after the system reached steady states for both water flow and reactions. At the rate of 68.0 mm d(-1), a reducing condition for denitrification developed below the 5-cm depth due to the depletion of 02 by organic matter degradation in the surface oxidizing layer; Eh and DO were below 205 mV and 0.4 mg L-1, respectively. At a depth of 70 cm, COD and NO3-N concentration decreased to 5.2 and 3.8 mg L-1 from the respective influent concentrations of 17.1 and 6.2 mg L-1. Most biodegradable organic matter was removed during flow and further removal of NO3 was limited by the lack of an electron donor (i.e., organic matter). These results indicate that the floodplain filtration technique has great promise for treatment of contaminated river water.

Devising acceptable and feasible changes in manure practices requires a full understanding of the forces shaping current manure management decisions. Previous theoretical models have shown that a wide range of factors influence the lowest cost solution for manure management. We used a mechanistic model to characterize the manure management practices on 39 swine operations (20 unagitated lagoon and 19 slurry operations) in five states (Iowa, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania). Information was collected from each operation about animal numbers, feed and water use, manure handling and storage characteristics, field locations, crop rotation, fertilizer need, and equipment inventory and usage. Collected data were used as input and to validate results from a mechanistic model that determined acres required for manure application, manure application rate, time required for manure application, value of manure, and costs of manure management. The 39 farms had a mean of 984 animal units (AU) per operation, 18.2 AU ha(-1) (7.4 AU acre(-1)), and manure application costs of $10.49 AU(-1) yr(-1). Significant factors affecting manure management included operation size, manure handling system, state, and ownership structure. Larger operations had lower manure management costs (r(2) = 0.32). Manure value potentially exceeded manure application costs on 58% of slurry and 15% of lagoon operations. But 38% of slurry operations needed to apply manure off the farm whereas all lagoon operations had sufficient land for N-based manure management. Manure management was a higher percentage of gross income on contract operations compared with independents (P < 0.01). This research emphasized the importance of site-specific factors affecting manure management decisions and the economics of U.S. swine operations.

Previous research established that P limits increase land needs for animal feeding operations. We evaluated the effect of N, annual P, and rotation P limits on the feasibility of manure management. A mechanistic model characterized manure management practices on 39 swine operations (20 unagitated lagoon and 19 slurry operations) in five states (Iowa, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania). Extensive information collected from each operation was used to determine effects of manure storage type, ownership structure, and application limits on attributes of manure management. Phosphorus limits had substantially greater effect on slurry operations, increasing land needs 250% (0.3 hectares per animal unit [AU]) and time for manure application 24% (2.5 min AU(-1)) for rotation P limits and 41% (4.4 min AU(-1)) for annual P limits. Annual P limits were infeasible for current land application equipment on two operations and had the greatest effect on time and costs because they required all but three slurry operations to reduce discharge rate. We recommend implementing rotation P limits (not to exceed crop N need) to minimize time effects, allow most farmers to use their current manure application methods, and allow manure to fulfill crop N and P needs in the year of application. Phosphorus limits increased potential manure value but would require slurry operations to recover at least 61% of manure value through manure sales. Phosphorus limits are likely to shape the U.S. swine industry through differential effects on the various sectors of the swine industry.

The models are applied to assess interventions for improving the quality of river flows diverted for irrigation along a 190-km segment of the South Platte River in Colorado. Eleven different pollution control strategies are considered, alone and in combination. Statistics of total dissolved solids (TDS), dissolved nitrogen (N) species, and fecal coliform concentrations are modeled, along with associated probabilities of violation of recommended criteria and the spatial and temporal uniformity of these probabilities. Over a 25-year horizon, for example, combined pollution control measures are predicted to achieve average reductions from 27 to 36% and from 31 to 39% in mean concentrations of TDS and N, respectively, for the 11 irrigation diversions located along the 53-km stretch just downstream of Denver. Uncertainty in predicted concentrations, as measured by the coefficient of variation, is considerable.

J	Chang, HJ				Chang, HJ			Water quality impacts of climate and land use changes in southeastern Pennsylvania	PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Conference of the Association-of-American-Geographers	MAR, 2003	NEW ORLEANS, LA	Assoc Amer Geographers		precipitation; urbanization; water quality; GIS	RIVER-BASIN; STREAM-FLOW; VALIDATION; SURFACE; FOREST; URBAN	This study investigates potential changes in nitrogen and phosphorus loads under a warmer and wetter climate, urban growth, and combined changes in the Conestoga River Basin and its five subbasins in southeastern Pennsylvania. A GIS-based hydrochemical model was employed for assessing the sensitivity of the basins to the projected changes in 2030. Under the HadCM2 climate change scenario, mean annual nitrogen and phosphorus loads are expected to increase, with great increases in spring but slight decreases in fall primarily because of changes in monthly precipitation. When climate change and urbanization occur concurrently, mean annual nitrogen loads further increase by 50% in the most urbanizing subbasin. Point source nitrogen control could mitigate negative effects of climate and land use changes, reducing mean annual nitrogen loads to the contemporary baseline level.

J	Van Der Lee, GEM; Venterink, HO; Asselman, NEM				Van Der Lee, GEM; Venterink, HO; Asselman, NEM			Nutrient retention in floodplains of the Rhine distributaries in The Netherlands	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						nutrient retention; floodplain; denitrification; sedimentation; plant uptake; nutrient load; water quality	FRESH-WATER; RIVER; DENITRIFICATION; SEDIMENTATION	Denitrification, plant uptake and sedimentation are important mechanisms of nutrient retention in floodplains. Due to nutrient retention, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loads of the river decrease, which is a primary aim in European water quality management. However, the relative contribution of the various retention mechanisms to nutrient retention is largely unknown, as is the total retention that may be achieved. The aim of this study was the estimation of nutrient retention by the mechanisms of plant uptake, silt sedimentation and denitrification for the Dutch Rhine distributaries over one hydrological year (April 2000-March 2001). N and P retention in these floodplain stretches were estimated by means of measured process rates in the floodplains and one-dimensional hydrodynamic and sedimentation models. Estimated total retention of N (all mechanisms together) is less than 3% of the annual load, which can be considered as insignificant. The total retention of P was 5 to 18% of the annual P load, which is significant. Floodplain sedimentation was the most important retention mechanism for both N and P. As excavation of the floodplain is expected to increase annual sedimentation rates, floodplain lowering as carried out in river restoration projects, may lead to a considerable increase in retention of P, but will hardly affect retention of N, because N was mainly present as dissolved nitrate in the river water.

J	Bakhsh, A; Kanwar, RS				Bakhsh, A; Kanwar, RS			Using discriminant analysis and GIS to delineate subsurface drainage patterns	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						cluster analysis; map overlay; soil attributes; topographic attributes	YIELD VARIABILITY; WATER-QUALITY; SOIL; CORN; CLUSTER; NITROGEN; NITRATE; MODELS; SYSTEM	The contamination of soil and water resources from nutrients, transported in subsurface drainage water having different drainage patterns, has important repercussions on the ecological environment and human health. This study was designed to delineate subsurface drainage patterns using cluster analysis based on six years (1993 to 1998) of field measured data on subsurface drainage flows from thirty-six 0.4 ha field experimental plots. These drainage patterns then were related spatially to the soil and topographic attributes using discriminant analysis and the map overlay capability of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to develop cause-effect relationships. The experimental field plots, under various tillage and nitrogen management treatments, were located on glacial till derived soils at Iowa State University's Northeastern Research Center near Nashua, Iowa. The field-measured subsurface drainage volumes were normalized to make comparisons over all plots and years, and the normalized data were used in the subsequent statistical and GIS analyses. After performing cluster analysis,;he output was generated as GIS data layers showing low, medium, and high drainage areas. Stepwise discriminant analysis identified elevation, slope, and average normalized yield as the factors contributing significantly (P < 0.10) to the formation of subsurface drainage zones. GIS data layers of the factors, identified during discriminant analysis, were overlaid on the drainage patterns to study the spatial relationships. Map overlay analysis showed that high drainage areas were consistently found at low elevation levels in the vicinity of Floyd soils over the 6-year study period. The combined use of discriminant analysis and GIS was found to be effective in delineating subsurface drainage zones so that appropriate management practices can be applied to mitigate the environmental effects resulting from medium and higher subsurface drainage effluents.

Predicting N export to streams is a critical goal of nonpoint-source modeling. This study was conducted to assess the effect of terrestrial N cycling on stream N export using long-term monitoring data from Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF) in New Hampshire. The field scale DAYCENT model was used to quantify N pools and long-term annual streamflow and mineral N export for six subwatersheds at the HBEF By combining DAYCENT with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) watershed model, mineral N export simulations were extended to the watershed scale. Our study indicated that only 13% of external N input was exported to streams during 1951-2000 at HBEF As much as 4763 kg/ha of N was stored in forest litter, soil organic matter (SOM), and living plant biomass. Net N mineralization of SOM and forest litter contributed 93% of total available N for export within the HBEF ecosystem. The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (E-ns) evaluating model performance of DAYCENT at six subwatersheds ranged from 0.72 to 0.82 for simulating annual streamflow (1964-2000) and from 0.48 to 0.67 for annual mineral N export (1971-1995), indicating reasonable simulated values. DAYCENT successfully predicted the effect of ecosystem disturbance such as forest cut and insect invasion on stream mineral N export. The watershed-scale simulation suggested that soil spatial variability affects stream N export in addition to the accepted controls of land cover, external N input, climate, and ecosystem disturbance.

J	Shah, SB; Miller, JL; Basden, TJ				Shah, SB; Miller, JL; Basden, TJ			Mechanical aeration and liquid dairy manure application impacts on grassland runoff water quality and yield	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						aerator; nitrogen; phosphorus; simulated rainfall; total suspended solids	PASTURE	The runoff water quality and agronomic impacts of mechanical aeration and liquid dairy manure (LDM) application to grassland (orchard grass with 10% to 20% alfalfa) were evaluated in two blocks. Simulated rainfall-generated runoff was collected six times from block A, and natural runoff was collected from block B once. Runoff samples were analyzed for nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N), ammoniacal-N, total Kjeldahl N (TKN), dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), total P and total suspended solids (TSS). The four treatments applied to the plots were control (CTL, no aeration and no LDM), aeration (AER), LDM application but no aeration (MAN), and aeration plus LDM application (AER+MAN). The plots were harvested three times, and crop yields and crop nutrient (N-P-K) contents were determined. Aeration impact on soil impedance was evaluated with a penetrometer In one simulated event, AER+MAN significantly reduced runoff, while the other treatments were comparable. Nutrient concentrations in simulated runoff increased with LDM application but were unaffected by aeration. Aeration reduced nutrient loadings of three or more species (not TKN)from manured plots in two of six simulated runoff events but not from non-manured plots. Aeration of manured plots was more effective in reducing DRP losses than other nutrient species. Mean total loadings of all nutrient species in simulated runoff were reduced greater than or equal to26% by AER+MAN vs. MAN. While aeration significantly increased TSS concentrations in simulated runoff, LDM application did not. In one of six simulated events, AER had the highest TSS loadings, while AER+MAN had the lowest, with the two other treatments in between. No treatment effects were observed with natural runoff for any constituent. The MAN treatment significantly increased forage yield in two harvests vs. CTL and AER and in one harvest vs. AER+MAN. Compared with MAN, total forage yields with CTL, AER, and AER+MAN were 78%, 67%, and 81%, respectively. Aeration reduced soil impedance and could improve root penetration in compacted soils.

J	Perschbacher, PW; Ludwig, GM				Perschbacher, PW; Ludwig, GM			Effects of diuron and other aerially applied cotton herbicides and defoliants on the plankton communities of aquaculture ponds	AQUACULTURE			English	Article						diuron; cotton herbicides/defoliants; water quality	ATRAZINE	Seven aerially applied cotton herbicides and defoliants were tested for possible adverse impacts on pond phytoplankton and zooplankton and critical water quality variables. Treatments simulated direct spraying of ponds and high and low amounts of drift judged able to reach the pond, 1/10 and 1/100 direct rates, respectively. The study was conducted in twelve 500-1 outdoor pool mesocosms filled with pond water from an adjacent goldfish Carassius auratus culture pond. Plankton and water quality samples were taken just prior to application and at 24 and 48 h after application. Sampling for chemicals showing effects were continued approximately weekly until oxygen levels in drift treatments returned to no significant difference from control. Chemicals tested and direct rates (kg active ingredient ha(-1)) were diuron as herbicide (1.4), paraquat (0.83), quizalofop (0.05), dimethipin (0.15), diuron as defoliant (0.1675), ethephon (0.176), tribufos (0.99) and sodium chlorate (5.28). Except for the diuron compounds, the cotton herbicides and defoliants produced no measurable impacts on pond plankton or associated water quality. Following application on March 5 of diuron, used as an herbicide, chlorophyll a levels and photosynthesis were significantly depressed in relation to diuron concentration. Recovery occurred slowly, and at the high drift dosage by week 3 morning oxygen levels returned to near control levels, although chlorophyll a levels were 1/3 the control. However, the off-flavor cyanobacterium, Anabaena laevendri, was essentially eliminated by week 3; and pH and thus unionized ammonia were much lower in high drift treatments. Copepod adult and nauplii zooplankton levels were depressed at week 2. However, rotifer numbers increased in the low drift treatment in weeks 3 and 4 and those of copepod nauplii in week 3. Fall application of diuron, as a defoliant at 1/10 the spring rate, produced similar effects when compared by concentration. The main adverse impact of diuron drift is on dissolved oxygen levels and can be anticipated by provision of adequate aeration capacity. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Stable isotope signatures of epiphytes on polyethylene mesh substrate, AquaMats(TM) and tank walls were compared with shrimp signatures. Two methods were used: the determination of carbon and nitrogen natural abundance ratios; and N-15-nitrogen enrichment ratios after the addition of N-15-ammonium to tanks. Using the natural abundance technique and a simple mixing model, epiphytes were found to contribute substantially to the carbon requirements of post-larval shrimp (39-53%). This was despite the addition of formulated feed at satiation levels. There was no indication of a reduced contribution of carbon from epiphytes to shrimp nutrition at higher shrimp densities. The lack of a difference in the N-15/N-14 ratios of the two food sources meant that mixing models could not be used to calculate the contribution of nitrogen from epiphytes vs. artificial feed to shrimp nutrition. Using the N-15-nitrogenenrichment method, the amount of nitrogen contributed by epiphytes to shrimp nutrition over 24 h could be determined. This method showed that nitrogen from epiphytes was assimilated by shrimp. N-15-enrichment methods provided a more accurate alternative to natural abundance techniques, particularly when the stable isotope signals ofthe food sources are similar. This experiment hasshown the benefits in providing substrates for P.esculentus in high-density rearing systems to provide an additional food source for shrimp.

The sediments in the river are highly polluted due to inputs from upstream tributaries as well as partially treated municipal wastewaters that are discharged to the river. The water quality and strategy for control are important because the river is the primary drinking water supply for the City of Seoul, as well as being a major source for irrigation and industrial water. The Jamsil submerged dam partitions the river to isolate an upstream area for drinking water, but also captures sediments. Samples from four sites were studied to determine sediment pollutant concentrations and phosphorus release rates. Phosphorus tends to desorb from sediments when the concentration of overlying water is less than 1.4 mg/l. Water column P concentrations range from 0.04 to 0.1 mg/l, which suggests that sediments will act as a P source. In a series of batch experiments, P was released at approximately 15-20 mg/m(2) week in the winter (1-5 degreesC) and as much as 90 mg/m(2) week in the summer (20-24 degreesC), and is also a function of pH and dissolved oxygen concentration. The sediment total phosphorus concentration, which averages 833 mg/kg, is evenly distributed among non-apatite-P (33%), apatite-P (32%) and residual-P (34%). An equilibrium model is proposed to describe release rate. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In 1997 a month-long diversion of the Mississippi River filled the Lake with highly concentrated river water (80 muM nitrate) and lowered the salinity to 0 psu within 2 weeks. After the spillway was closed the Lake mixed with estuarine tidal waters and came to equilibrium over 4 months with the riverine, atmospheric and offshore water nitrogen sources. A flushing rate of 1.78% d(-1) was estimated by analyzing a plot of In salinity versus time for the first 120 days after the diversion ceased. This flushing rate was similar to the loss rate for total nitrogen (1.75% d(-1)), implying no significant net nitrogen losses or gains were occurring inside the Lake. The percent loss of dissolved inorganic nitrogen was higher than that for TN (4.11% d(-1)), whereas the loss of organic nitrogen was lower (0.94% d(-1)), which suggests a net transfer from inorganic to organic nitrogen. These changes occurred steadily as chlorophyll a concentration ranged from 5 to 200 mug l(-1). The results demonstrate the potential significance of the organic nitrogen and interconversion of nitrogen forms when calculating estuarine nitrogen retention budgets and the necessity of measuring all nitrogen forms when performing mass balance estimates. The significance of denitrification in nitrogen removal is minimal at the high loading rates observed during this study. An implication to estuarine water quality management is that the relationships between nitrogen loading and retention are not linear and are controlled by factors other than water residence time.

J	Townsend, PA; Eshleman, KN; Welcker, C				Townsend, PA; Eshleman, KN; Welcker, C			Remote sensing of gypsy moth defoliation to assess variations in stream nitrogen concentrations	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Appalachian Mountains; change vector analysis; defoliation; forest disturbance; gypsy moth; Landsat; nitrate; nitrogen; remote sensing; water quality; watershed	CHANGE-VECTOR ANALYSIS; EASTERN UNITED-STATES; THEMATIC MAPPER DATA; LAND-COVER CHANGE; ACID-BASE STATUS; INSECT DEFOLIATION; FORESTED WATERSHEDS; MULTITEMPORAL SPACE; EXPORT; DISTURBANCE	Disturbance is an important mechanism controlling dissolved nitrogen (N) leakage to receiving streams, rivers, lakes, and estuaries from forested watersheds. In oak forests of the eastern United States, defoliation by the gypsy moth caterpillar represents a recurring disturbance regime that can impact water quality. Following an upsurge in gypsy moth activity in the mid-Appalachian region in 2000-2001, we examined the relationship between defoliation and N export within the Fifteenmile Creek watershed in Maryland and Pennsylvania using intensive stream surveys and remotely sensed imagery. Concentrations of dissolved N species were determined six times during seasonal baseflow and once during stormflow conditions at the outlet of 35 randomly selected sub-watersheds between April 2001 and June 2002. Summer Landsat images were used to characterize forest disturbance within each of the sub-watersheds in 1999, 2000, and 2001. Quantitative differences in imagery between the defoliation years of 2000 and 2001 (and 1999, a non-defoliation year) derived from change vector analysis provided indices of forest change. Dissolved N concentrations in the 35 reaches were dominated by nitrate-N (average 61%, ranging 19-89% of total dissolved nitrogen), although dissolved organic nitrogen was present at measurable levels (0.03-0.16 mg/L). Percent non-forested land cover accounted for only 8-33% of the spatial variation in nitrate-N concentrations, while multivariate models that also included change vector statistics from satellite imagery (magnitude and angular direction of image change) accounted for 72-80% of the spatial variation in nitrate-N concentrations. Measurements of defoliation during both the current and (when appropriate) previous year were statistically significant and indicated the importance of defoliation for increasing N inputs to the system at unseasonably high rates as a consequence of the deposition of caterpillar frass: Jackknifed residuals. were within 25% of the actual measurements, indicating that remote sensing models could be used to predict variations in N concentrations for ungauged watersheds in the region. Our results provide more evidence that the remote sensing approach is a valuable component in predicting spatially varying relationships between ecosystem status and water quality conditions at the regional scale, thereby allowing assessments of watershed disturbances as part of land management.

Tests using environmental indicators beyond those that affect human health have been less supportive of the EKC idea. We hypothesize that environmental changes impacting human health are more likely to show evidence of an EKC than variables less directly related to human health. Furthermore, the EKC hypothesis assumes that ecological damage is reversible, and we argue that this assumption is not always valid. We test for evidence of an EKC in Dane County, Wisconsin, using non-point-source pollution time series data for Lake Mendota throughout the 20th century. We examine metals deposited in lake sediments (cadmium, chromium, copper, and lead), other non-point-source pollutants such as sulfur and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), and water clarity (measured by Secchi disk depth). We relate changes in ecological variables to changes in real wealth per capita (RWPC) in Dane County over time. The EKC did not describe the relationship between all ecological and economic indicators tested; however, several variables were related to RWPC. Our strongest results (for Secchi depth, DRP, and copper) show increasing pollution with increasing wealth. Secchi depth and DRP are related to water quality and clarity, which have value to society but less direct, immediate health consequences. P pollution may also be fairly irreversible over short time scales. The best models and plots for cadmium, chromium, and lead suggest improvements in environmental quality with increases in RWPC, although these trends were not statistically significant. Results for sulfur were inconclusive. Overall, wealth did not explain much of the Variability in any of the ecological variables examined here, suggesting that consideration of additional factors are necessary to explain their dynamics. Economic prosperity cannot be expected to improve all aspects of the environment, but may be biased toward aspects that are ecologically reversible phenomena or of concern to human health.

Measurements were made in the Seine River downstream of a combined sewer overflow (CSO) to identify the relevant variables describing the evolution of water quality. The combined effects of various processes influencing oxygen depletion after a rain event were analysed given all the available data. A complete oxygen balance was established to rank the relative importance of the processes. The model PROSE used for these tasks was designed in the framework of a long term multidisciplinary research program devoted to the Seine River catchment. A comparison of the model we used with existing models was done. The conceptual model was especially adapted for this highly impacted urban ecosystem. Apart from usual processes considered in river ecological modelling, sedimentation and erosion of particles, a biologically active and mobile benthic boundary layer (BBL), exchange of particles and diffusion of solutes between this BBL and the water column, detailed descriptions of algal and bacteria physiology were taken into account. To explain the oxygen depletion in the river, the more relevant variables appear to be the quantity of bacteria brought by the overflow and the biodegradable dissolved organic carbon concentrations. Specific contribution to the evolution of water quality of the river of particles that are sedimenting, was investigated, including the micro organisms brought by the overflows. For this highly eutrophicated river, the influence of the reduction of photosynthesis activity due to cloud cover was quantified. The influence of the toxicity of the CSO on the phytoplanktonic photosynthesis was studied experimentally and taken into account in the model. The resulting effect is a delayed oxygen depletion inside the plume of polluted water. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All fights reserved.

The graphical structure explicitly represents cause-and-effect assumptions that allow a complex causal chain linking actions to outcomes to be factored into an articulated series of conditional relationships. Each of these relationships can then be independently quantified using a submodel suitable for the type and scale of information available. This approach is particularly useful for ecological modelling because predictable patterns may emerge at a variety of scales, necessitating a multiplicity of model forms. As an example, we describe a Bayesian network integrating models of the various processes involved in eutrophication in the Neuse River estuary, North Carolina. These models were developed using a range of methods, including: process-based models statistically fit to long-term monitoring data, Bayesian hierarchical modelling of cross-system data gathered from the literature, multivariate regression modelling of mesocosm experiments, and judgements elicited from scientific experts. The ability of the network to accommodate such a diversity of methods allowed for the prediction of policy-relevant ecosystem attributes not normally included in models of eutrophication. All of the submodels in the network include estimates of predictive uncertainty in the form of probability distributions which are propagated to model endpoints. Predictions expressed as probabilities give stakeholders and decision-makers a realistic appraisal of the chances of achieving desired outcomes under alternative nutrient management strategies. In general, the further down the causal chain a variable was, the greater the predictive uncertainty. This suggests that a compromise is necessary between policy relevance and predictive precision, and that, to select defensible environmental management strategies, public officials must adopt decision-making methods that deal explicitly with scientific uncertainty.

J	Perry, W				Perry, W			Elements of South Florida's Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan	ECOTOXICOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	22nd Annual Meeting of the Society-of-Environmental-Toxicology-and-Chemistry	NOV 11-15, 2001	BALTIMORE, MARYLAND	Soc Environm Toxicol & Chem		Everglades; ecosystem; restoration contaminants		Approximately 70% less water flows through the Everglades ecosystem today compared with the historic Everglades, and the quality of the remaining water is often degraded. The regionally managed hydropattern does not follow the pre-drainage distribution, timing, and duration of the natural Everglades, nor can water move freely though the remaining Everglades. As a result, there have been significant reductions in wildlife and fish populations, their habitat, and the environmental services wetlands provide society. Both the problems of declining ecosystem health and the solutions to Everglades restoration center on restoring the quantity, quality, timing, and distribution of water. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan consists of over 60 civil works projects that will be designed and implemented over a 30 year period. At an estimated cost of $7.8 billion, it seeks to correct an earlier attempt at water management in South Florida and improve water availability during the dry season and reduce flooding of urban and agricultural areas during the wet season. The plan calls for storage and controlled release from more than 217,000 acres of new reservoirs and wetland-based treatment areas and from over 300 underground aquifer storage and recovery wells. The plans assumes that during retention in stormwater treatment areas, the excess phosphorus, nitrogen, agrichemicals such as atrazine, diazinon, endosulfan, and other contaminants will be reduced before release into the natural areas. It also assumes that little or no change in water quality will occur during underground storage. To improve the hydraulic connectivity of natural areas, some of the extensive system of levees and canals within the Everglades will be removed in an effort to improve overland water flow. Most of the current planning has focused on water storage and restoring basic hydrology in the remnant natural areas and on phosphorus removal as a benchmark of water quality. The restoration plan, as approved by Congress, is conceptual and most of the details, including potential impacts of the plan on the natural system and the role of contaminants remain to be evaluated.

J	Karadurmus, E; Berber, R				Karadurmus, E; Berber, R			Dynamic simulation and parameter estimation in river streams	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						mathematical modelling in river streams; dynamic simulation; nonlinear parameter estimation	WATER-QUALITY MODELS; UNCERTAINTY	Predictions and quality management issues for environmental protection in river basins rely on water-quality models. The key step in model calibration and verification is obtaining the right values of the model parameters. Current practice in model calibration is such that the reaction coefficients are adjusted by trial-and-error until the predicted values and measured data are within a pre-selected margin of error, and this may be a very time consuming task. This study is directed towards developing a parameter estimation strategy coupled with the simulation of water quality models so that the heavy burden of finding reaction rate coefficients is overcome. Dynamic mass balances for different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus, biological oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, coliforms, nonconservative constituent and algae were written for a single computational element. The model parameters conforming to those in QUAL2E water quality model were estimated by a nonlinear multi-response parameter estimation strategy coupled with a stiff integrator. Yesihrmak river basin around the city of Amasya in Turkey served as the prototype system for the model development. Samples were collected simultaneously from two stations, and concentrations of many water-quality constituents were determined either on-site or in laboratory. This dynamic data was then used for numerical parameter estimation during computer simulation. When the model was simulated with the estimated parameters, it was seen that the model was quite able to predict the dynamics of major water quality constituents. It is concluded that the proposed method shows promise for automatically generating reliable estimates of model parameters.

The first approach is based on weighted averaging of species indicator values with the underlying assumption that species have symmetrical unimodal distributions along the nutrient gradient, and their distributions are sufficiently described by a single indicator value per species. The second approach uses multiple indicator values for individual taxa and is based on the possibility that species have complex asymmetrical response curves. Multiple indicator values represent relative probabilities that a species would be found within certain ranges of nutrient concentration. We used 155 benthic diatom samples collected from rivers in the Northern Piedmont ecoregion (Northeastern U. S. A.) to construct two datasets: one used for developing models and indices, and another for testing them. To characterize the shape of species response curves we analyzed changes in the relative abundance of 118 diatom taxa common in this dataset along the total phosphorus (TP) gradient by fitting parametric and non-parametric regression models. We found that only 34 diatoms had symmetrical unimodal response to TP. Among several indices that use a single indicator value for each species, the best was the weighted averaging partial least square (WA-PLS) inference model. The correlation coefficient between observed and inferred TP in the test dataset was 0.67. The best index that employed multiple indicator values for each species had approximately the same predictive power as the WA-PLS based index, but in addition, this index provided a sample-specific measure of uncertainty for the TP estimation.

Nitrogen leaching	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES			English	Article						nitrogen; diffuse pollution; agriculture; leaching; land use; model; national; catchment	WATER-QUALITY; SOIL-NITROGEN; NITRATE; LOSSES; UK	The Nitrogen Risk Assessment Model for Scotland (NIRAMS) has been developed for prediction of streamwater N concentrations draining from agricultural land in Scotland. The objective of the model is to predict N concentrations for ungauged catchments, to fill gaps in monitoring data and to provide guidance in relation to policy development. The model uses nationally available data sets of land use, soils, topography and meteorology and has been developed within a Geographic Information System (GIS). The model includes modules to calculate N inputs to the land. residual N remaining at the end of the growing season, weekly time-series of leached N and transport of N at the catchment scale. This paper presents the methodology for calculating N balances for different land uses and for predicting the time sequence of N leaching after the end of the growing season. Maps are presented of calculated residual N and N leaching for the whole of Scotland and the spatial variability in N leaching is discussed. The results demonstrate the high variability in N leaching across Scotland. The simulations suggest that, in the areas with greatest residual N, the losses of N are not directly proportional to the amount of residual N, because of their coincidence with lower rainfall. In the companion paper, the hydrological controls on N transport within NIRAMS are described, and results of the full model testing are presented.

A common theme is the provision of better information to decision makers. This study reports the trial of a prototype decision support system by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service and the Agricultural Research Service in the NRCS Harrison County Field Office in 1998. Observed data collected at the Deep Loess Research Station (DLRS) near Treynor, Iowa, were extrapolated using a modified GLEAMS field scale simulation model that included a nitrogen leaching component and a crop growth component. An accounting tool was used to convert crop yield estimates into crop budgets. A model interface was built to specify the climate, soil, and topography of the field, as well as the management scenarios for the alternative management systems. For the Deep Loess Hills area of Harrison County, a total of six soil and slope groups, with 66 total combinations of management practices forming management systems, were defined and simulated based on previously calibrated data from DLRS. A multiobjective decision support system, the Water Quality Decision Support System, or WQDSS, was used to examine the tradeoffs in a comprehensive set of variables affected by alternative management systems with farmers in Harrison County. The study concluded that a multiobjective decision support system should be developed to support conservation planning by the NRCS. Currently, a larger scale effort to improve water quality decision making is underway.

J	Dalzell, BJ; Gowda, PH; Mulla, DJ				Dalzell, BJ; Gowda, PH; Mulla, DJ			Modeling sediment and phosphorus losses in an agricultural watershed to meet TMDLs	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						water quality; TMDL; nonpoint source pollution; best management practices (BMPs); agriculture tillage	DEPTH; MINNESOTA; SYSTEMS	This paper studies the effectiveness of alternative farm management strategies at improving water quality to meet Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) in agricultural watersheds. A spatial process model was calibrated using monthly flow, sediment, and phosphorus (P) losses (1994 to 1996) from Sand Creek watershed in south-central Minnesota. Statistical evaluation of predicted and observed data gave r(2) coefficients of 0.75, 0.69, and 0.49 for flow (average 4.1 m(3)/s), sediment load (average 0.44 ton/ha), and phosphorus load (average 0.97 kg/ha), respectively. The calibrated model was used to evaluate the effects of conservation tillage, conversion of crop land to pasture, and changes in phosphorus fertilizer application rate on pollutant loads. TMDLs were developed for sediment and P losses based on existing water quality standards and guidelines. Observed annual sediment and P losses exceeded these TMDLs by 59 percent and 83 percent, respectively. A combination of increased conservation tillage, reduced application rates of phosphorus fertilizer, and conversion of crop land to pasture could reduce sediment and phosphorus loads by 23 percent and 20 percent of existing loads, respectively. These reductions are much less than needed to meet TMDLs, suggesting that control of sediment using buffer strips and control of point sources of phosphorus are needed for the remaining reductions.

Estimates of the regional dispersion patterns of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon were calculated using a three-dimensional mesoscale grid and compared to in situ experimental data. In the numerical simulations, the dispersion of different aquaculture wastes (dissolved nutrients, faecal matter and feed wastes) was evaluated by changing the rates of particles settling and their condition of release (continuous or periodical). Results of the simulations clearly showed that dissolved particles tend to spread rapidly and undergo rapid dilution depending on dominant wind and surface currents direction. In contrast, settling particles remain mainly confined in the fish farm area and readily sink. Predicted concentrations of wastes were low in both the water column and sediment compartments and never exceed the threshold of environmental crises. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Winsten, JR; Stokes, JR				Winsten, JR; Stokes, JR			The efficacy of controlling phosphorus loading: the case of management-intensive grazing	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						management-intensive grazing; nutrient management; phosphorus; stochastic dynamic programming; dairy farming		Consolidation in US agriculture has led to fewer, larger farms. In the case of dairy in the Northeastern US, higher concentrations of animals near large population centers pose water quality problems that can be attributed to excessive soil nutrient levels. While new environmental policies and regulations are being developed and implemented to help manage such problems, research to determine the efficacy of alternative dairy production systems is needed. The research reported in this paper makes use of stochastic dynamic programming to determine optimal stocking densities, milk production levels, and feed rations for a hypothetical dairy farm using management-intensive grazing. A key feature of the model is that financial disincentives are placed on excessive accumulation of phosphorus in the farm's soils. The results show that under optimal management the cost of reducing soil phosphorus to acceptable levels across all states of nature modeled is approximately $524 per hectare per year. The optimal farm management strategy is to rapidly reduce the size of the dairy herd (as opposed to feeding for a lower level of milk production per cow) until soil phosphorus levels are under control.

In this study, the runoff water quality impacts of three turkey litter application (4.5 Mg/ha) methods (broadcast, surface band, and incorporated band) were investigated. In the 8-d runoff study, treatments were applied to hydrologically isolated plots and runoff volumes were analyzed for pollutant concentrations over three runoff events (one natural, two simulated). In the natural runoff event, incorporated banding resulted in significantly reduced ammoniacal-nitrogen (N) and total phosphorus (P) concentrations as well as total suspended solids (TSS) loadings than the other treatments. In the second (first simulated) runoff event, dissolved reactive P (DRP) concentrations were significantly lower in runoff from the incorporated band versus broadcast treatment. No treatment effects were observed in the last (second simulated) runoff event probably due to depletion of nutrients from the effective zone of interaction due to the earlier runoff events. Overall, compared with broadcasting, incorporated banding reduced ammoniacal-N, DRP, and TSS loadings by 67%, 73%, and 53%, respectively. Hence, compared with broadcasting, incorporated banding reduced pollutant losses in runoff; however surface banding did not give any water quality, benefits.

Suspended sediment data for rivers were obtained from a United States-wide water quality database for 622 stations. Data for particulate nitrogen, suspended carbon, discharge, watershed area, land use, and population were also used. Stations were classified by United States Environmental Protection Agency ecoregions to assess relationships between terrestrial habitats and the quality and quantity of total suspended solids (TSS). Results indicate that nephelometric determinations of mean turbidity can be used to estimate mean suspended sediment values to within an order of magnitude (r(2) = 0.89). Water quality is often considered impaired above 80 mg TSS L-1, and 35% of the stations examined during this study had mean values exceeding this level. Forested systems had substantially lower TSS and somewhat higher carbon-to-nitrogen ratios of suspended materials. The correlation between TSS and discharge was moderately well described by an exponential relationship, with the power of the exponent indicating potential acute sediment events in rivers. Mean sediment values and power of the exponent varied significantly with ecoregion, but TSS values were also influenced by land use practices and geomorphological characteristics. Results confirm that, based on current water quality standards, excessive suspended solids impair numerous rivers in the United States.

J	Ortega, M; Velasco, J; Millan, A; Guerrero, C				Ortega, M; Velasco, J; Millan, A; Guerrero, C			An ecological integrity index for littoral wetlands in agricultural catchments of semiarid Mediterranean regions	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						assessment; land uses; landscape diversity; nonpoint-source pollution	LAND-USE; WATER-QUALITY; BIOTIC INTEGRITY; PHOSPHORUS CONCENTRATIONS; ENVIRONMENTAL-QUALITY; NORTH-CAROLINA; INDICATORS; SCALE; FRAMEWORK; NITROGEN	The main goal of the present study was to develop an ecological integrity index for littoral wetland management and conservation in semiarid Mediterranean areas that have been highly impacted by agriculture, including the selection of pressure and state indicators at landscape and wetlands scales that reflect the status, condition, and trends of wetlands ecosystems. We used a causality framework based on the relationship between pressure of anthropogenic activities and the ecological state of wetlands and their catchments, integrating environmental, biologic, economic, and social issues. From the application of 51 indicators in 7 littoral wetlands in the southeastern Iberian Peninsula, we selected 12 indicators (5 at catchment scale and 7 at wetland scale) to constitute the ecological integrity index proposed. The potential nitrogen export per area at catchment scale and the potential relative nitrogen export from the area surrounding the wetlands were the best pressure single predictors of state indicators with a causal relationship with environmental meaning. Wetlands in catchments with more agriculture had less ecological integrity than those in less impacted areas. A wide riparian zone in some wetlands acts as a buffer area, diminishing the effects of intensive agriculture. The index of ecological integrity developed here has a number of essential characteristics that make it a useful tool for ecosystem managers and decision-makers. The index can be used to (1) assess and control ecological integrity, (2) diagnose probable causes of ecological impairment, (3) establish criteria for protecting and restoring wetland ecosystems, and (4) integrate catchment management.

J	Soyupak, S; Chen, DG				Soyupak, S; Chen, DG			Fuzzy logic model to estimate seasonal pseudo steady state chlorophyll-a concentrations in reservoirs	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT			English	Article						fuzzy membership function; fuzzy rules; multiple linear regression; dam reservoir management; eutrophication	EUTROPHICATION	A fuzzy logic model is developed to estimate pseudo steady state chlorophyll-a concentrations in a very large and deep dam reservoir, namely Keban Dam Reservoir, which is also highly spatial and temporal variable. The estimation power of the developed fuzzy logic model was tested by comparing its performance with that from the classical multiple regression model. The data include chlorophyll-a concentrations in Keban lake as a response variable, as well as several water quality variables such as PO4 phosphorus, NO3 nitrogen, alkalinity, suspended solids concentration, pH, water temperature, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen concentration and Secchi depth as independent environmental variables. Because of the complex nature of the studied water body, as well as non-significant functional relationships among the water quality variables to the chlorophyll-a concentration, an initial analysis is conducted to select the most important variables that can be used in estimating the chlorophyll-a concentrations within the studied water body. Following the outcomes from this initial analysis, the fuzzy logic model is developed to estimate the chlorophyll-a concentrations and the advantages of this new model is demonstrated in model fitting over the traditional multiple regression method.

J	Rodvang, SJ; Mikalson, DM; Ryan, MC				Rodvang, SJ; Mikalson, DM; Ryan, MC			Changes in ground water quality in an irrigated area of southern Alberta	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							SHALLOW GROUNDWATER; HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY; NITRATE CONTAMINATION; RECHARGE; AQUIFER; FATE; FLOW; TILL; ISOTOPES; NITROGEN	Few studies have documented spatial and temporal variations in ground water quality in areas with high densities of animal farming operations (AFOs), or the long-term effects on surface-water quality. Changes in ground water quality were characterized in an irrigated area with a high density of AFOs in southern Alberta, Canada to evaluate the effect on ground water quality of manure application to fields. Fifty-five piezometers in the oxidized zone were sampled once or twice annually from 1995 to 2001, and temporal changes were analyzed using mixed model analysis. Average NO3--N increased significantly from 12.5 to 17.4 mg L-1 and average Cl- increased significantly from 19.4 to 34.4 mg L-1 in piezometers installed in an unconfined sand aquifer at locations receiving fertilizer and manure. Compared with these manured locations, nitrate and chloride concentrations were significantly lower in shallow aquifer water in areas of pasture or native range, and concentrations did not change significantly with time. Nitrate and chloride concentrations in shallow ground water in fine-textured manured locations did not change significantly. Ground water below about 6 m in till and fine lacustrine sediments contains O-18 signatures indicative of recharge under pre-irrigation or glacially influenced conditions, suggesting this ground water has a low vulnerability to agricultural contamination. Evaluations suggest that shallow ground water discharge Rill cause NO3--N and Cl- in the Oldman River to increase by factors of at least 4.3 and 1.3, respectively with more significant effects in smaller streams and under low-flow conditions.

We evaluated the effect of implementing the late spring nitrate test (LSNT) for corn (Zea mays L.) grown within a 400-ha, tile-drained subbasin in central Iowa. Surface water discharge and NO3 concentrations from the treated subbasin and two adjacent subbasins receiving primarily fall-applied, anhydrous ammonia were compared. In two of four years, the LSNT method significantly reduced N fertilizer applications compared with the farmers' standard practices. Average corn yield from LSNT fields and nonlimiting N fertilizer check strips was not significantly different. Autoregressive (AR) models using weekly time series in surface water NO3 concentration differences between the LSNT and control subbasins indicated no consistent significant differences during the pre-LSNT (1992-1996) period. However, by the second year (1998) of the treatment period (1997-2000), NO3 concentrations in surface water from the treated subbasin were significantly lower than the concentrations coming from both control basins. Annual average flow-weighted NO3 concentrations for the last two years (1999-2000) were 11.3 mg N L-1 for the LSNT and subbasin and 16.0 mg N L-1 for the control subbasins. Based on these values and the AR models, widespread adoption of the LSNT program for managing N fertilizer where fall N application is typically practiced could result in a greater than or equal to30% decrease for NO3 concentrations in surface water.

J	Vadas, PA; Kleinman, PJA; Sharpley, AN				Vadas, PA; Kleinman, PJA; Sharpley, AN			A simple method to predict dissolved phosphorus in runoff from surface-applied manures	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							RECEIVING SWINE MANURE; BROILER LITTER; WATER-QUALITY; FESCUE PLOTS; MANAGEMENT; RAINFALL; SOIL; TRANSPORT; NITROGEN; COMPOST	Computer models are a rapid, inexpensive way to identify agricultural areas with a high potential for P loss, but most models poorly simulate dissolved P release from surface-applied manures to runoff. We developed a simple approach to predict dissolved P release from manures based on observed trends in laboratory extraction of P in dairy, poultry, and swine manures with water over different water to manure ratios. The approach predicted well dissolved inorganic (R-2 = 0.70) and organic (R-2 = 0.73) P release from manures and composts for data from leaching experiments with simulated rainfall. However, it predicted poorly (R-2 = 0.18) dissolved inorganic P concentrations in runoff from soil boxes where dairy, poultry, and swine manures had been surface-applied and subjected to simulated rainfall. Multiplying predicted runoff P concentrations by the ratio of runoff to rainfall improved the relationship between measured and predicted runoff P concentrations, but runoff P was still overpredicted for dairy and swine manures. We attributed this overprediction to immediate infiltration of dissolved P in the freely draining water of dairy and swine manure slurries upon their application to soils. Further multiplying predicted runoff dissolved inorganic P concentrations by 0.35 for dairy and 0.60 for swine manures resulted in an accurate prediction of dissolved P in runoff (R-2 = 0.71). The ability of our relatively simple approach to predict dissolved inorganic P concentrations in runoff from surface-applied manures indicates its potential to improve water quality models, but field testing of the approach is necessary first.

The ecological state of the archipelago in front of Helsinki is affected by several factors. The effects of local point and scattered loads are mixed with the transboundary effects from neighbouring countries and atmospheric deposition. Municipal waste waters of 800 000 inhabitants of the capital area are released outside the archipelago into the open Gulf of Finland (GoF). In addition, river Vantaanjoki is transporting load originating from agriculture, industry and settlements of the drainage area to the shores of Helsinki. Toxic algal blooms and annoying filamentous algal mats have become a problem to the users of the coastal zone. A local nested 3D-hydrodynamic model with water quality and ecosystem modules was set up in the Helsinki sea area. The model gives us an opportunity to examine ecosystem processes in a simplified format. The whole Gulf of Finland is included into the calculation area with low resolution (5000 in) increasing in two steps towards the coastal area around Helsinki (1000 and 250-m resolution). The model calculates water flows, transport of nutrients and growth of two groups of phytoplankton and one group of littoral filamentous algae. For model validation, a measurement program was carried out (flows, nutrients, chlorophyll-a, littoral filamentous algal biomass). Two nutrient load reduction scenarios were analysed with the validated model. The first scenario describes planned improvements in the efficiency of Helsinki municipal wastewater treatment, and the second scenario decrease in riverine load from the drainage area. The wastewater scenario decreased both phytoplankton and filamentous algal biomass by 5-15% in the vicinity of the outlet located in the outer archipelago of Helsinki. Changes in the inner archipelago and close to the shoreline were hardly detectable. The effects of the agriculture scenario on the algal biomasses stayed mainly below the arbitrarily selected detection limit of 2%. The reason for low impact is probably the effective transport of the riverine nutrients out of the estuary. The water of river Vantaanjoki has a very high concentration of suspended solids making the growth of both phytoplankton and filamentous algae clearly light limited in front of the river mouth. Low light availability decreases the algal growth and nutrient uptake allowing an effective transport of even highly biologically available nutrients. When the nutrients are transported and diluted into a large area, also the effects of load reductions easily fade below the detection limit. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Li, KC; Yeh, MC				Li, KC; Yeh, MC			Nonpoint source pollution potential index: A case study of the Feitsui Reservoir watershed, Taiwan	JOURNAL OF THE CHINESE INSTITUTE OF ENGINEERS			English	Article						nonpoint source pollution; potential index; Feitsui Reservoir; watershed management; best management practices		Nonpoint pollution has become the main source of water pollution in Taiwan. In recent years, the Feitsui Reservoir has been threatened by eutrophication due to the nonpoint pollution from its watershed. This study develops a nonpoint source pollution potential index (NPPI) to identify and rank critical contributing areas in the Feitsui Reservoir watershed, so that, where appropriate, best management practices (BMPs) can be initiated to efficiently improve water quality. The NPPI ranking model is an aggreoation function, composed of six subindices - runoff volume, specific peak runoff rate, soluble nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the runoff and specific sediment yield, each with a relative importance weighting. The NPPI ranking system can be used not only as a management tool to prioritize the critical pollutant source areas on a regional watershed basis, but also as a policy decision-making tool to evaluate the effects of applying alterative BMPs for targeting the problem of nonpoint pollution.

Sources of variability were examined using one-dimensional physical and biogeochemical models. Model predictions for pCO(2) and DO were compared to further constrain model parameters. A number of transient processes were documented that have not been well characterized in previous studies. The models made it possible to link these short-term events to specific forcings. We found that (1) 11 d of the 13-d turnover period occurred under ice through light-driven convective mixing, (2) phytoplankton biomass increased to its highest seasonal level under ice, (3) weak stratification set up immediately after ice-out, causing bottom water pCO(2) and DO to diverge from surface levels, (4) subsequent diel convective mixing brought bottom pCO(2) and DO back toward surface levels, and (5) before stable stratification, vertical entrainment of CO2-rich water, net production, and air-water exchange drove 100-200 muatm daily changes in pCO(2) but, because of their counterbalancing effects, surface pCO(2) remained > 1,000 muatm for nearly I month after ice-out. Upon stable stratification, net production and air-water exchange overcame pCO(2) gains from mixing and heating and reduced pCO(2) to near atmospheric levels within 20 d. Net production and gas exchange accounted for similar to75% and 25%, respectively, of the decrease in surface pCO(2) observed after ice-out.

This paper briefly overviews RZWQM history and distinguishing features, overviews key RZWQM components and reviews RZWQM validation studies. RZWQM is a physically based agricultural systems model that includes sub-models to simulate: infiltration, runoff, water distribution and chemical movement in the soil; macropore flow and chemical movement through macropores; evapotranspiration (ET); heat transport; plant growth; organic matter/nitrogen cycling; pesticide processes; chemical transfer to runoff, and the effect of agricultural management practices on these processes. Research to date shows that if key input parameters are calibrated, RZWQM can adequately simulate the processes involved with pesticide transport (ET, soil-water content, percolation and runoff, plant growth and pesticide fate). A review of the validation studies revealed that (1) accurate parameterization of restricting soil layers (low permeability horizons) may improve simulated soil-water content; (2) simulating pesticide sorption kinetics may improve simulated soil pesticide concentration with time (persistence) and depth and (3) calibrating the pesticide half-life is generally necessary for accurate pesticide persistence simulations. This overview/review provides insight into the processes involved with the RZWQM pesticide component and helps identify model weaknesses, model strengths and successful modeling strategies.

In this review we summarize the motivation which has powered this engagement and focus on new technologies used to measure fluorescence, absorption and biochemical compositions of natural phytoplankton cells from nature. Combining the knowledge of phytoplankton structure along with taxon-specific measurements of photosynthetic activity and biochemical cell composition, can lead to new models which increase the reliability of water quality prediction. Furthermore, recent progress in the analysis of photophysiological fitness of phytoplankton cells has revealed new knowledge about the phylogenetic diversity of metabolic strategies to cope with light and nutrient stress. Future progress in single cell analysing systems will be discussed.

The water is turbid and thermal structure may significantly affect light availability. An in situ experiment was designed to represent complete mixing, diurnal stratification and persistent stratification and test the effect on growth of A. circinalis. To represent the mixing treatments, cells were incubated in diffusion chambers that were adjusted to different positions in the water-column throughout the day. Populations exposed to persistent stratification over six days grew significantly faster than the other treatments at a rate of 0.65 day(-1). However, growth of the diurnally stratified populations was slower than (0.28 day(-1)), or similar to (0.40 day(-1)) the mixed population (0.40 day(-1)). Therefore,the growth of the subpopulations exposed to the euphotic zone was insufficient to counteract the slow growth of the majority that were confined to darkness during the stratified period. A relationship between growth rate (G) and average daily light dose (I) was constructed and growth rate at optimal light dose (G(max)), slope of linear section of G-I curve (alpha), and light dose where lines of G(max) and light-limited portion of G-I curve intersect (I-k) were solved as 0.66 day(-1), 0.12 day(-1) (mol(-1) m(-2) day(-1))(-1) and 5.4 mol m(-2) day(-1), respectively. Using these parameters, a model was developed to predict possible differences in growth between diurnal and mixed populations under varying conditions of vertical light attenuation, mixed depth and incubation time.

To study the occurrence of toxic blooms in Lake Nantua, the Planktothrix rubescens species (Oscillatoria rubescens) was considered. At the same time, some physicochemical parameters were analysed to estimate their impact on toxin production. The investigations were conducted during summertime and the highest toxin concentration analysed by HPLC was detected in August (10.8 mug/l of lake water). The results of this work suggested that the toxin production increased when the light intensity, temperature, alkaline pH and phosphorus contents were at low levels. Moreover, the toxin production was positively related with NT/PT ratio. TLC analysis of the purified fractions revealed the occurrence of 4-7 polypeptide or protein bands. Two of them were shown to be toxic using Artemia bioassays and the most toxic one was identified as MCYST-RR. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Nhapi, I; Siebel, MA; Gijzen, HJ				Nhapi, I; Siebel, MA; Gijzen, HJ			The impact of urbanisation on the water quality of Lake Chivero, Zimbabwe	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						eutrophication; Lake Chivero; mass balance; nutrients; urbanisation	BANS	This study quantified concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the Lake Chivero catchment area, Zimbabwe. The results showed that sewage effluent is the major source of nutrients in the lake. The lake is hypertrophic, and it was concluded that the current situation is not sustainable. The Vollenweider model was used to predict the acceptable inflow phosphorus concentrations based upon oligotrophic conditions. The predicted value of 10 t/year total phosphorus was considered to be unattainable under the current situation because it is already lower than that from non-point sources. A 1970s value of 75 t/year total phosphorus is recommended as a starting point because it excludes sewage effluent and, for the long-term, it is recommended that pollution prevention and water re-use should be adopted in combination with the recycling of nutrients in controlled urban agriculture.

This paper reviews design models for horizontal subsurface flow constructed treatment wetlands, ranging from simple rules of thumb and regression equations, to the well-known first-order k-C* models, Monod-type equations and more complex dynamic, compartmental models. Especially highlighted in this review are the model constraints and parameter uncertainty. A case study has been used to demonstrate the model output variability and to unravel whether or not more complex but also less manageable models offer a significant advantage to the designer.

The independent variables of cumulative Julian days, seasonality terms, stream pH, conductivity, and flow rate were used in the regression models to predict concentrations and loads for acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), chloride, hydrogen ion, nitrate, potassium, sodium, and sulfate. The regression analyses showed statistically significant declines in nitrate and. ANC loads and concentrations with time, but did not show declines in hydrogen ion or sulfate concentrations. The water quality database and regression models were used to test weekly, bi-weekly, tri-weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, and quarterly sampling frequencies. The results showed overall that the weekly, bi-weekly, tri-weekly, and monthly sampling strategies should produce distributions that are statistically similar in mean and variance for stream water quality and loads.

We used N and C stable isotopes to link adult horseshoe crabs to their foraging locations and potential food sources in Pleasant Bay, Cape Cod. The delta(15)N in tissues of horseshoe crabs and their potential foods suggest crabs were loyal to local foraging sites and did not forage substantially in subestuaries receiving >110 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). Among locations where crabs foraged, delta(13)C values in potential foods showed that food webs in subestuaries subject to higher N loads were supported by algal producers, while food webs in subestuaries with lower N loads were also supported by Spartina. delta(13)C values in horseshoe crab tissue did not change with load, suggesting they ate a mixed diet, regardless of N load. N and C isotopes in horseshoe crab feces were similar to signatures of estimated diet, suggesting low assimilation efficiency, perhaps due to ingestion of low quality organic matter. Although horseshoe crabs were relatively opportunistic in foraging habits, conservation or culture of horseshoe crabs may require habitats with higher water quality, ample particulate organic matter, and supporting a variety of prey.

In this study, we use the IBIS terrestrial ecosystem model and the HYDRA aquatic transport model to examine how agricultural practices and climate influenced terrestrial and aquatic nitrogen cycling across the Mississippi Basin and the nitrate export to the Gulf. The modeling system accurately depicts the observed trends and interannual variability in nitrate export by the Mississippi River (r(2) > 0.83), and several of the major tributaries, between 1960 and 1994. The challenge of simulating nitrate export from the central western sub-basins highlights the key role of processes like denitrification. The simulations demonstrate that three factors led to the doubling of nitrate export by the Mississippi River since 1960: ( 1) an increase in fertilizer application rates, particularly on maize; ( 2) an increase in runoff across the basin; and ( 3) the expansion of soybean cultivation. By the early 1990s, fertilized crops may have accounted for almost 90% of the nitrate leached to the river system, despite representing only 20% of the watershed area. The majority of the nitrate exported to the Gulf appears to originate from "hot spots,'' including a stretch of the "Corn Belt'' across Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana. The relative contribution of such heavily fertilized lands, particularly those in close proximity to higher order streams, can be even greater during wet years.

J	Liu, F; Han, WY				Liu, F; Han, WY			Reuse strategy of wastewater in prawn nursery by microbial remediation	AQUACULTURE			English	Article						reuse strategy; microbial rernediation; nursery wastewater; Bacillus subtilis; glucose; phosphate; prawn	SHRIMP PONDS; RECIRCULATING SYSTEM; AQUACULTURE SYSTEMS; CULTURE; NITROGEN; BACTERIA; LARVAE; MICROORGANISMS; EFFLUENTS; REMOVAL	A strategy of reusing the prawn nursery wastewater was developed by the previous remediation with Bacillus subtilis and nutrients addition. The suggested method was preliminarily verified in rearing prawn larval. Bacteria assimilation is proved as a main and powerful mechanism for removing dissolved organic matter (DOM) and total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) in the experiments. The process of microbial remediation could be featured as two sequential stages: DOM degradation and TAN reduction. In the first stage (from day 0 to day 2), DOM was degraded directly as the bacterial carbon and nitrogen sources. The 48-h COD removal efficiencies (R-COD) in the treatment were 57.7 +/- 5.5%, showing significantly different from 12.2 +/- 4.1% in control. In the second phase (from day 2 to day 5), the deficiencies of C and P source relative to N source might limit bacteria proliferation and TAN removal. The glucose and/or phosphate addition significantly influenced the TAN removal performance, while the addition of vitamin mixture and/or microelement solution was not. When the initial TAN level was nearly 5 mg N/l, the optimal TAN removal efficiencies from day 2 to day 5 were above 85% in the treatments with both glucose and phosphate additions, where the white microbial floccules were observed to suspend. The C/N or N/P weight ratio of 5.4:1 or 5-7:1 was suggested for remediating the nursery effluents. The situation that the maximum bacterial levels did not exceed 10(8) CFU/ml was estimated to correlate with the formation of microbial floccules. After 5 days of microbial remediation by these adequate methods, the wastewater had been became the "microbially matured" water suitable to reuse. In the practical operations, the nutrient supplements were directed by Glucose/TAN weight ratio of 13:1 and KH2PO4/TAN weight ratio of 0.6-0.9:1. The results of the application trial pointed out that the remediated water reclaimed to the larvae culture tanks did not produce observable deleterious effects on the water quality and on the mortality of the prawn larvae. The method of reusing the remediated wastewater by microbial agents and nutrients additions will be advantageous to reduce both production cost and environmental pollution in the inland hatchery and nursery for prawn.

To support this decision-making process, a matrix model connecting flow paths and nitrogen transformation was developed with a quasi-stationary mass balance approach. The model concept is based on the assumptions that wetlands (1) receive water and nitrogen along several hydrological pathways, and (2) transformation of nitrogen occurs inside the wetland with different efficiencies, depending on the transition pattern between inflow and outflow pathways. These assumptions are formalized in a set of vectors describing the amount of water and the nitrogen concentration for each inflow pathway, a water distribution matrix between the inflowing water and several outflow pathways, a nitrogen transformation coefficient matrix of each inflow and outflow combination and, finally, two outflow vectors with the amount of water flowing out and the calculated nitrogen concentrations of each outflow pathway. The matrix model is applied to a drained valley peatland in order to quantify the effect of different water management options on an increase in nitrogen retention.

The Kennet catchment (1200 km(2)) is a predominantly groundwater fed river impacted by agricultural and sewage sources of nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) pollution. The results from a suite of simulation models are integrated to assess the key spatial and temporal variations in the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) chemistry, and the influence of changes in phosphorous inputs from a Sewage Treatment Works on the macrophyte and epiphyte growth patterns. The models used are the Export Co-efficient model, the Integrated Nitrogen in Catchments model, and a new model of in-stream phosphorus and macrophyte dynamics: the 'Kennet' model. The paper concludes with a discussion on the present state of knowledge regarding the water quality functioning, future research needs regarding environmental modelling and the use of models as management tools for large, nutrient impacted riverine systems.

Since this process leads to rapid bioaccumulation of recalcitrant pollutants such as heavy metals, organochlorine pesticides and hydrocarbons from impacted sites, it has prompted the widespread use of molluscs as biomonitors to quantify levels of marine pollution. This paper proposes pearl oyster deployment as a novel bioremediation technology for impacted sites to remove toxic contaminants, reduce nutrient loads and lower concentrations of microbial pathogens. Estimates extrapolated from the literature suggest that a modest pearl oyster farm of 100 t oyster material per year could remove 300 kg heavy metals plus 24 kg of organic contaminants via deposition into the tissue and shell. Furthermore, it was estimated that up to 19 kg of nitrogen may be removed from the coastal ecosystem per tonne of pearl oyster harvested. Pearl oysters are also likely to filter substantial amounts of sewage associated microbial pathogens from the water column. Method of cultivation and site selection are the key to minimising negative environmental impacts of bivalve cultivation. Deployment of oysters at sites with high nutrient and contaminant loadings would be advantageous, as these compounds would be removed from the ecosystem whilst generating a value-added product. Future potential may exist for harvesting bio-concentrated elements for commercial production. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Snelder, TH; Biggs, BJF; Weatherhead, MA				Snelder, TH; Biggs, BJF; Weatherhead, MA			Nutrient concentration criteria and characterization of patterns in trophic state for rivers in heterogeneous landscapes	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						river environment classification; spatial framework; ecoregions; nutrient criteria; trophic status; resource management	NEW-ZEALAND RIVERS; ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT; WATER CHEMISTRY; CLASSIFICATION; STREAMS; CHLOROPHYLL; ENVIRONMENT; ECOREGIONS; FRAMEWORK; ECOLOGY	A method is demonstrated for the development of nutrient concentration criteria and large scale assessment of trophic state in environmentally heterogeneous landscapes. The method uses the River Environment Classification (REC) as a spatial framework to partition rivers according to differences in processes that control the accrual and loss of algae biomass. The method is then applied to gravel bed rivers with natural flow regimes that drain hilly watersheds in New Zealand's South Island. An existing model is used to characterize trophic state (in terms of chlorophyll a as a measure of maximum biomass) using nutrient concentration, which controls the rate of biomass accrual, and flood frequency, which controls biomass loss. Variation in flood frequency was partitioned into three classes, and flow data measured at 68 sites was used to show that the classes differ with respect to flood frequency. Variation in nutrient concentration was partitioned at smaller spatial scales by subdivision of higher level classes into seven classes. The median of flood frequency in each of the three higher level classes was used as a control variable in the model to provide spatially explicit nutrient concentration criteria by setting maximum chlorophyll a to reflect a desired trophic state. The median of mean monthly soluble reactive phosphor-us and soluble inorganic nitrogen measured at 68 water quality monitoring sites were then used to characterize the trophic state of each of the seven lower level classes. The method models biomass and therefore allows variation in this response variable to provide options for trophic state and the associated nutrient concentrations to achieve these. Thus it is less deterministic than using reference site water quality.

A rainfall simulator was used to evaluate the effectiveness of different methods for controlling erosion from construction sites. Erosion control methods investigated included dry and liquid applications of polyacrylamide (PAM), hydroseed, and straw mulch. Fertilizer was also applied to each plot to examine the effectiveness of the methods in reducing nutrient losses in runoff. Runoff samples were analyzed for total suspended solids (TSS), nitrate, total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), ammonium, total phosphorus (TP), and orthophosphate. Among all treatments investigated, straw mulch was the most effective treatment for controlling TSS and nutrient losses during short term and long term simulations. The low liquid PAM (half the recommended PAM) treatment resulted in the highest reduction in runoff, TSS bound nitrogen, and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations and loadings. The study results indicate that a high application rate (twice the recommended rate) of PAM could actually increase runoff and TSS losses. At a low application rate, both liquid and dry PAM were effective in reducing TSS and nutrient losses in runoff. However, application of the liquid form of PAM to construction sites is more practical and perhaps more economical than applying the PAM in the dry form.

The methodology integrates all point and nonpoint sources of nitrogen, the national land cover database, soil nitrogen transformations, and the uncertainty of key soil and land use-related parameters to predict the nitrate mass leaching to ground water. The analysis considered 21 different land use classes with information derived from nitrogen sources such as fertilizer and dairy manure applications, dairy lagoons, septic systems, and dry and wet depositions. Simulations were performed at a temporal resolution of one month to capture seasonal trends. The model was applied to a large aquifer of 376 square miles in Washington State that serves more than 100,000 residents with drinking water. The results showed that dairy manure is the main source of nitrogen in the area followed by fertilizers. It was also seen that nitrate leaching is controlled by the recharge rate, and there can be a substantial buildup of soil nitrogen over long periods of time. Uncertainty analysis showed that denitrification rate is the most influential parameter on nitrate leaching. The results showed that combining management alternatives is a successful strategy, especially with the use of nitrification inhibitors. Also, change in the land use pattern has a noticeable impact on nitrate leaching.

J	Nagumo, T; Woli, KP; Hatano, R				Nagumo, T; Woli, KP; Hatano, R			Evaluating the contribution of point and non-point sources of nitrogen pollution in stream water in a rural area of central Hokkaido, Japan	SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION			English	Article						intensive pig farming; landfill site; non-point source estimate; stream nitrogen load	NITRATE; DENITRIFICATION; GROUNDWATER; RIVER; QUALITY; BUDGET; IMPACT	There is an increasing concern about nitrogen (N) pollution of surface water for which agricultural activities can be identified as non-point sources. Drainage from manure storage sites in large-scale livestock husbandry operations and drainage from landfill sites are considered to be point sources of N pollution that severely affect the quality of stream water. We evaluated the contribution of point as well as non-point sources of N pollution in stream water in the Etanbetsu River drainage basin, which is located in Asahikawa city, Central Hokkaido, Japan. Water sampling was carried out at 17 sites in the river both in the snowmelt and in the post-rice-planting seasons in 1997. Various drainage areas such as tributaries, open-ditches, and tile-drains from agricultural fields, wastewater from a pig farm, and a landfill leachate were also sampled at 47 and 49 sites in total in the snowmelt and post-rice-planting seasons, respectively. The results showed that the total N (T-N) concentration in the upper reaches of the Etanbetsu River was as low as <0.7 mg L-1 in the snowmelt season. and <0.3 mg L-1 in the post-rice-planting season. The concentration increased at the outlet of the Etanbetsu River to values as high as 1.6 mg L-1 in the snowmelt season and 2.0 mg L-1 in the post-rice-planting season. This increase in the TLN concentration was mainly due to landfill effluent and wastewater from a pig farm. The landfill leachate showed a remarkably higher T-N concentration of 96 mg L-1 in the snowmelt season and 162 mg L-1 in the post-rice-planting season, followed by a T-N concentration of 33 and 34 mg L-1 in the pig farm wastewater in the respective seasons. The T-N load showed a similar pattern to that of the TLN concentrations. In the upper reaches of the Etanbetsu River, the N load was as low as <4 g s(-1) in the snowmelt season and <0.4 g s(-1) in the post-rice-planting season. The N loads became as high as 26 and 4.8 g s(-1) in the respective seasons at the downstream site due to the landfill effluent and the wastewater from a pig farm. These results indicated that the landfill site and the pig farm acted as major N pollution sources affecting the stream water quality. We estimated the contribution of these two point sources together with that of forested and agricultural lands to the stream water T-N load. The results showed that, at the upstream sites, the contribution of agricultural land was 44-69% in the snowmelt season and 56-63% in the post-rice-planting season, indicating that agricultural non-point sources play a major role in the stream T-N load. In the entire Etanbetsu River basin, however, the contribution of the point sources of landfill effluent and wastewater from a pig farm was estimated to be extremely high. Estimates of the riverine N load were as high as 90% and 95% in the snowmelt season and in the post-rice-planting season, respectively. If these point sources were removed, the stream T-N concentration would be as low as 0.19-0.2 mg L-1 in the snowmelt season, which may allow the TLN concentration to be maintained within the range of T-N concentrations commonly found in forested streams in Hokkaido.

J	Nurnberg, GK; LaZerte, BD				Nurnberg, GK; LaZerte, BD			Modeling the effect of development on internal phosphorus load in nutrient-poor lakes	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						phosphorus; lakeshore capacity model; internal load predictions; water quality objectives	CENTRAL ONTARIO LAKES; ANOXIC HYPOLIMNIA; PREDICTION; SEDIMENTS; PHOSPHATE; EXPORT; CARBON; STATE	A steady state lake phosphorus (P) mass balance model was used to predict the equilibrium P concentration (annual, volume-weighted average) of the lake water from natural and anthropogenic, external and internal P inputs. Internal P load was modeled as the product of sediment release rates and anoxic factors. Both these components were predicted from lake P concentration computed from external load to create a link between external and internal load components. Such estimates allow the modeling and setting of objectives of several hundred lakes on the Canadian Shield. In particular, estimates of predevelopment lake P concentration made by removing all anthropogenic inputs were compared with postdevelopment conditions in which additional loading was added to the model. This was accomplished by determining how much development would increase external as well as internal phosphorus load and ultimately annual average lake P concentrations. By comparing proposed lake development scenarios with existing or predevelopment scenarios, it can be determined whether water quality objectives will be exceeded.

J	Burford, MA; Lorenzen, K				Burford, MA; Lorenzen, K			Modeling nitrogen dynamics in intensive shrimp ponds: the role of sediment remineralization	AQUACULTURE			English	Article							WATER INTERFACE; AQUACULTURE; AMMONIA; CULTURE; SIMULATION; MANAGEMENT; EFFLUENT; QUALITY; FATE	A mathematical model is used to investigate the role of sedimentation and remineralization in the sediment on nitrogen (N) dynamics in intensive shrimp culture ponds. The model describes the key processes involved in N cycling that underpin the dynamics of total ammoniacal N (TAN), nitrate/nitrite (NOX) and chlorophyll a (CHL) concentrations and the sediment N pool. These parameters may, in high concentrations, impact negatively on the shrimp or the adjacent aquatic environment when water is discharged from ponds. The model was calibrated for an Australian commercial shrimp (Penaeus monodon) pond. Most N enters the pond system as TAN from shrimp excretion of dietary N and decomposition of wasted feed, and is subsequently taken up by phytoplankton, which, on senescence, is sedimented and remineralized. Sediment remineralization is the dominant source of TAN in the water column for all but the beginning of the production cycle. The remineralization rate of sedimented N was estimated at 6% day(-1). Nonetheless, sediment acts as a net sink of N throughout the production cycle. The effect of management strategies, including increased stocking densities, water exchange and sludge (= sedimented material) removal, on water quality was examined. Model outputs show that using current shrimp farming techniques, with water exchange rates of 7% day(-1), an increase in stocking densities above 60 animals m(-2) would result in unacceptably high TAN concentrations. Both sludge removal and water exchange provide effective ways of reducing TAN and NOX concentrations and may allow substantially higher stocking densities. However, sludge removal may be the more acceptable option, given the need to meet strict regulatory requirements for discharge loads in some countries and the desire to reduce water intake to improve biosecurity.

At 24 h after herbicide application, rainfall events of different intensities were simulated to 0.5- m(2) field plots with 20% (70, 88, and 111 mm/h) and 30% (60, 70, and 80 mm/h) slope, respectively. The objective of this study was to compare the behaviour of pesticides covering a range of properties under identical hydrodynamic conditions. Sediment amounts and herbicide concentrations were determined in the runoff samples. As the transported sediment amounts were not sufficient for chemical analyses, herbicide residues attached to sediment were estimated using K-d values determined locally for the soil. Whereas pendimethalin concentrations followed no noticeable pattern, the concentrations for the other herbicides were highest in the first runoff samples, and decreased exponentially with further rain. Results show that herbicides were primarily transported in their dissolved form with the exception of pendimethalin. Slope affected cumulative runoff, sediment, and herbicide losses significantly ( P < 0.05). The impact of increased rainfall intensity on runoff initiation followed a similar trend, but herbicide losses from plots exposed to different intensities were not always significant. Losses dissolved in runoff from plots with 20% slope were &LE; 1% of the applied herbicide, whereas on plots with 30% slope the maximum recorded loss was 65%. Here, losses for all herbicides ranged between 1 and 7% at 60 mm/h and 8 and 65% at 80 mm/h. Exports of herbicides with moderate solubility were negatively correlated with their K-d values and their water solubility.

J	Di, HJ; Cameron, KC				Di, HJ; Cameron, KC			Effects of temperature and application rate of a nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide (DCD), on nitrification rate and microbial biomass in a grazed pasture soil	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL RESEARCH			English	Article						nitrogen; nitrate; leaching; pastures; dairying; water quality	NITROUS-OXIDE EMISSIONS; DAIRY SHED EFFLUENT; COW URINE; GRASSLAND; LYSIMETER; AGRICULTURE; IRRIGATION; FERTILIZER; KINETICS; MODEL	The nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) has recently been shown to be effective in reducing nitrate leaching from grazed pasture soils. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of temperature and application rate on the effectiveness of DCD in nitrification inhibition. Possible effects on soil microbial biomass were also determined. The soil, Lismore silt loam ( Pallic orthic brown soil; Udic Haplustept loamy skeletal), was incubated at a moisture content near field capacity under 2 temperatures (8 or 20degreesC). Urea was applied at 25 kg N/ha and dairy cow urine at 1000 kg N/ha. DCD was applied at 2 rates equivalent to 7.5 or 15 kg/ha. The results show that at a soil temperature of 8degreesC, the half-life of DCD was 111-116 days. The half-life of NH4+ changed from 44 days without DCD to 243-491 days when DCD was applied. In contrast, at a soil temperature of 20degreesC the half-life of DCD was 18-25 days. The half-life of NH4+ changed from 22 days without DCD to 64-55 days with DCD. The 2 different rates of DCD had a small effect on the NH4+ concentration in the soil. The application of DCD did not have a significant effect on soil microbial biomass. DCD would therefore be most effective in inhibiting nitrification and thus reducing nitrate leaching in late autumn-winter-early spring in most parts of New Zealand when daily average soil temperatures are generally below 10degreesC and when drainage is high.

J	Updegraff, K; Baughman, MJ; Taff, SJ				Updegraff, K; Baughman, MJ; Taff, SJ			Environmental benefits of cropland conversion to hybrid poplar: economic and policy considerations	BIOMASS & BIOENERGY			English	Article						short-rotation woody crops; poplar; water quality; erosion; non-market valuation; carbon sequestration	WATER-QUALITY; MANAGEMENT; IMPACTS; SYSTEMS	To evaluate environmental benefits that might accrue from conversion of farmland to short-rotation woody crops (SRWC), a hypothetical conversion of 10%, 20% and 30% of cropland was modeled in a watershed of the Lower Minnesota River. The analysis synthesized output from a watershed model (ADAPT) with literature-based estimates of productivity and economic values for water quality, forest conservation and carbon sequestration. A Monte Carlo simulation approach was used to estimate ranges of environmental benefit values for cropland conversion to SRWCs. The summed average net benefits justified annual public subsidies ranging from $44 to $96 ha(-1) depending on market scenario and conversion level. Cropland conversion to SRWCs reduced cumulative annual stream flows, sediment and nitrogen loadings by up to 9%, 28% and 15%, respectively. Reduced sediment loads resulted in potential average annual public savings on culvert and ditch maintenance costs of $9.37 Mg-1 of sediment not delivered to the watershed outlet. Hybrid poplars over a 5-year rotation produced an estimated annual economic value due to carbon sequestration of $13-15 ha(-1) when used for bioenergy and $29-33 ha(-1) (depending on conversion rate) when converted to wood products. If hybrid poplars are substituted for aspen traditionally harvested from natural woodlands, the poplars create annual forest preservation values of $4.79-5.44 ha(-1). (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been reported that the irradiance reflectance and, subsequently, the radiance collected by the sensor in such scenario is usually the result of an intimate mixture of sub-pixel components. As a result, the commonly used linear mixing model may not be appropriate to describe materials composition. In this work, we develop a nonlinear neural network-based algorithm for estimating water constituent concentrations, with special emphasis on the detection of chemical substances provided by agricultural and industrial sources. The proposed neural network architecture consists of a modified multi-layer perceptron (MLP) whose entries are determined by a linear function activation provided by a Hopfield neural network algorithm (HNN). The combined HNN/MLP supervised model has been used to estimate the concentration of water constituents by training the MLP with ground spectra of nitrogen salts, which are commonly used in extensive agricultural farms. Such spectra were collected using a Minolta spectro-photometer. The model was calibrated in our laboratory by using mixtures of water and nitrogen salt in different proportions. Hyperspectral images collected by the ROSIS imaging spectrometer over the Guadiloba reservoir in Caceres, SW Spain, are also used in this study to estimate the concentration of nitrogen salts in turbid inland waters.

These gases have numerous deleterious effects on the environment, including eutrophication of downwind ecosystems (NH3 and NO), noxious odours (NH3), production of atmospheric aerosols that reduce air quality (NH3 and NO), tropospheric ozone (O-3) production (NO), stratospheric O-3 depletion (N2O), and global warming (N2O and tropospheric O-3 derived from reactions involving NO). Because nitrogen (N) amendments are commonly needed for optimal agricultural productivity, some Leakage of applied N out of agricultural fields and into aquatic and atmospheric reservoirs is probably inevitable. The magnitude of that leakage, however, can be controlled by sound management practices. Our knowledge of the processes of gaseous production and transport in soils should allow us to minimise this leakage, thereby protecting air and water quality while maintaining food security. We contend that, although new technological developments in fertiliser products would be helpful, sufficient understanding of the processes of gaseous N losses already exists to allow substantial decreases in N losses. Rather than technological and scientific know-how, the most important limiting factors to progress in this area appear to be socio-economic mechanisms to provide farmers with incentives and/or requirements to reduce emissions.

To investigate changes in groundwater quality in 1994-2001 holes of a monitoring network were bored at a model locality of former large mine Silvestr near Sokolov where a landfill of solid municipal waste was established in that period. Selected parameters (conductivity, chloride index, alkaline index and degradation index) were used as indicators for an evaluation of main changes in quality of these waters. The results of monitoring demonstrated that fly ash and stabilizate from combustion processes could be applied to liquidate mining consequences. Statistical evaluation proved the existence of marked regularities of changes in water quality in time.

We found that the information gained from the! red (around 675 nm) and red edge (near 700 nm) spectral regions were sufficient for the construction of algorithms for phytoplankton density estimation. These algorithms were calibrated and validated in Lake Kinneret, and then applied to estimate chlorophyll concentration in numerous lakes and reservoirs with slight modification of the coefficients.

The Cahaba River lies in north-central Alabama and its watershed includes a variety of land uses from forested and agricultural to urban. Water quantity and quality modeling of the Cahaba River using several modules of the hydrologic simulation program FORTRAN (HSPF) and the nonpoint source model (NPSM) using the GIS-based BASINS package showed good agreement with measured flow data for low- and high-flow years but poor agreement with total nitrogen concentrations in the water column. Disparities between modeling and measured water quality data are attributed to the limited point source data available for nitrogen inputs to the stream and the lack of nitrogen-transformation process modeling with the NPSM. Future simulations should include use of models with detailed nitrogen transformation modules.

These nutrients are commonly added to soil as fertilizers in either inorganic or organic forms. However, poor application of fertilizers (both inorganic and organic) can lead to nutrient loss from agricultural land by runoff and leaching. These potential non-point source nutrient losses can contribute to environmental degradation, eutrophication of surface waters, and possible human health risks. These concerns have been stimulated by blooms of the toxic dinoflagellate algae (Pfiesteria piscicidia) that have caused fish kills and human illnesses and by reports of a hypoxic area (low dissolved oxygen) in the Gulf of Mexico (20,000 km(2)) (1), which have been attributed to pollution from excess nutrients (2). Nonpoint source pollution from agriculture has been identified as the leading source of water quality reduction by the USEPA (3), with estimates that agriculture affects the degradation of 60% of river miles, 50% of lake acres, and 34% of estuaries acres. While these impairments are not nutrient specific, both N and P have been implicated in causing accelerated eutrophication. The role of nutrients in the eutrophication process is very complex, but in general, lake eutrophication is associated with P, N is associated with ocean waters, and both N and P are associated with estuaries (4, 5). Factors affecting non-point loss of nutrients from agricultural soils are numerous and complex. Many of the factors that affect nutrient losses can be greatly impacted by agricultural management practices. Scientists have continued to research and develop methods to improve agricultural practices to reduce nutrient losses.

J	Hartnett, A; Nash, S				Hartnett, A; Nash, S			Modelling nutrient and chlorophyll_a dynamics in an Irish brackish waterbody	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						modelling; chlorophyll_a; nutrient cycles; light attenuation; water quality management	KILLARY HARBOR; IRELAND; PHYTOPLANKTON; FLOW	This paper presents aspects of a research investigation into nutrient fluxes into and out of an important Irish estuary, Wexford Harbour, located in the southeast of Ireland. Details of the methodology applied, the data collection and analysis and the models used are outlined. In particular, the paper addresses modelling of chlorophyll-a production in the brackish waterbody and its dependency on light attenuation. There are three distinct stages to the research carried out: (i) collection, collation and analysis of physical, chemical and biological water quality variables; (ii) development, validation and application of a chlorophyll-a production model; (iii) development of a Geographic Information System. The nutrient and chlorophyll-a production model simulates nine interactive water quality parameters; during the first stage these above parameters were measured to provide initial conditions for the model and for calibration purposes. From measurements, relationships were derived between the water quality variables and salinity, which were used to specify initial spatially varied values of the parameters to the model at different seasons. A relationship was also developed between light intensity, turbidity and concentrations of chlorophyll-a, based on field measurements. This relationship was incorporated into the model. The paper presents chlorophyll-a predictions using this relationship and illustrates how the enhanced model can be used as an accurate modelling tool for managing coastal ecosystems. The water quality model was incorporated into the ArcView GIs system providing an easy-to-use graphical user interface to run simulations and interrogate-results. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Marsili-Libelli, S				Marsili-Libelli, S			Fuzzy prediction of the algal blooms in the Orbetello lagoon	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st Biennial Meeting of the International-Environmental-Modelling-and-Software-Society (iEMSs)	JUL, 2002	Univ Lugano, Lugano, SWITZERLAND	Int Environm Modelling & Software Soc	Univ Lugano	eutrophication; phytoplankton; primary production; fuzzy systems; pattern recognition; decision support systems	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; MODEL; IDENTIFICATION	The Orbetello lagoon is a shallow brackish waterbody subject to intense and diverse eutrophication (phytoplankton, macroalgae 14 and macrophytes). Periodically a large amount of algae must be artificially removed, their collection and disposal representing a considerable management cost. This paper describes the design of a bloom predictor based on the daily fluctuations of simple water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen, oxidation-reduction potential, pH and temperature. The task of the fuzzy predictor is to recognise the possibility that a bloom of the macroalgae population is about to occur, based on the changing daily pattern of these variables. The fuzzy predictor is based on a set of fuzzy rules derived from experimental observations and expert knowledge. A 15 month period of hourly data was analysed and used to form the initial knowledge-base. The tests show that the inferential engine has good predictive capabilities, which could be improved when more data become available. The algorithm outlined in the paper has enough generality to be applied to any environmental classification problem where short-term time patterns and long-term statistical variability should be considered jointly.

J	McIntyre, NR; Wheater, HS				McIntyre, NR; Wheater, HS			A tool for risk-based management of surface water quality	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						water quality; uncertainty; risk; decision-making	SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; UNCERTAINTY; MODELS; EUTROPHICATION; PREDICTION; PHOSPHORUS; SYSTEMS; FUTURE	Water quality Risk Analysis Tool (WaterRAT) is software for supporting decision-making in surface water quality management. The philosophy behind the software is that uncertainty in water quality model predictions is inevitably high due to model equation error, parameter error, and limited definition of boundary conditions and management objectives. Using sensitivity and uncertainty analyses based on Monte Carlo simulation and first order methods, WaterRAT allows the modeller to identify the significant uncertainties, and evaluate the degree to which they control decision-making risk. WaterRAT has a library of river and lake water quality models of varying complexity, and these can be applied at a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, allowing the model design to be responsive to both the modelling task and the data constraints.

Typically, a well-calibrated hydrodynamic and water quality model is used as the management tool. The development of a water quality and circulation model is based on field data that encompasses the factors affecting the water body, and the model is used to evaluate the potential effects of changing point source loadings under varying operational and environmental conditions. The level of predictability depends on the goodness of field data needed for model calibration and for setting up input data, assuming all the relevant water quality processes are simulated correctly. But there are times when good field data are available, yet the calibration is not good. In such a situation, it is conventional to revisit the algorithms used for the various water quality processes. This approach was attempted in a recent project where a three-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model called GEMSS was applied to predict the quality of water in the Budd Inlet, located in the Southern Puget Sound (Washington, USA). Within GEMSS, the use of the water quality model called WQDPM, which is a modified version of EPA's Eutro5 water quality model, did not predict the vertical structure of dissolved oxygen and phytoplankton at different locations in the Budd Inlet. The phytoplankton was modeled in Eutro5 as a single algal group. In order to improve the calibration, the alternate water quality model called WQCBM available in GEMSS was used. This model includes different forms of organic carbon that can be related to sediment exchange processes. WQCBM simulates five interacting subsystems: net phytoplankton production, the phosphorus cycle, the nitrogen cycle, the dissolved oxygen balance, and the particulate organic carbon balance. The carbon based model was updated to include dinoflagellates and diatoms for the simulation of phytoplankton dynamics. The ability of dinoflagellates to undergo diel vertical migration and to actively take up nutrients at night greatly improved the prediction of dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll vertical structures. The concept of using spores and cysts as primary sources for algal blooming is discussed using numerical tank simulations.

B	Ji, ZG; Morton, MR; Hamrick, JH		Spaulding, ML		Ji, ZG; Morton, MR; Hamrick, JH			Modeling hydrodynamic and water quality processes in a reservoir	ESTUARINE AND COASTAL MODELING, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Estuarine and Coastal Modeling	NOV 03-05, 2003	Monterey, CA				GRAINED SEDIMENT TRANSPORT; LAKE OKEECHOBEE; RIVER; SIMULATION; FRONT	Despite the progress in three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic, water quality, and sediment diagenesis models and their successful applications in estuaries and bays, few similar 3D modeling studies on lakes and reservoirs have been published. In this study, a 3D hydrodynamic and water quality model has been developed and applied to Lake Tenkiller, Oklahoma. The model includes coupled hydrodynamic, eutrophication, and sediment diagenesis processes. Lake Tenkiller is a manmade reservoir up to 45 meters deep. The lake measures 48 kilometers (km) long, up to 3 in wide, and 70 km(2) in area. Its major water quality issues include nutrient enrichment, eutrophication, and hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. With large lateral variations, the lake needs a 3D model to simulate the hydrodynamic and water quality processes in detail. The model has 198 horizontal grid cells and 10 vertical layers. Measured data at 14 stations from February 1986 to September 1986 are available for hydrodynamic and water quality model calibration, including water elevation, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, 5-day biochemical oxygen demand, orthophosphorus, and nitrate-nitrogen. Comparisons between the modeled results and the measured data for all parameters were satisfactory. Seasonal variations of water quality variables in the lake were well replicated. A series of test cases was conducted to illustrate the importance of 3D modeling of lake hydrodynamic and eutrophication processes. It is shown that lake stratification and wind forcing are two major hydrodynamic processes controlling the hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. A seiche signal with a period of 2.36 hours is found in the lake. Theoretical estimation, time series plots, and the Fourier analysis all consistently support this finding. The model is used as a tool for water quality management in the lake.

From a set of water quality model scenarios with different nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and sediment (S) loads, a relationship between a water quality index (W) and the loading-constituents N-P-S, i.e., W = f (N, P, S), in a designated-use-area, can be established through regression. In a designated-use-area, we may obtain a percentage of non-attainment (or violation, V) of a water quality criterion accumulated over time and water-volume versus the entire simulated time and volume for a model scenario. From a set of model scenarios, a relationship between W and V, i.e., W = g(V), can be established. The value of the water quality index (Wo) equivalent to near-zero violation (Vo) of the criteria can be projected, i.e., Wo = g(Vo). Using W = We as a constraint for the function W = f(N, P, S), we can plot a 3-dimensional surface of minimum water quality attainment, Wo, versus N, P, and S loads for the designated-use-area. This surface divides the 3-dimensional N-P-S "loading volume" into regions of attainment and non-attainment of the water quality criterion in the designated-use-area. This plot can be used to analyze tradeoffs among N-P-S load reductions that still ensure attainment of the water quality criteria, providing useful information for optimal nutrient and sediment controls in water quality management.

The study area was a coastal lagoon system located in the southwest of Turkey. Yuvarlakcay Creek is one of the important streams within the selected watershed joining to Koycegiz Lake, which, in turn, connects to the Mediterranean Sea through the lagoon channel. A computational framework was developed to estimate the stream's water quality. In the first step, data analysis was carried out with data available on the stream (such as flow rate and water quality) and its watershed (such as land use) and analyzed. In the second step, the nutrient loads from the diffuse sources to the stream were calculated. In the third step, the appropriate mathematical models for stream water quality simulations were selected after comprehensive surveys. QUAL2E and WASP/EUTRO models, developed by US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were found to be appropriate for steady-state and dynamic simulations, respectively. The fourth step was the model calibration and verification. The model can be used to estimate both the current water quality of the Yuvarlakcay Creek and its nutrient loads carried to Koycegiz Lake. These data calculated can be used for developing future scenarios. The methodology and computational framework referred in this study forms a guideline that may be utilized for small streams.

The highest load of suspended sediments is from the Missouri watershed (58 mt km(2) yr(-1)), which is also the largest among the six major sub-basins. The Ohio watershed delivers the largest load of water (38%). The Upper Mississippi has the largest total nitrogen load (32%) and yield (1120 kg TN km(2) yr(-1)). The loading of organic carbon, total phosphorus and silicate from the Upper Mississippi and Ohio watersheds are similar and relatively high (range 2.1 - 2.5, 0.068 - 0.076, and 0.8 - 1.1 mt km(2) yr(-1), respectively). The yields of suspended sediments, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and silicate from the Lower Mississippi watershed are disproportionately the highest for its area, which is the smallest of all the watersheds and has the weakest monitoring network. The loading from the Red and Arkansas watersheds are of lesser importance than the others for most parameters investigated. The total nitrogen loading to coastal waters increased an additional 150% since the early 1900s, and is now dominated by loads from the Upper Mississippi watershed, rather than the previously dominant Ohio watershed. An analysis of trends for 1973 - 1994 suggests variability among years, rather than uni-directional change for most variables among 11 key stations. Explanatory relationships were established or confirmed to describe TN and TP loadings in terms of the now largely human-created landscape arising mostly over the last 150 years.

The upwelling event occurred on September 11, 2002, in response to a wind event of average wind speed of similar to 10 m s(-1) that extended over an interval of 11 hours along the main axis of the lake. Longitudinal differences in temperature ( T) and dissolved oxygen ( DO) documented for the lake's surface waters during the upwelling event were 5.7degreesC and 10 mg l(-1). DO concentrations < 1 mg l(-1) were observed in surface waters at the windward end of the lake. Oxidation of reduced oxygen-demanding by-products of anaerobic metabolism supplied to the upper waters from stratified layers during the event contributed to a loss of DO from the lake. Review of historic lake stratification, water quality related to oxygen resources, and long-term wind data indicate upwelling events with coupled deleterious impacts on DO resources have not been rare; at least 14 such events are estimated to have occurred over the 1990 - 2002 interval. The documented event probably represents a worst case for oxygen impacts for this period. An underway rehabilitation program, that will reduce anthropogenic phosphorus loading and implement hypolimnetic oxygenation, may ameliorate the impacts of upwelling events on the DO resources of the lake.

Measured data included subsurface drainage flows, NO3-N concentrations and loads in subsurface drainage water, and corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] yields. The dominant soil within this field was Webster (fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Endoaquolls) and cropping system was corn-soybean rotation. The model was calibrated with 1992 data and was validated with 1993 to 1997 data. Simulations of subsurface drainage flow closely matched observed data showing model efficiency of 99% (EF = 0.99), and difference (D) of 1% between measured and predicted data. The model simulated NO3-N losses with subsurface drainage water reasonably well with EF = 0.8 and D = 13%. The simulated corn grain yields were in close agreement with measured data with D < 10%. Nitrogen-scenario simulations demonstrated that corn yield response function reached a plateau when N-application rate exceeded 90 kg ha(-1). Fraction of applied N lost with subsurface drainage water varied from 7 to 16% when N-application rate varied from 30 to 180 kg ha-1 after accounting for the nitrate loss with no-fertilizer application. These results indicate that the RZWQM has the potential to simulate the impact of N application rates on corn yields and NO3-N losses with subsurface drainage flows for agricultural fields in central Iowa.

Amending poultry litter with alum [Al-3(SO4)(2).14H(2)O] has received considerable attention as a method of economically reducing ammonia volatilization in the poultry house and soluble phosphorus in runoff waters. The objective of this study was to characterize the effect of alum on broiler litter decomposition and N dynamics under laboratory conditions. Litter that had been amended with alum in the poultry house after each of the first four of five flock cycles (Experiment I) and litter that had been amended with alum after removal from a poultry house after the third flock cycle (Experiment II) were compared with unamended litter in separate studies. The litters in Experiment I were surface-applied to simulate application to grasslands, while the litters in Experiment II were incorporated to simulate application to conventionally tilled crops. The only statistically significant differences in decomposition due to alum occurred early in Experiment 11 and the differences were small. The only statistically significant differences in net N mineralization, soil inorganic N, and soil NH4+-N in either experiment was found in Experiment I after 70 d of incubation where soil inorganic N was significantly greater for the alum treatment. Thus, alum had little effect on decomposition or N dynamics. Results of many of the studies on litter not amended with alum should be applicable to litters amended with alum to reduce P availability.

The removal efficiencies removal rates of nutrients (N, P), and their specific growth rate were estimated As a function of inflow loading rate and hydraulic retention time (HRT) in a hydroponic culture system. Weight specific growth rates (WSGR) of P. japonica increased by 0.015 d(-1) in the ambient concentrations of NH4-N, NO3-N, and PO4-P and increased up to 9 times higher than the control (i.e., base concentration), whereas the WSGR decreased at the higher levels of nutrients under the same nutrient concentrations, the WSGR in the S. gracilistyla increased up to 9 times higher than the control, and then increased slowly. Nutrient removal efficiencies of both species were higher under. lower N and P concentrations and longer HRT conditions. The. removal rate. of P. japonica had a positive functional relation with surface loading rates of nutrients and leveled off at 3.0 g d(-1) of NH4-N, 12.5 g d(-1) of NO3-N, and 3.0 g d(-1) of PO4-P, respectively. The removal rate of S. gracilistyla also enhanced at the surface loading of 5 g d(-1) of NH4-N, 23 g d(-1) of NO3-N, and 5 g d(-1) of PO4-P, respectively, but was lower than that of P. japonica. It is concluded that the nutrient removal approach using the riparian plants may be used for efficient water quality management in the eutrophic streams with long HRT.

A two-dimensional, laterally averaged, finite-difference hydrodynamic, and water quality model was applied to simulate water quality conditions in the reservoir to determine appropriate strategies for the management of water quality. Data collected in the field for a two-year period were utilized to calibrate and verify the model. The model calibration and verification were achieved with water surface elevation, temperature, and water quality constituents such as nutrients, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll a. Then the model was used to simulate chlorophyll a concentrations under several scenarios corresponding to various waste load reduction ratios. A 90% reduction of nutrient loadings will upgrade the existing eutrophic/mesotrophic conditions to oligotrophic condition in both 2001 and 2002, exception January in 2001. The modeling effort had yielded valuable information that can be used by decision maker for the evaluation of different management strategies of reduction of nutrients coming from the catchment area.

This paper presents the parameters (NO3- -N, NO2- -N, Kjeldahl-N, non-ionic ammonia, P-PO4 and TP) determined at 16 sampling sites from 1997 to 1999. The dominant soluble nitrogen form was NO3- -N followed by Kjeldahl-N, NO2- -N and non-ionic ammonia. Mean values of NO3- -N, NO2- -N, Kjeldahl-N and non-ionic ammonia ranged from 0.50 to 2.37 mg/L, 0.022 to 0.084 mg/L, 0.33 to 0.99 mg/L and 0.007 to 0.092 mg/L respectively. Mean values of P-PO, at most sampling sites were higher than 0.1 mg/L for subject to eutrophication. The major factors influencing the concentrations of N and P might be agricultural runoff, municipal and industrial effluents. In addition, 6 kinds of soil were sampled at the area where would inundated after the dam completed. Two approaches were adopted to simulate the N and P release from the inundated soils. The results showed that the soils would release nitrogen and phosphorus to the overlying water when the soils were inundated. The characteristics of soil affected the equilibrium concentrations of N and P between the soil and the overlying water.

The combination of successive correction scheme and geostatistical method was used to get all the values of recent sediment thickness at the 69 x 69 grids in the whole lake. The results showed that there is the significant difference in sediment depth between the eastern area and the western region, and most of the sediments are located in the western shore-line and northern regimes but just a little in the center and eastern parts. The notable exception is the patch between the center and Xishan Island where the maximum sediment depth is more than 4.0 m. This sediment distribution pattern is more than likely related to the current circulation pattern induced by the prevailing wind-forcing in Taihu Lake. The numerical simulation of hydrodynamics can strong support the conclusion. Sediment effects on water quality was also studied and the results showed that the concentrations of TP, TN and SS in the western part are obviously larger than those in the eastern regime, which suggested that more nutrients can be released from thicker sediment areas.

Agricultural catchments and water quality: A phosphorus enigma	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Agricultural productivity; catchments; eutrophication; fertilizer; freshwater; manure; non-point pollution; phosphorus; sediment; soils; water quality; wetlands		Paradoxically, phosphorus (P) is one of the major nutrients required for higher agricultural production as well as the cause of algal blooms (eutrophication) in aquatic (lakes and costal waters) and semi-aquatic (natural wetlands) systems. Scientific advancements in understanding P transport from agricultural catchments to freshwater systems are well recognized to improve water quality. Nutrient loads result in alternation of plant and microbial communities, increased productivity, and nutrient accumulation in many freshwater and coastal water systems. The rates and duration of organic matter accumulations are critical determinants of how P cycle functions within an ecological unit of catchments. Nitrogen (N) is supplied from organic and inorganic sources to maximize agricultural productivity. While applying chemical fertilizers, the input of P can be controlled, however, application of organics including animal manure and biosolids would increase the levels of P along with others concomitants. Vertical as well as lateral movement of P may occur through subsurface soils depending on soil characteristics, especially during high water table periods(1). In recent decades, it is recognized that P losses from agricultural catchments to lakes, rivers, wetlands, etc., are critical for the very existence of these aquatic systems. Healthy lakes, streams and wetlands help conserve biodiversity by creating healthy habitats, and both the communities and governments around the world are in work to restore water quality. This article tries to explain in brief the roles of P in agriculture and water quality, and how farmers can contribute toward effective stewardship of land and water resources. Adoptions of agricultural best management practices (BMPs) and constant updates on techniques for estimation and mitigation of P loading to water bodies are essential to sustaining the soil and water qualities with long-term parity.

J	Hatfield, JL; Prueger, JH				Hatfield, JL; Prueger, JH			Impacts of changing precipitation patterns on water quality	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						conservation practices; drainage; soil management; soil water balance; surface runoff; water quality	SWINE MANURE; PHOSPHORUS; RUNOFF; SOIL; NITROGEN; TILLAGE; NITRATE; LOSSES; TRENDS; METOLACHLOR	Changing climate across the United States has been observed in the increasing intensity and amount of precipitation. One of the predicted areas for this impact is in the upper Midwest or the Corn Belt, and one concern is that current soil management practices in this region may not adequately protect the soil under these changes resulting in water quality impacts. To address this concern, this study was conducted to survey the current literature on the water quality impacts from current soil management practices and evaluate potential impacts on runoff and drainage from soil management practices under a number of precipitation scenarios. Soil management practices, e.g., crop residue, no-tilt, incorporation of manure, provide protection under today's climate. However, increasing precipitation amounts, or frequencies, rapidly decrease the effectiveness of these practices with the deleterious effect being even greater on soils with low water holding capacity and limited depth. The water quality impacts may be even more dramatic with the likelihood of increased surface runoff events. Soil management practices need to be developed and evaluated under precipitation patterns that may represent future scenarios so that producers can begin to adopt these practices into their management programs.

In-lake phosphorus concentration criteria, lake-segment watershed phosphorus load targets, and a Lake Champlain Phosphorus Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) have established reduction goals. Eleven years of tributary and lake phosphorus sampling and streamflow gaging have provided a set of data that can be used to determine preliminary status and trends of progress towards these goals. Phosphorus levels consistently were above in-lake criteria values during 1990-2000 in the Main Lake, South Lake A, Missisquoi Bay, St.Albans Bay, and the Northeast Arm. Significant upward linear phosphorus trends were present during 1990-2000 in Malletts Bay, the Northeast Arm, and St.Albans Bay. A significant downward trend was present in the South Lake B segment. Substantial declines in Vermont point-source loads occurred after 1991. In 2000, the Vermont point-source loads were below the TMDL wasteload allocations in all lake segments except South Lake B and Otter Creek. Substantial declines in New York point-source loads also have occurred since 1991 in most areas, but current loads remain above the TMDL wasteload allocation for the South Lake B, South Lake A, Port Henry, and Main Lake segments. Estimated phosphorus loads have remained above the tributary target loads in all cases, with the exception of the LaPlatte River. The tributary loads estimated in recent years generally were higher than the 1991 base year loads. Eight of the 18 tributaries tested showed significant trends in flow-adjusted concentrations after reconciling results from the mixed and the time-series approaches. The LaPlatte River and Otter Creek, both in Vermont, showed downward trends. These two tributaries also showed the greatest magnitude of change. The Bouquet, Great Chazy, Little Chazy, Salmon and Saranac Rivers, and Putnam Creek, all in New York, showed upward trends. Additional work relating trends to changes occurring in the tributary subbasins is needed to better understand the nature (upward or downward) of the trends and to help determine whether progress is being made in achieving the Lake Champlain.

Total phosphorus (TP) export from 15 study catchments (149-1,396 ha) was measured on 18 dates, representing a range in seasons and hydrologic conditions. Multiple regression models were developed to relate TP export to 14 possible explanatory variables based on land cover/use, quantified using a geographic information system. Most wetland variables had significant (p < 0.10) negative relationships with TP export on at least 1 date. These relationships were strongest on 2 spring snowmelt events, when 31% of the annual TP export from the LaPlatte River basin occurred. Overall, the percentage of nonagricultural poorly and very poorly drained soils was the best representation of phosphorus sinks in the study catchments. Identifying lands with poorly drained soils and no known sources of phosphorus may be a more functional and simpler method of delineating P sinks in the landscape than identifying wetlands using jurisdictional definitions.

GIS software packages (Arc/Info and ArcView) were used to prepare data input for the model and post process the results. The sensitivity of AGNPS parameters was evaluated to determine which most influenced phosphorus sediment loading. Evaluations were conducted to determine. whether calculation processes could be simplified for rapid pollution forecasts. The results showed that pollution could be predicted by varying temporary model data (i.e. precipitation etc.) in the AGNPS model. Lastly, parameter sensitivity showed that phosphorus sediment is most sensitive to soil texture while sediment loss is most sensitive to the SCS curve number.

We conducted a meta-analysis of recent mechanistic aquatic biogeochemical models (153 studies published from 1990 to 2002), to assess their ability to predict spatial and temporal patterns in the physical, chemical and biological dynamics of planktonic systems. The selected modeling studies covered a wide range of model complexity, ecosystem-types, spatio-temporal scales and purposes for model development. Despite the heterogeneous nature of this data set, we were able to identify model behavior trends and illuminate aspects of current modeling practice that need to be reevaluated. Temperature and dissolved oxygen had the highest coefficients of determination (respective median r(2) values were 0.93 and 0.70) and the lowest relative error (median RE < 10%), nutrients and phytoplankton had intermediate predictability (median r(2) values ranging from 0.40 to 0.60 and median RE similar to 40 %), whereas bacteria (median r(2) = 0.06) and zoo-plankton (median RE = 70 %) dynamics were poorly predicted. Longer simulation periods (i.e. months to decades) reduced model predictability, and increased model complexity did not improve fit. Aquatic biogeochemical modelers need to be more consistent in how they apply conventional methodological steps during model development (i.e. sensitivity analysis, validation), and the aquatic modeling community should adopt generally accepted standards of model performance. Recent advancements in data assimilation techniques, the combination of the present family of models with goal functions (derived from non-equilibrium thermodynamics) and the development of models with a stronger physiological basis are promising frameworks for obtaining more accurate simulations of planktonic processes.

Trend analysis and linear mixed-effects regression models were used to assess long-term variation in, and influence of water-quality parameters (modulated by freshwater input) on, the monthly mean abundance of the 2 dominant copepod species Acartia tonsa and Eurytemora affinis. There were no long-term trends in abundance of either copepod species, with the exception of a slight downward trend for A. tonsa in the mesohaline region of the northern Chesapeake Bay. There were no long-term trends in temperature, but there was a downward trend in salinity related to a wet period in the late 1990s. Linear mixed-effects models showed a negative correlation between freshwater input and A. tonsa abundance in the oligohaline region, and no significant relationship between other water-quality parameters and A. tonsa abundance in the mesohaline region. A. tonsa abundance was positively correlated with temperature in the polyhaline region. E. affinis abundance in the oligohaline region was negatively correlated with biovolume of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi and positively correlated with phytoplankton abundance. A negative correlation with salinity and a positive correlation with turbidity were found for E, affinis in the mesohaline region. While years of above-average freshwater input were characterized in the spring by high abundances of E. affinis in the mesohaline region and low abundances of A. tonsa in the oligohaline region, the former may show a lagged response depending on the time and magnitude of the input. Freshwater input appears to be mainly influencing habitat parameters specific to each copepod species and top-down control by predators.

The empirical relationship between nutrient loading (total phosphorus) and phytoplankton standing stock (chlorophyll a) in lakes was described about 30 years ago(3) and is central for managing surface water quality. The efficiency with which biomass and energy are transferred through the food web and sustain the production of higher trophic levels (such as fish) declines with nutrient loading and system productivity(4,5), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that in seston (fine particles in water) during summer, specific omega3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega3-PUFAs), which are important for zooplankton(6-10), are significantly correlated to the trophic status of the lake. The omega3-PUFAs octadecatetraenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid, but not alpha-linolenic acid, decrease on a double-logarithmic scale with increasing total phosphorus. By combining the empirical relationship between EPA-to-carbon content and total phosphorus with functional models relating EPA-to-carbon content to the growth and egg production of daphnids(8), we predict secondary production for this key consumer. Thus, the decreasing efficiency in energy transfer with increasing lake productivity can be explained by differences in omega3-PUFA-associated food quality at the plant-animal interface.

Adding nutrient rich treated wastewater effluent to selected coastal wetlands results in the following benefits: (1) improved effluent water quality; (2) increased accretion rates to help offset subsidence: (3) increased productivity of vegetation; and (4) financial and energy savings of capital not invested in conventional tertiary treatment systems. We present as case studies results from several wetlands that are receiving secondarily treated wastewater in coastal Louisiana. At one site where sedimentation accumulation was measured, rates of accretion increased significantly after wastewater application began in the treatment site (from 7.8 to 11.4 mm yr(-1)) and approached the estimated rate of regional relative sea level rise (RSLR) (12.0 mm yr(-1)). No corresponding increase was observed in an adjacent control site. This suggests that the application of nutrient-rich wastewater can help coastal wetlands survive sea level rise. In the same site, surface water nutrient reduction, from the effluent inflow to outflow (1600m), ranged from 100% for nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) to 66% for total phosphorus (P). At a second site, a forested wetland that has been receiving wastewater effluent for 50 years, N and P were both reduced by more than 90%. Nutrient reduction is due to three main pathways: burial, denitrification and plant uptake. Dendrochronological analysis at the second site revealed that stem growth increased significantly in the treatment site after wastewater applications began, and was significantly greater than an adjacent control site. Similar increases in productivity have been measured in a number of wetland treatment sites. Economic analyses comparing conventional and wetland systems indicate savings range from $500,000 to $2.6 million. In addition there are substantial energy savings. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Dolezal, F; Kvitek, T				Dolezal, F; Kvitek, T			The role of recharge zones, discharge zones, springs and tile drainage systems in peneplains of Central European highlands with regard to water quality generation processes	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH			English	Article						runoff; separation; interflow; nitrate; drainage; agriculture	RECESSION; CATCHMENTS; FLOW	The hydrogeology, runoff generation and water quality generation in old peneplains of Central Europe built by acid crystalline rocks (such as the Bohemo-Moravian Highland) are described and interpreted in terms of a three-zone concept. The recharge zones are located on flat tops of hills and their soils are mostly permeable. It is mainly through them that the shallow groundwater-bearing formations are loaded with nitrate. The groundwater exfiltrates on the lower parts of slopes (in the so-called transient zone) and in narrow valleys (in the discharge zone), creating dispersed springs and waterlogged areas. In addition, the rapid and shallow flow of perched groundwater down the slope, which takes place during wet periods in the recharge zone and, mainly, in the transient zone, leaches the nitrate from the soil directly to the stream, without necessarily being in contact with the permanent groundwater table of the recharge and the transient zones. Discharge and water quality measurements in the Kopaninsky tok experimental catchment (6.7 km(2)) were analysed, using a combination of two runoff separation techniques (a digital filter and a simple conceptual model GROUND). Three runoff components were distinguished (direct runoff, interflow and baseflow). There is a weak but significant positive correlation between the stream nitrate concentration on the one hand and either the interflow or the baseflow on the other hand. There is also a weak but significant negative correlation between the stream nitrate concentration on the one hand and either the ratio of direct runoff to total stream flow or the logarithm of this ratio on the other hand, provided that the cases of zero direct runoff are disregarded. A simple mixing model was used to estimate the characteristic nitrate concentrations of individual runoff components. The interflow has the highest characteristic nitrate concentration and is probably the main stream water polluter with nitrate. The baseflow is identified as the likely second main polluter. The differences in water quality between a drainage outlet and a forest spring indicate the importance of a proper nitrogen management in the recharge zones. It is also concluded that the tile drainage and tillage of formerly waterlogged sites, mainly located in transient zones, reduce the opportunity for denitrification of both baseflow and interflow. The ploughed lands in the recharge zones represent an established basis for local agriculture and cannot be easily set aside. Many such lands have been declared as vulnerable to nitrate pollution in order to protect waters against impacts of risky agricultural practices. It is proposed that some waterlogged and drained sites in the transient and discharge zones are set aside rather than the flat ploughed lands on the hill tops. To increase the denitrification, tile drainage runoff from the transient and the discharge zones should be retarded. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pollutant inputs to streams are indeed a direct function of human activities that can be represented, at least approximately, in terms of land use. Remote sensing is a valuable data source to determine the land use on a catchment. However the land use data obtained by this kind of information are subject to significant uncertainties, including misclassification or categorical uncertainty. This paper presents a method to analyse the impact of the land use categorical uncertainty on the responses of a nitrogen load model at the outlet of a catchment. We use the POL model, a semi-distributed event-based model on a French Mediterranean rural catchment and we focus on agricultural land use. First, the sensitivity analysis realised by simulations considering a uniform land use on the catchment, shows a great sensitivity of the estimated load to the land use change. Second, the categorical land use uncertainty is analysed on a total nitrogen load prediction set calculated with randomly generated land use maps consistent with the confusion matrix that characterizes misclassification of land use. Thus, from 1% to 10% of misclassified agricultural area results in a variation of almost 40% on nitrogen loads for the three studied events. Misclassified areas explain from 46% to 75% of the variance of the estimated nitrogen load. These first results illustrate the importance of sensitivity and uncertainty analyses to improve the confidence of a water quality model and need to be extended to other input data sets.

In some European countries, the application of composts may now be an alternative to the application of inorganic fertilizers because commercial compost production has increased and compost quality has been improved. There is, however, concern that compost amendments may cause increased leaching of nitrogen, trace metals and toxic organic compounds to groundwater. The objective of this study was to assess the risk of ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) leaching following a single compost application to silty and sandy soils in mature beech ( Fagus sylvatica L.), pine ( Pinus silvestris L.) and spruce ( Picea abies Karst.) forests at Solling and Unterlub in Lower Saxony, Germany. Mature compost from separately collected organic household waste was applied to the soil surface at a rate of 6.3 kg m(-2) in the summer of 1997 and changes in NH4+, NO3- and DON concentrations in throughfall and soil water at 10 and 100 cm soil depths were determined for 32 months. The spruce forests had the highest N inputs by throughfall water and the highest N outputs in both the control and compost plots compared with the pine and beech forests. Overall, the differences in total N outputs at 100 cm soil depth between the control and compost plots ranged between 0.3 and 11.2 g N m(-2) for the entire 32-month period. The major leaching of these amounts occurred during the first 17 months after compost amendments, but there was no significant difference in total N outputs (- 0.2 to 1.8 g Nm(-2)) between the control and compost plots during the remaining 15 months. Most of the mineral soils acted as a significant sink for NO3- and DON as shown by a reduction of their outputs from 10 to 100 cm depth. Based on these results, we conclude that application of mature compost with high inorganic N contents could diminish the groundwater quality in the first months after the amendments. A partial, moderate application of mature compost with low inorganic N content to nutrient depleted forest soils can minimize the risk of NO3- leaching.

It entails three modules: (i) a generic, modular substrate-plant-climate model designed to predict crop response to varying climate conditions, fertigation management, water quality and substrate characteristics, (ii) a management module that stores target dry matter and nitrogen accumulation functions and compares them with simulated results from the model, and (iii) a feedback control module that evaluates the quality of certain model predictions based on measurements inside the greenhouse. The objective of the DSS is to derive optimal greenhouse management rules for maintaining growth close to the target value with minimal intervention by the grower. Preliminary tests of the DSS indicate that the system is well calibrated to tomato growth in greenhouses in central Germany and has the potential for simulating tomato growth in closed irrigation loop greenhouses under and zone conditions. The modular structure of the DSS allows the simple replacement of any component by a more sophisticated one when justified. As most greenhouse crops are C3 plants, it is likely that photosynthesis, transpiration, dry matter production (DMP) and nutrient and water uptake models can be adapted to crop-type by parameter modifications. The main differences among crops appear to be dry matter (DM) and nitrogen partitioning and root growth, which have to be well characterized before further refinement of the DMP components.

Fine sediment can affect the light attenuation and adsorption desorption balance thus playing an important role in the ecological cycles of lakes. Various best management practices (BMPs) may be employed to reduce fine sediment load, but methods are needed to link BMPs to improvements in receiving water quality. A water quality module was developed and integrated into a two-dimensional depth-averaged hydrodynamic model, CCHE2D, which also includes a sediment transport module. The mass transport capability was first calibrated and then validated using data from two dye tests. Phytoplankton (as total chlorophyll) was simulated with inputs of nutrients, suspended sediments and related weather information. The impact of fine sediment on phytoplankton concentrations was estimated by the model. The results of a series of numerical experiments showed how the water quality in the lake could be improved due to a hypothetical sediment load reduction.

Dramatic changes in the Black Seais ecosystem and resources are due to natural and anthropogenic causes ( increase in the nutrient and pollutant load of rivers input, industrial and municipal wastewater pollution along the coast, and dumping on the open sea). A scientific management system for protection, conservation and restoration must be based on reliable information on bio-geophysical and geomorphologic processes, coastal erosion, sedimentation dynamics, mapping of macrophyte fields, water quality, climatic change effects. A multitemporal data set consisting of LANDSAT MS S, TM and SAR ERS-1 images was used for comparing and mapping landcover change via change detection. Synergetic use of quasi-simultaneously acquired multi-sensor data may therefore allow for a better approach of change detection of coastal area. The main aim of this paper is to conduct a comprehensive analysis based on existing historical and more recent in situ and remote sensing data to establish the link between phytoplankton bloom development, increasing erosion and diminishing of beaches and related coastal zone harmful phenomena.

Throughout the world the diversity of submerged aquatic vegetation appears to be in decline, although sufficient historical data, of sufficient quantitative quality is lacking. Hyperspectral remote sensing technology, available from low altitude aircraft sensors, may provide a basis to improve upon existing photographic regional assessments and monitoring concerned with the aerial extent and coverage of SAV. In addition, modem low altitude remote sensing may also help in the development of environmental satellite requirements for future satellite payloads. This paper documents several important spectral reflectance signature features which may be useful in developing a protocol for remote sensing of SAV, and which is transferable to other shallow water aquatic habitats around the world. Specifically, we show that the shape or curvature of the spectral reflectance absorption feature centered near the chlorophyll absorption region of (similar to) 675 nm is strongly influenced not only by the relative backscatter region between 530-560 rim, but by a "submerged vegetation red edge" that appears in the 695 to 700 nm region in extremely high density vegetative areas in very shallow waters (= 0.5m depth). This,,aquatic biomass red edge" is also observable in deeper waters where there is a shallow subsurface algal boom as demonstrated in this paper. Use of this submerged aquatic red edge feature will become an important component of SAV remote sensing in shallow aquatic habitats, as well as in phytoplankton-related water quality remote sensing applications of surface phytoplankton blooms.

A hydrodynamic model with a k-epsilon turbulence model and the thermodynamic exchanges at a water surface was firstly tested to reproduce seasonal variations of temperature distributions in the vertical direction. Then the water quality parameters such as phytoplankton (Chlorophyll-a), zooplankton, organic and inorganic nutrients are combined with a water temperature prediction model, using a standard modelling of ecological processes. It was shown that the calculated water quality distributions agree with the observed ones qualitatively, and the model may be applicable to predict the effect of global warming, though further investigations are required to identify the model parameters.

The long-term survey of groundwater quality shows that even below forest floors water quality drops. Nitrate concentrations increased from the typical output levels of forest ecosystems of 2 to 3 mg/l up to 5 to 6 mg/l and more within the last decades. At the landscape level, a prognosis of nitrate concentrations in the groundwater succeeded by using site parameters (critical load exceedance for N, C-stock in the mineral soil (0-30 em), annual precipitation, C/N gradient between humus layer and the upper mineral soil (0-5 cm), Castock in 0-5 cm and pH (KCl) in 10-30 cm) from the statewide Soil Chemical Survey in a multiple linear regression model. This model explained about 60% of the variance in nitrate concentrations in the groundwater. Thus the first step towards closing the gap between locally related process studies and landscape related practical planning is done.

A forest drainage system has been used for a field experiment to study the hydrological parameters associated with the forest stand structure and meteorological conditions, and to estimate the influence of drainage on water quality. The hydrological regime of drained forests on deep peat soils and those on hydromorphic mineral soils differs significantly. The precipitation inputs of N-NH4+, N-NO3-, P-PO43- and K+ into the forest ecosystem exceed their outputs, whereas the losses of Ca2+ and Mg2+ from the forest via ditch runoff exceed their inflow by precipitation water. Annually, the amount of N-NH4+, N-NO3, P-PO43- that has reached the soil via precipitation, is higher in an open area, while the amount of K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ is higher in the precipitation water that has flown through the forest canopy.

Measurements were made of leaching and sorption of nitrogen and phosphorus from corn (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Pastiche) residues placed in solutions containing inorganic nutrients. Variables used were type of residue material, nutrient constituent, solution concentration, and residue I solution contact time. For a given residue material and nutrient constituent, four different solution concentrations were used (PO4-P: 0 to 16 mug mL(-1); NO3-N and NH4 N.- 0 to 24 mug mL(-1)), and changes in solution concentration over five selected residue/solution contact times (25 to 86400 sec) were measured. Soybean and wheat residue contained relatively small amounts of NO3-N and therefore had minimal impact on the NO3-N content of the solutions. An increase in initial solution concentration did not substantially affect PO4-P leaching from corn and soybean residue but caused the amount of NH4-N removed to decrease. As residue solution/contact time increased from 25 to 86400 s (I day), the amount of PO4-P leached from corn and soybean residue consistently increased. Wheat residue sorbed PO4-P with an increase in sorption generally resulting from greater residue solution/contact time. Thus, crop residue materials appear to have the potential to influence the N and P content of runoff through leaching and sorption.

J	Bradford, A; Gharabaghi, B				Bradford, A; Gharabaghi, B			Evolution of Ontario's Stormwater Management Planning and Design guidance	WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA			English	Article						stormwater management; design criteria; receiving water impacts; planning and design guidance; prevention; treatment	RUNOFF; PHOSPHORUS	Ontario's Stormwater Management, Planning and Design Manual released in March 2003 integrates some of the advancements made in stormwater management since the 1994 version of the Manual was published. Perhaps the most significant update is the recognition of in-stream erosion control and water balance objectives in addition to flood and water quality objectives for stormwater management. Specific design criteria which would allow these objectives to be achieved are not set out, but procedures that can assist in the development of criteria based on local watershed and receiving water conditions are described. While refinements will undoubtedly be needed, approaches to designing end-of-pipe facilities to prevent undesirable geomorphic changes are included. Approaches to protect groundwater and baseflow characteristics are also included although guidance on addressing potential trade-offs between groundwater quantity and quality is an additional challenge for the future. Little design guidance is available in Ontario on techniques to mitigate impacts on wetlands, however, developments from other jurisdictions may be transferable. The 2003 Manual promotes an integrated, treatment train approach to stormwater management that emphasizes prevention first, followed by lot-level and conveyance controls and finally, end-of-pipe controls. Some information on better site design techniques is incorporated but in comparison to other jurisdictions, less emphasis has been placed on low-impact development strategies. Ontario's approach to design for water quality (suspended solids) control has evolved little. To complement the prevention and treatment train philosophy, the removal efficiency approach to sizing end-of-pipe facilities needs to be used in conjunction with effluent criteria and/or minimum requirements for source protection. Significant advancements in stormwater modelling over the last decade are not well reflected in the Manual; the limited discussion of modelling focusses on an event-based approach. Whether event or continuous modelling is utilized, Ontario practitioners will need guidance on adapting input data to account for the anticipated effects of climate change. Development of sound guidance on monitoring increasingly complex, multi-objective stormwater management systems and the ecosystems they are designed to protect will be critical to ensure that the knowledge gained from performance evaluations may continue to be utilized to refine the design and management of stormwater systems.

J	Hidaka, T; Tsuno, H				Hidaka, T; Tsuno, H			Development of a biological filtration model applied for advanced treatment of sewage	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						mathematical model; biological filtration; biological nitrogen removal; SS removal	NONSTEADY STATE SIMULATION; DRINKING-WATER BIOFILTERS; NITROGEN REMOVAL; BOM REMOVAL; FILTERS; DENITRIFICATION	A mathematical model of biological filtration process is developed in this paper. A biological filtration process has advantages that filtration action and biological activities are combined in a single reactor with aid of filter media. Both physical and biological functions are incorporated in this developed model to simulate both mechanisms. Backwashing is expressed by the assumption that a mean captured solids concentration is input as data, and a captured solids concentration is kept at that value during each filtration run. The developed model is applied to explain the experimental performance with biological filtration reactors, in which batch cultivation of autotrophic bacteria and continuous treatment of actual sewage are carried out. Its applicability is discussed by comparing the simulated results with the experimental data. This model can favourably estimate maximum accumulation of autotrophic bacteria on the medium in batch cultivation, long-term treatment performance in continuous treatment, details of water quality profiles through the filter bed, and biomass. Required hydraulic retention time for nitrification and an appropriate recirculation ratio in a winter season are discussed with this model. This model predicts that a HRT of 1.1 h or above is required to achieve nitrification with remaining NH4+-N of less than I mgN/L and that an appropriate recirculation ratio is 2-3.

J	Thebault, JM				Thebault, JM			Simulation of a mesotrophic reservoir (Lake Pareloup) over a long period (1983-1998) using ASTER2000 biological model	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						biological model; thermal forcing; reservoir modelling; phytoplankton dynamics; diatoms; nutrients	FRANCE; PHYTOPLANKTON; LAC	Lake Pareloup is studied since 1983. The model ASTER that simulated the ecosystem of the lake during the first phase of the study (1983-1987) has been modified. The new model, called ASTER2000 aims to improve the estimation of the trophic level and the water quality of different reservoirs. To this purpose, NH4, NO3 and O-2 were added as state variables. Affluents and pumping inflow have also been considered in order to consider the evolution of the watershed inflow and the variation from year to year in rainfall and pumping inflow. We have a long data series (1983-1998) that allows testing the model under different hydro-climatic conditions. The model simulates the state variables for this period in a satisfactory way. The evolution of nutrient concentrations differences bound to year-to-year entries are well represented, which would have been impossible with the original model. The addition of variables permits to rely on a larger range of the water quality criteria. In combination with the thermal forcing (temperature and stratification) provided by the EOLE model, ASTER2000, represents a strong and easy tool which could be used on many other reservoirs. The main modification necessitated in such applications concerns the type of diatoms dominating: consumed or not by the zooplankton. It is also indispensable to have input data in line with the structure of the model. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Matsui, S				Matsui, S			Drainage basin security of hazardous chemical fluxe in the Yodo River basin	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	13th Stockholm Water Symposium	AUG 11-14, 2003	Stockholm, SWEDEN	Stockholm Int Water Inst		dioxins; hazardous chemicals; lake biwa; organotins; PCBs; PRTR; Yodo River		The Yodo River basin consists of three major tributary basins (and other small river basins) namely Uji, Katsura and Kizu, which overlap respectively Shiga, Kyoto and Nara prefectures' administrative areas. Lake Biwa, the largest lake in Japan, drains water through the Uji river. The water quality of the lake, in terms of BOD, continuously improved over the last decade. However, the quality in terms of COD did not show any improvement in spite of a large amount of infrastructure finance being introduced. Eutrophication of the lake still continues, showing no improvement in the nitrogen concentration level. Non-point as well as point source control is not strong enough. There is a gap between BOD and COD evaluations of the lake water quality. Hazardous chemical fluxes are estimated based upon PRTR reports of Japan (2001). PCBs are still discharged into the lake, although the report of Shiga Prefecture showed zero discharge. Dace fish monitoring clearly showed that PCB contamination of the fish had not changed since the 1980s in spite of a ban on use and production of PCBs in the 1970s. There is still leakage of PCBs into the lake. The major exposure of dioxins to Japanese is fish rather than meat and eggs. The risk of water contamination must take into consideration not only drinking water safety but also ecological magnification of food chains in water. The ecological health aspect of hazardous chemicals is also important, such as organotins with imposex of sea snails. Finally, public participation in hazardous chemical management is very important using the method of risk communication based upon the annual report of PRTR in Japan.

J	Leuven, RSEW; Willems, FHG				Leuven, RSEW; Willems, FHG			Cumulative metal leaching from utilisation of secondary building materials in river engineering	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Diffuse Pollution	SEP 30-OCT 04, 2002	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	IWA		demolition waste; hydraulic engineering; metal leaching; minestone; phosphorus slag; river pollution; steel slag	COAL-MINING WASTES; REUSE	The present paper estimates the utilisation of bulky wastes (minestone, steel slag, phosphorus slag and demolition waste) in hydraulic engineering structures in Dutch parts of the rivers Rhine, Meuse and Scheldt over the period 1980-2025. Although they offer several economic, technical and environmental benefits, these secondary building materials contain various metals that may leach into river water. A leaching model was used to predict annual emissions of arsenic, cadmium, copper, chromium, lead, mercury, nickel and zinc. Under the current utilisation and model assumptions, the contribution of secondary building materials to metal pollution in Dutch surface waters is expected to be relatively low compared to other sources (less than 0.1% and 0.2% in the years 2000 and 2025, respectively). However, continued and widespread large-scale applications of secondary building materials will increase pollutant leaching and may require further cuts to be made in emissions from other sources to meet emission reduction targets and water quality standards. It is recommended to validate available leaching models under various field conditions. Complete registration of secondary building materials will be required to improve input data for leaching models.

J	Matejicev, L; Benesova, L; Tonika, J				Matejicev, L; Benesova, L; Tonika, J			Ecological modelling of nitrate pollution in small river basins by spreadsheets and GIS	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd European Ecological Modelling Conference	SEP 10-15, 2001	DUBROVNIK, CROATIA			watershed modelling; nitrogen; GIS; remote sensing; non-point source pollution	POINT-SOURCE POLLUTION; LAND; LOSSES	With the increasing importance and awareness of water quality in the small basins, the modelling system is developed for monitoring and predictions of surface water pollution. The compartment model deals with basin characteristics extended by land cover attributes. The parameters of the model are estimated by experimental data of water quality together with land cover types that serve as nutrient detention media or transformers. The study examines methodology to determine the potential areas of nitrate pollution from point and non-point sources by remote sensing techniques. Classification of water, agricultural, forest and urban areas is processed with satellite images (LANDSAT 7). Whereas the agricultural and urban areas act as sources of pollution, forest zones operate as sinks. The nitrate levels are decreased downstream, if the proportion of the forest inside contribution zones increases. The modelling system is used to simulate amounts of nitrates in each compartment of the stream during the monitored period of one year. The number of compartments and their lengths are estimated on the basis of morphology of the basin. Simulation of the dynamic model is carried out with the TabSim. Geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing tools are used to manage and estimate nitrate inflows from point and non-point sources of pollution. The article presents the spatial and time variation of the nitrate (NO3-) within the basin of the stream Rakovnicky (the west part of Bohemia, the whole area of 368 km(2)).

The model is obtained by coupling a finite element hydrodynamic model, that computes the velocity fields of water, an energetic model to compute the water temperature fields, and an ecological model that simulates the dynamic of phytoplankton, zooplankton, nutrients (ammonia, nitrate and phosphate) organic detritus (organic nitrogen, organic phosphorous and CBOD) and dissolved oxygen. The transport model is a two-dimensional barotropic finite element model which allows for a better resolution of the lagoon morphology. The ecological model has been developed by starting from the ecological module EUTRO of WASP (Water Analysis Simulation System released by US EPA), and by adapting it to the peculiarity of the Lagoon of Venice. A reference condition has been identified by running a 1-year simulation under climatologic condition. Then, the sensitivity to physical forcing (tide and wind) and to the input of macronutrients has been investigated, by comparing model predictions of spatial and temporal evolution of major state variables and of an aggregate index of Water Quality Trophic Index (TRIX).

J	Knud-Hansen, CF; Hopkins, KD; Guttman, H				Knud-Hansen, CF; Hopkins, KD; Guttman, H			A comparative analysis of the fixed-input, computer modeling, and algal bioassay approaches for identifying pond fertilization requirements for semi-intensive aquaculture	AQUACULTURE			English	Article						pond fertilization; Nile tilapia; algal bioassay; nutrient limitation; computer models	FISH PONDS; PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; NUTRIENT LIMITATION; FOOD WEBS; PHYTOPLANKTON; TILAPIA; LAKE; RESPONSES; PHOSPHATE; CULTURE	This paper compares three different strategies/treatments for determining fertilization rates for producing natural foods in semi-intensive aquaculture ponds. The first strategy used a predetermined, fixed-input rate of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) based on results from previous yield trials. The second strategy was based on algal nutrient concentrations, and used biweekly water quality measurements in combination with a microcomputer-based expert system, PONDCLASS(C), to determine fertilization rates. The third approach, the algal bioassay fertilization strategy (ABFS), was based on algal growth responses to nutrient [i.e., N, P, and carbon (C)] enrichment, and used weekly, pond-specific algal bioassays to determine both nutrient requirements and associated rates of nutrient inputs. The three fertilization strategies were applied to Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) growout ponds over a 120-day period, with five ponds per treatment. All ponds were fertilized weekly with urea, triple superphosphate, agricultural lime, and/or chicken manure in amounts determined by each strategy. Results indicated that net fish yields (NFYs) were not significantly different (P = 0.094) between treatments, with the fixed-input treatment giving the highest but most variable yields. Average NFYs +/- S.E. (standard error) for the 120-day growout period were 2124 +/- 276, 1476 +/- 151, and 1651 +/- 133 kg ha(-1) for the fixed-input strategy, PONDCLASSC(C), and ABFS treatments, respectively. The relatively lower NFYs for PONDCLASS(C) and ABFS indicate that neither approach maximized fish production. Nitrogen utilization efficiencies of fertilizer inputs were similar for all three strategies. Although the fixed-input approach used approximately 20% more N than the other two approaches, mean algal productivities and NFYs were also proportionally higher with this treatment. This result is consistent with the observation that algal productivities in PONDCLASS(C) and ABFS ponds were nearly always limited by N availability. However, both P utilization and fertilization cost efficiencies were significantly better with PONDCLASS(C) and ABFS than with the fixed-input treatment. The fixed-input approach not only used a higher P input rate than necessary, it did not account for ecological differences between ponds within the same treatment (e.g., nutrient and light limitation of algal productivity, inorganic turbidity, etc.), which can affect a pond's response to fertilization. In particular, the fixed-input treatment did not add carbon to compensate for nonuniform losses in alkalinity, which resulted in relatively high soluble P concentrations in treatment ponds where C availability apparently limited algal productivity. Including C fertilization in the fixed-input treatment would have likely reduced NFY variability and improved P utilization efficiency in those ponds. Because both PONDCLASS(C) and the ABFS adjusted pond-specific fertilization requirements throughout the study, they provided increased fertilization efficiencies and profitability over the fixed-input strategy. However, the ABFS is more practical than PONDCLASS(D for rural application because it is far simpler and does not require water chemistry, computers, laboratory equipment, technical expertise, or electricity to implement. Based on this study, the recommended fertilization strategy designed to achieve cost-efficient, consistently high yields is a modified ABFS approach that uses a fixed-input fertilization rate for N, and algal bioassays to determine time-specific and pond-specific fertilization requirements for P and C.

Secchi depth is still occasionally over 40 m at Lake Tahoe, but mean annual Secchi depth has declined nearly 10 m since 1967, prompting a large-scale restoration program. Year-to-year variability is extremely high, obscuring restoration actions and compliance with water quality standards. The model focused on Secchi depth during summer, when the lake is least transparent and most heavily used. Interannual variability for the summer season is driven largely by precipitation differences. The model offers a means for determining compliance with water quality standards when precipitation anomalies may persist for years. As demonstrated by means of an ex-post forecast, increasing Secchi depths during 1999-2001 were simply climate-driven and do not represent a recovery of the lake. The long-term trend for summer is most likely due to the accumulation of allochthonous mineral suspensoids.

It has been recognized that such models may have a large degree of uncertainty associated with their predictions, and that this uncertainty can significantly impact the utility of the model. In this study, ARRAMIS (Advanced Risk & Reliability Assessment Model) software package was used to analyze the uncertainty of the SWAT2000 (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) outputs concerning nutrients and sediment losses from agricultural lands. ARRAMIS applies Monte Carlo simulation technique connected with Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) scheme. This technique is applied to the Warner Creek watershed located in the Piedmont physiographic region of Maryland, and it provides an interval estimate of a range of values with an associated probability instead of a point estimate of a particular pollutant constituent. Uncertainty of model outputs was investigated using LHS scheme with restricted pairing for the model input sampling. Probability distribution functions (pdfs) for each of the 50 model simulations were constructed from these results. Model output distributions of interest in this analysis were stream flow, sediment, organic nitrogen (organic-N), organic phosphorus (organic-P), nitrate, ammonium, and mineral phosphorus (mineral-P) transported with water. Developed probability distribution functions for the model provided information with desirable probability. Results indicate that consideration of input parameter uncertainty produces 64% less mean stream flow along with approximately 8.2% larger sediment loading than obtained using mean input parameters. On the contrary, mean of outputs regarding nutrients such as nitrate, ammonia, organic-N, and organic-P (but not mineral-P) were almost the same as the one using mean input parameters. The uncertainty in predicted stream flow and sediment loading is large, but that for nutrient loadings is the same as that of the corresponding input parameters. This study concluded that using a best possible distribution for the input parameters to reflect the impact of soils and land use diversity in a small watershed on SWAT2000 model outputs may be more accurate than using average values for each input parameter.

They rely on data that are readily available at farm-gate and field level, and the information generated is easy to communicate to farmers and policy makers. This may have contributed to high expectations on element balances as a tool for optimising agricultural nutrient use efficiency and thereby reducing nutrient losses. Element balances are potentially useful as a screening tool across Europe provided the methods to calculate them are standardised, their limitations and usefulness defined and appropriate target values are established by which they can be compared. It is difficult to establish straightforward relationships between nutrient management, surplus, losses and environmental impact. Simple farm-gate and field balances need to be complemented by a better understanding of the processes regulating nutrient dynamics, and their spatial and temporal variability. Hence, agronomic and environmental reference or target values need to be established for different production systems, geographical areas and elements. Proper instruments and tools as well as training and educational programmes have to be developed for a successful implementation. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	In, SJ; Brannan, KM; Mostaghimi, S				In, SJ; Brannan, KM; Mostaghimi, S			Simulating hydrologic and water quality impacts in an urbanizing watershed	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						nonpoint source pollution; hydrologic modeling; watershed management; urbanization; water quality; HSPF; BASINS	LAND-USE; URBANIZATION; STREAMFLOW	The Hydrologic Simulation Program-Fortran (HSPF) was calibrated and used to assess the future effects of various land development scenarios on water quality in the Polecat Creek watershed in Caroline County, Virginia. Model parameters related to hydrology and water quality were calibrated and validated using observed streamflow and water quality data collected at the watershed outlet and the outlets of two subwatersheds. Using the county's Comprehensive Plan, land use scenarios were developed by taking into account the trends and spatial distributions of future development. The simulation results for the various land use scenarios indicate that runoff volume and peak rate increased as urban areas increased. Urbanization also increased sediment loads mainly due to increases in channel erosion. Constituent loads of total Kjeldal nitrogen, orthophosphorus, and total phosphorous for Polecat Creek watershed slightly decreased under future development scenarios. These reductions are due to increases in urban areas that typically contribute smaller quantities of nitrogen and phosphorous, as compared to agricultural areas. However, nitrate loads increased for the future land use scenarios, as compared to the existing land use. The increases in nitrate loads may result from increases in residential land and associated fertilizer use and concurrent decreases in forested land. The procedures used in this paper could assist local, state, and regional policy makers in developing land management strategies that minimize environmental impacts while allowing for future development.

The lake was used as a source of cooling water and for the disposal of ionic (Cl-, Na+, and Ca2+) waste, related solids and spent cooling water. At peak production the facility discharged similar to1.3 x 10(6) metric tons of ionic waste to the lake annually. The soda ash facility had a profound impact on these ecosystems, by severely altering their structure and function. Portions of the two largest tributaries to the lake have been degraded from solids deposition associated with solution mining for NaCl (process reactant) and precipitation of Ca2+ waste (as CaCO3). The cooling water operation recycled phosphor-us enriched hypolimnetic waters to the epilimnion. Ionic waste impacts on the lake and river included: (1) high salinity (S-3parts per thousand), (2) plunging inflows made dense by high S, that altered fundamental features of the lake's stratification regime and exacerbated the problem of severe dissolved oxygen (DO) depletion, (3) S-based density stratification and severe DO depletion over a 14 km reach of the river downstream of the take, and (4) high levels of CaCO3 precipitation that reduced clarity, increased net sedimentation in pelagic areas, altered the character of near-shore sediments, and reduced alkalinity and pH. These impacts on the take's chemistry and physical properties had profound effects on biological communities, including: (1) altered composition, (2) reduced richness and diversity, (3)limited macrophyte occurrence, (4) enhanced phytoplankton production, and (5) limited effectiveness of zooplankton grazing, thereby preventing intervals of high clarity. Closure of the facility resulted in dramatic improvements in water quality and ecological characteristics of these systems. Further improvement is expected as residual ionic waste loads decrease.

Advances in analytical techniques now permit the systematic study of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and this work has shown that DON is quantitatively significant in many waters. This article describes the sampling and analytical protocols required for rapid, precise and reliable determinations of DON, involving high-temperature catalytic oxidation (HTCO), coupled to chemiluminescence detection. This approach simultaneously determines dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), and DON is derived by subtraction of DIN measured by colorimetry. The DON determination is simple to perform, exhibits excellent precision (<1% for C and 1.5% for N) and is applicable to a wide range of natural waters. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

These water bodies provide the population with an adequate supply of drinking water and support most of the irrigation requirements of local agriculture. Moreover, they respond to the Mediterranean climate, with sequential, seasonally predictable events of flooding and drying and whose intensity varies markedly between years. As a consequence of summer drought and the policy to meet water demand throughout the season, the reservoirs experience massive dewatering, resulting in a reduction in the spring storage volume of 90%. Thus, they start the hydrological season as water bodies deep enough to form stable stratification but a thermocline has generally disappeared by the middle of summer and, as a consequence of the intense drawdown, they are transformed into shallow water bodies. This dual behaviour, driven by a progressive and conspicuous depth decrease, interferes with nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics, enhancing eutrophication phenomena and contributing to the selection of planktic cyanobacteria that are potentially dangerous to human health.

J	Carvalho, L; Kirika, A				Carvalho, L; Kirika, A			Changes in shallow lake functioning: response to climate change and nutrient reduction	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Limnology of Shallow Lakes	MAY 25-30, 2002	BALATONFURED, HUNGARY	Veszprem Univ, Acad Sci & Dept Limnol, Balaton Linmol Inst Hungarian		climate change; Daphnia; eutrophication; lake; phytoplankton	WATER	Nutrient, phytoplankton and zooplankton dynamics have been monitored intensively at Loch Leven for 34 years. The data collected reveal a decline in phosphorus concentrations, following major reductions in external nutrient loading, and large changes in its seasonal availability, particularly in recent years. More striking has been an increasing trend in water temperatures, annual means increasing by about 1degreesC over the 34 years, with even greater increases observed for winter and spring periods. In response to these changes, there has been a general pattern of decline in measures of phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll, concentrations). Closer inspection reveals that the detailed response is, however, not so consistent with the environmental trends. A significant decline in chlorophyll, concentrations occurred early on in the time series, before major reductions in nutrient availability. Correlation analysis revealed that this decline was associated with the re-appearance of Daphnia grazers. Further declines are only apparent in very recent years; correlation analysis and comparison of trends suggest that these were associated with the observed decline in nutrient concentrations. There was little correlation and no consistent relationship between annual measures of chlorophyll, and water temperature, but winter mean values did show a consistent positive relationship. Spring Daphnia densities showed an even stronger, and significant, positive relationship with spring water temperatures. It is clear from this that the scale of climate change predicted in the future will significantly alter the functioning of shallow lakes and seasonal patterns in water quality. This is a particular concern in Europe with the implementation of the EC Water Framework Directive, as if the net effect of global warming on annual measures of water quality is negative, the principle aim of 'good status' in all surface waters by 2016 will become even more difficult to achieve.

J	Al-Kaisi, MM; Yin, XH				Al-Kaisi, MM; Yin, XH			Effects of nitrogen rate, irrigation rate, and plant population on corn yield and water use efficiency	AGRONOMY JOURNAL			English	Article							SOUTHWESTERN COLORADO; SOIL CORES; MANAGEMENT; NITRATE	Improper N and irrigation management are major factors contributing to water quality and shortage problems in the Great Plains. This study was conducted on the Irrigation Research Farm in Yuma, CO, from 1,998 through 2000 to establish an accurate irrigation and N management system for corn (Zea mays L.) production in the Great Plains aimed at high yield and water use efficiency (WUE) simultaneously. A field experiment was conducted on a center-pivot-irrigated, well-drained Haxtun sandy loam soil (fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Pachic Argiustolls) by using a randomized complete block split-split plot design, with irrigation rates [0.60, 0.80, and 1.00 of the estimated evapotranspiration (ET)], N fertility rates (30, 140, 250, and 360 kg ha(-1), including N from soil, fertilizer, and irrigation water), and plant populations (57 000, 69 000, and 81000 plants ha(-1)) as the main-plot, split-plot, and split-split plot treatments, respectively. A combination of 0.80ET to 1.00ET, 140 to 250 kg N ha(-1), and 57 000 to 69 000 plants ha(-1) population provided optimum corn yield. Irrigation treatment 0.80ET, accompanied by 140 to 250 kg N ha(-1), and 57 000 to 69 000 plants ha(-1) population was the best management system for optimum WUE. No significant differences in water extraction from the soil profile for the entire season and soil moisture content at harvest between the 0.80ET and 1.00ET irrigation treatments were additional indications that 0.80ET is superior to 1.00ET. To preserve the Ogallala Aquifer, the best management system aimed at optimum WUE should be used for corn production in the Great Plains region.

J	Richardson, TL; Jackson, GA; Burd, AB				Richardson, TL; Jackson, GA; Burd, AB			Planktonic food web dynamics in two contrasting regions of Florida Bay, US	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article							DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; INVERSE MODEL ANALYSIS; COPEPOD ACARTIA-TONSA; HETEROTROPHIC BACTERIA; TAKAPOTO ATOLL; EGG-PRODUCTION; WATER-QUALITY; CARBON; MARINE; LIMITATION	Florida Bay is a shallow, lagoonal estuary located at the southern tip of Florida. An inverse analysis approach was used to examine carbon flows and trophic interactions in the planktonic system of two contrasting regions of Florida Bay, the eastern and north-central regions. The eastern region has relatively low phytoplankton concentrations, while the north-central region exhibits sporadic blooms of the picoplanktonic cyanobacterium Synechococcus. The overall goal of the study was to obtain a biologically realistic planktonic food web for Florida Bay that can be coupled to results of seagrass modeling and studies of inter-basin exchange. Estimated rates of carbon flow through the planktonic food webs differed greatly between regions, but not between seasons. Assumptions about the food preferences of the microzooplankton resulted in different paths of carbon through the food web, but had relatively little effect on total export from the planktonic system. The microbial loop played an important role in carbon cycling through the food webs of both the eastern and north-central regions. Despite active recycling, calculated carbon export rates were high from the north-central region (82-128 mg C m(-3) d(-1)); export from the eastern region was lower by a factor of 12-14. Production by small (< 5 JAM) phytoplankton accounted for the majority of carbon exported from the north-central region. The contribution of the picoplankton to export from this region contrasts with their more conventional role in recycling of organic matter within the water column. The inverse models helped identify gaps in knowledge of the Florida Bay planktonic ecosystem, and pointed to areas for future research including the characterization of protozoan bacterivory and the extent of microzooplankton grazing on picoplanktonic cyanobacteria versus heterotrophic bacteria.

Moreover, uncertainty of damage due to variations in pollution loads is usually ignored in analyses of international environmental cooperation. This paper analyses the allocation of abatement of nitrogen emissions among the countries surrounding the Baltic Sea as well as the corresponding distribution of the net benefits of abatement. The paper develops a simple model that accounts for uncertainty in the degradation of water quality and, hence in abatement impacts, due to the diffusion of nitrogen pollutants in the drainage basins to the coastal waters because of coastal and marine transports of the deposited nitrogen and variation in background depositions. The empirical analysis shows that no country incurs negative net benefits. Moreover, we find that the allocation of abatement and the distribution of net benefits among countries change significantly for higher risk aversion. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To reduce pollution of the Baltic Sea, Sweden has implemented a comprehensive scheme of nitrogen abatement instruments; a uniform nitrogen fertilizer tax, green payments (subsidies), and land-use regulations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative cost-efficiency of the scheme and to analyze the implications of agricultural policy for the least-cost solution. Due to the expanse and heterogeneity of the study area, a spatially distributed nonlinear mathematical programming model, which linked changes in agricultural production practices on crop farms in Southern Sweden to coastal nitrogen load, was developed. Spatial variation in physical parameters, production costs, and the fate and transport of nitrogen were accounted for. Interactions between agricultural and nitrogen policy were shown to occur. Least-cost abatement measures changed radically with and without agricultural policy. Nitrogen policy can be construed as simply correcting for pollution induced by agricultural policy.

J	Hiscock, JG; Thourot, CS; Zhang, J				Hiscock, JG; Thourot, CS; Zhang, J			Phosphorus budget - land use relationships for the northern Lake Okeechobee watershed, Florida	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						phosphorus budget; import and export; nutrient management; land use; water quality; landscape characteristics; GIS; Lake Okeechobee watershed		Eutrophication of Lake Okeechobee, Florida, has been accelerated by excessive phosphorus (P) loading to the lake from land use practices involving phosphorus-containing materials. Average annual P budgets were estimated for each of the 25 tributary basins in the northern Lake Okeechobee watershed for current land uses and land use practices. Phosphorus import, export, and net import coefficients in terms of kg P ha(-1) per year were determined for each land use being practiced in the watershed based on landowner surveys and literature data. The net P coefficient for each land use was applied to the appropriate land use area with a Geographic Information System (GIS) to obtain a basin-wide P budget. Phosphorus runoff load was estimated based on measured data and literature values of P concentrations and runoff estimates for each land use. The P loads to the lake were measured at discharge structures from each basin. On-site P storage and wetland assimilation values were estimated using a mass balance approach for each basin. For the northern Lake Okeechobee watershed, total net P imports from land use activities were estimated at 1717 metric tonnes (t) per year, which is about 28% lower than the previous P budget conducted in 1991. Other P import, export, and storage components were obtained, and results were compared with the previous budget data. Linear regression was performed to determine which basin/landscape characteristics influence lake loading. Runoff phosphorus, the amount of developed land, and net P imports had the strongest correlation when related to lake loading. Using multiple linear regression, the annual changes in P retention correlated well with net P import intensity and stream/canal density, and the net P import and length of streams/canals correlated well with lake loading.

This paper is a further analysis of data from four experiments carried out in that framework, to explore periphyton, fish and fertilizer dose effects on water quality. Factor analysis and ANOVA models applied to a data matrix of water quality parameters in ponds with and without artificial substrates (bamboo poles and kanchi sticks), with and without fish (filter feeders catla and rohu, with and without bottom feeder kalbaush), and with a standard or 50% increased fertilizer dose, allowed us to identify the underlying ecological processes governing this novel periphyton-based pond system, and construct conceptual graphic models of the periphyton-environment relationships observed. We clearly established that the phosphorus flow is mainly linked to phytoplankton activity in the water column and decomposition on the pond bottom, while nitrogen flow is mainly linked to autotrophic (photosynthesis) and heterotrophic (decomposition and nitrification) processes that take place in the periphyton in addition to the water column and pond bottom. Consequently, disruption of the pond bottom by bottom feeding fish primarily promoted phosphate cycling and phytoplankton, while periphyton development on the supplied substrates and fertilization mainly improved oxygen balance and nitrogen related processes developing in the water column. The use of bamboo poles led to better results than kanchi sticks, related to the greater autotrophic periphyton development on bamboo and to the larger surface of bamboo poles that facilitate fish grazing and periphyton dislodgment that in turn have a renewal effect on periphyton. Stocking bottom feeding fish produces a fertilizing effect through the food web that benefits the filter-feeding fish and that makes it unnecessary to increase the dose of inorganic and organic fertilizers applied to the ponds. Thus, the output of this analysis will help the fish farmers in resource constrained countries to improve their production in periphyton-based ponds just by choosing bamboo substrates, stocking a bottom feeder fish together with the filter feeders, and saving money on fertilizers.

Among the forestry activities, draining of wetlands had the most pronounced impacts on sediment, nutrient, and metal loading in the past. At present, renovation of old ditches and fertilization of peatlands constitute the major risk of forestry-induced diffuse pollution. Contemporary forestry aims at decreasing this risk with various riparian buffer strip designs. Among such designs, creation of overland flow areas by plugging the outlet ditches is increasingly used. Our objectives were to evaluate the potential of constructed overland flow areas to function as riparian buffers and estimate the quality and quantity of diffuse pollution from old versus recent forest drainages. We studied retention and release of pollutants from 20 constructed, 2- to 10-m-wide overland flow areas receiving drainage water from forested peatlands. Drainage waters were sampled above and below the plugged ditches three times per year from 1998 to 1999. Chemical oxygen demand and nutrient and metal loads and concentrations varied strongly between seasons, years, and drainage areas. Areas subjected to recent ditch renovations and fertilizations had clearly elevated seasonal loads and concentrations of total phosphorus (TP), PO4, Fe, and A in comparison to old treatment areas. Especially TP loads were high above the national average values measured for forestry-induced diffuse pollution. In general, water quality above and below the buffer strips did not differ significantly. Our results indicate that plugged outlet ditches and associated narrow overland flow areas do not function as proper buffers in peatland areas.

Concern has been expressed that wastewater nutrients may be escaping from the saline groundwater system into canals and surrounding coastal waters and perhaps to the reef tract 10 km offshore, promoting unwanted algal growth and degradation of water quality. We performed a field study of the fate of wastewater-derived nitrate in the subsurface of a Florida Keys residential community (Key Colony Beach, FL) that uses this disposal method, analyzing samples from 21 monitoring wells and two canal sites. The results indicate that wastewater injection at 18-27 m depth into saline groundwater creates a large buoyant plume that flows quickly (within days) upward to a confining layer 6 m below the surface, and then in a fast flow path toward a canal 200 in to the east within a period of weeks to months. Low-salinity groundwaters along the fast flow path have nitrate concentrations that are not significantly reduced from that of the injected wastewaters (ranging from 400 to 600 mumol kg(-1)). Portions of the low-salinity plume off the main axis of flow have relatively long residence times (>2 months) and have had their nitrate concentrations strongly reduced by a combination of mixing and denitrification. These waters have dissolved N(2) concentrations up to 1.6 times air-saturation values with delta(15)N[N(2)] = 0.5-5parts per thousand, delta(15)N[NO(3)(-)] = 16-26parts per thousand, and calculated isotope fractionation factors of about -12+/-4parts per thousand, consistent with denitrification as the predominant nitrate reduction reaction. Estimated rates of denitrification of wastewater in the aquifer are of the order of 4 mumol kg(-1) N day(-1) or 0.008 day(-1). The data indicate that denitrification reduces the nitrate load of the injected wastewater substantially, but not completely, before it discharges to nearby canals. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sharpley, A; Kleinman, P				Sharpley, A; Kleinman, P			Effect of rainfall simulator and plot scale on overland flow and phosphorus transport	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							WATER-QUALITY; SOUTHERN PLAINS; RUNOFF; NITROGEN; CULTURE; SOILS	Rainfall simulation experiments are widely used to study erosion and contaminant transport in overland flow. We investigated the use of two rainfall simulators designed to rain on 2-m-long (2-m(2)) and 10.7-m-long (32.6-m(2)) plots to estimate overland flow and phosphorus (P) transport in comparison with watershed-scale data. Simulated rainfall (75 mm h(-1)) generated more overland flow from 2-m-long (20 L m(2)) than from 10.7-m-long (10 L m(2)) plots established in grass, no-till corn (Zea mays L.), and recently tilled fields, because a relatively greater area of the smaller plots became saturated (>75% of area) during rainfall compared with large plots (<75% area). Although average concentrations of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in overland flow were greater from 2-m-long (0.50 mg L-1) than 10.7-m-long (0.35 mg L-1) plots, the relationship between DRP and Mehlich-3 soil P (as defined by regression slope) was similar for both plots and for published watershed data (0.0022 for grassed, 0.0036 for no-till, and 0.0112 for tilled sites). Conversely, sediment, particulate phosphorus (PP), and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and selective transport of soil fines (<2 mum) were significantly lower from 2- than 10.7-m-long plots. However, slopes of the logarithmic regression between P enrichment ratio and sediment discharge were similar (0.281-0.301) for 2- and 10.7-m-long plots, and published watershed data. While concentrations and loads of P change with plot scales, processes governing DRP and PP transport in overland flow are consistent, supporting the limited use of small plots and rainfall simulators to assess the relationship between soil P and overland flow P as a function of soil type and management.

J	Guo, LG; Li, ZJ				Guo, LG; Li, ZJ			Effects of nitrogen and phosphorus from fish cage-culture on the communities of a shallow lake in middle Yangtze River basin of China	AQUACULTURE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on Management of Aquaculture Effluents	MAY 06-09, 2002	HONOLULU, HAWAII			fish-cage culture; nitrogen; phosphorus; shallow lake; communities	IMPACT	In recent decades, net-cage aquaculture has become one of the main patterns of the intensive fish-culture in the lakes, reservoirs and even rivers in China. This aquaculture pattern results in enriching exogenous nutrients in water and, consequently, accelerates the process of lake eutrophication. To ensure that normal environmental conditions and fisheries in a lake remain sustainable, qualitative estimations of nutrients in relation to ecosystem changes are essential. A study, mainly on nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) influences due to cage fish-culture was carried out in a shallow 35.5 ha bay in Niushanhu Lake, a shallow lake located in middle Yangtze Basin, during the period from March to December 2000. Net-cages in total covered an area of 1000 m(2) and the annual fish yield was 16.0 metric tons (MT). Fish feeding residue entering the water during the period was equivalent to 1532.9 kg of total N and 339.2 kg of total P. Sampling and analyses of the total N and total P concentrations, diversity and biomass of plankton and Chi a were made monthly, while data on zoobenthos were collected twice, respectively, at the beginning and the end of the study. Results showed that the Chi a content in water was correlated negatively to distance from the cage. The Chi a content that is converted into wet biomass of phytoplankton may be expressed by the regression: B = 2.673 - 0.0016D (B, biomass in mg/l; D, distance in km, r=0.9362; n=7). The biomass of rotifers inside or near the cages was higher than that in areas more distant, while that of the cladocerans was the opposite. No significant difference of copepod density or biomass was detected between cages and open water. Changes of zoobenthic community were remarkable. At the beginning of fish farming, there were nine zoobenthic taxa inside and 13 outside the cages. Only two saprophilous taxa, chiefly oligochaetes, were present in the cages at the end of the culture. Density and biomass of benthic animals decreased as well. Several bioindices, such as Shannon-Wiener index, Simpson index, and Margelef index, also exhibited a declining tendency. Through this study, the authors are of the opinion that mass-input of exogenous nutrients may cause negative effects on water quality in areas from the cage to a distance of 50 m outwards.

A non-hydrostatic hydrodynamic model featuring very large eddy simulation (VLES) concepts, combined with ecological components that consider three types of phytoplankton species, one zooplankton, and nutrient cycling in each grid, is developed as the basic component of the research. Nitrogen and phosphorus loads from I I I sub-basins that supply Lake Biwa are set as the boundary condition for the numerical simulation. The chlorophyll a concentration calculated near the water intake, weighted in proportion to the intake discharge, is set as the water quality index. Transferable discharge permits are introduced for estimating the total reduction cost for achieving the objective water quality. Two types of scenario are tested: one considers the difference in location of nutrient reduction in the north and south basins, and the other ignores this difference. Initially, the effect of nutrient loads on the water quality of Lake Biwa was calculated using the Biwa3D model, using estimated nitrogen and phosphorus loads from the basin as the boundary condition. Transferable discharge permits were then designed according to the impact factor on each basin calculated by the model in order to compare the cost-effectiveness of the reduction scenarios. It is concluded that consideration of the characteristics of each basin and the distribution of effluent in designing transferable discharge permits reduces the total costs by around 4-25% of that required for achieving the target concentration of chlorophyll a.

J	Park, SS; Na, YM; Uchrin, CG				Park, SS; Na, YM; Uchrin, CG			An oxygen equivalent model for water quality dynamics in a macrophyte dominated river	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						water quality model; macrophyte; diurnal dissolved oxygen; nutrient recycle; river; QUAL2E	GROWTH	A water quality modeling study was performed in a macrophyte dominated river. A computer model, MACRIV (macrophyte growing river) was formulated to incorporate diurnal dissolved oxygen variations and nutrient uptake/recycle caused by all aquatic plants. including macrophytes. In this model, the aquatic plant is represented as an equivalent amount of dissolved oxygen by reach, which varies diurnally as well as seasonally depending upon solar radiation, temperature, and nutrients. The solar radiation is computed in the model based on the latitude, Julian day, and real-time of day. The model simulates seven coupled state variables (BOD (CBOD or 5-day BOD), DO (daily average value or diurnal variation), organic nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, nitrite/nitrate nitrogen, total organic phosphorus, dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP)) and two non-coupled variables (a first-order decay substance, and a conservative substance). Through a stoichiometric relationship between plant protoplasm and physiological processes including photosynthesis, respiration, and death, the water quality variables interacting with aquatic plants are computed in the model. The model was calibrated and verified against data collected from an impounded river in which macrophytes play an important role in defining water quality dynamics. There were reasonable agreements between model predictions and the field measurements both for steady-state water quality and diurnal dissolved oxygen. The overall study demonstrated that the developed MACRIV model can simulate the most important parameters involved in waste load allocation studies in macrophyte growing rivers, such as diurnal DO variation, BOD (autochtonous and allochtonous), ammonia toxicity, and nutrient dynamics.

This significance and the complex requirements for macrophyte growth have stimulated the development of growth models to predict macrophyte biomass, oxygen production, nutrient cycling, etc. However, there is a lack of relationships that characterize the response of macrophyte growth to varying physical conditions. The growth model developed in this study relates the rate of production of rooted aquatic macrophytes to basic physiological parameters (growth and respiration rates) and controlling physical parameters (incident irradiance, water temperature, light attenuation by water and phytoplankton). The model is developed to be general, rather than specific to a particular plant species, with the intention of broadly characterizing macrophyte growth behavior as a function of a few key parameters. The growth equations are solved analytically using the assumption of uniform temperature and biomass over depth. Expressions for instantaneous rate of growth, daily production, and equilibrium biomass are found. A set of dimensionless parameters are defined and used to characterize four growth regimes. Model results are given in terms of the governing dimensionless parameters and then related to real world, dimensional parameters. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Bales, JD				Bales, JD			Effects of Hurricane Floyd inland flooding, September-October 1999, on tributaries to Pamlico Sound, North Carolina	ESTUARIES			English	Article								Hurricane Floyd in September 1999 caused disastrous flooding from South Carolina to Massachusetts in the United States, with particularly severe and prolonged flooding in eastern North Carolina resulting in record flood-flow loadings of freshwater and contaminants to Pamlico Sound, North Carolina. The inland flooding, water quality, and loadings to Pamlico Sound were determined as part of a multi-agency response to the floods and in an effort to understand the effects of the floods on the greater Pamlico Sound Basin. All major river basins draining to Pamlico Sound experienced floods at the 500-yr recurrence level. The volume of flood waters entering Pamlico Sound during September-October 1999 was estimated to be equivalent to about 95% of the volume of Pamlico Sound, meaning that flood waters could have essentially displaced most of the water present in Pamlico Sound. Nitrogen and phosphorus loads to the Pamlico River estuary and Neuse River estuary, the two principal estuaries draining to Pamlico Sound, in a 36-d period during the flooding were between 50-90% of the long term average annual loads. Pesticide concentrations in flood waters were surprisingly high, given the amount of dilution produced by the floodwaters.

J	Peierls, BL; Christian, RR; Paerl, HW				Peierls, BL; Christian, RR; Paerl, HW			Water quality and phytoplankton as indicators of hurricane impacts on a large estuarine ecosystem	ESTUARIES			English	Article							NEUSE RIVER ESTUARY; NORTH-CAROLINA; SUBTIDAL SEDIMENTS; NUTRIENT BEHAVIOR; TEMPERATE ESTUARY; BLOOM DYNAMICS; COASTAL; COMMUNITY; GROWTH; RESPONSES	Three sequential hurricanes in the fall of 1999 provided the impetus for assessing multi-annual effects on water quality and phytoplankton dynamics in southwestern Pamlico Sound, North Carolina. Two and a half years of post-hurricane data were examined for short- and long-term impacts from the storms and > 100 year flooding. Salinity decreased dramatically and did not recover until. May 2000. Inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were briefly elevated during the flooding, but later returned to background levels. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations declined through the whole study period, but did not appear to peak as was observed in the Neuse River estuary, a key tributary of the Sound. Light attenuation was highest in the fall to spring following the storms and was best correlated with chlorophyll a concentrations. Phytoplankton biomass (chl a) increased and remained elevated until late spring 2000 when concentrations returned to pre-storm levels and then cycled seasonally. Phytoplankton community composition varied throughout the study, reflecting the complex interaction between physiological optima and combinations of salinity, residence time, nutrient availability, and possibly grazing activity. Floodwater advection or dilution from upstream maxima may have controlled the spatial heterogeneity in total and group-specific biomass. The storms produced areas of short-term hypoxia, but hypoxic events continued during the following two summers, correlating strongly with water column stratification. Nitrogen loading to the southwestern sound was inferred from network analysis of previous nitrogen cycling studies in the Neuse River estuary. Based on these analyses, nutrient cycling and removal in the sub-estuaries would be decreased under high flow conditions, confirming observations from other estuaries. The inferred nitrogen load from the flood was 2-3 times the normal loading to the Sound; this estimate was supported by the substantial algal bloom. After 8-mos, the salinity and chl a data indicated the Sound had returned to pre-hurricane conditions, yet phytoplankton community compositional changes continued through the multi-year study period. This is an example of long-term aspects of estuarine recovery that should be considered in the context of a predicted 10-40 yr period of elevated tropical storm activity in the western Atlantic Basin.

J	Kallio, K; Koponen, S; Pulliainen, J				Kallio, K; Koponen, S; Pulliainen, J			Feasibility of airborne imaging spectrometry for lake monitoring - a case study of spatial chlorophyll alpha distribution in two meso-eutrophic lakes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article							WATER-QUALITY; THEMATIC MAPPER; INLAND WATERS; PHYTOPLANKTON; WIND; REFLECTANCE; RETRIEVAL; SERIES	The spatial distribution of the sum of chlorophyll a and phaeophytin a concentrations (chl-a) under light wind (0 - 2 m s(-1)) conditions was studied in two lakes with an AISA airborne imaging spectrometer. Chl-a was interpreted from AISA radiance data using an algorithm based on the near-infrared (700 - 710 nm) to red (660 - 665 nm) ratio. The results of Lake Lohjanjarvi demonstrate that the use of one monitoring station can result in over- or underestimation by 29 - 34% of the overall chl-a compared with an AISA-based estimation. In Lake Hiidenvesi, the AISA-based estimation for the mean chl-a with 95% confidence limits was 25.19 +/- 2.18 mug l(-1). The use of AISA data together with chl-a measured at 15 in situ sampling stations decreased the relative standard error of the mean chl-a estimation from 20.2% to 4.0% compared with the use of 15 discrete samples only. The relative standard error of the mean chl-a using concentrations at the three routine monitoring stations was 15.9 mug l(-1) (63.1%). The minimum and maximum chl-a in Lake Hiidenvesi were 2 and 101 mug l(-1), 6 and 70 mug l(-1) and 11 and 66 mug l(-1), estimated using AISA data, data from 15 in situ stations and data from three routine in situ stations, respectively.

J	Srivastava, P; Hamlett, JM; Robillard, PD				Srivastava, P; Hamlett, JM; Robillard, PD			Watershed optimization of agricultural best management practices: Continuous simulation versus design storms	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						nonpoint source pollution; watershed management; optimization; A-nnAGNPS; water quality; modeling	QUALITY	Nonpoint source (NPS) models and expert opinions are often used to prescribe best management practices (BMPs) for controlling NPS pollution. An optimization algorithm (e.g., a genetic algorithm, or GA) linked with a NPS model (e.g., Annualized AGricultural Nonpoint Source pollution model, or AnnAGNPS), can be used to more objectively prescribe BMPs and to optimize NPS pollution control measures by maximizing pollutant reduction and net monetary return from a watershed. Pollutant loads from design storms and annual loads from a continuous simulation can both be used for optimizing BMP schemes. However, which strategy results in a better solution (in terms of providing water quality protection) for a watershed is not clear. The specific objective of the study was to determine the differences in watershed pollutant loads, in an experimental watershed in Pennsylvania, resulting from optimization analyses performed using pollutant loads from a series of five 2-yr 24-hr storm events, a series of five 5-yr 24-hr storm events, and cumulative pollutant loads from a continuous simulation of five years of weather data. For each of these three different event alternatives, 100 near optimal solutions (BMP schemes) were generated. Sediment (Sed), sediment nitrogen (SedN), dissolved N (SolN), sediment organic carbon (SedOC), and sediment phosphorus (SedP) loads from a different five-year period (an evaluation period) suggest that the optimal BMP schemes resulting from the use of annual cumulative pollutant loads from a continuous simulation of five years of weather data provide smaller cumulative NPS pollutant loads at the watershed outlet.

J	Robertson, DM				Robertson, DM			Influence of different temporal sampling strategies on estimating total phosphorus and suspended sediment concentration and transport in small streams	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION			English	Article						sampling design; strategies; frequency; water quality; load; streams	LOADS	Various temporal sampling strategies are used to monitor water quality in small streams. To determine how various strategies influence the estimated water quality, frequently collected water quality data from eight small streams (14 to 110 km(2)) in Wisconsin were systematically subsampled to simulate typically used strategies. These subsets of data were then used to estimate mean, median, and maximum concentrations, and with continuous daily flows used to estimate annual loads (using the regression method) and volumetrically weighted mean concentrations. For each strategy, accuracy and precision in each summary statistic were evaluated by comparison with concentrations and loads of total phosphorus and suspended sediment estimated from all available data. The most effective sampling strategy depends on the statistic of interest and study duration. For mean and median concentrations, the most frequent fixed period sampling economically feasible is best. For maximum concentrations, any strategy with samples at or prior to peak flow is best. The best sampling strategy to estimate loads depends on the study duration. For one-year studies, fixed period monthly sampling supplemented with storm chasing was best, even though loads were overestimated by 25 to 50 percent. For two to three-year load studies and estimating volumetrically weighted mean concentrations, fixed period semimonthly sampling was best.

The objective of this study was to account daily ammonia excretion rates of tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum), the main fish species of the Amazonia related to water temperature and fish mass. Ammonia excretion rates were measured every two hours during a 24-hour period and results were evaluated by a multiple linear regression. Tambaqui presented two to five excretion peaks during the 24-hour period, reaching up to ten times the mean excretion rates. The model developed by the multiple linear regression explained 95.2% of the daily ammonia excretion rates, which increased according to fish mass and decreased when water temperature increased.

The calibrated model provides a quantitative assessment of the water and chemical fluxes transported by the rivers Derwent, Yorkshire Ouse, Wharfe, Aire, Don and Trent into the Humber estuary, i.e. a total drainage area of almost 18 000 km(2) (almost 15% of the area of England) with 2088 km of modelled river. The model simulated flow, temperature, pH, suspended sediment, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, particulate organic nitrogen, ammonium, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, zinc (dissolved and particulate), lindane and atrazine. For all rivers, except the Trent, simulations were for the period 1985-1995; the simulation period for the Trent was 1998-1995. The modelling used routine monitoring data collect by the England and Wales Environment Agency, for both calibration and validation, with other data sets mainly collated by the LOIS River-Atmosphere Coastal Study (RACS) data centre (e.g. land use, soils, river network). A stepwise model development started with a basic water quality model driven by observed in-stream water quality, and resulted in the development of a LOIS specific version of the in-stream model Quality Evaluation and Simulation Tool for River-systems that could be used to explore scenarios. The performance of the model was demonstrated by the reproduction of long-term statistics describing loads and concentrations, together with graphical output in the form of time series and distributions. The simulations were subsequently used to drive a linked catchment-river-estuary-coast-sea model covering the full domain of the RACS area. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Boorman, DB				Boorman, DB			LOIS in-stream water quality modelling. Part 2. Results and scenarios	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Meeting on Estuarine Modelling: Use and Abuse	SEP, 2001	CUMBRIA, ENGLAND				RIVERS	The catchment and river modelling undertaken within the UK Land Ocean Interaction Study programme represents the most extensive consistent exercise of this type undertaken in the UK. The calibrated model provides a quantitative assessment of the water and chemical fluxes transported by the rivers Derwent, Yorkshire Ouse, Wharfe, Aire, Don and Trent into the Humber estuary. These fluxes have been partitioned according to source (diffuse or point) for each basin, and a number of determinands. Total nitrogen from diffuse sources ranged from 92% on the largely agricultural Derwent to 38% from the industrial Don catchment. Even on catchments dominated by diffuse sources, point sources can contribute most during summer months. A quantitative assessment of the effect of in-stream processes suggests that denitrification can remove up to 40% of the total nitrogen entering the river system. A climate change scenario representing the 2050s revealed major changes in flow patterns, with all rivers showing a faster return to zero soil moisture deficit in the autumn and increased winter runoff, but a mixed picture of enhanced and reduced summer flows. Many associated fluxes may also increase, but long-term mean concentrations reduce because of the increased flows. The effect of the scenario on a river ecosystem classification was minor. Fertilizer reduction scenarios showed that even a large reduction in N applied as fertilizer (50%) resulted in much smaller reductions in the load delivered to the Humber estuary (6-16%).

The model, constructed within the ECoS3 simulation software, has been calibrated using data obtained from 27 surveys of the Yorkshire Ouse and Humber estuaries during 1994-1996. The model is tidally averaged, and is one-dimensional in the vertical and in cross-section. Daily-varying longitudinal concentration profiles of SPM, POC, nitrate, nitrite and ammonium have been simulated, and these have been compared with the observations used for model calibration (model confirmation). The fits are generally good. The model captures the marked seasonal variability in concentrations of the particulate constituents (SPM, POC), and places the turbidity maximum in approximately the correct region of the estuary. There was a high degree of scatter in the SPM and POC concentrations measured due to tidal resuspension, which was not reproduced by the tidally averaged model. Comparisons between measured and simulated nitrate + nitrite are satisfactory, although for a number of surveys the modelled values are systematically too low in the lower Yorkshire Ouse and upper Humber. These discrepancies are not readily explained, but may be linked to inadequately characterised source terms for this nitrogen. The general trends in the concentrations and distributions of ammonium are reproduced by the model, despite the plethora of external inputs of this constituent, and significant modifications to ammonium transport by in situ nitrification and benthic exchange. The simulated concentrations and distributions have also been tested against independent data encapsulating axial transects in the Trent and Humber estuaries, and temporal variations at fixed sites on the Trent and Yorkshire Ouse estuaries. With some exceptions, the fits between the model results and these data are also good. The model has also been used to construct constituent budgets (external/internal sources and sinks) for each estuary for 1994, 1995 and 1996. Riverine inputs of SPM, POC, nitrate, nitrite and ammonium decreased over the 3 years, presumably reflecting changing patterns of terrestrial runoff coupled to a reduction in effluent inputs. This trend was also observed in the point discharges of these constituents direct to the estuary. The simulated estuary was a source of sediments to the North Sea during 1994 and 1996, but a sink during 1995. The difference has been ascribed to the exceptionally dry summer and autumn of 1995, in which up-estuary tidal 'pumping' of SPM was dominant over down-estuary flushing by river water. Fluvial inputs represent an important external source of POC to the model estuary (27-55%), as does the North Sea (26-58%). These inputs are exceeded by POC loss via bacterial remineralisation, suggesting that the estuarine bed is a net source of POC. Riverine inputs account for 76-77% of the external inputs of nitrate. This constituent behaves quasi-conservatively in the estuary, reflecting the dilution of nitrate-rich river waters with low-nitrate coastal water, although nitrification is a significant input (approx. 21%). Denitrification is small, and consequently all nitrate added to the estuary is lost to the North Sea. External loads of nitrite are small and ammonium nitrification accounts for approximately 93% of its annual input. Practically all of the nitrite is oxidised to nitrate, and little escapes to the North Sea. The fluvial and direct waste inputs of ammonium to the estuary are of similar size. Most of the ammonium in the model is nitrified (98-100%) and only a few In 1996 the estuary appears to have been a sink for coastal water ammonium. Constituent budgets are compared with independently evaluated fluxes. There is good agreement in a number of cases, but the comparison highlights the main uncertainties in the simulated fluxes. It is concluded that the model as currently formulated provides an excellent basis for heuristic studies of the Humber estuarine system. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	An, KG; Kim, DS				An, KG; Kim, DS			Response of reservoirwater quality to nutrient inputs from streams and in-lake fishfarms	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION			English	Article						chlorophyll-a; net cage fishfarm; Korea; nutrients; reservoir water quality	TROPHIC STATE INDEX; CHEMICAL FACTORS; FLORIDA LAKES; PHYTOPLANKTON; WATER; NITROGEN; LOADS	This study demonstrates how land-use characteristics influence stream water chemistry in a Korean watershed and how stream conditions and in-lake point sources determine trophic state, algal biomass and phytoplankton composition. Measurements of nutrient loads showed that 68% of total phosphorus (TP) loads was originated from the watershed and the remaining 32% came directly from in-lake fish farms. Based on mass balance models, annual areal phosphorus (L-p) and water loading (q(s)) were 1.032 g m(-2) and 25 m(3) m(-2) yr(-1), respectively, and the total annual P-input exceeded dangerous loading levels according to Vollenweider's classification (1976). In situ Nutrient Stimulation Bioassays (NSB), Trophic State Index (TSI), and mass N:P ratios showed that phosphorus was the primary element regulating algal chlorophyll in the system, and non-algal turbidity and zooplankton effects on algal growth were minor. A high regression coefficient in the empirical relationship between chlorophyll (Chl) and TP supported the evidence of strong P-limitation, and model comparisons suggested that our observed Chl values were largely underestimated in models developed for world-wide lakes. Direct P-input to the trophogenic zone from the in-lake fishfarms and streams with intense human-use resulted in massive bluegreen algal blooms, indicating that the highly available input fraction may explain the deviation. Under the circumstances, reduction in P-loading is an essential measure for long-term eutrophication control in this system.

J	Zhang, YZ; Pulliainen, J; Koponen, S; Hallikainen, M				Zhang, YZ; Pulliainen, J; Koponen, S; Hallikainen, M			Empirical algorithms for Secchi disk depth using optical and microwave remote sensing data from the Gulf of Finland and the Archipelago Sea	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH			English	Article							THEMATIC MAPPER DATA; WATER-QUALITY; ATMOSPHERIC CORRECTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; SUSPENDED SEDIMENTS; SATELLITE DATA; LAKE CHICOT; CALIBRATION; COASTAL; RETRIEVALS	In this paper empirical algorithms for determining the Secchi disk depth (SDD) are developed and employed using optical (e.g., Landsat TM) and microwave (e.g., ERS-2 SAR) remote sensing data from the Gulf of Finland and the Archipelago Sea. The SDD is an important optical measure of water quality in the study area, where the coastal water considerably attenuates light because of the presence of phytoplankton, suspended matter and yellow substance. The results show that the accuracy of SDD estimation using a neural network-based method is much higher than that of a semi-empirical or multivariate approach. On the other hand, the additional use of SAR data only slightly improved SDD estimation when compared with the use of TM data only. Although the improvement is marginal, the results suggest that there may be some SAR backscattering signatures correlated to SDD measurements in the area. However, such a small improvement is not very helpful for the practical estimation of SDD. In the future, the technique of using combined optical and microwave data still needs to be refined using, e.g., MERIS and ASAR data.

Koi (Cyprinus carpio L.) were used as the model species and the experiment was conducted outdoors in greenwater. When fish density was 9.7 kg per 2.08 m(3) and they were eating 125 g day(-1), the 20 L trickle filters were able to maintain acceptable water quality Tanks with the same size submerged filters suffered significantly lower dissolved oxygen levels compared with tanks with trickle filters and control tanks with no biofilters exhibited significantly higher nitrite-nitrogen (about 20 mg L-1) and nitrate levels (about 400 mg L-1). As typical ornamental fish weigh 3 g, the trickle biofilter system described here can produce 1.55 fish L-1 (compared with the industry standard 0.25 fish L-1) and use very little water other than the water originally in the tanks.

J	Webber, DF; Kelly, PW				Webber, DF; Kelly, PW			Characterization of sources of organic pollution to Kingston Harbour, the extent of their influence and some rehabilitation recommendations	BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE			English	Article							JAMAICA; WATERS	Sources of organic pollution to Kingston Harbour were assessed by monthly sampling at 22 rivers, gullies and discharge pipes emptying into the harbor between August 1996 and July 1997. These sources were divided into point and non-point sources and coupled with underground water and industrial flow assessed from 1992 and 1996 data. Organic pollution signatures were coliform bacteria, total suspended solids (TSS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), nitrite + nitrate nitrogen and phosphate phosphorous. Sewage is by far the most important contributor of organic pollution to Kingston Harbour, regardless of the signature used. The continuity and concentrations at the outfall of the Greenwich and Western sewage treatment plants render these two areas as the most significant point sources of pollution to the harbor. River flow is the second largest point source of organic pollution to the harbor; the degree of its contribution depending on rainfall since only at high flow does it make major contributions. Poor watershed management, extensive agriculture inputs from few, but large industries, large and growing residential areas and the length of the river creates problems. When the rivers are at low flow, industries and groundwater become major non-point sources of different pollutants. During periods of high water flow the gullies are small, but significant non-point sources of most pollutants. Fifty-five to 70% of the contributions of total suspended solid (TSS) is associated with sewage, while 23-30% is associated with a range of industries. Under high flow conditions, < 20% of TSS is associated with the outflow from rivers and gullies, while under low flow conditions, rivers and gullies make no meaningful contribution. Of the contributions of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), 29-50% is associated with sewage, while 24-40% with industries. Under high flow conditions, 40% of BOD is associated with river outflow, while under low flow conditions, rivers make no meaningful contribution. Of the contributions of nitrate nitrogen, 55-65% is associated with sewage, approximately 30% is associated with ground water and < 20% associated with flow from rivers and gullies under high flow conditions. River and gully outflow under low flow conditions make no meaningful contribution. Of the contributions of phosphate phosphorous, 75-90% is associated with sewage and < 20% associated with high flow conditions from river and gully outflow. At low flow, industries and ground water make no meaningful phosphate phosphorous contribution. Having identified, quantified and ranked the sources of organic pollution to Kingston Harbour, recommendations are suggested for the improvement of the water quality. Among these are a reduction and/or cessation of sewage discharges to the harbor coupled with the use of a predictive hydrodynamic three-dimensional model and an ongoing monitoring program.

Because of potential ecological effects, dissolved zinc and orthophosphate were the solutes of primary interest. Results from deployments of an in situ flux chamber indicated that benthic fluxes of dissolved Zn and orthophosphate were comparable in magnitude to riverine inputs. Tracer analyses and benthic-community metrics provided evidence that solute benthic flux were diffusion-controlled at the flux-chamber deployment sites. That is, effects of biomixing (or bioturbation) and ground-water interactions did not strongly influence benthic flux. Remediation efforts in the river might not produce desired water-quality effects in the lake because imposed shifts in concentration gradients near the sediment-water interface would generate a benthic feedback response. Therefore, development of water-quality models to justify remediation strategies requires consideration of contaminant flux between the water column and underlying sediment in basins that have been affected by long-term (decadal) anthropogenic activities.

J	Argent, RM; Mitchell, VG				Argent, RM; Mitchell, VG			Development and adoption of a simple nonpoint source pollution model for Port Phillip Bay, Australia	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						nonpoint source pollution; model development process; interface prototyping; software adoption	GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; DECISION-SUPPORT-SYSTEM; SOURCE WATER-QUALITY; MANAGEMENT; GIS; PHOSPHORUS; QUANTITY; RUNOFF; SCALE	New computing tools and approaches allow tailored development of software to meet the needs of environmental managers. The processes required for such tailoring fit well with adaptive management concepts where, as knowledge and system understanding develop among managers, the software can be developed or replaced to match. This paper reports on development and adoption of a simple nonpoint source pollution modeling tool, including technical aspects of data support for modeling and social aspects of software design. The software, named FILTER, used a unit load model to generate expected pollutant loads from subcatchments of Port Phillip Bay, Australia. Monitoring data were used for calibration to modify the delivery of generated pollutants to receiving waters. Spatial, tabular, and charting software components were used to provide alternative forms of output visualization. FILTER was developed using a process that resulted in manager-stakeholders taking responsibility for setting of model parameter values and operation of the user interface, thereby encouraging uptake. The inclusive development process, tailoring of the software to manager needs and styles of usage, and matching of model complexity to data and knowledge, resulted in a successful application that has become the current agreed system representation among disparate stakeholder organizations.

J	Roseta-Palma, C				Roseta-Palma, C			Joint quantity/quality management of groundwater	ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS			English	Article						groundwater; optimal taxes; quantity-quality management	NONPOINT-SOURCE POLLUTION; NITROGEN USE; CONTAMINATION; POLICIES; QUALITY	Economic literature on groundwater management has traditionally been split into two areas: there are papers that evaluate different schemes of dynamic aquifer management, considering that pumping costs vary with stock but ignoring water quality. On the other hand, there are papers that consider contamination problems caused by specific pollutants. This paper presents two alternative models for joint quantity-quality management, and it shows that existing models are in fact special cases of these. The framework is dynamic and considers both the stock of water quantity and a stock measure of water quality. Optimal taxes are derived, and shown to be different from those in existing quantity-only or quality-only models. Implementation problems are briefly discussed.

A numerical one-dimensional model (DLM) was used to predict the thermal structure of the reservoir during the period of maximum water demand. The model was found to satisfactorily predict the basic trends of the thermal stratification of the water column of the reservoir. We used this model to investigate various possible water withdrawal scenarios. When thermal stratification has been completely developed, the location of the main thermocline coincides with the depth of the outlet, in the various withdrawal scenarios considered.

The data were collected in monthly intervals during two ice-free seasons: between April 2000-November 2000 and April 2001-November 2001. To reduce over-fitting of the neural network based models, we employed single hidden layer networks with early stopping of training.

J	Horn, W				Horn, W			Long-term development of the crustacean plankton in the Saidenbach Reservoir (Germany) - changes, causes, consequences	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Reservoir Limnology and Water Quality	AUG, 2002	CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZECH REPUBLIC			crustaceans; Daphnia; fish community structure; long-term changes; Secchi depth; temperature	PHYTOPLANKTON; ZOOPLANKTON	The drinking water reservoir Saidenbach (Germany) has been investigated continuously from the year 1975 onwards. Since 1987, daphnids (Daphnia galeata)-an essential component in the cycle of matter and energy in the pelagic zone of reservoirs and lakes-became less and less abundant. Its total and relative biomass declined drastically and the exponential population growth began later in the year. After 1990, also the biomass of the copepods decreased significantly. Thus, the total crustacean biomass declined from 0.35 cm(3) m(-3) (mean 1975-1990) to 0.22 cm(3) m(-3) in the 1990s. Top-down effects seem to be responsible for all these changes, because stocks of both native planktivorous fishes, mainly roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis), and non-native silver carps (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) have increased over the years. A second observation confirms this conclusion: the significant temperature effects on the growth rate of Daphnia observed every year in early summer (May) in the first years under investigation were not detectable anymore after the year 1987. Since then, the exponential population development did not start until end of June/beginning of July. This delay and the substantial decrease of the mean body length of the daphnids are clear indications for the enormous predation pressure on this zooplankton group. Simultaneously, the concentration of nanoplankton increased and the Secchi depth decreased indicating the diminishing impact of crustaceans on phytoplankton in the course of the years. Thus, a significant relationship between the concentration of Daphnia and the water transparency could be obtained-a confirmation of their great importance for the water clarity. Consequently, if Daphnia shall provide a positive contribution to water quality (e.g., by effective particle elimination), a well structured fish community with regard to species composition, size structure, standing stock and functional groups will be needed as a prerequisite.

Total phosphorus, orthophosphate, chlorophyll a concentrations and water colour were determined monthly in winter and biweekly in summer, in two reservoirs located in the Portuguese part of River Douro catchment. Complementarily, variables such as nitrate, ammonium ion and ammonia gas, as well as water temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and transparency were measured. Trophic state of both reservoirs was assessed by computation of Carlson's Trophic State Index. The potential allochthonous sources of phosphorus and nitrogen to both reservoirs were identified and estimated. Differences between reservoirs were found for conductivity, water temperature, transparency and water colour. According to Carlson's Trophic State Index both reservoirs were classified as meso-eutrophic from winter to the beginning of summer, and as eutrophic from this period onwards. Intrinsic factors such as age of reservoir, organic matter inputs from decomposition of flooded terrestrial vegetation and exposure of littoral sediments to cycles of drying and wetting, as well as extrinsic factors such as grazing and frequent land fires, can explain the trophic state of S. Serrada Reservoir. Allochthonous sources of nutrients originated from agriculture and grazing in the catchment area, and recreational activities in the reservoir probably are the factors with greatest influence on Azibo Reservoir trophic state. Based upon the obtained data, management measures are suggested to prevent further eutrophication and water quality degradation in both reservoirs.

J	Finkl, CW; Charlier, RH				Finkl, CW; Charlier, RH			Sustainability of subtropical coastal zones in southeastern Florida: Challenges for urbanized coastal environments threatened by development, pollution, water supply, and storm hazards	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd Leadership Conference of the International Oceanographic Institute	SEP 25-28, 2002	MAMAIA-CONSTANTZA, ROMANIA	Int Oceanog Inst		environmental integrity; submarine groundwater discharge; nutrient loading; water quality; remediation; ecosystem collapse; coastal management	GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE; SEDIMENTARY PETROLOGY; UNITED-STATES; PATTERNS; KEYS; EXPERIENCE; LESSONS; BEACH; USA	The subtropical Atlantic coastal zone of southeastern Florida supports nearly 7 million inhabitants on a coastal plain conurbation that stretches from West Palm Beach to Miami. About a quarter of the present population originally settled on higher topography along the shore-parallel Atlantic Coastal Ridge. From about the middle 1900s, however, urbanization intensified along the shore and spread westward into freshwater marshlands. Population densities approaching 2500 persons per km(-2) along some coastal sectors and dredge and fill operations to create urban land in western marshes degraded coastal environments bringing in question sustainability. Efforts to maintain environmental integrity initially focused on shore protection first via "hard" engineering works, which later ont included massive beach renourishment projects along developed coasts subject to critical erosion. Marine algal blooms, led to eutrophication, degraded coastal water quality, and deterioration of coral reefs indicate environmental problems at least as serious as beach erosion. Recognition of a potential eco-catastrophe, collapse of entire marine and coastal wetland ecosystems in southern Florida, led turn to the Everglades Restoration Project, the largest single environmental recovery effort in the world. Cleanup of terrestrial systems is essential to sustainability of marine ecosystems now jeopardized by nutrient loading. Serious degradation of the Florida Reef Tract, a coral-algal barrier reef system, is beyond question as extensive sectors of coral reef die from increased loading of nearshore waters by elevated nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) nutrient levels delivered to the coast by submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). The source of N-P input into the Biscayne Aquifer, which has one of the highest carbonate aquifer transmissivities in the world, is sugar cane farming in the Everglades Agricultural Area on the inner portion of the coastal plain. Groundwater discharges for Palm Beach County are, for example, estimated from a groundwater MODFLOW model at 1,659 X 10(6) m(3) yr(-1). Total N in groundwater below the coastal plain adjacent to remnant Everglades averages about 1.25 mg l(-1). SGD nutrient fluxes to the coast are 5727 and 414 metric tons per year for P and N, respectively. Surface water contributions for P and N are respectively 197 and 2,471 metric tons per year. Nutrient delivery to beach and nearshore environments is a serious problem that threatens coastal water quality which in turn will impact tourism-related activities such as sunbathing, beach walking, swimming, snorkeling, SCUBA diving, and surf fishing. The full magnitude of the problem has yet to surface because it takes about three to eight decades for groundwater from the interior parts of the coastal plain to reach the nearshore zone. Pollution of groundwater increases with time due to higher doses of fertilizers on croplands and runoff from expanding urban areas. Solutions to present environmental threats are obvious and, perhaps surprisingly, do not fall within the scientific arena because causes and remedies are already known and future impacts are anticipated. The present environmental cleanup efforts, which are of mammoth proportions and financial cost, are doomed to failure until the causes of problems are eliminated or neutralized. Even though sustainable management procedures are well known, sustainability cannot be achieved by treating symptoms. Sustainable coastal habitats in subtropical southeast Florida will be secured when there is application of best management practices based on environmental ethics rather than capital gain, development of political will directed towards continuous multiple land use rather than terminal single use, and inculcation of proactive public perception of best land management practices rather than politically-correct land-use policies.

J	Andraski, TW; Bundy, LG; Kilian, KC				Andraski, TW; Bundy, LG; Kilian, KC			Manure history and long-term tillage effects on soil properties and phosphorus losses in runoff	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							DISSOLVED INORGANIC-PHOSPHATE; CORN PRODUCTION SYSTEMS; SURFACE RUNOFF; BIOAVAILABLE PHOSPHORUS; AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF; RAINFALL SIMULATOR; NUTRIENT LOSSES; POULTRY LITTER; WATER-QUALITY; FERTILIZER	Manure additions to cropland can reduce total P losses in runoff on well-drained soils due to increased infiltration and reduced soil erosion. Surface residue management in subsequent years may influence the long-term risk of P losses as the manure-supplied organic matter decomposes. The effects of manure history and long-term (8-yr) tillage [chisel plow (CP) and no-till (NT)] on P levels in runoff in continuous corn (Zea mays L.) were investigated on well-drained silt loam soils of southern and southwestern Wisconsin. Soil P levels (0-15 cm) increased with the frequency of manure applications and P stratification was greater near the surface (0-5 cm) in NT than CP. In CP, soil test P level was linearly related to dissolved P (24-105 g ha(-1)) and bioavailable P (64-272 g ha(-1)) loads in runoff, but not total P (653-1893 g ha(-1)). In NT, P loads were reduced by an average of 57% for dissolved P, 70% for bioavailable P, and 91% for total P compared with CP. This reduction was due to lower sediment concentrations and/or lower runoff volumes in NT. There was no relationship between soil test P levels and runoff P concentrations or loads in NT. Long-term manure P applications in excess of P removal by corn in CP systems ultimately increased the potential for greater dissolved and bioavailable P losses in runoff by increasing soil P levels. Maintaining high surface residue cover such as those found in long-term NT corn production systems can mitigate this risk in addition to reducing sediment and particulate P losses.

J	Hubbard, RK; Newton, GL; Gascho, GJ				Hubbard, RK; Newton, GL; Gascho, GJ			Nutrient removal by grass components of vegetated buffer systems receiving swine lagoon effluent	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						animal wastes; coastal Bermuda grass; nutrient removal; vegetated buffer systems; water quality	FILTER STRIPS; SIMULATED VEGETATION; NITROGEN; PHOSPHORUS; POLLUTION; SEDIMENT; RUNOFF; WATER; CONSTITUENTS; FILTRATION	Information is needed on nutrient removal mechanisms in vegetated buffer systems to assist in the design of these tong-term nutrient removal systems. We determined nutrient removal by grass portions of grass-forest buffer systems receiving swine lagoon wastewater. Cuttings were made at three positions within buffers of coastal Bermuda grass (Cynondon dactylon L.) (Tifton 78) for three years. Wastewater was applied weekly at two rates. The first rate averaged 800 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) (714 lb N ac(-1) yr(-1)), 215 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) (192 lb P ac(-1) yr(-1)), and 1030 kg K ha(-1) yr(-1)(920 lb K ac(-1) yr(-1)), and the second rate furnished twice these amounts. Grass buffers 20 M (65.6 ft) in length removed 44% of the nitrogen (N), 19% of the phosphorus (P), and 23% Of the potassium (K) as grass biomass from the lesser wastewater application rate. Nutrient removal via uptake (percentage of applied) dropped by a factor of 1.6 when wastewater was applied at the greater rate. Overall, the study showed that while nutrient uptake into the grass biomass accounts for a portion of the nutrient removal in grass-forest buffer systems, the nutrient concentrations in surface runoff and subsurface water exiting these systems as reported previously (Hubbard et al., 1998b), imply that other factors (denitrification, forest uptake, and adsorption) play a greater role in the nutrient assimilation and filtering commonly associated with grass-forest buffer systems. The information on biomass production and nutrient removal by coastal Bermuda grass receiving wastewater in a lower landscape position is important for producers who want to utilize the wastewater nutrients and produce forage on an under-utilized portion of the landscape.

More than 90% of the ammonia received by the lake is from a municipal wastewater treatment plant (Metro). It was found that various decisions to be made by regulators in management applications of the model greatly influence the lake's apparent assimilative capacity (TMDL). In particular, the following issues were critical: (1) anticipated hypolimnetic oxygenation treatment, (2) previously documented in-lake nitrification events, (3) effects of residual industrial pollution on pH, (4) effects of uncertainties and potential bias in pH measurements, (5) anticipated increases in population growth served by Metro, and (6) revisions in national guidance toxicity criteria prepared by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. Several limitations in the existing ammonia TMDL analysis are reported, including: (1) arbitrary specification of critical conditions, (2) omission of the important features of duration and allowable number of occurrences in the state standard, (3) identification of the wrong month as critical for determining the lake's assimilative capacity, (4) lack of recognition of the artificial assimilative capacity associated with the effects of residual industrial pollution, (5) the specified "margin of safety" was too low, given the level of modeling and input uncertainties, (6) anticipated increases in discharge from Metro were not considered, and (7) incorrect identification of the critical year for tributary hydrology. Recommendations are made to upgrade the ammonia TMDL analysis, including the supporting model framework and data sets.

J	Beutel, MW				Beutel, MW			Hypolimnetic anoxia and sediment oxygen demand in California drinking water reservoirs	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						hypolimnetic anoxia; hypolimnetic aeration; sediment oxygen demand; reservoir	FLOW VELOCITY; EUTROPHIC LAKE; AERATION; CONSUMPTION; MERCURY	Summertime hypolinmetic anoxia can occur in productive drinking water reservoirs as a result of the decay of phytoplankton. Anoxic conditions promote ecological processes that degrade water quality through the release of problem-causing compounds from anoxic sediments including phosphates; ammonia, sulfides, methylmercury, iron and manganese. Hypolimnetic aeration systems are commonly installed in reservoirs to prevent hypolimnetic anoxia, but these systems have been historically undersized due to an underestimation of the magnitude of oxygen demand in the hypolimnion. To gain insight into the sizing of hypolimnetic aeration systems, this study evaluated the effects of water current and DO concentration near the sediment-water interface on sediment oxygen demand (SOD) in nine California drinking water reservoirs of various size (5-220 million-m(3)) and trophic status (mean annual chlorophyll a of 0.5-11 mug (.) L-1). SOD measured under quiescent conditions in 1.8 L experimental chambers ranged from 0.1-0.8 g (.) m(2) (.) d(-1). Currents near the sediment-water interface of 3-8 cm (.) S-1 induced a two to four-fold increase in SOD, and resulted in a shift from first-order to zero-order DO uptake by sediment with respect to DO concentration in overlaying water. Results support the diffusive boundary layer model for SOD, with increased DO concentration and currents resulting in a larger SOD since there is a greater diffusional driving force across a smaller diffusive boundary layer. The study also evaluated the effects of trophic status and morphometry on hypolimnetic anoxia at the nine study sites. A number of significant correlations were discovered between factor quantifying hypolimnetic anoxia (areal and mass based hypolinmetic oxygen demand, SOD) and those quantifying morphometry (mean depth of the hypolimnion, volume of the hypolimnion) and trophic status (mean annual chlorophyll a): These results suggest that both increased size of the hypolimnion and higher productivity lead to higher oxygen demand within the hypolimnion. In addition, shallower reservoirs had a larger fraction of their total oxygen demand exerted in the sediments versus the water column. As a result, increased mixing at the sediment-water interface after start-up of aeration systems, and the resulting stimulation of SOD, will be particularly important in productive reservoirs of moderate depth (mean depth of 10-15 m). Aeration systems should be designed to enhance SOD by maintaining high oxygen concentrations and by inducing currents at the sediment water interface. This will increase the depth of penetration of DO into sediment and promote beneficial aerobic biogeochemical reactions in surface sediments. Aeration systems that utilize pure-oxygen with horizontal discharge of highly oxygenated water across the sediment surface, rather than the traditional airlift aeration system, will be more successful in satisfying SOD and improving hypolimnetic water quality.

We analyzed 1473 lake-years of data on 438 Florida lakes to develop a series of tables that can be used to predict the frequencies that phytoplankton chlorophylls will exceed concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mg (.) m(-3) in Florida lakes based on the annual average concentrations of chlorophyll, total phosphorus, or total nitrogen. Different tables were created for lakes grouped by TN/TP ratios of >17, <17 but >10, and <10. These tables can be directly applied towards setting lake management goals for those Florida lakes that lack sufficient data to construct their own bloom frequency curves.

J	Bachmann, RW; Hoyer, MV; Fernandez, C; Canfield, DE				Bachmann, RW; Hoyer, MV; Fernandez, C; Canfield, DE			An alternative to proposed phosphorus TMDLs for the management of Lake Okeechobee	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT			English	Article						restoration; eutrophication; aquatic macrophytes; phosphorus; and lake management	SUBTROPICAL LAKE; FLORIDA USA; EUTROPHICATION; SEDIMENTS	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection recently proposed total maximum dailyloads (TMDL) of phosphorus for Lake Okeechobee of 198 t(.)yr(-1) and 140 t(.)yr(-1), respectively, with a goal of limiting algal blooms in the near-shore areas of the lake. We evaluated the reasonableness of these regulations by examining evidence of past changes in the lake, factors determining water quality, current phosphorus targets for the pelagic water, factors determining total phosphorus levels in the lake, expected benefits of the proposed TMDLs, and alternative management options. Available data are insufficient to demonstrate the degree of any recent eutrophication of the lake. Movement of the sediments in this shallow lake, perhaps by hurricane generated currents, casts doubt on reconsttuctions of lake history through sediment cores. W e estimated presettlement phosphorus loading of 377 t(.)yr(-1), indicating that the lake has been eutrophic for a hundred or more years. The pelagic region of the lake is dominated by resuspended sediments that increase the phosphorus concentration and reduce light transmission. Thus, algal populations are limited by light and not phosphorus. As a result, there is no correlation between phosphorus and plankton chlorophylls and only a very weak correlation (r = 0.26) between Secchi depth and chlorophyll a. Living plankton account for only 15% of the total suspended solids in the pelagic region. Phosphorus targets for Lake Okeechobee have been based on conditions in the near-shore region along the western marshes. A concentration of 40 mg (.) m(-3) of TP in the near-shore region would limit the frequency of algal blooms (chlorophyll a > mg (.) m(-3)) to 15% of the year, the lowest bloom frequency observed in the closest pelagic stations in the past 28 years. Models indicate that this frequency can be achieved with a pelagic TP concentration of between 72 and 92 mg (.) m(-3), though the TMDL models use 40 mg (.) m(-3) as their pelagic target TP concentration. Phosphorus levels in the pelagic region are not correlated with phosphorus inputs, so in spite of recent decreases in phosphorus loading to the lake, phosphorus concentrations continue to rise. This seems to be due to a reduction in phosphorus retention by the lake since 1973. The reason for the loss of phosphorus retention is not known, though there are indications that rising water levels and/or declining calcium concentrations might be involved. The data do not demonstrate that stringent phosphorus TMDLs will improve the lake. On the other hand, there is evidence that high water levels are responsible for reduced water quality in the lake and loss of macrophytes. A planned reduction in lake stage in 2000 made significant improvements in plant coverage, water clarity, and fish habitat without any change in the phosphorus regime. Water level controls seem to have more promise as a management tool for Lake Okeechobee than TMDLs for phosphorus.

This decrease results from a conversion of loosely bound inorganic P (IP) which is readily desorbable to water, to less soluble Al- and Fe-bound IP and, to a lesser extent, calcium-bound IP pools. Although this conversion has little effect on predictors of plant-available soil P (e.g., Mehlich-3 P), little is known about the plant uptake of P over several growth cycles after high P soils are amended with FGD. In a greenhouse experiment, we measured P uptake by ryegrass ( Lolium perenne) using a modified Stanford - Dement procedure ( three growth cycles), and the extent to which IP was being removed from 21 each soil IP fraction (Hedley fractionation), for three soils treated with FGD gypsum ( equivalent to 22.4 Mg ha(-1)). Treatment with FGD decreased water extractable soil P 38 to 57%, but had little effect on Mehlich-3 soil P. During the first growth cycle, the shift from resin IP to less available Al, Fe, and Ca IP remained stable. Repeated growth cycles of ryegrass removed resin IP and thus, had a continued effect on lowering water- extractable P. After three growth cycles and harvests, ryegrass dry-matter production was not affected by FGD treatment (P > 0.05), although cumulative P uptake (20%) and P concentration of ryegrass tops (25%) were greater in FGD treated than untreated soils. Our results confirm that treatment of high P soils with FGD gypsum decreases water- extractable P by conversion to soil IP fractions that are stable with time, does not decrease plant production, and suggests that the potential for P export in surface runoff may be reduced for several years.

Specifically, nitrogen, phosphorus, sediment, and runoff were predicted over a seven-year period. Land under cultivation makes up approximately 25% of the 333 km(2) watershed. Livestock facilities include swine, poultry, dairy cows, and beef cattle. Results from the simulation were compared to seven years of monitoring data at the outlet of five nested subwatersheds and at the outlet of the Little River Research Watershed (LRRW). The average annual predicted runoff in the upper part of the watershed was one-third to half of observed runoff. In contrast, predicted runoff in the lower part of the watershed was close to observed, and was 100% of observed at the outlet of the watershed. Runoff underprediction was attributed to the method of landcover discretization. The extent of forest land in the upper watershed (55% to 63%) and the fragmented landscape that has relatively small fields surrounded by riparian forests and tracts of forest resulted in overestimation of forested area in the watershed. In addition to runoff, sediment and nutrient loads were also underpredicted in the upper part of the LRRW. Two factors are most likely responsible for underprediction. Runoff is underpredicted at these sites, which reduces the carrying capacity of sediment loads. In addition, the overestimation of forested areas at these sites coincides with underestimation of sediment-producing areas, such as cropland. In contrast to the upper part of the watershed, sediment and nutrient loads were overpredicted in the lower part of the watershed. This may have resulted from inadequately simulating nonpoint-source pollution attenuation by the extensive riparian forests and forested in-stream wetland areas found in these watersheds. Prediction results can be improved through better input into the model, as well as modification of the processes within the model to account for forest and riparian conditions.

Here, the project objective was to determine full-scale, subsurface-flow constructed wetland retention times and treatment performance through assessment of water quality by daily sampling of total dissolved solids, pH, total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand (COD), tannins, nitrate, ammonium, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, phosphate, sulfate, and sulfide across operating systems for winery wastewater treatment. Measurements were conducted during both the fall crush season of heavy loading and the spring following bottling and racking operations at the winery. Simple decay model coefficients for these constituents as well as COD and tannin removal efficiencies from winery wastewater in bench-scale reactors are also determined. The bench-scale study used upward-flow, inoculated attached-growth (pea-gravel substrate) reactors fed synthetic winery wastewater. Inlet and outlet tracer studies for determination of actual retention times were essential to analyses of treatment performance from an operational subsurface-flow constructed wetland that had been overloaded due to failure to install a pretreatment system for suspended solids removal. Less intensive sampling conducted at a smaller operational winery wastewater constructed wetland that had used pretreatment suspended solids removal and aeration indicated that the constructed wetlands were capable of complete organic load removal from the winery wastewater.

EPCO2 (defined as the partial pressure of CO2 in natural water divided by the equilibrium partial pressure of CO2) levels ranged from mean values of 6.32 +/- 0.41 in spring/summer to 7.86 +/- 1.17 in autumn/winter. A decreasing trend in mean annual EpCO(2) was also observed. with a high of 9.61 in 1990 and a low of 5.22 in 1996. The variations were attributed to changes in pH, which showed an inverse relationship with river discharge r(2) = 0.47). Both pH and EpCO(2) levels were strongly linked to biological activity with increases caused by primary productivity. Filterable reactive phosphorus (FRP) and total phosphorus. (TP) concentrations correlated with river discharge. The results showed that the majority of the phosphorus load was transported during storm events, which agrees with results from an export coefficient model predicting phosphorus loading in the Frome catchment.

The common denominator among all types of fens is recognition of the importance of ground-water discharge, especially mineral-rich ground water, in determining fen hydrology, chemistry, and vegetation, in contrast to wetlands whose characteristics are determined primarily by precipitation or surface-water inputs. Thus, fens tend to occur where climate and hydrogeologic setting sustain flows to the plant-rooting zone of mineral-rich ground water. In the United States, these areas include the glaciated Midwest and Northeast, as well as portions of the Appalachian Mountains and mountainous West. Individually and collectively, fens are among the most floristically diverse of all wetland types, supporting a large number of rare and uncommon bryophytes and vascular plant species, as well as uncommon animals including mammals, reptiles, land snails, butterflies, skippers, and dragonflies. Several species listed under the federal Endangered Species Act inhabit or use fens. Fens also help maintain stream water quality through denitrification and phosphor-us sorption. Few estimates of loss and current extent exist, but where estimates are available, they indicate extensive loss, fragmentation, and degradation. Cultural eutrophication threatens the biological and functional integrity of remaining fens because, along with mineral-rich water, low availability of nitrogen and phosphorus controls many of their distinctive characteristics. Because they occur where ground water discharges to the surface, fens are isolated from neither ground water nor surface water. However, the majority of fens develop in headwater areas and could be defined as "isolated" for jurisdictional purposes because of their distance from navigable-in-fact waters. If so defined, the critical roles that fens play in maintaining biological diversity and stream water quality are at risk regarding federal jurisdiction over "isolated waters" because of the 2001 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the case of Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

A smoothing spline technique is used to model changes in water quality as a result of changes in flow rates, seasonal effects and an underlying trend. The method involves fitting the model twice, once with the underlying trends constrained to be identical for each river and once with the trends unconstrained. Statistical properties are assessed by simulation methods that allow for the autocorrelation in the residuals from the unconstrained fit. The method is applied to data from two streams in the Balquhidder catchments in the Highlands-of Scotland and to data from the Dee, Don and Ythan rivers in the north-east of Scotland.

Although optimal control of such systems is Seldom attainable, the form of such optimal controls provides important insights for more practical schemes. Here we optimize the expected discounted net benefits of phosphorus (P) loadings for a potentially eutrophic lake. The benefits accrue to agricultural interests from activities that result in loading, and costs accrue to other interests from the resulting deterioration of water quality. We extend the 1999 results of S. R. Carpenter, D. Ludwig, and W. A. Brock to account for dependence of P recycling upon the concentration of P in sediments. We obtain optimal policies using methods of dynamic programming with two state variables. We find a strong interaction between economic and ecological parameters in determining the optimal policy: the economic discount rate determines whether the time horizon is long or short, and this in turn strongly influences the magnitude of the optimal loadings. Simple policies that neglect dynamics of P in the sediments are inadequate unless the time horizon is short and the dynamics are slow. A stochastic model is essential if there are substantial random fluctuations in loadings. Uncertainty in the determination of the critical P density that triggers recycling cannot be neglected. Our results may be interpreted as a quantitative precautionary principle that takes account of both economic and ecological aspects of the management of the lake. Our results may also be used to illustrate economic ideas such as sustainable development, natural capital, option,values, and income.

The question arises as to how have sensitive ecosystems reacted, and will react in the future, to these reduced inputs of acidity? In this paper, the SMART dynamic acidification model predicts the possible recovery of 36 acid-sensitive Finnish headwater lakes, for which both catchment soil and water quality measurements were available. The model was calibrated to measurements by adjusting poorly known parameters. it was then used to simulate soil and water chemistry until 2030 under the 'current legislation scenario' resulting from implementing current European emission reduction agreements. Whereas most of the catchment soils show very little change in base saturation, the positive trends in lake ANC and the negative trends in lake sulphate concentrations, observed over the past decade, continue into the future, albeit at a slower pace. The model predicts that, during 2010-30, all lakes will have reached a positive ANC, a pre-requisite for the recovery of fish populations.

Non-point source pollution of water resources: Problems and perspectives	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						NPS pollution; water quality; integrated management strategy; simulation model; sustainable agriculture; GIS	DIFFUSE POLLUTION; PESTICIDES; PHOSPHORUS; NITROGEN; IMPACT; MODEL; SOIL	Non-point source water pollution also known as diffused source pollution arises from a broad group of human activities for which the pollutants have no obvious point of entry into receiving water courses. Quantification and control of non-point source (NPS) pollution remain relatively difficult tasks as compared to those of "point" sources of pollution. Despite several decades of research on management practices in agriculture to minimize water pollution, agriculture production remains a major diffuse source of water pollutants and water quality degradation throughout the World. The concern for agricultural diffuse pollution sources in integrated water quality management has therefore grown recently throughout the World. Such sources are more critical in developing countries. Surface and groundwater quality degradation due to agricultural practices can be categorized as follows: a) increased erosion and soil loss due to agricultural practices; b) chemical pollution by fertilizer and pesticides and c) pollution from animal operations. Abatement of agricultural diffuse sources of pollution must be conducted in the context of moving towards sustainable agriculture. The paper enumerates the present status of non point source pollution in a global perspective and suggests possible measures to control that.	[Panda, R.

Due to the important differences in succesionnal vegetative trends after fire between mixed-wood and coniferous-dominated forests in Quebec (Canada), we undertook a long-term paleoecological study of the impact of fires on the biogeochemistry of Lac a la Pessiere, a small lake located in a conifer-dominated boreal forest ecoregion ( Picea mariana-moss domain). The paleolimnological study was carried out using diatom assemblages (class: Bacillariophyceae) to reconstruct changes in environmental variables of limnological interest [pH, total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and, epilimnetic carbon dioxide (CO2)] potentially associated with fire over the last 1200 calendar years. Diatom composition and related reconstructed limnological variables were compared before and after fire events. No significant changes were systematically observed in lake chemistry associated with fire events. However, diatom-inferred epilimnetic CO2 showed a clear decreasing trend over the last similar to400 cal. yrs BP. The results suggest that fire-induced changes in lake chemistry are limited in catchments dominated by black spruce ( Picea mariana). We hypothesize that this fact result of excess moisture associated to the thick humus layer, which likely limits the mobilization of nutrients and major ions even during a fire event.

Analysis is performed on data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) on nutrients in 1990 through 1997 and 1999 and on discharge rates in 1988 through 1997 and 1999. The Illinois River Basin is in western Arkansas and northeastern Oklahoma and is designated as an Oklahoma Scenic River. Consistently high nutrient concentrations in the river and receiving water bodies conflict with recreational water use, leading to intense stakeholder debate on how best to manage water quality. Results show that the majority of annual phosphorus (P) loading is transported by direct runoff, with high concentrations transported by high discharge rates and low concentrations by low discharge rates. A synthetic relationship is derived and used to generate daily phosphorus concentrations, laying the foundation for analysis of annual loading and evaluation of alternative management practices. Total nitrogen (N) concentration does not have as clear a relationship with discharge. Using a simple regression relationship, annual P loadings are estimated as having a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 39.8 t/yr and 31.9 t/yr and mean absolute percentage errors of 19 percent and 28 percent at Watts and Tahlequah, respectively. P is the limiting nutrient over the full range of discharges. Given that the majority of P is derived from Arkansas, management practices that control P would have the most benefit if applied on the Arkansas side of the border.

The study was performed by applying a biogeochemical biomass-based ecosystem model (ERSEM: European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model) coupled with a 1-dimensional version of a commonly used hydrodynamical model (POM: Princeton Ocean Model). The model response was studied by performing 2 simulations: one with atmospheric forcing functions for present-day climate conditions ('Control', 1970-1999), and one for the future climate after a doubling of the CO2 concentration ('Scenario', 2060-2089). Time-series of meteorological forcing functions were obtained from a greenhouse gas experiment with the high-resolution version of the ECHAM4 atmospheric general circulation model with a horizontal resolution of about 100 km. Present-day simulation results were compared to the available historical observations and showed a satisfactory agreement with the main seasonal cycles of hydrodynamical variables and nutrients in the limits of the 1-dimensional representation. Under the Scenario conditions, the model predicted an overall enhancement of the water-column stratification on an annual basis, with stronger intensification during the summer periods. The diffusion of oxygen and nutrients between surface and bottom layers is reduced, and the transfer of organic matter through the food web is shifted towards the smaller components of the microbial web. The model gives indications of an increase in the specific phytoplankton uptake rates of inorganic carbon in the Scenario, but the photosynthesized carbon ends up in the DOC pool because of the reduced supply of nutrients. The mean annual concentration of DOC is thus higher in the Scenario, with possible negative consequences on the water quality. Additional experiments show that the response of primary producers is not directly linked to the increase in ambient temperature. The structure of the food web modulates the interaction of phytoplankton with the abiotic conditions. The results give indications of a possible non-linear response of the biogeochemical cycles to the climate change warming scenario and confirm the feasibility of using the downscaling technique to couple large-scale climate models with comprehensive regional ecosystem models.

J	Miro, M; Estela, JM; Cerda, V				Miro, M; Estela, JM; Cerda, V			Application of flowing stream techniques to water analysis. Part I. Ionic species: dissolved inorganic carbon, nutrients and related compounds	TALANTA			English	Review						flow techniques; nutrients; monitoring; water analysis	SEQUENTIAL-INJECTION-ANALYSIS; SIMULTANEOUS SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC DETERMINATION; GAS-PHASE CHEMILUMINESCENCE; NATURAL-WATERS; WASTE-WATERS; TRACE AMOUNTS; AMMONIUM ION; MALACHITE GREEN; SPECTROFLUOROMETRIC DETERMINATION; TOTAL PHOSPHORUS	This paper summarizes the most relevant manuscripts issued from 1990 to date referred to water analysis using flowing stream techniques. Concretely, reported flow methods applied to the determination or monitoring of inorganic analytes (viz. carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and silicon species) together with some related compounds to assess water quality in drinking, rain, underground, marine, river, estuarine, waste and industrial samples are reviewed. For the first time, the most widespread flow techniques of analysis described in the literature (viz. segmented flow analysis (SFA), continuous flow analysis (CFA), flow injection analysis (FIA), sequential injection analysis (SIA), multicommuted FIA (MCFIA), multisyringe FIA (MSFIA), along with the different exploited injection modalities are included in the same review.

J	Worrall, F; Swank, WT; Burt, TP				Worrall, F; Swank, WT; Burt, TP			Changes in stream nitrate concentrations due to land management practices, ecological succession, and climate: Developing a systems approach to integrated catchment response	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article						nitrate; streamwater; forest hydrology; climate change; ecological change	NITROGEN SATURATION; FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; CRITICAL LOADS; WATER-QUALITY; TIME-SERIES; WHOLE-TREE; WALES; CHEMISTRY; IMPACTS; TRENDS	[1] This study uses time series analysis to examine long-term stream water nitrate concentration records from a pair of forested catchments at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory, North Carolina, USA. Monthly average concentrations were available from 1970 through 1997 for two forested catchments, one of which was clear-felled in 1977 and the other maintained as a control. The time series were decomposed into their trend and annual cycle before modeling as an autoregressive (AR) process. AR models were calculated for both an expanding and a shifting window so that prefelling could be directly compared with the effects of tree clearance. In comparison with flow records for both of the catchments, transfer function-noise models were calculated on a moving window basis, and the impulse functions were derived. Analysis shows that both catchments show an annual memory effect but that the clear-felled catchment shows, in addition, a 6-month memory effect. The annual effect in the control catchment responds to drought conditions while in the felled catchment, it reflects the change in vegetation. The 6-month effect in the felled catchment responds to drought conditions independent of both the annual effect and of logging operations. The control catchment shows no significant impulse function with respect to flow, while for the felled catchment a distinct impulsivity develops over time subsequent to logging and coincident with the onset of nitrogen saturation. By examining the nature of the nitrate export, rather than solely the levels of export, a systems approach can be taken to understanding catchment behavior. Such an approach shows that the catchment is in metastable equilibrium with respect to its hydrological pathways and nitrogen reserves but in dynamic equilibrium with respect to long-term temperature change. The onset of nitrogen saturation may represent irreversible changes in the catchment behavior, and impulsivity, with respect to streamflow, represents a new indicator of N-saturated conditions.

J	Battle, J; Golladay, SW				Battle, J; Golladay, SW			Prescribed fire's impact on water quality of depressional wetlands in southwestern Georgia	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST			English	Article							ORGANIC-MATTER; COASTAL-PLAIN; FOREST; LAKES	Depressional wetlands are a natural feature of the longleaf pine-wiregrass ecosystem on the southeastern Coastal Plain. Fire is an essential part of the longleaf pine forest with prescribed burns occurring at 1-3 y intervals. In 2000 and 2001 we sampled wetlands whose surrounding uplands had been burned and reference wetlands (i.e., no fire) to determine the short-term changes (<1 mo) in surface water quality In 2000 pH, alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were higher in burned wetlands than reference sites based on ranked ANOVA In 2001 dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and NH4-N were higher in burned wetlands than reference ones. Differences between years suggest that field conditions are very important in determining fire's affect on water quality. To clarify our findings we conducted a laboratory experiment where we looked at changes in water quality when exposed to material (wiregrass, dead pine needles and soil) that had undergone simulated fire (muffle furnace at 340 C for 1 h). Results indicated that water exposed to burned soil had elevated pH, alkalinity, DOC, NH4-N and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) compared to unburned soil. Burned wiregrass and pine needles had lower DOC and DIC levels compared to unburned material, but burned wiregrass had higher NH4-N and SRP concentrations than the unburned treatment. Overall our results suggest that the linkage of fire and water quality of wetlands is through fire's effect on soils rather than vegetation.

The lab experiments showed that a complete nitrogen removal can be realized after 10 d of infiltration in fractures by adding whey in the influent waste. The lab results have been used in a mathematical model in order to simulate ground water quality changes caused by the addition of whey in the injecting water. The analytical parameters of ground water sampled in monitoring wells located at different distances from the injection site, have been compared with mathematical model results. Moreover for preserving such resource from pollution, the mathematical model allowed two areas, around the injection site to be drawn. These areas, where withdrawals would be prohibited, are required to avoid infections by pathogens and bacteria in ground water due to incomplete biodegradation processes. The experimental results can be useful to identify standardized methodology for artificial ground water recharge which could be required for aquifer clean up (Water Frame Directive 2000/60)..

The North Inlet estuary has a relatively small watershed with minimal fresh water input, while the Ashepoo, Combahee, and Edisto (ACE) Basin is characterized by a relatively greater influence of riverine drainage. Sampling stations were located in regions of the estuaries experiencing frequent diurnal tidal mixing and had similar salinity and temperature regimens. Phytoplankton community pigment composition was assessed by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and multivariate statistical analyses. Shannon diversity index, principal-component, and cluster analyses revealed that phytoplankton community pigments in both estuaries were seasonally variable, with similar diversities but different compositions. The temporal pigment patterns indicated that there was a relatively weak correlation between the pigments in ACE Basin and the relative persistence of photopigment groups in North Inlet. The differences were presumably a consequence of the unpredictability and relatively greater influence of river discharge in the ACE Basin, in contrast to the greater environmental predictability of the more tidally influenced North Inlet. Furthermore, the timing, magnitude, and pigment composition of the annual phytoplankton bloom were different in the two estuaries. The bloom properties in North Inlet reflected the predominance of autochthonous ecological control (e.g., regenerated nutrients, grazing), and those in ACE Basin suggested that there was greater influence of allochthonous environmental factors (e.g., nutrient loading, changes in turbidity). These interestuarine differences in phytoplankton community structure and control provide insight into the organization of phytoplankton in estuaries.

J	Turner, RE; Rabalais, NN; Justic, D; Dortch, Q				Turner, RE; Rabalais, NN; Justic, D; Dortch, Q			Global patterns of dissolved N, P and Si in large rivers	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						coastal waters; estuaries; large rivers; limnology; nitrogen; nutrient ratios; phosphate; silicate; stoichiometry	MISSISSIPPI RIVER; NITROGEN; SILICATE; EUTROPHICATION; NUTRIENT; OCEAN; PHYTOPLANKTON; RESPONSES; BALANCE; SYSTEM	The concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), dissolved nitrate-N, Total-N (TN), dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP), total phosphorus (TP), dissolved silicate-Si (DSi) and their ratios in the world's largest rivers are examined using a global data base that includes 37% of the earth's watershed area and half its population. These data were compared to water quality in 42 subbasins of the relatively well-monitored Mississippi River basin (MRB) and of 82 small watersheds of the United States. The average total nitrogen concentration varies over three orders of magnitude among both world river watersheds and the MRB, and is primarily dependent on variations in dissolved nitrate concentration, rather than particulate or dissolved organic matter or ammonium. There is also a direct relationship between the DIN: DIP ratio and nitrate concentration. When nitrate-N exceeds 100 mug-at l(-1), the DIN: DIP ratio is generally above the Redfield ratio (16:1), which implies phosphorus limitation of phytoplankton growth. Compared to nitrate, the among river variation in the DSi concentration is relatively small so that the DSi loading (mass/area/time) is largely controlled by runoff volume. The well-documented influence of human activities on dissolved inorganic nitrogen loading thus exceeds the influences arising from the great variability in soil types, climate and geography among these watersheds. The DSi: nitrate-N ratio is controlled primarily by nitrogen loading and is shown to be inversely correlated with an index of landscape development-the "City Lights" nighttime imagery. Increased nitrogen loading is thus driving the world's largest rivers towards a higher DIN: DIP ratio and a lower DSi: DIN ratio. About 7.3 and 21% of the world's population lives in watersheds with a DSi: nitrate-N ratio near a 1:1 and 2:1 ratio, respectively. The empirical evidence is that this percentage will increase with further economic development. When the DSi: nitrate-N atomic ratio is near 1:1, aquatic food webs leading from diatoms (which require silicate) to fish may be compromised and the frequency or size of harmful or noxious algal blooms may increase. Used together, the DSi: nitrate-N ratio and nitrate-N concentration are useful and robust comparative indicators of eutrophication in large rivers.

Implementation of best management practices is required in those critical erosion prone areas of the watershed for controlling the soil and nutrient losses. Identification of these critical areas is essential for the effective and efficient implementation of watershed management programmes. In this study, a calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was verified for a small watershed (Nagwan) and used for identification and prioritisation of critical sub-watersheds to develop an effective management plan. Daily rainfall, runoff and sediment yield data of 7 years (1992-1998) were used in this study. Data related to nutrient losses for few storm events of 1997 were also used. Besides these data, the topographical map, soil map, land resources data and satellite imageries of the study watershed were used in this study. A geographical information system was used for generating the watershed and sub-watershed boundaries, drainage networks, slope, soil series and texture maps. Supervised classification method was used for land use/cover classification from satellite imageries. The weighted average values of parameters such as runoff curve number, surface slope, channel length, average slope length, channel width, channel depth, soil erodibility factor and other soil layer data were taken for each sub-watershed to verify the model. The calibrated SWAT model was verified for the monsoon season on daily basis for the year 1997 and monthly basis for the years 1992-1998 for both surface runoff and sediment yield. It was also tested for the available data on nutrient losses. Critical sub-watersheds were identified on the basis of average annual sediment yield and nutrient losses during the period of 3 years 1996-1998. The erosion rates and their classes were used as a criterion for identifying the critical sub-watersheds. Out of the 12 sub-watersheds, one sub-watershed fell under moderate soil loss group and five sub-watersheds fell under high soil loss group of soil erosion classes whereas other sub-watersheds fell under slight erosion classes. The study revealed that the SWAT model could successfully be used for identifying and prioritising critical sub-watersheds for management purposes. (C) 2003 Silsoe Research Institute.

Water sampling trips were carried out monthly from April to October 2000. Average water quality parameter concentrations and ranges were: nitrate 0.008 mg-N l(-1) (non-detectable (n.d)-0.143 mg-N l(-1)); ammonium 0.007 mg-N l(-1) (n.d-0.048 mg-N l(-1)); total nitrogen 0.577 mg-N l(-1) (0.193-1.285 mg-N l(-1)); phosphate 0.034 mg-P l(-1) (n.d-0.369 mg-P l(-1)); total phosphorus 0.055 mg-P l(-1) (0.022-0.424 mg-P l(-1)); total suspended sediment 16 mg l(-1) (4-101 mg l(-1)), salinity 3%) (0-12%,), and chlorophyll a 11 mug l(-1) (1-31 mug l(-1)). A UNET hydrodynamic model was constructed to predict hydrologic patterns as diverted water flowed through the Maurepas swamp. The study area was divided into 53 storage cells based on topographical features that mostly consisted of natural bayous and degraded artificial levees. Nitrate loading was high in the initial cells and removal efficiencies were on the order of 40-70%. Loading in subsequent cells was much lower and Simulated nitrate retention was greater than 90%. Since most nutrients will be retained in the swamp, the proposed diversion of Mississippi River water should not cause adverse water quality conditions or extreme or persistent algal blooms in the Lake Maurepas.

I	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Lake Ladoga; ecosystem model; phytoplankton succession; phosphorus loading	SPECIES COMPOSITION; PHOSPHORUS; EVOLUTION	New models of Lake Ladoga ecosystem and the results of modeling are presented. In the first part the model of phytoplankton succession in the process of anthropogenic eutrophication of the lake is considered under the evolution of the phosphorus loading. The still continued anthropogenic eutrophication of the lake started in 1962 when the phosphorus load began to increase. Since 1962 during the evolution of the lake's state from oligotrophic to developed mezotrophic one, the structure of phytoplankton community dominating species was significantly changed as well as its total productivity. The system state in the model is described by 14 parameters: nine phytoplankton complexes, zooplankton, dissolved organic matter, detritus, dissolved mineral phosphorus and dissolved oxygen. The number of parameters of this model is noticeably larger than that of previous models created by the authors. The relative dynamics of phytoplankton complexes in the lake's ecosystem. evolution was simulated by the new model. It is shown that the modeling results are adequately corresponding to the observation data. The results of phytoplankton structure modeling allow to estimate the impact of phytoplankton on the water quality as well as give the prediction of the lake's ecosystem evolution with the changes of the phosphor-us loading.

J	Tuchkovenko, YS; Lonin, SA				Tuchkovenko, YS; Lonin, SA			Mathematical model of the oxygen regime of Cartagena Bay	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING			English	Article						eutrophication; dissolved oxygen; water quality; three-dimensional model; hydrodynamics; bay model		A mathematical model of eutrophication/oxygen regime for Cartagena Bay (Colombia) is described. The model consists of hydrodynamic and biogeochemical blocks to assess engineering alternatives for improving the water quality and oxygen regime in the bay. The hydrodynamic block of the model is based on the primitive three-dimensional equations for estuarine and coastal dynamics. The biogeochemical block includes the balance equations for the following components of the ecosystem: phytoplankton, bacteria, detritus, dissolved organic matter (DOM), phosphate, ammonium, nitrite, nitrate and dissolved oxygen. A non-traditional parameterization of bacteria role in biochemical oxidation of organic matter is used. Modelling of distinct ecological situations for Cartagena Bay has shown the principal strategic objectives to improve the water quality of the bay. The model has been tested and could be applied to other similar water bodies. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Donner, S				Donner, S			The impact of cropland cover on river nutrient levels in the Mississippi River Basin	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						agriculture; croplands; land cover change; land use; Mississippi River; nitrogen; North America; phosphorus; silica; water quality	GLOBAL LAND-COVER; ESTIMATING HISTORICAL CHANGES; STREAM CHEMISTRY; RESOLUTION; NITROGEN; ECOSYSTEMS; CLIMATE; FLUX	Aim This study developed high-resolution datasets of the area of maize, soybean and wheat cultivation in the United States for 1950, 1970 and 1992. The datasets were used to examine the relationship between individual crop cover and nutrient levels in rivers across the Mississippi River Basin. Location This study was conducted in the United States, with focus on the Mississippi River Basin. Methods County and state-level estimates of the planted area of maize, soybean and wheat were integrated with a satellite-derived pattern in total cropland to develop 5' x 5' resolution datasets of the fractional area of maize, soybean and wheat in the United States for 1950, 1970 and 1992. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationships between mean levels of nitrogen, phosphorous and silica in 25 rivers across the Mississippi Basin, and the extent of maize, soybean and wheat cultivation in the watersheds. Results The crop datasets provide a spatially explicit representation of the area of the three primary crops in 1950, 1970 and 1992. The datasets clearly depict the rapid expansion of soybean cultivation, the increased specialization of individual agricultural regions, and the accompanying reduction in agricultural biodiversity since 1950. The statistical analysis identified strong correlations between the extent of maize and soybean cover in a watershed and the level of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) at the watershed outlet. In particular, the area of maize appears to be strongly related to the concentration of total-N and the ratio of dissolved inorganic-N and organic-N at the watershed outlet. Conclusions The intensification of cultivation of the three primary crops - maize, soybean and wheat - has altered land cover and water quality across the U.S. since 1950. The high present-day rate of fertilizer use on maize and the expansion of soybean cultivation could be largely responsible for the change in nutrient ratios in the Mississippi River since 1950.

J	Gaston, LA; Drapcho, CM; Tapadar, S; Kovar, JL				Gaston, LA; Drapcho, CM; Tapadar, S; Kovar, JL			Phosphorus runoff relationships for Louisiana Coastal Plain soils amended with poultry litter	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							AGRICULTURAL PHOSPHORUS; BROILER LITTER; WATER-QUALITY; EXTRACTANTS; PROTECTION; INTENSITY; RELEASE; SITES	Long-term application of poultry (Gallus gallus domesticus) litter has built high levels of P in certain Coastal Plain soils of north Louisiana. However, soil P/runoff P relationships for soil and environmental conditions of the area have not been examined. This study measured soil P (total, Bray 1, Bray 2, Mehlich 3, resin-exchangeable, and water-extractable) and runoff P (dissolved P, DP; and total P, TP) at four pasture sites previously amended with poultry litter. Sites varied in soil P due to annual litter applications ranging from 1 to more than 20. Three replicated plots at each site were subjected to simulated rainfalls over 2 yr, and concentrations of DP and TP in runoff were measured and related to soil P. This allowed examination of soil P/runoff P relationships and their changes over time. Runoff DP was also related to DP desorbed from surface soil in a miscible displacement experiment. Among measures of soil P, only resin-exchangeable and water-extractable P showed significant decreases over 2 yr. These measures of soil P explained 54 to 64% of the variability in runoff DP data. However, the miscible displacement technique proved the best indicator of runoff DP, explaining 70% of the variability. Runoff varied among sites (decreasing with increasing years of litter application), limiting the predictive capability of the soil extraction methods. Linking runoff characteristics with miscible displacement data may he a useful predictive tool and warrants further examination.

J	Venterink, HO; Wiegman, F; Van der Lee, GEM; Vermaat, JE				Venterink, HO; Wiegman, F; Van der Lee, GEM; Vermaat, JE			Role of active floodplains for nutrient retention in the river Rhine	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							NITROGEN-RETENTION; WATER-QUALITY; SEDIMENTATION; STREAM; PHOSPHORUS; TRANSPORT; WETLANDS; PATTERNS; BUDGET; MODEL	We evaluated the importance of floodplains for nutrient retention in two distributaries of the river Rhine (Waal and IJssel) by monitoring N and P retention in a body of water during downstream transport. We hypothesized that (i) retention of P is much larger than retention of N and (ii) nutrient retention increases with an increasing amount of the discharge flowing through floodplains (Q(F)). The second hypothesis was tested by comparing retention between the rivers Waal (low QF) and IJssel (high Q(F)) as well as at different discharges. Total nitrogen (TN) did not decrease significantly during downstream transport in both rivers, whereas 20 to 45% of total phosphorus (TP) disappeared during transport in the river Ussel. This difference between N and P retention-supporting the first hypothesis-was probably caused by differences in sedimentation through a much lower proportion of N adsorbed to particles than of P (2-3% of N vs. 50-70% of P). Phosphorus retention was only observed in the Ussel and not in the Waal, and absolute P retention (g P s(-1) km(-1)) in the Ussel increased with increasing QF. The second hypothesis was, nevertheless, not fully supported, because the percentage P retention (% of P load) decreased (instead of increased) with increasing QF.

The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of two tillage practices (no-till and chisel plow) and a range of soil P levels on the concentration and loads of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), algal-available phosphorus (AAP), and total phosphorus (TP) losses in runoff, and to evaluate the P loss immediately following tillage in the fall, and after six months, in the spring. Rain simulations were conducted on a Typic Argiudoll under a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] rotation. Elapsed time after tillage (fall vs. spring) was not related to any form of P in runoff. No-till runoff averaged 0.40 mg L-1 and 0.05 kg ha(-1) DRP and chisel-plow plots averaged 0.24 mg L-1 and 0.02 kg ha(-1) DRP concentration and loads, respectively. The relationship between DRP and Bray P1 extraction values was approximated by a logistic function (S-shaped curve) for no-till plots and by a linear function for tilled plots. No significant differences were observed between tillage systems for TP and AAP in runoff. Bray P1 soil extraction values and sediment concentration in runoff were significantly related to the concentrations and amounts of AAP and TP in runoff. These results suggest that soil Bray P1 extraction values and runoff sediment concentration are two easily measured variables for adequate prediction of P runoff from agricultural fields.

It is hypothesized that the natural characteristics of the streams in Korea allow the contaminated water to be treated at the tributaries. Downstream river water quality in Korea may be improved by spraying the contaminated stream water from the tributaries over the surrounding floodplains. The consequent water filtration through the soil could remove the contaminants through aerobic and denitrifying reactions. In this study, the kinetics parameters of the denitrifying reaction in floodplain filtration were determined using contaminated stream water. For the electron donor the Monod kinetics was used, while the competitive Michaelis-Menten model was employed for the electron acceptors. The parameters to the competitive Michaelis-Menten model were found using continuous denitrifying reactions, instead of the batch reactions employed in previous studies, to match the conditions needed to apply the competitive Michaelis-Menten kinetics. From the result, it was found that continuous reactions as well as batch reactions could be used to determine the affinity coefficients in denitrification. The results of this study also showed that the affinity coefficient of NO2-, using continuous reactions, was similar to that of other studies in the literature found via batch reactions, whereas the affinity coefficient of N2O was much larger than that acquired with batch reactions. The parameters obtained in this study will be used in future work to simulate the contaminant behaviors during floodplain filtration using a mathematical model.

This leads to high rates of eutrophication, sedimentation and related problems. This study coupled two models-Agricultural Nonpoint Source (AGNPS) watershed and BATHTUB lake-to simulate actual lake water quality conditions in three contrasting subbasins and subwatersheds of Clinton Lake, Kansas, and demonstrated the use of the coupled model for simulating lake response to changes in watershed land use and management. Watershed event-based yields were used to determine monthly watershed loads of water, sediment, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) to Clinton Lake. The lake was initially surveyed for depth and sampled monthly for various water-quality parameters with depth at 12 sites from May through December 1997 and April through November 1998. Watershed toads for 1997 conditions (26.5% cropland, 56.0% grassland) accurately simulated lake levels of total N, total P, chlorophyll a (chl a), and Secchi depth for each subbasin. The calibrated model simulated in-lake reductions as much as 35% for N, 38% for P, and 49% for chl a from the native-grass scenario, and increases as much as 6% for N, 12% for P and 9% for chl a from removing all existing terraces (17.8% of watershed). The calibrated current-conditions model also demonstrated a decrease in N:P ratio from 9.3 to 8.7 as take depth decreased from sedimentation over the next century. The coupled model shows promise for load allocation and take water-quatity response determinations to support the total maximum daily load (TMDL) process.

Three distinct water quality models were applied to support the TMDL: a two-dimensional laterally averaged model, a three-dimensional model, and a probability (Bayesian network) model. In this paper, we compare the salient features of all three models and present the results of a verification exercise in which each calibrated model was used to predict estuarine chlorophyll a concentrations for the year 2000. We present six summary statistics to relate the model predictions to the observed chlorophyll values: (1) the correlation coefficient; (2) the average error; (3) the average absolute error; (4) the root mean squared error; (5) the reliability index; and (6) the modeling efficiency. Additionally, we examined each model's ability to predict how frequently the 40 mug/L chlorophyll a criterion was exceeded. The results indicate that none of the models predicted chlorophyll concentrations particularly well. Predictive accuracy was no better in the more process-oriented, spatially detailed models than in the aggregate probabilistic model. Our relative inability to predict accurately, even in well-studied, data-rich systems underscores the need for adaptive management, in which management actions are recognized as whole-ecosystem experiments providing additional data and information to better understand and predict system behavior.

J	Walker, WW				Walker, WW			Consideration of variability and uncertainty in phosphorus total maximum daily loads for lakes	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						phosphorus; water quality; lakes		A simplified framework for considering variability and uncertainty in developing lake phosphorus total maximum daily, loads (TMDLs) is demonstrated. Explicit consideration of these factors can increase the probability that TMDL implementation will meet a defined water quality goal at an acceptable frequency. Although a lake goal is typically expressed as a seasonal or yearly average phosphorus concentration, effects of temporal variations can be captured by correlating average phosphorus concentrations with the frequency of algal blooms (defined by extreme values of chlorophyll a) or the frequency, of exceeding numeric water quality standards that are directly linked to algal blooms, such as hydrogen ion concentration or transparency. The margin of safety (MOS) required to achieve the lake goal at a defined frequency and with a defined confidence level can be estimated by including stochastic terms in the phosphorus balance equation to reflect variability and uncertainty. Given limitations in the data and models typically used in developing TMDLs, the cost of the MOS, expressed in terms of percent of the total allocated load or safety factors in the design of control measures, can be large. The MOS would be expected to increase with the percent load reduction required under the TMDL, as the forecast loads become increasingly dependent on assumptions regarding the performance of best management practices or other measures for reducing loads. The magnitude and cost of the MOS can be reduced by implementing TMDLs in an iterative fashion with ongoing data collection, and, model refinement to reduce uncertainties associated with forecasting the performance of phosphorus load controls and lake responses.

Specifically, our analysis aims at identifying the key control and management actions, and the key scientific uncertainties about the fluvial system, that govern the attainment of a set of water, quality objectives for the downstream boundary of the study area. To this end, we present a computational framework that integrates a recently developed sediment-nutrient dynamics model with a Monte Carlo-based methodology for model uncertainty. evaluation. Our results suggest that, in general, reliable execution of controls and management actions is more crucial to meeting the target values for flow, sediment, and phosphorus concentration, than the scientific uncertainties associated with fluvial processes within the river channel. We also discuss the potential utility of-our framework for accommodating the various science-and policy-derived uncertainties in the total maximum daily load process.

Unlike conventional simulation models, probability networks describe probabilistic dependencies among system variables rather than substance mass balances. Full networks are decomposable into smaller submodels, with structure and quantification that reflect relevant theory, judgment, and/or observation. Model predictions are expressed probabilistically, which supports consideration of frequency-based water quality standards and explicit estimation of the TMDL margin of safety. For the Neuse Estuary TMDL application, the probability network can be used to predict compliance with the dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a regulatory criteria as a function of riverine nitrogen load. In addition, the model includes ecological endpoints, such as fishkills and shellfish survival, that are typically more meaningful to stakeholders than conventional water quality characteristics. Incorporating these unregulated attributes into TMDL decisions will require explicit consideration of costs, benefits, and relative likelihoods of various possible outcomes under alternate loading scenarios.

Several modifications to the model were made for this application including the further development of the existing sediment diagenesis submodel and an empirically derived light extinction prediction. The simulation period included two extreme nitrogen loading events and three summers with chlorophyll a concentrations that exceeded the water quality standard of 40 mug/L. A multiobjective, statistically based procedure was used to calibrate the model to observed chlorophyll a concentrations. The model was then used to predict changes in chlorophyll a concentrations and water quality standard exceedances in estuary regions for a variety of total. nitrogen load reductions. The model predicted that a load reduction of approximately 5% was needed to lower the frequency of water quality standard violations below 10%. The process-based modeling approach was found to be a valuable tool for a TMDL analysis, with certain reservations related to its relatively high-data needs and its inability to fully address prediction uncertainty.

The model provides reach-level predictions of the probability of exceeding water-quality criteria, and estimates of total nitrogen budgets. Model estimates of point- and diffuse-source contributions and nitrogen loss rates in streams and reservoirs compared moderately well with literature estimates. Maps of reach-level predictions of nutrient inputs and delivery provide an intuitive and spatially detailed summary of the origins and fate of nutrients within a basin.

The manipulation was initiated in spring 2000 as a response to non-point sources of phosphorus in a drinking water reservoir in Saxony, Germany. Salmonids (brown trout, Salmo trutta forma lacustris) were chosen as predators as the reservoir has a large hypolimnic water body and surface temperatures rarely exceed 20 degreesC. The vertical distributions of prey fish and brown trout were analysed with a fleet of vertical gill nets set in the pelagic zone of the reservoir. Consumption of brown trout was estimated by means of a bioenergetic model and the diet analyses of the trout. While the dominant planktivore (roach, Rutilus rutilus) was caught almost exclusively in the epilimnion during the stratification period trout were caught mainly below a depth of 10 m. Diet analysis revealed that the trout performed vertical migrations to consume food in the epilimnic layer, as an important food component were adult terrestrial and aquatic insects. The amount of fish in the food increased strongly with the size of the brown trout. The consumption estimate suggested that the trout had consumed 2-3% of the total roach stock during the study period (May-November 2000) of the first year of biomampulation. We conclude that in general salmonids are suitable for food-web manipulation in deep reservoirs, but the stocked fish should be as large as possible (> 300 mm) and the proportion of large trout (> 500 mm) should be as high as possible.

J	Watson, SB; Satchwill, T				Watson, SB; Satchwill, T			Chrysophyte odour production: resource-mediated changes at the cell and population levels	PHYCOLOGIA			English	Article							POLYUNSATURATED FATTY-ACIDS; FRESH-WATER; NUTRIENT LIMITATION; PHYTOPLANKTON; GROWTH; LIGHT; LIPIDS; ALGAE; CYANOBACTERIA; PHOSPHORUS	Algal metabolites have major impacts on water quality. Some of the more potent of these compounds can produce severe source-water odours furthermore, there is now growing evidence that some algal volatile organic compound,, (AVOCs) function in aquatic chemical ecology. However, the processes that influence the levels and dynamics of AVOC production are not well understood. There has been some success in linking to individual taxa, but it is often difficult to predict taste and odour (T/O) Outbreaks because algal communities show significant among- and within-species variation in AVOC production. Thus, while it is generally established that resources Such as nutrients and light govern the growth of many odour-causing freshwater algae, it is not clear how these resources influence algal odour production and whether this is simply via changes in standing stock or in per capita AVOC yield or chemistry. We examined this question for three bloom-forming chrysophytes, the two bacterivores Dinobryon cylindricum Imhof and Uroglena cf. americana Calkins, and the autotroph Mallomonas papillosa Harris & Bradley, Using data from several studies. These chrysophytes can produce severe rancid or fishy odours through the production of unsaturated fatty acid derivatives (2,4-heptadienal, 2.4-decadienal and 2,4,7-decatrienal), which differ considerably in potency [with odour threshold concentrations (OTCs) of 25, 0.3 and 1 mug l (1) respectively]. We measured in vitro growth, biomass, AVOC production and total odour yield (calculated from OTC-normalized AVOCs), under low and high P, N, Fe and light. The results showed significant resource-related changes in biomass and AVOC production and chemistry, which differed among species. For Mallomonas, biomass, AVOC and odour yields were all correlated closely with resource levels. For the two bacterivores, biomass was related strongly to light and P, but odour production varied between species and treatments. Dinobryon AVOC yield was related significantly to P and N, but not directly to light Or Fe; Uroglena AVOC yield responded to light and P. For the two bacterivores, AVOC production was not related clearly to grazing activity. The final total odour produced by each species did not necessarily reflect changes in their total biomass or AVOC mass yield because of variation in their relative and absolute per capita production of individual aldehydes, and because of the large differences in the relative potencies of these compounds. This implies that biomass reduction (e.g. via nutrient abatement) will not always reduce algal-derived T/O, because this is a function of changes at both the cell and Population levels. This is also important from an ecological viewpoint, because the potential roles of these AVOCs as chemical signals or allelogens is likely to be Coupled closely with the dynamics of their production.

J	Jin, CX; Sands, GR				Jin, CX; Sands, GR			The long-term field-scale hydrology of subsurface drainage systems in a cold climate	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Agricultural-Engineers	JUL 28-31, 2002	CHICAGO, IL	Amer Soc Agr Engineers		DRAINMOD; hydrology; long-term simulation; subsurface drainage	WATER MANAGEMENT MODEL; NITRATE-NITROGEN; CORN YIELD; SOIL; SIMULATION; DRAINMOD; TILLAGE; RUNOFF; FLOW	Subsurface drainage is a common practice in the agricultural regions of the northern Midwest. Concerns about the impact of subsurface drainage on surface water quality and hydrology have increased over the past decade, spawning continued research on artificial drainage. Annual and decadal climatic variability necessitates a long-term perspective to fully evaluate these impacts. In addition, less is known about the hydrology of artificially drained lands in cold regions, where soil freezing and snowmelt routinely occur. A field-scale hydrologic analysis of subsurface drainage was performed using DRAINMOD v5.1 for an 85-year climatic period (1915 to 1999) for south-central Minnesota. This version of DRAINMOD included modifications for soil freeze/thaw and snowmelt processes. The results give insight into the long-term variations of subsurface drainage and other precipitation abstractions in a cold climate. Seasonal hydrology was characterized by well defined drainage and evapotranspiration (ET) "seasons" from March to June and from July to October, respectively. On average, 74% of infiltrated water was removed by subsurface drainage during the drainage season (March to June), representing 27% of annual precipitation. Significant increases in the 28-year average precipitation and drainage depths were apparent over the 85-year simulation period. Frequency and extreme value analysis revealed that annual drainage represented approximately 40% of annual precipitation at the 2-year return interval. Simulated annual drainage volumes were distributed normally, wherein the predicted 100-year annual drainage depth was 532 mm. Decreased drain spacing was found to significantly affect infiltration and drainage over the 85-year period. The results have potential uses for drainage practitioners, water management decision makers, and environmental and agricultural scientists and may pose significant challenges for addressing water quality issues on artificially drained lands.

J	Haan, PK; Skaggs, RW				Haan, PK; Skaggs, RW			Effect of parameter uncertainty on DRAINMOD predictions: II. Nitrogen loss	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						drainage; DRAINMOD; first-order approximation; Monte Carlo simulation; nitrogen; uncertainty	MODELS; SOILS	Reducing nitrate levels in sensitive coastal waters has become a national priority. Agriculture has been targeted as a significant contributor to this problem. Controlled drainage is recognized as one way to reduce nitrate losses from agricultural fields requiring subsurface drainage. The computer-based hydrology model DRAINMOD can be used to predict the effect of drainage design on the rate of subsurface drainage and the water quality related to nitrates in these waters. An uncertainty analysis of the model was conducted to quantitatively assess the variability in the model predictions for average annual nitrate loss through subsurface drainage, surface runoff, and denitrification caused by parameter uncertainty. First-order approximation and Monte Carlo simulation were used to estimate the effect of the uncertainty in the most sensitive parameters (dispersivity, bulk density, % nitrogen uptake by corn, mineralization rate constant, and denitrification rate constant) on the uncertainty in the model objective functions. The denitrification rate constant accounted for greater than 70% of the uncertainty in terms of the variance for all objective functions under both conventional and controlled drainage. Reducing the uncertainty in influential parameters can reduce the uncertainty in DRAINMOD predictions for nitrate loss.

The water quality model being used includes phytoplankton and both dissolved and particulate constituents as state variables. It includes zooplankton grazing of the phytoplankton, where excretions from the latter increase the particulate constituents. The phytoplankton and particulate constituents also undergo settling. When applied to an existing estuary, the model results are different for a first order zooplankton grazing rate formulation than for a second order zooplankton grazing rate formulation. Constituents enter the estuary as wastewater discharges, freshwater river inflows, exchanges between the sediment and water interface, and exchange across the tidal boundary. The water quality model is coupled with a three-dimensional time varying hydrodynamic and transport model that allows accurate computation of the tidal velocity field transporting the constituents from their sources throughout the estuary. Comparisons of model results between the first order and the second order density dependent zooplankton grazing relationships allow determining which of the two processes best describe water quality behavior for the estuary being examined. The second order density dependent zooplankton grazing relationship performs best in application.

J	Albek, E				Albek, E			Estimation of point and diffuse contaminant loads to streams by non-parametric regression analysis of monitoring data	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION			English	Article						diffuse pollution; monitoring; non-parametric regression; point source; stream pollution; water quality	RIVERS	In this study, point and diffuse contaminant loads to a stream are estimated using stream monitoring data. Regression analysis is conducted to separate point source loads and background contaminant loads using water quality and flow time series. Non-parametric methods are utilized for regression and auxiliary statistical tests to eliminate the effects of outliers in the data and to avoid restrictions posed by assumptions of normality. Point source loads and background concentrations are estimated directly by regression of data from a station. A second station is needed to estimate diffuse load contributions. The method is exemplified using data from a polluted stream in Turkey, the Porsuk Stream. Point and diffuse loads are estimated for six water quality parameters, chloride, dissolved solids, ammonia, nitrate, biochemical oxygen demand and total phosphorus. It is found that for many water quality parameters, contaminant loads to a stream can be estimated with reasonable accuracy.

The studied catchments are located throughout Finland except the northernmost parts of the country. The concentrations of TOC were relatively high, on average 20 mg L-1. Annual leaching of TOC ranged from 3000 to 10 000 kg km(-2). The average total nitrogen concentration and annual leaching were 430 mug L-1 and 140 kg km(-2), respectively. The average total phosphorus concentration and annual leaching were 15 mug L-1 and 5.4 kg km(-2), respectively. On a national level temperature and discharge conditions were the most important variables for predicting total phosphorus, total nitrogen and TOC concentrations. Both total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations displayed positive correlation with temperature, and thus the concentrations were higher in the south than in the north. Nitrogen was mainly organic and showed strong correlation with TOC. On the catchment level, both TOC and total nitrogen concentrations and export had a strong positive correlation with the abundance of Norway spruce (Picea abies Karsten) and a strong negative correlation with the abundance of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). Nitrate concentrations and leaching were related to average site type. The more fertile the average site type was in the catchment, the higher the nitrate concentrations and export were.

J	von Elert, E; Martin-Creuzburg, D; Le Coz, JR				von Elert, E; Martin-Creuzburg, D; Le Coz, JR			Absence of sterols constrains carbon transfer between cyanobacteria and a freshwater herbivore (Daphnia galeata)	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						food quality; fatty acid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; Daphnia; cyanobacteria; sterol	BLUE-GREEN-ALGAE; POLYUNSATURATED FATTY-ACIDS; FOOD QUALITY; PHOSPHORUS LIMITATION; NUTRIENT LIMITATION; WATER ZOOPLANKTON; GROWTH; REPRODUCTION; FILAMENTS; PHYTOPLANKTON	A key process in freshwater plankton food webs is the regulation of the efficiency of energy and material transfer. Cyanobacterial carbon (C) in particular is transferred very inefficiently to herbivorous zooplankton, which leads to a decoupling of primary and secondary production and the accumulation of cyanobacterial biomass, which is associated with reduced recreational quality of water bodies and hazards to human health. A recent correlative field study suggested that the low transfer efficiency of cyanobacterial C is the result of the absence of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the diet of the zooplankton. By supplementation of single-lipid compounds in controlled growth experiments, we show here that the low C transfer efficiency of coccal and filamentous cyanobacteria to the keystone herbivore Daphnia is caused by the low sterol content in cyanobacteria, which constrains cholesterol synthesis and thereby growth and reproduction of the herbivore. Estimations of sterol requirement in Daphnia suggest that, when cyanobacteria comprise more than 80% of the grazed phytoplankton, growth of the herbivore may be limited by sterols and Daphnia may subsequently fail to control phytoplankton biomass. Dietary sterols therefore may play a key role in freshwater food webs and in the control of water quality in lakes dominated by cyanobacteria.

We define biogeochemical hot spots as patches that show disproportionately high reaction rates relative to the surrounding matrix, whereas hot moments are defined as short periods of time that exhibit disproportionately high reaction rates relative to longer intervening time periods. As has been appreciated by ecologists for decades, hot spot and hot moment activity is often enhanced at terrestrial-aquatic interfaces. Using examples from the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, we show that hot spots occur where hydrological flowpaths converge with substrates or other flowpaths containing complementary or missing reactants. Hot moments occur when episodic hydrological flowpaths reactivate and/or mobilize accumulated reactants. By focusing on the delivery of specific missing reactants via hydrologic flowpaths, we can forge a better mechanistic understanding of the factors that create hot spots and hot moments. Such a mechanistic understanding is necessary so that biogeochemical hot spots can be identified at broader spatiotemporal scales and factored into quantitative models. We specifically recommend that resource managers incorporate both natural and artificially created biogeochemical hot spots into their plans for water quality management. Finally, we emphasize the needs for further research to assess the potential importance of hot spot and hot moment phenomena in the cycling of different bioactive elements, improve our ability to predict their occurrence, assess their importance in landscape biogeochemistry, and evaluate their utility as tools for resource management.

J	King, RS; Richardson, CJ				King, RS; Richardson, CJ			Integrating bioassessment and ecological risk assessment: An approach to developing numerical water-quality criteria	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						biological assessment; ecological thresholds; everglades; Index of Biological integrity; macroinvertebrates; nutrients; phosphorus; risk assessment; wetlands	BIOTIC INTEGRITY; STREAMS; EVERGLADES; LIMITATION; ENRICHMENT; PERIPHYTON; COMMUNITY; NUTRIENTS; GRADIENT; WETLANDS	ioassessment is used worldwide to monitor aquatic health but is infrequently used with risk-assessment objectives, such as supporting the development of defensible, numerical water-quality criteria, To this end, we present a generalized approach for detecting potential ecological thresholds using assemblage-level attributes and a multimetric index (Index of Biological Integrity-IBI) as endpoints in response to numerical changes in water quality. To illustrate the approach, we used existing macroinvertebrate and surface-water total phosphorus (TP) datasets from an observed P gradient and a P-dosing experiment in wetlands of the south Florida coastal plain nutrient ecoregion. Ten assemblage attributes were identified as potential metrics using the observational data, and five were validated in the experiment. These five core metrics were subjected individually and as an aggregated Nutrient-IBI to nonparametric changepoint analysis (nCPA) to estimate cumulative probabilities of a threshold response to TP. Threshold responses were evident for all metrics and the IBI, and were repeatable through time. Results from the observed gradient indicated that a threshold was greater than or equal to50% probable between 12.6 and 19.4 mug/L TP for individual metrics and 14.8 mug/L TP for the IBI. Results from the P-dosing experiment revealed greater than or equal to50% probability of a response between 11.2 and 13.0 mug/L TP for the metrics and 12.3 mug/L TIP for the IBI. Uncertainty analysis indicated a low (typically greater than or equal to5%) probability that an IBI threshold occurred at less than or equal to 10 mug/L TP, while there was greater than or equal to95% certainty that the threshold was less than or equal to 17 mug/L TP. The weight-of-evidence produced from these analyses implies that a TP concentration > 12-15 mug/L is likely to cause degradation of macroinvertebrate assemblage structure and function, a reflection of biological integrity, in the study area. This finding may assist in the development of a numerical water-quality criterion for TP in this ecoregion, and illustrates the utility of bioassessment to environmental decision-making.

J	Christian, RR; Thomas, CR				Christian, RR; Thomas, CR			Network analysis of nitrogen inputs and cycling in the Neuse River Estuary, North Carolina, USA	ESTUARIES			English	Article							CHESAPEAKE BAY; SUBTIDAL SEDIMENTS; COASTAL WATERS; BLOOM DYNAMICS; FLOW-ANALYSIS; ECOSYSTEM; TEMPERATE; MODEL; EUTROPHICATION; CONSEQUENCES	The Neuse River estuary, North Carolina, United States, has demonstrated various symptoms of eutrophication during the past 20 yr. We contributed to an environmental assessment program, through ecological network analysis, a group of algorithms to evaluate networks of material flows within a structured system. Networks of nitrogen (N) cycling for 16 consecutive seasons were constructed based on previous field and laboratory studies. Network analysis provided understanding of the relationship between N loading and recycling, the fates of N and the expected interseasonal variation of both model inputs and outputs. Various indices indicated that recycling of imported N was very high, supporting measured observations. There was little correlation between estimates of loading and N uptake by phytoplankton, although loading of total and particulate N did correlate positively with export. Because of the high degree of recycling of N, the rate of loading of new N is a small fraction of the total processing of N or of the needs for primary production alone. We predict that on a short-term basis the controls on primary production tend to be associated with conditions in the estuary rather than import. This condition is likely to postpone easily observable responses to loading reduction over the entire estuary and in the short term, although improvements in water quality should occur over time.

J	Tundisi, JG; Matsumura-Tundisi, T				Tundisi, JG; Matsumura-Tundisi, T			Integration of research and management in optimizing multiple uses of reservoirs: the experience in South America and Brazilian case studies	HYDROBIOLOGIA			English	Article						limnology; management; tropical reservoirs; new approaches	SAO-PAULO; PHYTOPLANKTON; STATE	The construction of large reservoirs in South America and particularly in Brazil has intensified within the last 50 years. Built up primarily for hydroelectricity production, these artificial ecosystems now serve purposes such as: water storage for public use; fisheries and aquaculture; recreation; tourism, and irrigation. These artificial ecosystems were also built up with the purpose of enhancing the regional development. These activities produce multiple impacts among which are eutrophication, a serious problems with various ecological, economic, and social consequences. Basic studies on reservoirs have identified their main ecological characteristics and described some of their fundamental mechanisms of functioning. This information cover: factors involved in reservoir complexity, such as spatial scale, vertical and horizontal heterogeneity, temporal variation at several time scales and, in some cases, watershed/reservoir relationships, and the impact of non-point and point sources of nutrients. Numerous studies have been dedicated to describing aquatic biota, its relationship with environmental factors, and the impacts of degradation/pollution/eutrophication on biodiversity. Research priorities have been established mainly by limnologists in response to needs identified by environmental impact assessment. Due to the pressure of multiple uses, population growth, and economic factors, aquatic scientists now face a number of questions being posed by managers and engineers. These questions relate to a wide range of practical problems, the solutions to which depend on accumulated data related to the structural complexities and function mechanisms previously referred to. These problems can be divided into three main groups: (i) eutrophication processes and their characteristics, and water quality control; (ii) impact of fisheries, aquaculture, and exotic species introduction on the biota and the water quality; (iii) sustainable development of reservoirs and optimization management of their multiple uses. Predictive capabilities required in the face of these problems should be based on modeling development and intensive use of data-bases resulting from long-term studies on reservoirs. The predictions thus made possible would involve economic factors and the costs of recovery of eutrophic reservoirs. The experience of reservoir research and management in South America and in Brazil is, probably part of a world wide tendency on reservoir research and development with the aim to optimize multiple uses. Based on the cooperation of limnologists and engineers, ecosystem management models must eventually be applied at the watershed / reservoir level, where demands on the part of managers and decision makers will certainly promote a predictive, integrated, and adaptive approach, based on fundamental research.

Although designed as a technical demonstration for land applications, Hyperion was tested for its capabilities over a range of water targets in Eastern Australia, including Moreton Bay in southern Queensland. Moreton Bay was the only Australian Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) Hyperion coastal site used for calibration/validation activities. This region was selected due to its spatial gradients in optical depth, water quality, bathymetry, and substrate composition. A combination of turbid and humic river inputs, as well as the open ocean flushing, determines the water quality of the bay. The field campaigns were coincident with Hyperion overpasses, retrieved inherent optical properties apparent optical properties, substrate reflectance spectra, and water quality, parameters, Environmental noise calculations demonstrate that Hyperion has sufficient sensitivity to detect optical water quality concentrations of colored dissolved organic matter, chlorophyll, and suspended matter in the complex waters of Moreton Bay. A methodology was developed integrating atmospheric and hydrooptical radiative transfer models (MODTRAN-4, Hydrolight) to estimate the underwater light field. A applied to retrieve concentrations matrix inversion, method was of chlorophyll, colored dissolved-organic matter, and suspended matter, which were comparable to those estimated in the field on the days of the overpass.

Recent measurements such as total phosphorus, chlorophyll a and Secchi depth levels suggest that the water quality has been declining. A two-dimensional, laterally averaged, finite difference hydrodynamic and water quality model was used to simulate the water quality in the Feitsui Reservoir in an effort to determine sound water quality management strategies. The model was calibrated and verified using data collected in 1996 and 1997. The calibrated model was used to simulate algal biomass (in terms of chlorophyll a) levels under various wasteload reduction scenarios. Model results show that 50 percent reduction of the total phosphorus load will improve the existing water quality, shifting the trophic status from eutrophic/mesotrophic to oligotrophic. The modeling effort has yielded valuable information that can be used by decision makers for the evaluation of different management strategies of reducing watershed nutrient loads.

J	Dodds, WK				Dodds, WK			Misuse of inorganic N and soluble reactive P concentrations to indicate nutrient status of surface waters	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						ammonium; dissolved reactive phosphorus; inorganic nutrients; nitrate; nutrient limitation; phosphate; water-quality monitoring	LARGE OLIGOTROPHIC LAKE; PRAIRIE STREAMS; ALGAL BIOMASS; NITROGEN; PHOSPHATE; LIMITATION; PHYTOPLANKTON; PHOSPHORUS; PATTERNS; REGENERATION	Dissolved inorganic N (DIN) and soluble reactive P (SRP) have been used by some to indicate the trophic status of waters, and concentration ratios (DIN:SRP) to indicate nutrient deficiency. The utility of such measurements should be questioned, particularly based on well-known problems associated with determination of the concentration of SRP, which is commonly assumed to represent PO43-. Another potential problem with using inorganic nutrient pools to represent trophic state and nutrient availability ratios arises because concentration values are in units of mass per unit volume, and cannot be used with certainty to estimate supply (i.e., turnover rate of the nutrient pool, expressed either in mass per unit volume per unit time or simply as per unit time) to organisms without information on uptake and remineralization. Two data sets with lotic water-column nutrient values were explored, a large, continental-scale data set with analyses and collections done by many laboratories, and a more limited data set collected and analyzed by the same laboratory. In concert, the data sets indicated that at high total N (TN) (i.e., >5 mg/L) and total P (TP) (i.e., >2 mg/L) concentrations, >60% of the nutrient is usually made up of dissolved inorganic forms, but at low levels the ratio of dissolved inorganic to total nutrients is highly variable. Last, DIN:SRP is a weak surrogate for TN:TP and thus should be used with caution to indicate nutrient limitation.

J	Carr, GM; Bod, SAE; Duthie, HC; Taylor, WD				Carr, GM; Bod, SAE; Duthie, HC; Taylor, WD			Macrophyte biomass and water quality in Ontario rivers	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						macrophytes; nutrients; water quality; rivers; models; validation	AQUATIC MACROPHYTES; INORGANIC CARBON; FLOWING WATERS; GROWTH; STREAMS; PHOSPHORUS; PERIPHYTON; NITROGEN; CANADA	An empirical survey of macrophyte biomass collected from 38 stations along 28 rivers in southwestern Ontario was conducted in 1999 and 2000 to quantify the relationship between biomass and instream nutrients and dissolved ions. Multiple regression models showed that mean and maximum biomass were weakly but significantly related to the nutrients N and P; these variables explained similar to27% of the variability in biomass across stations. Models developed with 1999 data were improved with the addition of measurements of total residue, which is correlated to ionic concentrations and turbidity, providing a rough indication of instream light availability. However, validation of the models with an independent data set, collected in 2000, showed that the nutrient-only models were the most robust across data sets. We detected a significant lack of fit in all of the models developed, indicating the independent variables used were not best at explaining variability in macrophyte biomass. Although our study yielded only weak predictions of biomass in rivers, the robustness of the models based on nutrients among data sets suggests that nutrient-abatement programs, focussed primarily on N, may be successful in reducing nuisance macrophyte biomass.

The lake is usually dimictic butsome years stratification begins under the ice and the lake misses a re-oxgenating overturn. One-third of the annual heat budget of about 19,600 cal . cm(2) is taken up by melting the ice cover. The lake is the common calcium-bicarbonate type but is dilute due to its relatively small watershed and dominance of siliceous material in the local lithography. Based on Secchi transparency, plant nutrients and algal chlorophyll the lake is oligotrophic, with no evidence the lake has been enriched during the study period. Annual primary productivity was estimated at 48 C . m(2) (.) yr(-1) and exhibited a seasonal pulse that began in early May and reached peak values just before ice-off at the end of May. Two chironomid species were identified that were indicative of oligotrophic conditions in this Nearctic take. Data on vascular plant biomass and zooplankton are presented.

In this study we predict stream sensitivity to non-point source pollution based on the non-linear responses of hydrological regimes and associated loadings of non-point source pollutants to catchment properties. We assessed two hydrologically based thresholds of impairment, one for catchment storage (5-10%) and one for mature forest (<50% versus >60% of catchment in mature forest cover) across two different hydrogeomorphic regions within the Northern Lakes and Forest (NLF) ecoregion: the North Shore [predominantly within the North Shore Highlands Ecological Unit] and the South Shore (predominantly within the Lake Superior Clay Plain Ecological Unit). Water quality samples were collected and analysed during peak snowmelt and baseflow conditions from 24 second-order streams grouped as follows: three in each region x catchment storage x mature forest class. 2. Water quality was affected by a combination of regional influences, catchment storage and mature forest. Regional differences were significant for suspended solids, phosphorus, nitrogen: phosphorus ratios, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and alkalinity. Catchment storage was significantly correlated with dissolved silica during the early to mid-growing season, and with DOC, specific conductance and alkalinity during all seasons. Total nitrogen and dissolved nitrogen were consistently less in low mature forest than in high mature forest catchments. Catchment storage interacted with the influence of mature forest for only two metrics: colour and the soluble inorganic nitrogen : phosphorus ratio. 3. Significant interaction terms (region by mature forest or region by storage) suggest differences in regional sensitivity for conductance, alkalinity, total organic carbon, and colour, as well as possible shifts in thresholds of impact across region or mature forest class. 4. Use of the NLF Ecoregion alone as a basis for setting regional water quality criteria would lead to the misinterpretation of reference condition and assessment of condition. There were pronounced differences in background water quality between the North and South Shore streams, particularly for parameters related to differences in soil parent material and glacial history. A stratified random sampling design for baseflow and snowmelt stream water quality based on both hydrogeomorphic region and catchment attributes improves assessments of both reference condition and differences in regional sensitivity.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the quantity and biodegradability of soluble organic matter in soil under monoculture maize or maize - soybean rotation, and different amendments: manure, inorganic fertilizer, or no amendment. We characterized organic matter extracted in cold and hot (80 degreesC) water by using a bioassay involving incubation of the extracts (after inoculation with soil microflora) at 35 degreesC for 42 days. Soluble organic C and organic and mineral nitrogen (N) were monitored during the incubation. Extracts of whole soil (015 cm depth) and three water-stable aggregate size classes (>1000, 1000-250, and 250-50 mum) were subjected to the bioassay in order to evaluate the physical disposition and kinetics of soluble organic matter. Hot water-soluble C accounted for about 70% of the total (cold+hot) water-soluble organic matter. Organic N was the major form of N in the extracts; it comprised 61-83% of the total N extracted with cold water and 87-97% of the total N extracted with hot water. The quantity of soluble organic matter that was biodegradable was related to the extraction procedure and the management history of the soil. The proportion of soluble C and organic N that was biodegradable was greatest in hot water extracts and greater in manured than nonmanured soils. During the bioassay, proportionately greater amounts of organic N were metabolized relative to organic C, so that the C:N ratios of the extracts widened as the incubation progressed, indicating that the soluble organic matter was rich in labile organic N. The rate at which soluble organic matter decomposed (i.e., turnover) was not related to the type of input. Decomposition data fitted a double exponential decay model, suggesting that the soluble organic matter comprised two fractions: a rapidly decomposable fraction (containing 29-36% of the total soluble C) with a turnover time of < 1 day, and a slowly decomposable fraction with a turnover time of about 80 days. The concentration of soluble organic matter in soil aggregates was related to aggregate size; the concentration was greatest in the largest aggregates and it decreased with decreasing aggregate size. Soluble organic C extracted from aggregates also comprised two kinetically discrete pools. The turnover time (i.e., mean residence time) of each pool was not affected by amendment, crop rotation, or aggregate size. However, the slowly decomposable organic C pool was larger in microaggregates (<250 mum) than in macroaggregates, whereas the rapidly decomposable pool was larger in macroaggregates. We conclude that water-soluble organic matter in maize-cropped soils comprises two kinetically defined fractions and is readily decomposable due to its high content of hydrophilic, labile N-rich compounds.

J	Tabbara, H				Tabbara, H			Phosphorus loss to runoff water twenty-four hours after application of liquid swine manure or fertilizer	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							EXTRACTABLE SOIL-PHOSPHORUS; BEEF-CATTLE MANURE; POULTRY LITTER; NUTRIENT RUNOFF; QUALITY IMPACTS; NITROGEN; TILLAGE; MANAGEMENT; COMPOST; PASTURE	Phosphorus (P) added to soil from fertilizer or manure application could pose a threat to water quality due to its role in eutrophication of fresh water resources. Incorporating such amendments into the soil is an established best management practice (BMP) for reducing soluble P losses in runoff water, but could also lead to higher erosion. The objective of this study was to test whether incorporation of manure or fertilizer 24 h before an intense rain could also reduce sediment-bound and total phosphorus (TP) losses in runoff. A rainfall simulation study was conducted on field plots (sandy loam with 6-7% slope, little surface residue, recently cultivated) that received two application rates of liquid swine manure or liquid ammonium polyphosphate fertilizer, using either surface-broadcast or incorporated methods of application. Incorporation increased the total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations in runoff but mass losses were not affected. Incorporation also reduced flow-weighted concentrations and losses of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) and TP by as much as 30 to 60% depending on source (fertilizer vs. manure) and application rate. Phosphorus is moved below the mixing zone of interaction on incorporation, and thus the effect of the amount and availability of P in this zone is more important than cultivation on subsequent P losses in runoff. Incorporating manure or fertilizer in areas of intense erosive rain, recent extensive tillage, and with little or no surface residue is therefore a best management practice that should be adhered to in order to minimize contamination of surface water. Results also show comparatively lower P losses from manure than fertilizer.

J	Kleinman, PJA; Sharpley, AN				Kleinman, PJA; Sharpley, AN			Effect of broadcast manure on runoff phosphorus concentrations over successive rainfall events	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY			English	Article							RECEIVING SWINE MANURE; FESCUE PLOTS; POULTRY MANURE; WATER-QUALITY; SOIL; NITROGEN; TILLAGE; SURFACE; LOSSES; LITTER	Concern over eutrophication has directed attention to manure management effects on phosphorus (P) loss in runoff. This study evaluates the effects of manure application rate and type on runoff P concentrations from two, acidic agricultural soils over successive runoff events. Soils were packed into 100- x 20- x 5-cm runoff boxes and broadcast with three manures (dairy, Bos taurus; layer poultry, Gallus gallus; swine, Sus scrofa) at six rates, from 0 to 150 kg total phosphorus (TP) ha(-1). Simulated rainfall (70 mm h(-1)) was applied until 30 min of runoff was collected 3, 10, and 24 d after manure application. Application rate was related to runoff P (r(2) = 0.50-0.98), due to increased concentrations of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in runoff; as application rate increased, so did the contribution of DRP to runoff TP. Varied concentrations of water-extractable phosphorus (WEP) in manures (2-8 g WEP kg(-1)) resulted in significantly lower DRP concentrations in runoff from dairy manure treatments (0.4-2.2 mg DRP L-1) than from poultry (0.3-32.5 mg DRP L-1) and swine manure treatments (0.3-22.7 mg DRP L-1). Differences in runoff DRP concentrations related to manure type and application rate were diminished by repeated rainfall events, probably as a result of manure P translocation into the soil and removal of applied P by runoff. Differential erosion of broadcast manure caused significant differences in runoff TP concentrations between soils. Results highlight the important, but transient, role of soluble P in manure on runoff P, and point to the interactive effects of management and soils on runoff P losses.

Runoff P can be related to soil test P and P sorption saturation, but these approaches are restricted to a limited range of soil types or are difficult to determine on a routine basis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether easily measurable soil characteristics were related to the soil phosphorus requirements (P-req, the amount of P sorbed at a particular solution P level). The P-req was determined for 18 chemically diverse soils from sorption isotherm data (corrected for native sorbed P) and was found to be highly correlated to the sum of oxalate-extractable AI and Fe (R-2 > 0.90). Native sorbed P, also determined from oxalate extraction, was subtracted from the P-req to determine soil phosphorus limits (P-L, the amount of P that can be added to soil to reach P-req). Using this approach, the P-L to reach 0.2 mg P L-1 in solution ranged between -92 and 253 mg P kg(-1). Negative values identified soils with surplus P, while positive values showed soils with P deficiency. The results showed that P, AI, and Fe in oxalate extracts of soils held promise for determining PL to reach up to 10 mg P L-1 in solution (leading to potential runoff from many soils). The soil oxalate extraction test could be integrated into existing best management practices for improving soil fertility and protecting water quality.

Integrated economic-environmental model simulations performed for the Lake Fork Reservoir Watershed in northeast Texas indicate that appropriate pasture nutrient management including stocking density adjustments and more efficient commercial fertilizer use could lead to significant reductions in nutrient losses. Soluble and organic P losses were predicted to decline by 54 and 13% relative to baseline conditions when manure P was assumed totally plant available (Low P scenario). The soluble and organic P loss reductions declined to 33 and 7% when only inorganic P was assumed plant available (High P scenario). Simulation of an N-based manure management plan resulted in the smallest predicted soluble and organic P loss reductions of 18 and 3%. Nitrogen loss predictions ranged from a 7 % decline to a 1 % increase for the 3 scenarios as compared to the baseline. The High P and Low P scenarios resulted in estimated aggregate profit reductions of 6 and 18% relative to the baseline. These profit declines occurred because the dairies had to acquire additional pasture land to accommodate the expanded area required for the P-based scenarios. In contrast, the N-based stocking density and nutrient management scenario resulted in an aggregate profit increase of 3% across all dairies. Variations in economic impacts were also predicted across farm sizes.

J	Parnell, PE				Parnell, PE			The effects of sewage discharge on water quality and phytoplankton of Hawai'ian coastal waters	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						sewage; dilution; outfall; nutrients; nitrogen; bacteria; Chl alpha; phytoplankton; plume; Hawai'i	NITROGEN	The effects of sewage discharge on algal populations and the quality of Hawai'ian coastal waters were investigated. Two outfalls were studied. One discharges primary treated sewage and the other discharges secondary treated sewage but are otherwise similar. This enabled comparisons of the effects of these different levels of treatment on the water quality and algal productivity of receiving waters. Plumes were followed and repeatedly sampled in a time-series manner. Rhodamine dye was used as a conservative tracer to compare the dilution behavior of the plume constituents MRP, NO3 + NO2, NH4, Silicate, TDP, TDN, total bacteria, PC, and PN. Rates of initial dilution ranged from two to almost three orders of magnitude, and were in reasonable agreement with engineering model predictions. Dilution of plume constituents approximated that of Rhodamine until background concentrations were reached, typically within 10 min of discharge. Chl a concentrations did not increase through time in the primary sewage plume but did increase up to 30% in the secondary sewage plume. However, rates of far-field dilution were so rapid that the increase could not have been due to algal growth. The increase Was attributed to the plume mixing with a water mass whose relative chl a concentrations were greater. Rates of secondary dilution ranged from 2 to 3 orders of magnitude. resulting in total dilutions of 10(5)-10(6) within 3 h of discharge. These rates of secondary dilution were much greater than model predictions. From a nutrient standpoint, secondary treatment exhibited no advantages over primary treatment because dilutions were so rapid. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nationwide, millions of swine, poultry, and cattle are raised and fed in concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) owned by large, vertically integrated producer corporations. The amount of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) in animal manure produced by CAFOs is enormous. For example, on the North Carolina Coastal Plain alone an estimated 124,000 metric tons of nitrogen and 29,000 metric tons of phosphorus are generated annually by livestock. CAFO wastes are largely either spread on fields as dry litter or pumped into waste lagoons and sprayed as liquid onto fields. Large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus enter the environment through runoff, percolation into groundwater, and volatilization of ammonia. Many CAFOs are located in nutrient-sensitive watersheds where the wastes contribute to the eutrophication of streams, rivers, and estuaries.

J	Borah, DK; Bera, M; Shaw, S				Borah, DK; Bera, M; Shaw, S			Water, sediment, nutrient, and pesticide measurements in an agricultural watershed in Illinois during storm events	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASAE			English	Article						agrochemical; rainfall events; sampling methodologies; water quality; watershed monitoring	NITROGEN; NITRATE; QUALITY; EXPORT	Flow and concentrations of suspended sediment, nitrate-N, phosphate-P, atrazine, and metolachlor were monitored during the spring seasons of 1998 and 1999, primarily during storm events, at a tributary station (Big Ditch) and two main-stem stations (Fisher and Mahomet) of the Upper Sangamon River watershed in east central Illinois. These three stations respectively drain 98, 622, and 932 km(2) of mainly agricultural lands. Rainfall data were collected from six newly established raingage stations. The study provides a valuable database to understand some of the complex physical and chemical processes in an east central Illinois watershed and to calibrate, validate, and evaluate mathematical models. Analyses of the limited data from different sampling methods showed consistencies among the methods. The nitrate-N concentrations in Big Ditch during intense storms of 1998 showed inverse relationships with water discharge. Higher goodness-of-fit of the relationships was found within the data for individual months than for the combined set, showing dependence on varying climate, land cover, and management practices during the growing season. The nitrate-N concentrations at each of the three stations during less intense storms in 1999 showed weak positive relationships with water discharge. The total nitrate-N load in Big Ditch generated by the storms of March, May, and June of 1998 was similar to the average annual load, indicating the importance of single-event storms, and therefore their need for close attention. After the intense storm of April 1999, the less intense storms during May and June after long low-flow periods significantly raised the nitrate-N concentrations in all three stations. A similar pattern was noticed in the 1998 observations before each of the major peaks, when the smaller peaks elevated nitrate-N concentrations followed by dilution with the larger peaks. Results of this study show positive relationships between suspended sediment concentration and water discharge for the smaller watershed (Big Ditch); however, no relationships were found in the larger watersheds (Upper Sangamon River at Fisher and Mahomet). Observed data at each of the stations showed positive relationships of phosphate-P, atrazine, and metolachlor concentrations with water discharge.

J	Zimba, PV; Mischke, CC; Brashear, SS				Zimba, PV; Mischke, CC; Brashear, SS			Pond age-water column trophic relationships in channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus production ponds	AQUACULTURE			English	Article						algae; pond culture; channel catfish; water quality; multivariate statistics	LAKES; CYANOBACTERIA; CHLOROPHYLL; ZOOPLANKTON; 2-METHYLISOBORNEOL; CONFIRMATION; PREDICTION; PHOSPHORUS; LIMITATION; FILAMENTS	Long-term temporal succession changes in nutrients, phytoplankton and zooplankton have not been previously investigated in aquaculture ponds. This study analyzed relationships of pond age with nutrients, zooplankton and phytoplankton populations, and incidence of off-flavor occurrence. Nutrient levels (iron, silica, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen), phytoplankton community composition, off-flavor compounds, and zooplankton community composition were determined for 10-11 replicate commercial channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus production ponds of ages 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10 or 15 years postconstruction. Data were analyzed using canonical discriminant function analysis, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), and multiple regression approaches. Nutrients (N and P) accumulated in ponds during the first 3 years postconstruction; however, concentrations of these nutrients leveled off after this time. The continual addition of nutrients (as feed) makes standard chlorophyll-P relationships reported from natural lakes unable to account for variation in aquaculture data. Algal composition became dominated by filamentous cyanobacteria after year 4; zooplankton composition also was dominated by larger copepods and cladocerans in older ponds. Younger ponds had lower incidence and intensity of off-flavor relative to older pond water. If ponds are drained/reworked every 3-4 years, incidence of off-flavor should decline.

J	Larssen, T; Brereton, C; Gunn, JM				Larssen, T; Brereton, C; Gunn, JM			Dynamic modelling of recovery from acidification of lakes in Killarney Park, Ontario, Canada	AMBIO			English	Article							ACID DEPOSITION; TRENDS; RETENTION; NITROGEN; WATER	During much of the 1900s, the lakes in Killarney Provincial Park have been exposed to high levels of acid deposition due to sulfur emissions from the nearby metal smelters in Sudbury. The sulfur emissions from this large point source have decreased to about 10% of what they were in the 1960s. Lake water quality in Killarney Park has greatly changed in response to reduced emissions, with noticeable declines in sulfate, aluminum and calcium concentrations. Here we apply the dynamic acidification model MAGIC to 3 lakes in Killarney Park. The lakes, which have different buffering capacities and response times, were selected to represent fast, intermediate and slow recovery from acidification. The model was calibrated to match observed data for the lakes and 4 different forecast scenarios for future sulfur deposition reductions were applied. The results indicate that there is still a large potential for improvement in the water quality in Killarney. The recovery time for the different lakes varies greatly, For the lake having the slowest response time several decades are needed for the chemistry to stabilize after implementation of deposition reductions.

J	Romero, JR; Imberger, J				Romero, JR; Imberger, J			Effect of a flood underflow on reservoir water quality: Data and three-dimensional modeling	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE			English	Article						reservoirs; floods; underflow; numerical modeling; nutrients	SIMULATION; INFLOW	As in many of the world's reservoirs, floods provide most of the water to Lake Burragorang (Sydney, Australia). In this study a winter flood through this large (2 km(3)), long (ca. 50km) and narrow (ca. 0.5-2km) reservoir was monitored at multiple stations over several weeks. The nutrient-laden underflow took 7-8 days to travel from the river confluence to the dam and upwardly displaced the pre-flood anoxic hypolimnion. Particulate phosphorus and nitrogen, and turbidity settled at an exponential rate (0.34-0.42d(-1)) in the head of the underflow. Application of a three-dimensional model (ELCOM) with large grid sizes (200x200x1m) for reasonable run times (ca. I day) did not resolve the underflow hydrodynamics in this large, narrow and complex geometry. A technique for 'straightening' morphologies that are narrow and curvy was applied to the Lake Burragorang bathymetry to allow large model grid sizes. Simulations with the 'straightened' bathymetry had low run times and compared well with field data. Then, an aquatic ecological model (CAEDYM) was coupled to ELCOM to simulate the biogeochemical fate of the floodwaters. Simulated spatial patterns of dissolved oxygen, and filterable and particulate nutrients compared well with field data. Further, the ELCOM-CAEDYM simulation demonstrated that the dynamic spatial variations in water quality from a Eularian perspective during such flood events are dominated by transport. Settling is the dominant process in the head of the underflow from a Lagrangian frame of reference. To simulate spatial variations during a flood it is adequate to couple an accurate hydrodynamic driver to a simply configured biogeochemical model.

This paper presents the landscape-scale results from these monitoring programs and outlines a method for exploring the relationships between two such data sets. Seagrass species occurrence and abundance data were used to define eight benthic habitat classes from 677 sampling locations in Florida Bay. Water quality data from 28 monitoring stations spread across the Bay were used to construct a discriminant function model that assigned a probability of a given benthic habitat class occurring for a given combination of water quality variables. Mean salinity, salinity variability, the amount of light reaching the benthos, sediment depth, and mean nutrient concentrations were important predictor variables in the discriminant function model. Using a cross-validated classification scheme, this discriminant function identified the most likely benthic habitat type as the actual habitat type in most cases. The model predicted that the distribution of benthic habitat types in Florida Bay would likely change if water quality and water delivery were changed by human engineering of freshwater discharge from the Everglades. Specifically, an increase in the seasonal delivery of freshwater to Florida Bay should cause an expansion of seagrass beds dominated by Ruppia maritima and Halodule wrightii at the expense of the Thalassia testudinum-dominated community that now occurs in northeast Florida Bay. These statistical techniques should prove useful for predicting landscape-scale changes in community composition in diverse systems where communities are in quasi-equilibrium with environmental drivers.
