Optimisation of motorway operations via ramp metering and variable speed limits	TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	46th Annual Conference of the Universities-Transport-Studies-Group (UTSG)	JAN, 2014	Newcastle Univ, Newcastle upon Tyne, ENGLAND	Univ Transport Studies Grp	Newcastle Univ	variable speed limits; ramp metering; cell transmission model; mixed integer linear programming	TRAFFIC FLOW; WAVES; MODEL	This paper presents a modelling and optimisation framework for deriving ramp metering and variable speed control strategies. We formulate the optimal control problems aiming to minimise the travel delay on motorways based upon a macroscopic cell transmission model of traffic. The optimal ramp metering optimisation is formulated as a linear programming (LP) while the variable speed control problem is formulated as a mixed integer LP. The optimisation models are applied to a real scenario over a section of M25 motorway in the UK. This paper also includes various analyses on the sensitivity of the optimal control solutions with respect to different network configurations and model assumptions.	[Li, Ying; Chow, Andy H.

Only depending on the traffic flow rate as input data and the density of freeway and intersections of auxiliary road as output data, the proposed control scheme guarantees density balance between freeway and auxiliary road.

This algorithm can be responsive to different traffic flows by tuning control parameters over both time and location, and it tends to minimize delay at low traffic flows by using a set of so-called stage weights. We show that under mild conditions, the EBP algorithm with time-varying control parameters can achieve maximum throughput, i.e., when the EBP algorithm is adopted, the expected long-term average of total queues is bounded from above for largest possible set of arrival vectors. A simulation based on real traffic data of Singapore demonstrates the validity of the proposed EBP algorithm.

In this paper, we consider privacy in the routing game, where the origins and destinations of drivers are considered private. This is motivated by the fact that this spatiotemporal information can easily be used as the basis for inferences for a person's activities. More specifically, we consider the differential privacy of the mapping from the amount of flow for each origin-destination pair to the traffic flow measurements on each link of a traffic network. We use a stochastic online learning framework for the population dynamics, which is known to converge to the Nash equilibrium of the routing game. We analyze the sensitivity of this process and provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence rates as well as differential privacy values for these models. We confirm these with simulations on a small example.	[Dong, Roy; Krichene, Walid; Bayen, Alexandre M.; Sastry, S.

With a control goal of minimizing the total network-wise delay time, we translate the traffic signal control problem into a centralized mixed integer linear programming problem solvable by several existing tools, e.g., CPLEX. To overcome the potentially high complexity involved in the centralized approach, we propose a distributed scheduling strategy based on Lagrangian relaxation and subgradient method. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed traffic light scheduling approach.

Sudden and large disturbances in a transportation network can lead to the creation and propagation of shock waves which spread throughout the system causing jams and decreasing system throughput. By considering the Cell Transmission Model of traffic flow, we design a minimum-energy controller that exploits inter-vehicle communication to localize shock waves to small sections of the highway and attenuate them within a specified period of time. The control design is illustrated through simulations on realistic data from the I-210 highway in California.

Moving Horizon Fault-Tolerant Traffic State Estimation for the Cell Transmission Model	2015 54TH IEEE CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL (CDC)	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control		English	Proceedings Paper	54th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	DEC 15-18, 2015	Osaka, JAPAN	Kozo Keikaku Engn, MathWorks, Springer, CYBERNET Syst, Mitsubishi Elect, Soc Ind & Appl Math, Altair, Int Journal Automat & Comp, IEEE CAA Journal Automatica Sinica, Cogent Engn, Now, IHI, IEEE				Traffic state estimation is an important problem with significant applications in advanced traveler information systems, transportation management and traffic control. Nonetheless, the often faulty nature of measurement sensors, especially inductive loop detectors, hinders reliable state estimation. This work proposes a systematic, model-based, network-wide, moving-horizon approach for fault-tolerant traffic state estimation. By exploiting information redundancy and fault sparsity, it achieves reliable estimation and simultaneously detects, isolates and corrects measurements from periods of faulty sensor behavior. The approach is examined in relation to the Asymmetric Cell Transmission Model, a popular and powerful macroscopic first-order traffic flow model. In the absence of any faults, the proposed approach achieves similar results with other state-of-the-art estimation approaches while it can achieve better estimation performance when some sensors are faulty. It is further demonstrated that the developed approach can successfully handle multiple faults of different types.

However, identifying key intersections that will soon become congested is a difficult task, performed by tedious, thorough simulations; even more difficult is to adapt the road network so as to increase its efficiency and avoid congestion. We argue upon the social component of road traffic and propose an alternative way to detect hotspots leading to congestion by using techniques borrowed from complex network analysis. We will use the betweenness centrality and argue upon its power-law distribution, which we set out to redistribute and equalize. The paper introduces a genetic algorithm that redistributes the betweenness values at a community level in a city by changing street directions and number of available lanes in order to reduce (and possibly even eliminate) congestion hotspots. Experimental results in terms of reducing traffic loads from hotspots and transferring to neighboring streets yield an improvement with a factor of up to 90% times without adding significant costs or modifying the existing infrastructure.

If tracking algorithms could work properly, performing tracking should be preferred in intelligent surveillance systems. However, it is unrealistic to segment and track each individual vehicle under all circumstances. Under congestion conditions, we propose a mechanism to estimate the traffic flow parameter via regression analysis. The experimental results have shown that the self-diagnosis ability and the modules designed for the system make the proposed system robust and reliable.

Satellite navigation technology is increasingly used almost in all sectors and activities; it has become an essential tool for every demanding professional, commercial and scientific application. The use of GNSS system has been widely used in many industries; maritime, communication, agriculture and banking. Due to the increase of the number of GNSS users in different industries there was a production of low-cost GNSS receivers, these receivers are of different types and models, some models work with the GPS system, others work with the GLONASS system. In the last few years there was a trend of producing a new type of receivers that receive both GLONASS and GPS signals at the same time, so as to calculate the position and time with better accuracy. The Egyptian government intended lately to develop and modernize many services especially; the transportation sector which includes many fields that need to be supported by GNSS such as railways for trains' monitoring specially with the increase of the speeds of trains lately, navigation in the Nile River, transportation by trucks which need monitoring on high ways to control the traffic flow and finally the mega project of Suez canal. The enormous need of GNSS system in Egypt is still booming day after day, for that there is a need to measure the accuracy, repeatability, reliability and accessibility of the low-cost receivers. This paper provides analysis of a static test to measure the difference between low-coast standalone GPS receiver and the integrated GLONASS/GPS receiver in terms of accuracy, repeatability, reliability and accessibility. To accomplish this target a low-cost receivers will be used for data collection during 24 hours.

Nonetheless people supported this rule while fail to be aware that it may not have perfect performance in certain aspects. This paper modeled driving rules and discussed performances. We construct an overtaking model and a non-changing lane driving model to illustrate the right-lane driving rule. Computer simulations are employed respectively in light and heavy traffic to show the traffic procedure under these rules. An evaluation model is constructed to measure the traffic flow and safety based on the vehicle number, time of brakes, overtaking and car accident from the simulation data. The evaluation results demonstrated that traffic flow and safety are existence of contradictions. High traffic flow inevitably leads to low safety and vice versa. In order to address the problem, an alternative called free-lane driving rule in intelligence system is built. Under the intelligent system, all the distance and speed are automatic control. Additionally we set up fast traffic lane and slow traffic lane. Computer simulation indicates that performance under intelligence system has a significant progress.

Firstly, a CTM is built, which can accurately describe the actual status of freeway traffic flow. Secondly, the principle and algorithm of an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) are formulated with details. Thirdly, freeway density controllers based on the improved PSO algorithm and the nonlinear process control technique are designed. This improved PSO algorithm is applied to optimize the proportional and integral (PI) parameters. The searching ability for finding the optimal PI parameters is enhanced by means of varying the inertia weight value and using simulated annealing algorithm at the same time. Finally, two simulation experiments are carried out to show the superiority of this approach. Compared to the genetic algorithm or the standard PSO algorithm, the improved PSO algorithm has smaller density errors. The optimization algorithm, as well as the nonlinear process control technique, provides a new way for freeway density control.

For a kind of microscopic traffic flow model (Transportation analysis and simulation system model, TRANSIMS), a new optimal objective function is adopted which is based on the mean and standard deviation of the traffic fundamental graphic data. According to this objective function, a method of successive weighted average algorithm is used to search the optimal parameter. After these process, the model is calibrated. The studies show that the optimal parameter can always be found, and the relative error between the best parameter and real parameter is less than 10%.

For the model simulation we propose adapted algorithm. We compare our adaptive system results to others given by urban traffic systems based on fixed pattern lights. The system is designed to make equilibrium between the length queue and the states of lights to search optimal strategy guarantying the fluidity of traffic and minimizing the total delay. The proposed real-time urban traffic control model was implemented on a simple intersection presenting two roads. We have chosen a simple intersection to validate our method which will be applied afterwards on a complicated intersection. We have used traffic evaluation criteria to test the accuracy of the model. The results show benefits of the suggested model on the total delay compared to that of the fixed pattern lights system. All traffic situations, whether they are peak or low are concerned by these results.

Generally, more active vehicles can enhance the connectivity performance. Nevertheless, an increasing number of active vehicles may bring about significant interference and thus negatively affect the connectivity. In this paper, a highway model is presented to study the effects of active vehicle ratio on connectivity performance in the presence of co-channel interference. A closed form expression of the inter-vehicle connectivity probability is also derived to evaluate the impacts of active ratio, traffic flow, and fading factors under Nakagami fading channel. Analytical results of inter-vehicle connectivity probability are shown to be consistent with the simulation results, and can be applied to estimate connectivity performance with interference in the network design for highway vehicular scenarios.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of delayed feedback on the dynamics of two widely-studied car-following models; namely, the classical car-following model and the optimal velocity model. We first conduct a control-theoretic analysis for both models and derive conditions that ensure local stability. We then demonstrate that the transition of traffic flow from the locally stable to the unstable regime occurs via a Hopf bifurcation. Qualitatively, this results in the emergence of limit cycles, which manifest as a back-propagating congestion wave. The analysis is complemented with stability charts and bifurcation diagrams.

The paper takes the minimum mean square prediction error as the objective function, selects suitable detectors with PSO algorithm, and predicts the short term traffic flow with wavelet neural network. The test results with America 1-84 highway measured data show that the proposed algorithm can ensure the accuracy of short-term traffic flow prediction, the investment costs can be reduced effectively, and can provide the certain theory instruction for the optimal layout of traffic detector in highway engineering.

A particle updates its velocity and position not only by individual and global optima, but also by individual optima of a specific particle chosen by roulette method according to certain probability, to maintain population diversity and prevent precocity and stagnation. This method is used to solve the maximum entropy model, estimating OD matrix from traffic flows. By an experiment on a junction in Chongqing City, the results demonstrate that the particle swarm algorithm overcomes the defect of Newton method that strictly relies on initial values, and the improved particle swarm algorithm has much higher optimization capability than the basic particle swarm algorithm and the basic genetic algorithm.

City traffic state can vary temporally and spatially between road links, depending on crossroads and lanes. In addition, congestion estimation requires some sort of tuning to "what is around" to trigger appropriate reactions. An adaptive aggregation mechanism of position data is therefore crucial for traffic control. We present a biologically-inspired technique to aggregate position samples coming from on-vehicle devices. In essence, each vehicle position sample is spatially and temporally augmented with digital mark, locally deposited and evaporated. As a consequence, a marks concentration appears and stays spontaneously while many stationary vehicles and high density roads occur. Marks concentration is then sharpened to achieve a better distinction of critical phenomena to be triggered as detected traffic events. The overall mechanism can be actually enabled if structural parameters are correctly tuned for the given application context. Determining such correct parameters is not a simple task since different urban areas have different traffic flux and density. Thus, an appropriate tuning to adapt parameters to the specific urban area is desirable to make the estimation effective. In this paper, we show how this objective can be achieved by using differential evolution.	[Cimino, Mario G. C.

Their research and development has sometimes relied on the use of standard driving cycles. However, these cycles cannot reproduce the variations of traffic flow in real world. That is why in this paper we develop a software tool able to analyze real-life driving cycles for electric vehicles. To do so, a driving trajectory process tool is used to obtain large data for vehicles driving in the same stretch of highway. To show the performanc of the developed tool, sample cycles are analyzed and simulated for electric vehicles automatically in the REV-Cycle (Real Electric Vehicle Cycle analyzer) software presented.

Motivated by this problem, the paper proposes a real-time signal control strategy, called the UTBC (Urban Traffic Balance Control, for short) strategy, under which traffic states within links can reach consensus, i.e., the network can realize the balanced distribution of traffic flows. First, a signal control model of URTNs based on basic conservation principle of vehicle flows is proposed, which is a discrete-time linear time-invariant control system, with control input being phase green-time durations. Furthermore, the state-feedback signal control law (i.e., the UTBC strategy), is proposed, such that the closed-loop signal control system can realize consensus. Moreover, ALINEA ramp metering algorithm is considered. At last, we illustrate joint applications of the UTBC and ALINEA strategies by conducting simulation tests for a real-world network in Wangjing District in Beijing.

To discuss the performance of traffic rules, in this paper, two Cellular Automaton Models which simulate the features of traffic flow of two traffic rules are established. After the preliminary analysis of the simulation results, Multi-level fuzzy analysis method is developed to evaluate the Safety Level and the Service Level of two rules. The final evaluations for two rules are calculated further in the light traffic and heavy traffic. The simulating results show that the keep-right-except-to-pass rule and the rule of choosing appropriate lane of limiting speed are similar for the evaluation of traffic conditions in light traffic. However, the latter is better than the former in heavy traffic. Finally, Multi-level fuzzy analysis is utilized to assess two traffic rules	[Han, Bo] North China Elect Power Univ Baoding, Baoding, Hebei, Peoples R China	Han, B (corresponding author), North China Elect Power Univ Baoding, Baoding, Hebei, Peoples R China.	ncepuhb@163.com					Daganzo CF, 2007, TRANSPORT RES B-METH, V41, P49, DOI 10.1016/j.trb.2006.03.001; Fukui M, 1996, J PHYS SOC JPN, V65, P1868, DOI 10.1143/JPSJ.65.1868; Gao Ziyou, 2005, ALLOCATION MODEL ALG; Hanaura H, 2007, PHYSICA A, V374, P419, DOI 10.1016/j.physa.2006.07.032; Jiang R, 2002, PHYS REV E, V66, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevE.66.036104; Kemer B S, 2002, J PHYS A, V35, P9971; Kong Xianjuan, 2007, RES MODELLING CHARAC; Nagatani T, 2002, REP PROG PHYS, V65, P1331, DOI 10.1088/0034-4885/65/9/203; Nagatani T, 2006, PHYSICA A, V368, P560, DOI 10.1016/j.physa.2005.12.031	9	0	0	0	0	SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT & SPORTS SCIENCE INST PTE LTD	SINGAPORE	8 TEMASEK BOULEVARD # 34-03 SUNTEC TOWER THREE, SINGAPORE, 038988, SINGAPORE	2339-5133		978-981-09-5076-7	ADV SOC BEHAV SCI			2015	8						480	487					8	Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary	Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics	BF3CO	WOS:000380527100089					2021-01-11

In general, transportation network design problem (TNDP) concerns optimal selection of several projects from various alternative proposed projects (with estimated costs) maintaining associated constraints to ensure benefit versus cost. Various approaches have been investigated to solve TNDP in last several decades. Recently, particle swarm optimization (PSO) based method is shown to outperform other methods. However, the most of the existing methods, including PSO, tested on the small scale TNDP. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify the effectiveness of the PSO based method for a mega city heaving large number nodes and arcs. The mega city considered in this study is Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. The experiment has been conducted on the roughly estimated data for exiting network as well as proposed projects. Experimental results for revealed that the method able to select projects for optimal (or near optimal) utilization of a given budget amount. The selected projects are seem to be effective to increase traffic flow while observe on the schematic diagram of the road network.	[Akhand, M. A. H.; Shill, P. C.; Sabuj, M.

The main aim here is to ensure quicker travel time by selecting one of the possible routes between a pair of source and destination. The proposed system intakes traffic information, such as volume to capacity ratio, traffic flow, vehicle queue length and green cycle length etc by the use wireless sensor nodes and CCTVs located at different cross sections. The road information between source and destination pair are collected from a cloud based map application, such as Google Map. Such a map may suggest the shortest distance path that exists between source and destination as static information but this may not be traveled in the shortest time if varying traffic flow exists. Our proposed model can take such dynamic information and can deliver twofold outcome-adjust the green cycle length of each lane based on the volume to capacity ratio, traffic flow and vehicle queue length of all the lanes, and assist a driver to select shortest time path. We also show that the proposed adaptive approach can deliver superior results based on dynamic information to static information based route selection.

Resilience as an Objective in the Optimal Reconstruction Sequence for Transportation Networks	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION SAFETY & SECURITY			English	Article						resilience; transportation networks; reconstruction sequence; multi-stage network design; day-to-day traffic assignment	STOCHASTIC EQUILIBRIUM; ROUTE CHOICE; DESIGN; STABILITY; FRAMEWORK; ALGORITHM; PARADOX; MODELS; LINKS	Disasters have substantial negative impacts on the transportation system performance. To be resilient, transportation systems should recover quickly and function effectively after disasters. However, reconstruction of road links has to be implemented as a multi-stage procedure due to limited budget. Hence, guidance needs to be provided on when and where to reconstruct to maintain high system performance during the recovery period. This article proposes a novel multi-stage network design model for identifying the optimal reconstruction sequence that maximizes the resilience of transportation networks with budget constraints. To achieve this, resilience is quantified as the sum of the recovery ratios of system performance during reconstruction. A day-to-day traffic assignment model and a logit-based loading model are integrated to describe the traffic flow evolution during reconstruction. The model is implemented on two test transportation networks. The results show that the optimal reconstruction sequence leads to the most significant improvement in postdisaster performance. Stability analysis indicates that effective traffic control strategies are necessary to ensure the flow stability during reconstruction.

To satisfy the demand of traffic flow estimation, this paper studies the method of real-time traffic flow prediction based on Bayesian classifier and support vector regression (SVR). We first model the traffic flow and its relations on the roads using 3D Markov random field in spatiotemporal domain. Based on their relations, we define cliques as combination of current cone-zone and its neighbors. The dependencies on the defined cliques are estimated by using multiple linear regression and SVR. Finally, the traffic flow at next time stamp is predicted by finding the speed level with decreasing the energy function. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, it was tested on traffic data obtained from Gyeongbu expressway. The experimental results showed that the approach using SVR-based estimation showed superior accuracy than linear-based regression.

Thus, it is an important and extensive method in many countries to use the intelligent transportation systems (ITS) to control traffic and to induce vehicle flows so that road congestion may be mitigated and the traffic may be more efficient. As an important part of intelligent transportation, an intelligent route guidance system (IRGS) not only regulates traffic flow of every crossroads intersections to make full use of insufficient road infrastructure, but also reduces running distance and average waiting time for every driver to reach region traffic balance. This paper explores a design of IRGS and proposes a way to address the task decomposition of traffic guidance and path selection issues. Results from the simulation experiments suggest that IRGS with shortest path algorithm can achieve better network performance and increased traffic control system efficiency.

Many imputation based algorithms have been proposed to handle with incomplete data, where these algorithms use statistics of the historical information to remedy the missing parts. However, these methods merely use the structural information existed in the data, which are very helpful for sharing between the complete entries and the missing ones. For example, in traffic system, some group information and temporal smoothness exist in the data structure. In this paper, we propose to incorporate these structural information and develop a Structural Feature Leaning method for learning with InComplete data (SFLIC). The SFLIC model adopts a fused Lasso based regularizer and a group Lasso style regularizer to enlarge the data sharing along both the temporal smoothness level and the feature group level to fill the gap where the data entries are missing. The proposed SFLIC model is non-smooth function according to the model parameters, and we adopt the smoothing proximal gradient (SPG) method to seek for an efficient solution. We evaluate our model on both synthetic and real-world highway traffic datasets. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

Feature space construction and distance metric selection are two important parts in nonparametric regression. Few of previous works have taken both these two aspects into account together. In addition, how to use information of related stations in network scale is a key to improve the performance of ITS. In this paper, we propose a novel three-stage framework based on KNN to handle the issues above for short-term traffic flow forecasting. In the first stage, the related origin stations and destination stations of target task are discovered from the whole traffic network. Then for each target task, a particular distance metric is learned in the second stage. Finally, an extended multi-metric k-nearest neighbor regression model is built in the third stage. Experimental results on real-world traffic dataset show that our multi-metric KNN model with Lasso outperforms the traditional KNN model and the feature construction method is effective.

This paper presents a novel approach to estimate visibility conditions using an onboard camera and a digital map. Based on a traffic sign detector's characteristics in the fog, and registering detection by vision and information encoded in the map, we are able to accurately determine the current visual range in hazy conditions. Quantitative results are provided on a large experimental data set of driving environment with various level of fogginess.

In large IB fabrics, isolation of nodes is provided through partitioning. The routing algorithm, however, is unaware of these partitions in the network; Traffic flows belonging to different partitions might share links inside the network fabric. This sharing of intermediate links creates interference, which is particularly critical to avoid in multi-tenant environments like a cloud. In such systems, each tenant should experience predictable network performance, unaffected by the workload of other tenants. In addition, using current routing schemes, routes crossing partition boundaries are considered when distributing routes onto links in the network, despite the fact that these routes will never be used. The result is degraded load-balancing. In this paper, we present a novel partition-aware fat-tree routing algorithm, pFTree. The pFTree algorithm utilizes several mechanisms to provide network-wide isolation of partitions belonging to different tenant groups. Given the available network resources, pFTree starts by isolating partitions at the physical link level, and then moves on to utilize virtual lanes, if needed. Our experiments and simulations show that pFTree is able to significantly reduce the affect of inter-partition interference without any additional functional overhead. Furthermore, pFTree also provides improved load-balancing over the de facto standard IB fat-tree routing algorithm.

Moreover, their performance further degrades in the case of disruptions like accident or vehicle breakdown, increasing the rate of fuel consumption and air pollution. In this paper, we propose an traffic light system which itself adjusts traffic lights' signal timing at a single junction. We have employed a network of sixty infrared (IR) sensors, where each of the four directions have fifteen sensors embedded on the road. The first layer of sensors is placed at the stop line for indicating any violators, and all the layers of sensors (including the first layer of sensors) are placed at a distance of 4 metres from each other. All the sensors calculate the time taken by a vehicle to pass over them, which varies with velocity of the vehicles, and accordingly timings of the traffic lights' are rectified. The timings of all the four traffic lights at a junction is constantly updated for smoother flow of traffic and effective congestion control. Along with congestion control and violations indicator, the traffic light system also indicates any accident or vehicle breakdowns because of which the respective authorities can be alerted without any delay, hence, resulting in a shorter disruption of the traffic flow. The traffic light system was implemented on Virtex-7, and was able to work at the maximum frequency of 567.54 MHz with a power of consumption of 0.476 Watt.

As the development of sensor and information technology, we can recognise timely how crowded a street is. Route planning considering traffic congestion can further improve people's travel and effectively reduce the time-cost. In this paper, we use the traffic flow of a road to describe how crowded this road is, and construct a weighted network model based on a traffic-flow data of the main roads in the center of Beijing. By designing the network's weights, route planning considering traffic flows is transformed into searching for the shortest paths in the network. This route planning has been realized based on the real data in this paper. The results have shown that the routes recommended by the strategy considering traffic congestion save more time for travellers than the strategy not considering the traffic congestion.

Towards that end, a variety of applications and driver advisory tools have been developed. To work efficiently, many require knowledge of not only street maps but also elements affecting traffic flow. The most obvious elements are traffic lights and stop signs, which we shall henceforth call traffic regulators. Unfortunately, information on traffic regulators is not widely available in public databases such as OpenStreetMap (OSM). Prior work described crowd-sourcing solutions to predict regulator type and locations. In this paper, we improve the prediction by offering a combination of map-based modeling and crowd-sensing solutions. The modeling component reverse engineers rules for placement of traffic regulators, allowing it to predict their locations and type based on map information. Where available, crowd-sourced vehicular GPS traces are incorporated into the prediction function to improve the results. The approach is evaluated across multiple cities and is shown to outperform both crowd-sourcing alone and map-based modeling alone. It achieves a prediction accuracy level above 97% in detecting the existence and determining the type of traffic regulators in the cities considered.

The main objective is to maximize the throughput of the network by guiding traffic flow towards insufficiently utilized infrastructures. Due to the linear property of the LQMPC, it is fast enough for real-time online traffic control with a short control step (30 second for example). Simulation results from a case study demonstrate that the proposed traffic control approach has great potential to solve congestion when disturbances occur on freeways.

Performances of those models depend heavily on the similarity or distance metric used to search nearest neighborhood. Metric learning algorithms have been developed to learn the distance metrics from data in recent years. In real-world transportation application, multiple forecasting tasks are set since there are lots of road sections and detector points in the traffic network. Previous works tend to learn only one global metric to be used for all the tasks or learn multiple local metrics for each task which may lead to under-fitting or over-fitting problem. To balance these two kinds of methods and improve the generalization of learned metrics, we propose a common metric learning algorithm under the intuition that homogenous tasks tend to have similar local metrics. Then the learned common metrics are used in common metric KNN (CM-KNN) for traffic flow prediction. Experimental results show that our algorithm to learn common metrics are reasonable and CM-KNN method for traffic flow prediction outperforms other competing methods.

This paper presents such a vehicle driving system in a model predictive control (MPC) framework to efficiently drive a vehicle on multi-lane roads. Anticipation enhances the driving intelligence and strengthens the vehicle's ability in taking advance action, e.g., lane change, speed adjustment, in a dynamically varying traffic environment. More elaborately, presuming a connected vehicle environment, the system receives the information form the surrounding vehicles and infrastructure instantly through V2X communication systems and, using dynamical models, predicts the future road-traffic states. Considering relevant constraints and a performance index, the system generates the optimal acceleration and executes lane change maneuver optimally if long term advantages are anticipated. Numerical simulation in realistic traffic flow conditions reveals that the vehicles with the proposed driving system improve their travel efficiency significantly.	[Kamal, M. A.

Traffic Density Estimation using Dimensional Analysis	2015 IEEE INTELLIGENT VEHICLES SYMPOSIUM (IV)	IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium	JUN 28-JUL 01, 2015	Seoul, SOUTH KOREA					Traffic density, defined as the number of vehicles per unit length, is the primary measure used for quantifying road congestion. However, the direct measurement of this variable is difficult due to its spatial nature and the only method to directly measure it from field is aerial photography. Hence, it is usually estimated from other easily measurable variables such as speed or flow. Some of the reported approaches to obtain density include the input output analysis, fundamental traffic flow relation, and occupancy-based measurements in addition to those based on statistics, machine learning or model-based approaches. However, for better performance, all these methods require the careful selection of the relevant input variables/parameters and their relationships. One way of obtaining these relationships is to perform a dimensional analysis of the variables/parameters involved, identifying the non-dimensional variables/parameters and then obtaining a relationship between them using experimental data. This approach has been attempted for estimating road traffic density in this paper. The appropriate non-dimensional variables/parameters that characterize road traffic flow were first determined and the relation between them was then found out using simulated data. This relationship was subsequently used to estimate density for other datasets and the results were found to be promising.

Then, the traffic situation will be complicated. In order to alleviate the traffic pressure and decrease the traffic congestion, the study of vehicle detection becomes very important and very necessary. The traditional vehicle detection method, which is named inductive loop method, costs a lot and has a high impact on traffic flow. Therefore, this paper studies the vehicle detection by using the wireless sensor network. The vehicle is sensed by magnetic sensors, and the signal is transmitted by wireless communication way. Due to the deployment of magnetic sensors on the side of roads, it is very difficult to sense and receive very accurate magnetic signal. After receiving the magnetic signal, the wavelets methods are used to filter the noise and improve the accuracy of magnetic signal. In addition, two kinds of algorithms are designed to determine the traffic flow based on the magnetic signal. According to the experimental results, the accuracy of each algorithm is 90.9 % and 84.1%, respectively.

This kind of traffic video processing has become an important means for intelligent traffic management and control. The estimation and analysis of road traffic motion is an involved task in computer vision and video processing. In our work, morphological operations and region growing method are used to perform salient motion detection of objects. In classical background extraction method, the background has to be learnt from large numbers of frames. In our method, no a prior knowledge about shape and size of object is acquired. Instead, sum of square difference is estimated via online learning for the calculation of the centroid distance. The test results indicate that the road vehicles and their statistics are determined through our algorithm with complete fidelity.

By rerouting we mean changing the currently chosen path in road network after either receiving some information or observing consequences of an unexpected traffic event. Recently we have proposed Information Comply Model (ICM) to address the rerouting phenomena in Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) [1]. In this paper we focus on estimation framework for the model and verify the assumptions on the rerouting behavior. The paper identifies two datasets where rerouting can be observed: (1) direct - path trajectories; (2) indirect - traffic flows over the cut-set of the network. Proposed method of formal analysis derives from the data the input to estimate the rerouting behavior, namely how: information spreads (speed and range), drivers observe (how an atypical delay leads to rerouting), drivers decide (utility of rerouting used in discrete-choice model). Indirect estimation method from traffic flows is illustrated with a field-data from Warsaw bridges observed over several consecutive days including day of the event. Central findings are: a) about 20% of the affected traffic flow reroutes, b) rerouting flows are increasing in time, c) drivers show strategic capabilities, d) and maximize their utility while rerouting. Which were assumed while conceiving the ICM model.

Gasoline from transportation systems is the main source of GHGs. Frequent acceleration processes in vehicles cause unnecessary fuel consumption. If unnecessary acceleration is prevented, emission of GHGs will be reduced. In this research, unnecessary acceleration is decreased by changing line speed limit with an intelligent method at the highway. We propose an intelligent speed change (ISC) algorithm, which estimates the number of vehicles waiting in the traffic and calculates a speed limit to decrease unnecessary accelerations. A case study is done to reduce the gas emission at Istanbul E-80 highway with Istanbul Technical University City Transportation Simulation (ITUCiTSim) program. Test section is selected as ekerp nar-Selimpa a at one direction. An Intelligent Highway is constructed by placing sensors at access road connections. Traffic on the road is modelled by using the main principles of queueing theory. Information that is acquired by sensors is used in determining new speed limit in an intelligent way. It is demonstrated by simulations that the proposed method leads to a decrease in unnecessary accelerations, which results in a subsequent decrease in emitted GHGs.

Maneuver of shared taxi through lanes in order to pick-up and drop-off passengers and asking their destinations may lead to disorder in traffic flow. In order to investigate the effect of these maneuvers (or sudden lane changing) on traffic flow, it is essential to simulate these maneuvers on the existing roads in intelligent traffic simulator software. In this research Aimsun software was selected as a traffic modelling software. The selected path was simulated twice. First it has been simulated with all geometrical characteristics of path and all passing vehicles, without maneuvers of shared taxis. Travel time parameter of vehicles was selected to evaluate the validity of this simulation. After observing errors between simulation and real time measurement, maneuver of shared taxis around stop areas was added to the previous simulation. It was observed that simulating the maneuvers of shared taxi decreased the error significantly. By comparing these two travel time the considerable effect of these maneuvers was recognized around 16.95% on travel time of passing traffic flow in this path.

Simultaneous assessments of innovative traffic data collection technologies for travel times calculation on the East ring road of Lyon	4TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM OF TRANSPORT SIMULATION (ISTS'14) SELECTED PROCEEDINGS	Transportation Research Procedia		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Symposium of Transport Simulation (ISTS)	JUN 01-04, 2014	Ajaccio, FRANCE	Transport Traff Engn Lab, ENTPE & IFSTTAR		travel time; traffic management; assessment		In recent years, many innovative technologies for the travel times calculation evolved, but have never been evaluated and compared to each other at the same time. These technologies depend on the kind of implemented sensor for the traffic data collection. The purpose of this paper is to introduce an original experimentation, which will compare several recent technologies of data collection allowing travel times calculation from Bluetooth sensors, magnetometers, Floating Car Data from GPS embedded devices and even inductive loops stations for speeds interpolation. For this assessment, number plate readers (ANPR) were chosen to provide the reference travel times according to their high traffic's identification rate (near to 90%), which is much greater than the whole of assessed systems, and also allows to reach an optimal representativeness of the traffic flow. This trial takes place in a 12 kilometres long segment of the Lyon East ring road, which DIR-CE is the road operator. The daily traffic flow is about 90,000 vehicles with around 10% of trucks. The East ring road of Lyon usually presents any kind of traffic density : free-flow, heavy traffic, regular 1 to 2 kilometres long end of day congestion. So, it will be interesting to test the swiftness of each of these new technologies for all of the various traffic conditions, especially during the fast transition phases of the traffic flow or even while the traffic is jammed and therefore when the travel times are high. There are five measurements test points along this itinerary and so four elementary segments. The installation of all the field sensors ended at the beginning of March and when all the systems will be in a nominal operating mode (actually, they are at present in a testing and settling phase), it is planned to collect data during at least three months, which will allow to build a large travel times database. Among these four road segments, one of them has neither entry nor exit, thus the penetration rate and the overall performances of each of these technologies will be able to be estimated with no disruption in travel time measurements.

As intensive development of ITS, active and dynamic lane management has been practically implemented. By employing the technology of ITS, balancing lane-flow distribution is one of the feasible solutions to increase the throughput of bottleneck flow. However, the mechanism of the unbalanced usage among lanes is still unclear and traffic flow models enabling online and network-wide evaluation of dynamic and strategic lane management have not been proposed due to the lack of the method to computing lane-based traffic flow including lane-changing dynamics. This paper developed the multi-lane first order traffic flow model, which depicts the dynamics of lane-changing. It is assumed that each vehicle changes the lane to improve its utility or decrease its disutility, and also that the equilibrium of lane flow distribution is achieved as the condition of stochastic user equilibrium (SUE), where all drivers believe that they cannot improve their utility by changing the lanes. Thus, in the model, lane-changes are represented as the dynamics towards lane-flow equilibrium. As a result of simulating multilane traffic on freeway without any merging and diverging, it is revealed that the proposed model can represent the equilibrium curve of lane-flow distribution, and depict the propagation of traffic congestion at a lane-drop bottleneck section.

The toll-setting system incorporates models to predict the vehicle arrival process upstream of the toll lane facility and drivers' choice whether or not to use the toll lanes as a function of the toll rate and travel times presented to drivers within the information system. A macroscopic traffic simulation model is used to predict the flow conditions within the prediction horizon. The travel times provided to users as information and the ones predicted by the traffic flow model are iterated until consistency between them is obtained. The whole process is embedded within an optimization algorithm that sets tolls that optimize a given objective function. Several case studies demonstrate the use of this framework and its potential to provide useful toll settings. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

With recent developments, the network topology is getting more complex, and traffic prediction based on statistical analysis is becoming harder since it does not take into account the drivers' behavioural changes on the network. Looking at the issue from the seeds and needs perspective, there would be needs to develop a network traffic simulator dealing with traffic flow dynamics and driver behaviors. From the seeds side, road operators are now motivated to utilize the electronic toll collection (ETC) trip data collected every time a vehicle passes an ETC tollgate located at interchanges. Fully using ETC data is expected to improve the accuracy of time-dependent O-D matrix and route choice behavior model which is important in simulation studies. In this paper, the concept of traffic modeling and route choice behavior modeling in the expressway network simulation will be described, followed by calibration of time-dependent O-D matrix.

This paper aims to assess the impact of pickup-delivery trucks on traffic conditions. To this end, we resort to a theoretical but realistic urban arterial where deliveries are completed in double-park. The study first focuses on traffic flowing at capacity and determines the analytical formulation of the effective capacity when neglecting the effects of traffic signals. This formulation only depends on the characteristics of the arterial, the average time headway between truck arrivals and the average stop duration. It turns out that the pickup-delivery maneuvers strongly reduce the capacity. Then, this modeling framework is extended to other traffic conditions. The use of the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) makes it possible to incorporate effects of traffic signals. To this end, an existing MFD estimation method is adapted to the case of double-park deliveries. The comparison of the MFD estimates highlights that logistic activities have a major impact for traffic conditions near the maximal capacity. It confirms that creation of dedicated delivery areas and related logistic policies (pre-booked area, off-pick hours deliveries, etc.) are very promising solutions to improve both the efficiency of the transportation network and the logistic system.

We briefly overview the development of traffic flow theory based on continuous flow-density models of Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) type, that lead to the second-order model of Aw-Rascle. We will then concentrate on widely-adopted discrete approximation to the LWR model by Daganzo's Cell Transmission Model. Behaviour of the discussed models will be demonstrated by comparing the traffic flow prediction based on these models with real traffic data on the southern highway ring of Prague.

These are expected to revolutionise the features and capabilities of individual vehicles within the next decades. The introduction of VACS brings along the (sometimes ignored) necessity and continuously growing opportunities for accordingly adapted or utterly new Traffic Management (TM) actions and strategies. This calls for a new era of freeway TM research and practice, which is indispensable in order to accompany, complement and exploit the evolving VACS deployment. Specifically, the development of new traffic flow modelling and control approaches should become a priority in the years to come.

There is presented a cellular automaton model with introduced rules of vessels movement and collision avoidance manoeuvre. This model is able to describe different types of vessels evolving different type of intersections and provides the basis for simulation. In simulation there is considered simple crossing with distinguished main flow having priority and a roundabout with three different priority scenarios. As a result of simulation there are given probabilities of transitions between system safety states and probabilities of system's being in particular safety states during simulation time. Analysis and comparison of simulation results for various crossing's geometry and priority traffic schemes can potentially affect the tasks and decisions of authorities related to maritime transport and traffic in area with developed vessel traffic management including vessel traffic services.

Our problem is to clarify how boundary and fluctuation effects from psychological aspects are related to a traffic flow. This paper shows that we can see a phase transition at some traffic flow in fundamental diagrams (flow versus density). There, the traffic flow has remained in a small change by updating the distribution of car speed, while the car densities have been changed drastically.

Hence, the broadcast storm problem is prone to occur. In the past, several approaches have been proposed to solve the problem. Among them, we find counter-, distance-, location-, cluster-, and probabilistic-based schemes. In this paper, we analyze existing protocols and present a novel scheme that is designed to mitigate the broadcast storm problem, reduce the end-to-end latency in real urban scenarios, and deal with the faults that occur during transmission. The proposed routing protocol assigns a density adopted dynamic back-off time based on traffic flow theory to vehicle. It ensures the dissemination of the emergency message onto every part of the road, and when there is no relay vehicle, the emergency message will be retransmitted. We use the GrooveNet simulator to demonstrate that the proposed scheme has a low collision probability, low overhead and a short end-to-end latency.

So the study on the pollutant dispersion characteristics and influence factors of vehicles emission in city streets is of great significance. This paper analyses the influence factors of the vehicles emissions, gets the numerical simulation of the building's roof shape on both sides of the street and the influences of the relative height of buildings on both sides of the street canyon on the air flow field and pollutant diffusion concentration field. The results show that with the increase of height, the diffusion of vehicle emissions is in a downward trend in the street leeward and windward surface, the pollutants at the top of the street is obviously less than the vehicle emissions of pollutants in the street and the pollutants is obviously less affected by traffic flow at the top of the street. The results of this article can provide scientific basis about the control, monitoring and estimate of pollutant emission from the urban vehicle, and the rational layout and planning of the city's streets.

Drivers are divided into two classes, strategic and captive drivers. Strategic drivers time their departures to minimize expected generalized cost and can choose either the free lanes or HOT lane. Captive drivers have random departure times, and must choose the free lanes. Generalized cost for strategic drivers takes the form of the well-known schedule delay penalty function combined with travel time. The traffic flow model involves two parallel bottlenecks, one for each lane group. Four toll algorithms are compared: a fixed toll which is constant in time and unresponsive; a dynamic, but unresponsive toll based on expected demand; a dynamic and responsive toll which adapts based on congestion in the HOT lane; and a "full-information" toll which is aware of all captive driver inflows.

Road safety conditions depend on several factors, represented by a variety of quantitative and qualitative data, including: number of traffic accidents, traffic flow, lane width, shoulder width, road curvature and grade, access-point density, road markings and road signs (Mooren et al. 2012; OECD, 2002). By analysing a set of given roads or different sections of the same road, each with specific safety conditions, this methodology allows to determine which sections require interventions to improve safe driving conditions. Specifically, the multicriteria analysis technique is used in decision-making processes to support the choice among different alternatives in complex problems (Fadda, 2002). Among the different multicriteria techniques available, the Concordance Analysis will be used here. This paper proposes a unique modelling tool that incorporates the different indicators to calculate safety conditions. The methodology has been applied to a real case study for evaluating road safety on sections of a motorway infrastructure. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Firstly, a model is derived which predicts the speed of a given mixture of traffic within a single lane. The distribution over lanes is then phrased as an assignment problem, where it is assumed that individual drivers choose lanes so as to try to maximise their own speeds. Theory is derived which establishes circumstances in which the assignment matrix and consequent lane speeds can be solved for. Two examples are presented which demonstrate how the theory can be used to inform traffic management that employs either dynamic speed limits or mandatory lane policies. Future research and applications are then scoped. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.	[van Wageningen-Kessels, Femke] Delft Univ Technol, Stevinweg 1, NL-2628 CN Delft, Netherlands; [Wilson, R.

A general node approach could take into account different aspects about conflicts at intersections. In this paper, we present a new node model based on CTM to represent traffic flows that crosses signalized and unsignalized intersections. It allows to model complex intersections for urban contest. In particular, to represent different turn movements of the inflow at intersection and belonging at the same lane, the model introduces a new variable. It is utilized to represent the percentages of different turns. The model takes into account also the estimation of the merge flows at the intersection. We present a new model to compute the minor streams that are limited by major stream on unsignalized intersections. This model reduces the problems and the complexities of the capacity determination (based on gap acceptance) and it could be used for dynamic traffic assignment. Our model could be used also for complex signalized intersection, where many conflicts among through flows are presented. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The variation in traffic quality was evaluated basing on a traffic demand characterized by different percentages of heavy vehicles. Aimsun microsimulator was used to isolate traffic conditions difficult to capture on field, to replicate them to have a number of data as much as possible numerous, and to quantify the fundamental variables of traffic flow, namely the speed, flow, density, for a test freeway segment. Model calibration was accomplished by using traffic data collected at observation sections on the A22 Brenner Freeway, Italy. In order to check to what extent the model replicated reality, the validation of the calibrated model was also addressed. Simulation data were used to develop the relationships among the variables of traffic flow and to calculate the passenger car equivalents for heavy vehicles by comparing a fleet of passenger cars only with a mixed fleet characterized every time by different percentages of heavy vehicles. Despite the exploratory nature of this study, some implications can be drawn: PCE estimations are small at low flow rates and increase with increased flow rates due to at low volumes there are few passenger cars that can be influenced by heavy vehicles.

S	Xiao, X; Chen, YS; Yuan, Y		Santos, BF; Correia, GHA; Kroesen, M		Xiao, Xiao; Chen, Yusen; Yuan, Yufei			Estimation of missing flow at junctions using control plan and floating car data	18TH EURO WORKING GROUP ON TRANSPORTATION, EWGT 2015	Transportation Research Procedia		English	Proceedings Paper	18th Euro Working Group Transportation	JUL 14-16, 2015	Delft, NETHERLANDS			Control timing plan; junction loop flow; FCD; missing flow estimation; data fusion	ERRORS	This paper proposes a new and consistent approach for estimating missing flow by analyzing data from SCATS (containing both flow and timing plan at junctions) and FCD (Floating Car Data). SCATS system provides flow data and timing plan at a 5-minute interval, while FCD contains information of taxi trajectories with speed and position for each vehicle at a 30-second interval. Two objectives are defined in this paper: 1) to summarize major methods of flow estimation and create a generalized framework in flow estimation, 2) to research for the possibility of improving utilization of traffic flow data, by comparing methods from multiple aspects, to provide accurate and reliable source for traffic research and application. The paper devises three consistent methods to estimate missing flow at junctions. Firstly, historical flow data of a specific lane is used to make an initial estimation. Flow estimation values are estimated from each single lane and normalized to further complement Secondly, flow values from adjacent lanes with similarities are processed to compare with the estimated lane, for which timing plan is applied to identify relevant control group (same turning lanes) with their relative phase time proportions. Proportions and flow rate from observed lanes on the same control group are normalized to make an estimation at missing lanes. Thirdly, the information of FCD (such as speed) is used to estimate corresponding flow value. Typically detected flow and FCD speed relationship is established from junction streams. This relation is then applied back to the stream to calculate traffic flow. Each of the methods is expected to perform under varying situations. If all the results are proved to be reliable to a certain degree, they can be iterated for mutual verification and consistency. This methodology has been applied to Changsha municipality in China. Initial results indicate that suggested methods give promising indication that almost all missing lane flow could be recovered using these three methods. Further research is ongoing to investigate specific data fusion mechanism or interchangeable data source for traffic state estimation and its quality. Further research will also consider adjacent junctions within a given area to understand how data and flow relationship works at the network level. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In order to overcome the possible lack of real-time information, authors propose to use simulation-based data in order to improve the accuracy of the traffic state estimation. This model was tested on a urban freeway stretch in Rome, for which a set of real-time data during the morning of a typical workday was available. Results of the application point out the benefits of the proposed approach in predicting the traffic state, as shown by GEH, RMSE and RME values similar to those presented in the literature.

We aim at reducing these and introduce a modelling framework at two-dimensional scale in order to model traffic flow of transportation systems of large surface networks. We present a network flow pattern corresponding to network flows modelling with a few network sensors of traffic count locations. We manage and evaluate traffics on wide and dense networks with a minimum of available measurements and data, through modelling of global behaviours based on local behaviours. We find that the traffic at this scale is governed by multidimensional hyperbolic conservations laws. Godunov-type method has been proposed to compute the network flow flux across computational domains. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Sossoe, K.

For operational analysis it is crucial to distinguish between low level of service related to oversaturated conditions and generated by extraordinary events as incidents. In case of incident it is fundamental to have a prompt response in order to activate any requested countermeasure, such as rescue activation and traffic detour. This paper introduces a control system which recognizes incidents from vehicle loop detectors data (system control), and identifies the optimal position of loop detectors (system design). The system was developed using fuzzy logic concepts and calibrated using data from micro simulation experiments. Micro simulation approach is justified from the impossibility to get the requested data from on-field observations. The analysis has been focused on a two-way four-lane freeway basic segment; traffic flow variables (Density, Space Mean Speed and Flow Rate) were estimated with reference to the set of consecutive time intervals (one-minute long) belonging to the whole observation time period (3 hours). Simulated data were obtained running the model several times (10 runs) for each traffic volume class adopted in the analysis (1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 3,500 vehicles/hour), with different random number seeds. Calibration dataset was used to determine the knowledge base of each FIS using the open-source software FisPro, and the remaining data (validation dataset) to evaluate the performance of the system. The main finding of the study is that the detection system, despite its simplicity, shows excellent False Alarm Rate and satisfactory Mean Time To Detection. (C) 2015 The Authors.

So there is an opportunity to infer useful patterns and trends. In this research, we plan to apply a statistical approach on 10000 vehicle GPS traces, from around 3600 drivers which are mined to extract the outlier traffic pattern to be used further in an Intelligent Transportation System. We choose to divide the urban area into a grid and organizing the road infrastructure as segments in a graph. Further, at a given time we can make an assumption regarding the congestion level in a specific area taking into account the visits for each vehicle, using the GPS trace data. Over time, the visited segments will settle into a pattern and vary periodically. In this study we will use R software in conjunction with a set of libraries. They provide an environment in which we can perform statistical analysis and produce graphics to annotate different results. Our objective is to identify contiguous set of road segments and time intervals which have the largest statistically significant relevance in forming traffic patterns. Taking into account the number of drivers that submitted their routes in correlation with the entire population on New Haven we can state that a 2-3% penetration rate of smart phones is enough to provide accurate measurements of the traffic flow and identification of traffic patterns.

Among the wide range of proposed VACS, the ones that include vehicle-to-infrastructure communication capabilities may be exploited both as sensors and as actuators. This enables traffic control centres to obtain more accurate information on the current traffic state and to assign to each vehicle appropriate control tasks, so as to achieve a global traffic flow target. The concept employs and exploits the synergistic (integrated) action of a number of old and new control measures, including ramp metering, vehicle speed control, and lane changing control, at a macroscopic level. The problem is tackled through a Quadratic Programming optimisation problem used as the core of a model predictive control framework. The optimal control actions may be sent directly to vehicles equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC), affecting directly their cruise speed and, in addition, their lane-changing behaviour. The effectiveness and the computational feasibility of the proposed approach are demonstrated via microscopic simulation for a variety of ACC settings and penetration rates of equipped vehicles.

Kashii Sando in Fukuoka City is known as a notoriously busy road that approaches a shrine. Therefore, we focus on the road and introduce a cellular automaton model to simulate the bottleneck situation due to a railroad crossing. We introduce parameters such as traffic volume, initial traffic volume, and car stop time in front of the crossing. We show that a traffic jam is considerably affected by the time that cars are stopped at the railroad crossing.

To conduct the analysis of braking state vehicle formation, this paper introduces the concept of inverse of time to collision and gives a detailed analysis the optimal velocity (OV), the modified optimal velocity (MOV), the full velocity difference (FVD), and the modified full velocity difference (MFVD) models. In this paper, we proposed a modified car following model based on the Full Velocity Difference (FVD) model, with the new optimal velocity as function of spacing and relative speed which introduced the weighting factor that based on inverse time to collision. The modified full velocity difference shows that can simulate the motions of cars is better than the modified OV model.

S	Majith, NA; Sinha, S			IEEE	Majith, Abdul N.; Sinha, Sitabhra			Statistics of Stop-and-go Traffic: Emergent properties of congestion behavior arising from collective vehicular dynamics in an urban environment	2015 7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS IEEE COMSNETS 2015	International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks	JAN 06-10, 2015	Bangalore, INDIA	airtel, Mahindra COMVIVA, Sasken, hp Networking			SYSTEMS	The movement of large numbers of vehicles along the complex network of roads in a city result in interactions between them that become stronger as the traffic density increases. The non-trivial behavior arising from the collective dynamics of vehicles include the occurrence of persistent congestion at different points of the transport network that typically reduce the efficiency of overall traffic flow. In order to understand the mechanisms responsible for the characteristic spatio-temporal patterns of urban traffic, we first need to identify statistically robust features from empirical observations, which one can then try to recreate in computational models of traffic dynamics. In this article, we have analyzed the GPS traces collected round the clock for more than a hundred taxis operating in a major Indian city over a period of 1 month. The available information allows us to precisely measure the periods during which the vehicle is static and when it is moving. We focus on the intermittent patterns of rest and motion that a car exhibits during its passage through city traffic, which provides a window into key aspects of collective dynamics resulting from congestion. We show that the distribution of waiting time, i.e., the period during which a car is static between two successive epochs of movement, has a highly skewed nature. The bulk of the probability distribution appears to follow power-law scaling with exponent value of 1.78. As city traffic has very different densities during peak hours and off-peak hours, we have also investigated this distribution at different times of the day. While the power-law scaling is found to be robust, the exact value of the exponent does change slightly. We have also considered the active time distribution, i.e., the period of movement between two epochs when the car is static, which does not exhibit a power-law signature but rather resembles a inverse Gaussian or a log-logistic distribution. We also look at the recurrence relation between the durations of successive waiting times, as well as, that between active time duration and the duration of the preceding waiting time. Our results can be used to help understand how the statistical properties of large-scale traffic movement over complex road networks which characterize cities deviate from that of other types of collective dynamics, e.g., the diffusion of random walkers.

We model this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). This problem is hard to solve when simultaneously considering all the junctions in the road network. So, we propose a decentralized multi-gent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm for solving this problem by considering each junction in the road network as a separate agent (controller). Each agent optimizes the order of the phase sequence using Q-learning with either E-greedy or VCB [3] based exploration strategies. The coordination between the junctions is achieved based on the cost feedback signal received from the neighbouring junctions. The learning algorithm for each agent updates the Q-factors using this feedback signal. We show through simulations over VISSIM that our algorithms perform significantly better than the standard fixed signal timing (FST), the saturation balancing (SAT) [14] and the round-robin multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms [11] over two real road networks.

In this paper we revisit the traffic signal control to improve urban network performance. Three novel strategies that address congested heterogeneous traffic flow are presented. The first two strategies - keeping intersection signal cycle times shorter and bottleneck metering - are derived from field observed data while the third - exclusive lanes and storage area near intersections for two wheelers - is supported based on a micro-simulation model. Potential improvements are presented based on the strategies. While most recent studies have focused on area wide / network signal control improvements our study shows potential for significant improvement even at the level of an isolated signal.

In this paper, we estimate the traffic flow density based on classification. Various new efficient features are introduced for distinguishing between different traffic states, including number of key-points, edges of difference-image and moving edges. These features describe the traffic flow without any need to individual vehicles detection and tracking. We experiment our proposed approach on a standard database and some real videos from Tehran roads. The results show high accuracy performance of our method, even in changes of environmental conditions (e.g., lighting), by using efficient features. Duo to low computational cost, our proposed approach for traffic density estimation is applicable in real time applications.

The advantage of artificial neural network is its ability of learning or training in other words. By learning, the network can give appropriate output when accepting input. Thus, artificial neural network is a good model for predicting transportation flow. This paper proposes the Bayesian normalized Elman neural network as the prediction model which has the reliability and stability of Elman neural network and is able to overcome the influence of the hidden layer nodes on the prediction accuracy, which improves the generalization ability of the network. Then depending on long-time traffic forecasting results of different neural networks like classical BP, wavelet neural network, statistics accuracy error and comparative analysis are finished to draw a conclusion that combined with Bayesian normalized method based on Elman neural network is more suitable for long time traffic forecast.

Taking lane-changing frequency as the main indicator of traffic safety level, we analyze the impact of different lane changing and deceleration probability on the traffic flow and safety in light and heavy traffic. And then we compare the "keep-right-except-to-pass" rule with the free rule in the two-lane case. The results demonstrate that "keep-right-except-to-pass" rule is not as effective as the free rule in promoting traffic flow; however, this rule ensures better safety for drivers than the free rule. Additionally, a new traffic rule, which sets different posted speed limits for adjacent lanes, is designed to promote a better traffic flow with the safety requirements satisfied.

It considers route choice behaviour on both the strategic (pre-trip) and tactical (en-route) level. To achieve this, we put forward a class-specific equilibrium direction relation of the pedestrians, which is governed by two parts: one part describing the global route choice, which is pre-determined based on the expectations of the pedestrians, and one part describing the local route choice, which is a density-gradient dependent term that reflects local adaptations based on prevailing flow conditions. Including the local route choice term in the multi-class model causes first of all dispersion of the flow: pedestrians will move away from high density areas in order to reduce their overall walking costs. Second of all, for the crossing flow and bi-directional flow cases, local route choice causes well known self-organised patterns to emerge (i.e. diagonal stripes and bi-directional lanes). We study under which demand conditions self-organisation occurs and fails, as well as what the impact is of the choices of the different model parameters.

In the model, lane changing is considered as a stochastic behavior that can decrease an individual driver's disutility or cost, and is represented as dynamics toward the equilibrium of lane-flow distribution along with longitudinal traffic dynamics. The proposed method can be differentiated from those in previous studies because in this study, the motivation of lane changing is explicitly considered and it is treated as a utility defined by the current macroscopic traffic state. In addition, the entire process of lane changing is computed macroscopically by an extension of the kinematic wave theory employing IT principle; moreover, in the model framework, the lane-flow equilibrium curve is endogenously generated because of self-motivated lane changes. Furthermore, the parsimonious representation enables parameter calibration using the data collected from conventional loop detectors. The calibration of the data collected at four different sites, including a sag bottleneck, on the Chugoku expressway in Japan reveals that the proposed method can represent the lane-flow distribution of any observation site with high accuracy, and that the estimated parameters can reasonably explain the multilane traffic dynamics and the bottleneck phenomena uphill of sag sections.

By exploiting a symmetry property of the stochastic MFD, whereby it exhibits identical probability distributions in free-flow and congestion, it is found that the network MFD depends mainly on two dimensionless parameters: the mean block length to green ratio and the mean red to green ratio. The theory is validated with an exact traffic simulation and with the empirical data from the city of Yokohama. It is also shown that the effect of buses can be approximated with the proposed theory by accounting for their effect in the red to green ratio parameter. (C) 2015 The Authors.

And the consistency of jam density is identified as the equivalent criterion. Utilize PCE to study the influences of various vehicles on oversaturated traffic flow. First of all, this new algorithm is established according to the 'I-80' field data provided by NGSIM. Then, the results directly prove the consistency of jam density and show that heavy vehicles have a larger effect on the oversaturated traffic flow than passenger cars. The speed-density algorithm can be used to estimate the PCE under oversaturated conditions and jam density keeps consistent when the road is crowded.

Based on Hybrid Radial Basis Function Neural Network, another novel predictive statistic modeling technique called Enhanced Hybrid Radial Basis Function Neural Network (EHRBF-NN) is proposed in the paper. EHRBF-NN is a flexible forecasting technique that integrates regression trees, particle swarm optimization, with radial basis function neural networks. In this technique, the regression tree is used to determine the centers and radius of the radial basis functions. The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to avoid the over fitting and determine the weights of the neural network. Computer simulations have been implemented to validate the EHRBF-NN. Compared forecasting results with actual data, the algorithm of HRBF-NN is more effective than ordinary RBF-NN, RBF-NN with least square method and HRBF-NN, while it uses less computing resources and shorter computing time.

It is also the key to the efficiency of the urban transport system. In this paper, the mesoscopic traffic flow models are improved by integrated with variable speed limits strategy to simulate the dynamic of vehicles on urban expressway network. The models include static queuing model, the velocity model and the vehicle movement model. Moreover the corresponding variable speed limits values can be obtained by proposed simulation method which can aid traffic managers to develop a network traffic flow control strategy. In the end, the elevated expressway network of Jinan city is used as a simulation example. We investigated the performance of the transport system with averaged density, speed and flow on link. We also analyzed the dynamic of the traffic system on expressway network at different demand level. The simulation results show that the proposed models and method are feasible and effective. The variable speed limits strategy can successfully alleviate the traffic congestion in some extent. The operational efficiency of the transportation system is greatly improved.

This will makes the average speed of vehicles reduce. Based on METANET model shows that this section can be equivalent to reducing lane bottleneck road, with traffic flow increases, the degree of congestion has catastrophe. The simulation by vissim and the data analysis by matlab shows that when less traffic on road, such bottlenecks have much smaller impact on traffic flows, and when traffic flow increases, this will cause serious traffic congestion suddenly. Meanwhile the bottleneck effect of steep uphill in tunnel has relationship with the proportion of vehicles which have significant reduction of the speed.

This paper analyses the theory combined with vissim for simulation and matlab for data analysis, which finds that the relationship between highway bottlenecks and congestion can be explained by catastrophe theory. Relations of traffic flow parameters (flow rate - density) will result in sudden change. That means the traffic congestion will suddenly become serious but not slowly become serious as traffic flow increases. The study of catastrophe theory of highway bottlenecks is very helpful for traffic control and transport phenomena prediction.

However, the effectiveness of VMS largely depends on the number and location of installation in road network. In practice, VMS location is always based on the managers' experiences and subjective judgments, without sufficient theoretical support. This paper presents an algorithm for VMS location through road traffic network in which the idea of backtracking is used. The location order can be obtained by scanning the four multi-level traffic-guidance attributions on each road. These four attributions include road grade, traffic flow, and information intensity and information attenuation. In the proposed algorithm, the remaining roads will be scanned by using lower-level attribution or rescanned by using the same upper-level attribution after one attribution has been checked for one road. In this algorithm, not only the static factors related to traffic information are taken into account, but also the dynamic one like information attenuation is considered. Finally, a practical example of the algorithm is analyzed and verified.

The results shows that Tangxia monitoring site has a much higher flow than other sites which indicates a heavy traffic jam in holidays. A further Investigation of traffic flow in Tangxia site shows a common higher traffic flow in the north direction compared with that in the south direction. The temporal distribution of traffic flow in each holiday has its own characteristics which are closely related to the characteristics of the holidays. The hourly distribution of traffic flow in each day has the similar trend with high value at daytime and lower flow at night. The artificial neural networks (ANN) model was used to predict the traffic flow in 2014 which was trained with data in the same site and holiday in 2013. The multi-layer feed-forward perceptron networks (MLP) with three-layer structure was applied to predict the traffic flow in the next 5 minutes with the past 25 minutes flow data. An example of Yandang monitoring site shows a pretty well prediction results with mean absolute relative error (MARE) and max absolute relative error (MAXARE) being 0.0214 and 0.1244, respectively. The investigation and prediction of traffic flow can provide a theoretical basis for the transportation administration to make decisions.

The fluency of one-way waterway transportation is proposed in this paper. By using the model, a simulation system is constructed on the basis of First Come First Served (FCFS) model. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to see the performance of navigation efficiency. The vessels are generated randomly according to statistical characteristics on ship arrival rate and speed among others. Moreover, the safe distance is used to guarantee navigational safety. Based on the simulations, the relationships between traffic fluency and the parameters that are related with traffic efficiency, including channel length, vessel's arrival rate and vessel speed are analyzed. The results can provide a reference for vessel traffic organization and scheduling.

However, the maritime accidents are attracting public attention. The way to improve safety of navigation has become a prior task for the operations. The trajectory is useful to analyze the features of the traffic flow and helpful to simulate traffic flows. Therefore, to explore the law of navigation in curving waterway and the reliability prediction of trajectories could provide security for the navigation of ships, and also provide the decision-making for trajectory-planning and risk warning. This paper uses Markov Chain and Grey prediction, and improves the traditional Markov model. Based on this, it offers a prediction method for island ship in curving waterway on the foundation of Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. It can be showed that this method can effectively predict the trajectory of island ship.

Phantom jam avoidance through in-car speed advice	CURRENT PRACTICES IN TRANSPORT: APPRAISAL METHODS, POLICIES AND MODELS, 42ND EUROPEAN TRANSPORT CONFERENCE SELECTED PROCEEDINGS	Transportation Research Procedia		English	Proceedings Paper	Current Practices in Transport: Appraisal Methods, Policies and Models, 42nd European Transport Conference Selected Proceedings	SEP 29-OCT 01, 2014	Goethe Univ, Frankfurt, GERMANY	Assoc European Transport	Goethe Univ	Phantom jams; ITS; Traffic management		The existence of phantom jams can be explained following the definition of Kerner & Konhauser (1993) who state that a phantom jam occurs without the existence of a physical bottleneck and is caused by the imperfect driving style of road users under metastable traffic conditions. In order to prevent a phantom jams to occur, one can either focus on the cause of the perturbation, or on the metastability of the traffic flow. Previous studies have shown that the use of dynamic speed limits, displayed by road-side equipment, is a successful instrument to stabilize traffic flow and to dissolve formed phantom jams (e.g. Specialist algorithm tested in Dynamax project in The Netherlands). However, the increasing attention and possibilities for in-car application can provide more accurate and personalized or differentiated advice possibly increasing the impact. In our research we have tested several strategies implementing in-car dynamic speed limits in order to prevent phantom jams from occurring. Penetration rate and the compliance rate of car drivers were varied to investigate the effects. For this, a microsimulation study was set up based on the VISSIM software, for a stretch of highway without any on-and off-ramps. Different strategies for speed advice have been evaluated, where the actual speed and the thresholds were varied. For this purpose we processed the speed and flow data that were detected by dual loop detectors, by using fuzzy logic rules in order to determine the spatio-temporal traffic conditions. Based on these traffic conditions a speed advice is given. The spatio-temporal traffic conditions are derived from Kerner's three phase theory and the forecasting of traffic objects method (FOTO) by Kerner et al. (2004). Subsequently, this data is processed using clustering techniques to determine when and where on the network advice should be provided in order to prevent a phantom jam from occurring. It turned out that prevention based advice systems, making use of the presence of high intensity waves, are successful in preventing phantom jams from occurring. A significant reduction of both the number of phantom jams as the total jam weight has been measured. Consequently this also contributes to the traffic safety as traffic is stabilized and speed differences between vehicles are reduced. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Suijs, L. C.

We propose a microscopic acceleration and track-changing model taking into account different fitness levels, gradients, and interactions between the athletes in all traffic situations. The model is calibrated on microscopic data of the Vasaloppet 2012. Using the multi-model open-source simulator MovSim.org, we simulate all 15,000 participants of the Vasaloppet during the first 10 km.

The macroscopic model considers synchronized traffic flow, uses the continuum approach and is based on the original quasi-gas-dynamic (QGD) system of equations. The distinguishing feature of the model is the variable transverse velocity reflecting the speed of lane changing. The numerical implementation is explicit, the similarity with kinetically consistent finite difference schemes is used. The microscopic model is based on the cellular automata theory and presents generalization of Nagel-Schreckenberg model to the multilane case. The computational domain is the 2D lattice where two directions correspond to the road length and width. The number of cells in the transverse direction corresponds to the number of lanes. Each cell of the lattice can be either empty or occupied by one vehicle. Such a model allows vehicles to change lanes and to overtake one another. The algorithm of cell state update is formed by two components: lane change (if it is necessary and possible), movement along the road by the rules of N-S model.

Although most cellular automata intend to reproduce this diagram by measuring the limit steady-states from the dynamic simulation, real roads are constantly perturbed by external factors, driving the system to explore a much broader phase space. Hereby, we show that a Monte Carlo sampling of all states compatible with a driving rule (previously derived for Bogota) actually reproduces the measured fundamental diagram, both in mean values and dispersion, when all such states are assumed equally probable. Even more, by using the Wardrop's relation, the same gathered data also approximates the general form of the time-mean fundamental diagrams. These results suggest that driving rules are much richer in information than usually expected and, that the assumption of equally probable states plus a finite length of road may be a first model for the statistical description of highways.

Weather and Road Geometry Impact on Acceleration Behavior: Experimental Set-Up and Data Collection Using a Driving Simulator	TRAFFIC AND GRANULAR FLOW '13			English	Proceedings Paper	Traffic and Granular Flow	SEP 25-27, 2013	Julich, GERMANY				SPEED	Transportation researchers tried for decades to investigate the dynamics of traffic flow in order to "optimize" the movement of goods and people under different surrounding conditions while reducing the negative environmental impacts and the economic losses due to congestion and traffic incidents. An important aspect missing from some previous studies relates to the activities through which drivers process the information representing a given surrounding. Such activities include: perception, evaluation, judgment and execution. Recognizing such limitation, the objective of this paper is utilize a 3-D driving simulator to advance the state of knowledge related to driving behavior while considering the surrounding environment's impact (weather and road geometry) on drivers' decision-making logic. Through a thorough literature review, the authors looked at the external factors that may impact longitudinal driving behavior. The major factors considered include visibility level, road friction, curvature, gradient, median existence, lane width and shoulder width. The literature review is then translated to an experimental setup with variables that "parameterize" the external environment's characteristics. A total of 36 students and staff from the George Washington University, 26 male and 10 female, with varying driving experience participated in the experiments. The participants drove behind a yellow cab which speed patterns are dictated by real-word trajectories taken from the NGSIM trajectory data. The collected performance measures include accelerations, speeds, longitudinal and lateral coordinates of the subject vehicle and the lead vehicle.

TRAFFIC AND GRANULAR FLOW '13			English	Proceedings Paper	Traffic and Granular Flow	SEP 25-27, 2013	Julich, GERMANY					The theoretical reason for the existence of universal features of traffic jams forming in various places and with different number of cars on highways is provided using exact solutions of a mathematical model for traffic flow, the Optimal Velocity (OV) model. The OV model well reproduces real traffic data of jams in several aspects, such as the critical density of jam formation, the velocity of a jam cluster, etc. where each value is almost universal. The OV model with Heaviside step function as OV-function has essentially the same properties as a realistic OV model. Recently, we have obtained exact solutions of jam flow in the model for an arbitrary number of cars N > 3 and car-density. In the solutions, the dependence on N and the density are exponentially reduced for N -> infinity. This means that the properties of jams with more than about ten cars are almost the same as that of an infinite jam. This result is originated in the fact that the model is built mathematically based on the concept that traffic flow is a non-equilibrium dissipative system. This explains the universality of jam flow.

Recent homogenization methods allow to obtain sufficient conditions for that the system converges with no collision to the uniform solution. These conditions are calculated and illustrated by numerical experiments with the linear optimal velocity model. As expected, the homogenization condition is more restrictive than the condition for the collective stability. More precisely, the homogenization condition corresponds to the over-damped case of the local stability.

Compact perturbations of coercive periodic quasiconvex Hamiltonians enter into this framework, for example. We prove that the rescaled solution converges towards the solution of the expected effective Hamilton-Jacobi equation, but whose "flux" at the origin is "limited" in a sense made precise by Imbert and Monneau. In other words, the homogenization of such a Hamilton-Jacobi equation yields to supplement the expected homogenized Hamilton-Jacobi equation with a junction condition at the single discontinuous point of the effective Hamiltonian. We also illustrate possible applications of such a result by deriving, for a traffic flow problem, the effective flux limiter generated by the presence of a finite number of traffic lights on an ideal road. We also provide meaningful qualitative properties of the effective limiter.

As for evaluating performance of the rule, we set up several assessment indicators including safe distance, traffic flow, the times of changing lanes and etc. The five-spots dynamic traffic flow model, namely, combined with the principle of bubble sort, provides a solution to study the changing of vehicles state information in the traffic flow so as to simulate varying transport phenomena. By simulating, it can be shown that the keep-right-exceptto-pass rule is more efficient in heavy traffic while the different-speed-limits-foreach-lanes rule can improve the traffic capacity and safety in heavy traffic.(1)	[Feng, Jiewei; Hu, Guiwu; Huang, Wenmin; Hu, Jianling] Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Math & Stat, Guangzhou 510320, Guangdong, Peoples R China	Feng, JW (corresponding author), Guangdong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Math & Stat, Guangzhou 510320, Guangdong, Peoples R China.

This paper presents the process of video images by feature information extraction in tunnel intelligent control system. By detecting whether vehicles pass, their driving speed and vehicle number information in tunnels, the brightness scheme of the tunnel lights of "the car near the lights on, the car far the lights off" can be implemented and adjusted automatically. In addition, the data generated by information extraction and data mining can be applied as follows. Firstly, the system can forecast tunnel traffic conditions judging by traffic flow and speed, alarm and send the information to the traffic control department when necessary, which is helpful to the tunnel traffic grooming or accident rescue. Secondly, it has the function to retrieve the time when a vehicle passed the monitoring point. Thirdly, the system can also provide monthly, quarterly or annual traffic volume of the tunnel etc.	[Li, Liangrong; Lu, Qian; Li, Zhen] Guizhou Univ, Guiyang 550003, Guizhou, Peoples R China	Li, LR (corresponding author), Guizhou Univ, Guiyang 550003, Guizhou, Peoples R China.

To study the influence of this rule on the traffic flow, we improve the existing cellular automata model and take into account the velocity differences and random factors about changing lanes. Then a new kind of cellular automata model is proposed and used to assess the performance of this rule in terms of traffic flow, safety and posted speed limit. Simulations give us vivid figures, showing effects of density of vehicles and speed limit on traffic flow under that rule.

It is challenging to play out full potential of temporally-related information and overcome the problem of data sparsity existed in the traffic flow prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel urban traffic prediction mechanism namely C-Sense consisting of two parts: CRF-based temporal feature learning and sequence segments matching. CRF-based temporal feature learning exploits a linear-chain condition random field (CRF) to explore the temporal transformation rule in the traffic flow state sequence with supplementary environmental resources. Sequence segments matching is utilized to match the obtained state sequence segments with historical condition to get the ultimate prediction results. Experiments are evaluated based on datasets obtained in Wuhan and the results show that our mechanism can achieve good performance, which prove that it is a potential approach in transportation field.

The results come out from modelling of measurement of postal transport system efficiency on the basis of real postal traffic flows with particular discriminant characteristics. Measurement of transit time is realized by flow of test postal items in proportion to real postal traffic flows. The result of on-time performance is represented by estimate of on-time probability. The main objective of this paper is assessment of measurement system efficiency by calculation of key parameters for assessment of measurement results from viewpoint of next modelling.

The idea of the research is to develop an algorithm for the theoretical data set calculation using the measured traffic flow rate and the average speed of the traffic flow. The generated data set is used as an input data to solve engineering traffic flow problems.

For its realization in the field of transport, they are a wide scale of different specialized software tools. For the need of an application of computer simulation in the field of transport it is possible to use also other software solutions. This paper deals with the possibility of simulation model for light-controlled road junction creation by the program Technomatix Plant Simulation. Computer simulation is an effective and powerful tool for solving a wide spectrum of transport problems. Without its help today we can not imagine solving different types of tasks in the field of transport. To apply traffic modeling, there is now a wide variety of different types of programs that differ from each other by different parameters. In addition to specialized programs, it is possible for the transport sector to use other simulation programs, which are general in nature use. Through them, we can create a full traffic model, which in terms of level can be divided according to generally accepted terminology into micro, macro and mezzo levels. The issue of modeling and simulation services is part of the presented works of different authors. Stromgren et all [2] deal with a model for Traffic Simulation of Flared Rural Road Intersections. The intersection model is designed with input parameters that describe the geometric conditions of the flare. Computer simulation of transport can also be used to solve transport within conurbations. Planning an urban car park provision using microsimulation make Sykes et all [3]. A common area for the use of simulation models are crossings. This is particularly the realization of models of microtip level. With microscopic modeling of adaptive cruise control systems deal Ntousakis et all [4]. The Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system, is one of the emerging vehicle technologies that has already been deployed in the market. Although it was designed mainly to enhance driver comfort and passengers' safety, it also affects the dynamics of traffic flow. For this reason, a strong research interest in the field of modeling and simulation of ACC-equipped vehicles has been increasing in the last few years. [4] Another field for application of computer simulation in traffic is the problem of traffic congestion. Basir [5] study exploring new methods bus priority at junctions isolated vehicle actuated. A similar issue is addressed and Gentile. [6] in the paper using general link transmission model in a dynamic traffic assignment to simulate congestion on urban networks. This article presents two new models of Dynamic User Equilibrium That are Particularly suited for ITS applications, where the evolution of vehicle flows and travel times must be simulated on large road networks, possibly ever in real-time. The key feature of the proposed models is the detail representation of the main congestion phenomena occurring at nodes of urban networks, Such as vehicle queues and their spillback, as well as conflicts in mergins flow and diversions [7]. This raises a wide range of using the method of computer simulation in the field of transport. Since transportation issues are an important part of the city logistics research issues, the question arises whether it is possible for the issue to let simulation tools set priorities for the area of logistics. One such software is software Plant Simulation.

In this paper, a hi-level programming model is formulated. In the upper level, we aim to minimize the total time spent in the urban artery, which considers the constraints of sequence phases' starting and duration through the macroscopic traffic flow model. In the lower level, the goal is to maximize the vehicle release rate. In this work, vehicular emissions model is adopted to calculate the emissions and an environmental constraint is introduced by considering the requirement of air quality. Simulation experiments are conducted using data of real road network. Experimental results indicate that our method not only reduces the total time at a rate of approximately 10%, but reduces the concentration of PM2.5 as well.

The agent-oriented technology provides the advantage in modeling the system and reflecting the ITS components' interactive and self-managing behavior than the conventional simulation technologies. In this paper, a multi-agent traffic simulation system is presented and implemented in NetLogo platform. In this system, the urban traffic components including the vehicles, road sections, intersections are abstracted to agent models. Each agent has the basic abilities of obtaining knowledge, autonomy, interaction and communication. In the road agent model, the traffic flow forecasting ability is integrated to induce vehicle agents' action and help intersection agent control the traffic signal. Each intersection agent is the abstracted model of the signal controller and the traffic situation of intersection. In each intersection agent model, the signal control function is implemented by analyzing the real-time and predicted traffic flow information from the interaction with related road agents. Simulation result shows that the proposed multi-agent traffic system performs well in reflecting the evolution of dynamic traffic system's behavior. Besides, it shows the advantage in reducing the vehicles' delay time of the road network by the interaction-based signal control function of the intersection agent.

This is called the capacity drop. Recent studies show that the queue discharge rate increases as the speed in congestion increases. For many applications, such as dynamic speed limit control design and evaluation, macroscopic models are needed. A kinematic wave model aiming to assess consequences of control strategies should firstly reproduce different queue discharge rates depending on congestion states, and secondly capture the capacity drop for both standing queues and stop-and-go waves. However, no such kinematic wave model exists until now. Therefore, this paper fills in the gap, incorporating the capacity drop into a kinematic wave model. The new model can reproduce different queue discharge rates corresponding to the vehicular speed in congestion, which means the new model can reproduce speed limit effects accurately. By formulating the model in Lagrangian coordinates and applying an upwind discretization method, this paper presents a hybrid model which captures the capacity drop with stop-and-go waves and can be applied to reproduce the capacity drop with standing queues.

This paper introduces a novel model for Automatic Incident Prediction (AID) on freeways: Drift3Flow. This stepwise methodology produces flow/occupancy rate predictions using an online weighted ensemble schema of two well-known time series analysis techniques: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (ETS). Then, it continuously monitors the probability distribution function (p.d.f.) of the prediction residuals to trigger alarms of an imminent prediction divergence, i.e. concept drift. Such alarm activates an update neuron which extends our model's reactivity by embedding a fully incremental learning schema inspired on the Delta Rule (DR) (derived from the BackPropagation (BP) algorithm). Our experimental test-bed used three weeks of data acquired from a real-world sensor network in Asia. The results validated its contributions by exhibiting a superior performance: 25% greater than the one obtained using ARIMA and ETS-based AID methods.

We present an extension of the Cell Transmission Model for Urban Traffic (CTM - UT). It is suitable to represent complex flow interactions among lane groups at upstream of signalized intersections and at intersection with determination capacity. Our model is a simple and versatile simulation framework designed to realistically simulate the dynamic queue interactions. It can represent the potential capacity of minor flow obstructed at intersection for large scale urban network. In this paper we present our macroscopic simulation model considering also an optimization calibration method for congestion wave. A comparison between our model and Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) is done.

It can be avoided by some traffic control measures such as ramp metering. In this paper, a generic first-order traffic flow model is proposed, to reproduce the capacity drop at both on-ramp bottleneck and lane drop bottleneck. Based on this model, a linear quadratic model predictive control strategy for the integration of dynamic route guidance and ramp metering is presented. The objective is to minimize the total time spend of a traffic network. Due to the linearity of the optimization problem, the problem can be solved efficiently, which makes the problem suitable for real-time traffic control. A hypothetical traffic network containing both on-ramp bottleneck and lane drop bottleneck is utilized as a test bed, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

Integrated Variable Speed Limit and Ramp Metering Control against Jam Waves - a COSCAL v2 based Approach	2015 IEEE 18TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	18th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems	SEP 15-18, 2015	SPAIN	IEEE, Int Transportat Syst Soc, CVCEI, Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Ayuntamentiao Las Palmas Gran Canaria, LPA, IEEE Comp Soc, Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Univ Ciencias Tecnologias Ciberneticas				In the recent past, numerous Variable Speed Limit (VSL) approaches have been designed to resolve traffic jams on the freeway. In this work, the theory of one such VSL strategy COoperative Speed Control ALgorithm (COSCAL v2) - is analytically extended for integration with Ramp Metering (RM), based on traffic flow theory. COSCAL v2 is a reactive feedback VSL strategy that resolves jam waves using shockwave theory. However, on -ramp flows (with or without RM) are currently not included in its design. When VSLs are activated by jams near an on -ramp, the additional merging flow can reduce effectiveness of the VSL scheme, by preventing jam resolution or even triggering new jams in the controlled section. The integrated approach improves effectiveness of the VSL strategy, and overall network efficiency. The extended theory is evaluated for a freeway section with an on -ramp in micro -simulation, and results indicate a lower total time spent as compared to the original algorithm.

Bounded acceleration capacity drop in a Lagrangian formulation of the kinematic wave model with vehicle characteristics and unconstrained overtaking	2015 IEEE 18TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	18th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems	SEP 15-18, 2015	SPAIN	IEEE, Int Transportat Syst Soc, CVCEI, Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Ayuntamentiao Las Palmas Gran Canaria, LPA, IEEE Comp Soc, Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Univ Ciencias Tecnologias Ciberneticas		traffic modelling; capacity drop; bounded acceleration; kinematic wave model; Lagrangian coordinates; invariant advection	TRAFFIC FLOW MODEL; HIGHWAY; MERGES	In this contribution a model-based analysis of the application of bounded acceleration in traffic flow is considered as a cause for the capacity drop. This is performed in a Lagrangian formulation of the kinematic wave model with general vehicle specific characteristics. Unconstrained overtaking is presumed, which allows a demonstration to be given of the influence that constraints in traffic flow may have on the capacity drop. An experimental case demonstrates that bounded acceleration in traffic flow with unconstrained overtaking has very limited effect on the capacity drop. This implies that the capacity drop when incurred through bounded acceleration must make use of (semi-)constrained traffic flow, in which variety in vehicle acceleration ability may also be required to increase inhomogeneity. This is an important conclusion as it further defines the conditions required for capacity drop. The application of a Lagrangian formulation with advection invariant combined with bounded acceleration is also novel. The contribution further shows that the application of bounded acceleration in the presented model is feasible, although adjustments are required to capture the capacity drop through bounded acceleration.

In the model, the traffic dynamics are described by the, Modified Cell Transmission Model (MGM), where the cells are expressed by hybrid automata, and multi -mode switching expressions are introduced to the connections among these cells. The proposed DGHA models are modularized and easily -extensible, and are implemented by Modelica language on the OpenModelica. By using the, modeling method, one can establish traffic flow network models with any topology structure. Two simulation examples show the effectiveness of the proposed modeling method.

This paper applies a simulation approach to the improved design of cross-border operations within the context of end-to-end trade corridor management. The high levels of inefficiency that currently characterize most African border posts is presented as use case; long cross-border delays are shown to result from conflicting objective of different stakeholders and lack of integration between the systems and processes of independent participants. The results of empirical studies were used to identify the most important contributing factors to cross border delays. A state flow diagram that represents the critical cross-border processes was constructed to capture the logical interactions between participants, systems and processes. This was converted into a Simio-based discrete process simulator that accurately describes the reality of typical African cross-border processes. The simulator was applied to determine the beneficial impact of various potential remedies to cross-border inefficiencies, including the use of RFID to support a Green Lanes concept and the interchange of information to allow the dynamic scheduling of customs processing capacity. The results of the simulations show that cross-border delays can be reduced by more than 80% through the implementation of a combination of the proposed system and operational changes.

Traffic density is a key traffic variable that can be used to characterize the traffic system and can be a valuable input to the functional areas of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, measurement of density in the field is difficult due to several practical limitations. This creates a need for inferring density from other traffic variables that are easily measurable in the field. In this paper, model based approaches for the estimation of traffic density are discussed. The non-linear model equations are based on the conservation principle and the fundamental traffic flow. The technique used for recursive estimation of density in real time plays a key role in terms of estimation accuracy. The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a common tool for recursive estimation for nonlinear systems. This study investigates the application of particle filter (PF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) as alternatives to (EKF) for nonlinear traffic state estimation in the context of traffic conditions in India. The estimated density values were corroborated using manually extracted field density values. The performance of these methods was also compared with a base model, where the fundamental traffic flow equation was used for calculating density. The convergence properties of these filters were also analyzed.

As a result of this process, previously planned roads and intersections that were designed according to some optimality criteria at the time, turn out to be suboptimal when traffic conditions change. This paper presents a method that can be used in order to identify intersections whose capacity is no longer in correspondence with the demand of vehicles on them and the choices agent make at those locations. Using real data from a survey describing the travel patterns of people in the city of Singapore we are able to model the routing choices of commuters and simulate the traffic demands on the road network. After calculating the turning probabilities on every intersection we are able to compare the traffic demand for every turn with the planned physical roads' capabilities. Furthermore we define a measure, which quantifies the deviation of the whole road network from the ideal demand-calculated values. We use these measures to evaluate the temporal and spatial profile of the mismatch between the roads and the demand for them. The measure is designed such that it is universal in nature and invariant to the absolute values of the traffic flows in the city. It can, therefore, be used to compare the proper utilisation of road networks among different cities.

A model of a mixed traffic stream comprised of conventional and advanced vehicles was built upon a microscopic single lane urban traffic simulator that we have previously developed, calibrated and validated. Through number of parallel simulations of real and mixed traffic stream and analysis of the obtained results, we have evaluated the impact that certain presence rates of adaptive stop&go cruise control equipped vehicles in the mixed traffic stream have on the traffic flow, travel time, energy demand and emission. Furthermore, the comparison of the results leads towards some interesting conclusions which may serve as a base for further tuning of several aspects related to mixed traffic in urban environment.

We propose the virtual platooning concept to ensure a smooth, efficient and safe traffic flow through an automated intersection. The virtual platoon is formed by defining a virtual inter-vehicle distance between vehicles driving on different lanes. Such distance is employed by a Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) system which, in turn, generates the required safe "gaps" for the vehicles to cross the intersection. A simulation study demonstrates the functionality of the presented methodology, which is referred to as Cooperative Intersection Control (CIC).

Development and implementation of safety-relevant functions require prospective, quantitative assessment of their traffic safety impacts. Both benefits and risks can be quantified using simulation-based virtual experimental techniques. To this end, traffic phenomena are modeled taking into account key safety-relevant processes and "stochastic" simulation is performed on large, representative virtual samples. The virtual representations of traffic phenomena are based on detailed, stochastic models of drivers, vehicles, traffic flow, and the road environment, together with their interactions. The models incorporate knowledge from FOT, NDS, laboratory and driving simulator experiments, and other sources. Large-scale, comprehensive simulations could help in identifying and evaluating the relevant situations in which automated driving impacts traffic safety. The goal is a standardized harmonized methodology, agreed upon by all stakeholders, for holistic assessment of the impact of new driver assistance or automatic driving functions on traffic safety.

Real time knowledge of drivers' behaviour can be useful to a wide range of applications, such as driving assistance in traffic situations identified as critical, detection of tiredness levels or identification of drivers for insurance purposes. In situations where drivers only interact with other vehicles, for instance on highways, the drivers' behaviours can be modelled through microscopic car following models. Those models are known to be able to capture the physical features of traffic flow, while accurately describing specific drivers' behaviour via behavioural parameters. A lot of research to date has focused on fitting the parameters of these models to real trajectory datasets using off-line techniques, with the objective to reproduce drivers variability in simulation. However very little has been published on online parameter estimation of car-following models. This paper investigates how in-vehicle sensors could help estimate car-following behavioural parameters. The focus is on the Intelligent Driver Model. A discussion of the sensitivity of the estimation is provided in light of previous work, and it is argued that, depending on the traffic state, not all the parameters need to be calibrated. An extended Kalman filter with physical inequality constraints on the behavioural parameters is then formulated for the class of time continuous car-following models. The filter exhibits systematic convergence for real trajectories of leaders and synthetic-simulated- trajectories of followers, for randomly picked parameters within the physical bounds, and for fixed and dynamic observation time steps ranging from 0.1 s up to 1 s. This demonstrates that online parameter estimation of behavioural parameters has great potential.

The approach is a novel one and is based on the introduction of a relaxation term that satisfies the time/space-gap principle of ACC or CACC systems. The relaxation time is assigned on multiple leading vehicles in the CACC case; whereas in the ACC case this relaxation time is only assigned to the direct leading vehicle. Numerical simulations investigate the effect of ACC and CACC to traffic flow macroscopic stability with respect to perturbations introduced in a ring road and to flow characteristics in open freeways with merging flows at an on-ramp. Following from the results, it can be deduced that CACC vehicles increase the stabilization of traffic flow, compared to ACC ones. Further, the proposed CACC approach can further improve the dynamic equilibrium capacity and traffic dynamics, especially at on-ramp bottlenecks.

The algorithm is based on the Discontinuous Galerkin Method and Minimax Estimation, and is applied to a macroscopic model based on a scalar conservation law. We present numerical results which demonstrate the shock-capturing capability of the algorithm under high uncertainty in the initial traffic condition, using only sparse measurements, and under time-dependent boundary conditions. The latter makes it possible for estimation to be performed on merge/diverge sections, allowing the possibility of the deployment of the algorithm to road networks.

In many parts of the world where this research has been conducted, detailed maps of the streets and the precise locations of the traffic lights are publicly available. Continued timing research has recently been further spurred by the increasing ubiquity of personal cell-phone based GPS systems. Through their use, an enormous amount of travel tracks have been amassed thus providing an easy source of real traffic data. Nonetheless, one fundamental piece of information remains absent that limits the quantification of the benefits of new approaches: the existing traffic light schedules and traffic light response behaviors. Unfortunately, deployed traffic light schedules are often not known. Rarely are they kept in a central database, and even when they are, they are often not easily obtainable. The alternative, manual inspection of a system of multiple traffic lights may be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming for many experimenters. Without the existing light schedules, it is difficult to ascertain the real-improvements that new traffic light algorithms and approaches will have especially on traffic patterns that have not yet been encountered in the collected data. To alleviate this problem, we present an approach to estimating existing traffic light schedules based on collected GPS-travel tracks. We present numerous ways to test the results and comprehensively demonstrate them on both synthetic and real data. One of the many uses, beyond studying the effects of existing lights in previously unencountered traffic flow environments, is to serve as a realistic baseline for light timing and schedule optimization studies.

The lane-changing terms, simulating lane-changes due to vehicle interactions as well as spontaneous ones, are introduced as source and sink terms into the traffic flow equations. The numerical integration is based on an accurate and robust high-resolution finite volume relaxation scheme, where the nonlinear system of the macroscopic partial differential equations are first recast to a diagonilizable semi-linear system. A fifth order in space WENO scheme is used for spatial discretization, while time integration is based on a high-order implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta method. Numerical simulations, considering a two-lane highway flow where a bottleneck is formed due to a lane closure, demonstrate the ability of the proposed methodology to efficiently simulate the corresponding traffic dynamics.

Nearest neighbor based nonparametric regression method is a classic data-driven method for traffic flow prediction. Modern data collection technologies provide the opportunity to represent various features of the nonlinear complex system which also bring challenges to fuse the multiple sources of data. Firstly, the classic Euclidean distance metric based models for traffic flow prediction that treat each feature with equal weight is not effective in multi source high-dimension feature space. Secondly, traditional hand-crafting feature engineering by experts is tedious and error prone. Thirdly, the traffic conditions in real-life situation are too complex to measure with only one distance metric. In this paper, we propose a hybrid multi-metric based k-nearest neighbor method (HMMKNN) for traffic flow prediction which can seize the intrinsic features in data and reduce the semantic gap between domain knowledge and handcrafted feature engineering. Experimental results demonstrate multi-source data fusion helps to improve the performance of traffic parameter prediction and HMMKNN outperforms the traditional Euclidean-based k-NN under various configurations. Furthermore, visualization of feature transformation clustering results implies the learned metrics are more reasonable.

Snow on urban roads disturbs traveling of vehicles as a huge amount of snow is piled up on roadsides, which often obstructs smooth driving. In this paper, we propose a novel method to predict the speed of vehicles on each road segment in snowy cities. This estimation is helpful for urban traffic planning of local government or trip planning of residents. We collect weather information such as the highest temperature, daylight hours, snow depth and snowfall of the previous day and current new snowfall and vehicular traffic data of each road segment obtained from floating car data such as the average speed in summer and the speed of the previous day. We have built a speed model of vehicles for each road segment in snowy conditions as a linear combination of those factors. Then we enumerate multiple factors which might have some influence on vehicle speed in snowy conditions and have derived their weights by using multiple regression analysis. We have applied the proposed method to major road segments in Sapporo City, Japan and derived multiple regression functions using real weather information and vehicular traffic data. We have shown that our proposed model can predict the speed deceleration for seven days with small errors.

Recently IT strategy for phase split is proposed with anticipation of traffic demands since traffic flows are repetitive with certain variations on working days. The offset is designed to initialize the stating time of junctions such that "green wave" are generated to allow more possible vehicles driving through junctions without stopping by red signals. Traffic flow histograms collected at upstream links are exploited here to estimate downstream queued vehicles. The objective is to minimize the number of queued vehicles for two-way links between neighbouring junctions. It is a decentralized strategy and converges to steady states via iterative actions. IT strategies for phase split and offset are integrated iteratively to generate better traffic signal schedules. Real traffic conditions in Singapore are emulated with real traffic variations on working days. Simulations results show that delay time and number of stops under IT strategies for phase split and offset outperform IT strategy for phase split only and fixed-time strategy.

Ensuring that vehicles coordinate safely while improving efficiency is, however, a very challenging problem as it depends on (i) the characteristics of individual vehicles (vehicle physics, sensors), (ii) unreliable wireless communication, and (iii) driving behaviour at a microscopic level, and their compounded effects at scale. The presence of non-communicative, non-automated vehicles must also be considered. Designing and evaluating coordination protocols requires a scalable simulation framework that is accurate both microscopically (to assess safety) and macroscopically (to evaluate efficiency). Standard car-following models, where position and velocity are dictated by local input stimuli, produce sometimes unrealistic behaviour when laterally changing position, and lack support for additional inputs. Furthermore, conventional environments used to model traffic flow are either too fine-grained to scale or too coarse to appropriately simulate control logic. This paper introduces RoundaSim consisting of (i) a traffic simulator using a novel approach of mixed discrete-continuous modes of time, and (ii) a framework for implementing car following models that supports lane-changing and coordination protocols, with additional inputs from advanced sensors and wireless communications. We show how our framework can be used to implement and evaluate a car-following model with lane changes and validate that the traffic flow achieved approximates that of real-world highways. This allows our platform to be used as a baseline for evaluating the safety and efficiency of coordination protocols.

The approach is based on the realistic assumption that the average speed of conventional vehicles is roughly equal to the average speed of connected vehicles, and consequently, it can be obtained at the (local or central) traffic monitoring and control unit from connected vehicles' reports. Thus, complete traffic state estimation (for arbitrarily selected segments in the network) may be achieved by estimating the total density of vehicles. Recasting the dynamics of the total density of vehicles, which are described by the well-known conservation law equation, as a linear time-varying system, we employ a Kalman filter for the estimation of the total density. We demonstrate the fact that the developed approach allows a variety of different measurement configurations, by also considering the case in which additional mainstream total flow measurements are employed to replace a corresponding number of total flow measurements at on-ramps or off-ramps. We validate the performance of the developed estimation scheme through simulations using a well-known second-order traffic flow model as ground truth for the traffic state.

Given the installation and maintenance costs of such detectors is high, many transportation agencies are shifting to probe vehicle based traffic data. However, estimating traffic flow rates from probe vehicle data remains critical. This paper attempts to estimate traffic flow rates by utilizing a well-calibrated fundamental diagram in combination with the traffic speed information obtained from the probe vehicle. Different single-regime fundamental diagrams and aggregation intervals of the probe vehicle data are investigated in search of the combination that provides the most accurate estimate of flow rates. The results suggest that flow rates are best estimated by using fundamental diagram developed by Van Aerde. Moreover, estimates of flow rates during congested periods are found to be more accurate than free-flow periods.

For simplicity to find an analytical solution, we start with a grid structured road network. The goal is to find a traffic distribution over the road network such that the total average time of travel from source to sink is minimized. The theoretical result obtained was verified using linear programming problem solving tool in MATLAB.

Considering the sensitivity of the estimation results to the parameters of the model and avoiding the effects of the use of preset fixed model parameters effect on the estimation accuracy, a self-adaptive adjustment strategy for model parameters under the influence of traffic state is proposed through considering the relationship between free-flow speed and traffic state (V/C). The measured results show that the traffic parameter estimation based on hybrid particle filter that is able to quickly identify the obvious fluctuations of traffic volume and speed in normal and accident traffic conditions has a higher accuracy and stability than the kalman filter. Meanwhile, the self-adaptive adjustment strategy of model parameter under the influence of traffic conditions had improved the estimation accuracy and achieved better estimation effect even in case of accident.

Traffic flow is simulated by the cell transmission model adopting a two-phase triangular fundamental diagram. Flow dynamics specific to the selected freeway test stretch are used to determine prevailing traffic conditions. The performance of fuzzy c-means clustering is evaluated in two cases, with two assumptions. The procedure fuzzy clustering method follows is systematically dynamic that enables the clustering, and hence partitions, over the fundamental diagram specific to selected temporal resolution. It is seen that clustering simulation with dynamic pattern boundary assumption performs better for almost all the steps of data expansion when considered to simulation with the corresponding static case.

Though there have been extensive studies on reducing congestion due to slowdown, they basically address velocity control of vehicles upstream in the congestion vehicle group. This paper presents a scheme to largely improve the traffic flow to avoid congestion where each vehicle detects the initial state of congestion and alerts all the vehicles running in the whole target area. Upon receiving alert information, a vehicle at the head of the congestion vehicle group and those behind the group perform different velocity control to increase traffic flow. Performance evaluation by simulation using trace data of velocity collected at the highway shows that the proposed scheme improves average velocity by about 50% at maximum compared to the case with no velocity control is applied.

Under critical traffic conditions, the merging of main road traffic and on-ramp traffic is known to trigger speed breakdown and congestion. Additionally, merging is one of the most stressful tasks for the driver, since it requires a synchronized set of observations and actions. Consequently, drivers often perform merging maneuvers with low efficiency. Emerging vehicle technologies, such as cooperative adaptive cruise control and/or merging-assistance systems, are expected to enable the so-called "cooperative merging". The purpose of this work is to propose a cooperative merging system and evaluate its performance and its impact on highway capacity. The modeling and simulation of the proposed methodology is performed within the framework of a microscopic traffic simulator. The proposed model allows for the vehicle-to infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, which enables the effective handling of the available gaps between vehicles. Different cases are examined through simulations, in order to assess the impact of the system on traffic flow, under various traffic conditions. Useful conclusions are derived from the simulation results, which can form the basis for more complex merging algorithms and/or strategies that adapt to traffic conditions.

The aim of introducing a CARBOTRAF system is to reduce BC and CO2 emissions and improve air quality by optimising the traffic flows. A chain of models combines microscopic traffic simulations, emission models and air quality simulations for a range of traffic demand levels and intelligent transport system (ITS) actions. These ITS scenarios simulate combinations of traffic signal optimisation plans and variable messaging systems. The real-time decision support system uses these simulations to select the best traffic management in terms of traffic and air quality. In this paper the modelled effects of ITS measures on air quality are analysed with a focus on BC for urban areas in two European cities, Graz and Glasgow.

The model is chosen as simple as possible such as a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Traffic flow can be classified into two-states and switching between two states controlled by first-order Markov chain with a certain probability. The model is characterized by several Gaussian parameters and estimated by using Expectation-Maximization (EM) technique. Actual traffic flow data on City of Jakarta and Bandung is used to model through EM estimation parameter and to validate the results by using particle filter. The results confirm that the proposed model gives satisfactory results which capture the variation of traffic flow. This work is easily extended to Jump Markov Model as a more general model especially relating to the development of traffic control design based upon queue length.

Road congestion can be predicted by analyzing traffic flow data collected by various data acquisition equipment primarily. However, existing methods not only need to store large amount of historical information, but has not enough suitability for large-scaled and changing traffic flows. Therefore, an online prediction method based on Random Forest (RF) is put forward in this paper and the prediction on congestions is made by real-time data instead of digging the historical data. Simulation and experiment results show that the design presented in this paper improves accuracy of predictions and it has a certain use value.

However, they decrease the traffic flow fluency because of the queuing delay at each road intersection. In order to improve the traffic efficiency all over the road network, Intelligent Traffic Light Scheduling (ITLS) algorithm has been proposed. In this work, we introduce an ITLS algorithm based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) merging with Machine Learning (ML) algorithm. This algorithm schedules the time phases of each traffic light according to each real-time traffic flow that intends to cross the road intersection, whilst considering next time phases of traffic flow at each intersection by ML. In order to get each next time phases of traffic flow, we use Linear Regression (LR) algorithm as ML algorithm. The introduced algorithm aims to increase traffic fluency by decreasing the total waiting delay of all traveling vehicles at each road intersection in the road network. We compare the performance of our algorithm with the unimproved one for different simulated data. Results shows that, our algorithm increases the traffic fluency and decreases the waiting delay by 21.5 % compared with the unimproved one.

J	Pessaro, B; Buddenbrock, P				Pessaro, Brian; Buddenbrock, Patrick			Managed Lane Toll Prices Impact of Transportation Demand Management Activities and Toll Exemptions	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								This research involved a simulation that compared 3 days of actual traffic data for the 1-95 Express Lanes and general purpose lanes in Miami, Florida, with a hypothetical scenario in which all transportation demand management (TDM) activities and toll exemptions were eliminated. The purpose of the research was to quantify the extent to which carpooling, vanpooling, and transit use contribute to better traffic flow in the 1-95 corridor. In the hypothetical scenario there was a slight degradation in express lane level of service (LOS) and a slight increase in tolls in the southbound direction. Conversely, there was a slight improvement in express lane LOS and a slight decrease in tolls in the northbound direction. In the hypothetical scenario, many inherently low emission vehicles (DLEVs), which are toll exempt, opted out of the express lanes. The increase in express lane volume from former carpoolers, vanpoolers, and transit riders reverting to single-occupant status was often offset by even larger volumes of ILEVs leaving the express lanes. Although the traffic effect on the express lanes was mild, the effect on the general purpose lanes was more severe. In the hypothetical scenario, the general purpose lanes operated at LOS F 22% more of the time in the southbound direction and 8% more of the time in the northbound direction.

Different from prior work based on empirical data collected decades ago, in this work, we collect a large amount of empirical traffic flow data from five typical overhead road segments during two different time periods recently in Shanghai. Statistical results in a short time scale (i.e., within half an hour) show that the lane-level traffic volumes/vehicles' velocities in the monitored road segments followed truncated Gaussian distribution (with a match rate of roughly 90%) better than Poisson distribution (with a match rate of roughly 80%) which is normally assumed in the literature. Traffic flow characteristic in a long time scale (i.e., in a day or a week) is also presented, which shows that the traffic density in the night and daytime are very different, however, the traffic flow density in the daytime stays high. With the obtained traffic flow characteristics, we discuss the possibility of the coexistence of WAVE and WLAN in 5.9G band according to the Federal Communications Commission's intention, and point out that for areas in the vicinity of a overhead road inside Outer Ring road in Shanghai, it is not practical for WLAN devices to operate on 5.9G WAVE band.

However, searching the shortest path is difficult as road traffic flows are time-varying. An important issue in searching the shortest path is how to obtain the time expired on each segment at the given time. To this purpose, we propose a hybrid speed model to calculate the travel time in this paper, which considers the difference between the speed in congested and uncongested road networks. And analysis of speed in both conditions are given, respectively. Subsequently, a metric is also proposed to distinguish between congested and uncongested networks. Our work also utilizes the huge traffic data to reflect and analyze the real scenario. Compared to the previous work, this paper considers a more complex urban traffic scenario and some verifications are made with our data. Finally, a numerical study is carried out in the urban road network in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. The results show the hybrid speed model can give travel time prediction in an accurate way and can provide useful information for road designers.

The EV charging market is modeled as the oligopoly. A consumer behavior based approach is applied to forecast the charging demand of the charging stations using a nested logit model. The impacts of both the urban road network and the power grid network on charging station planning are also considered. At each planning stage, the optimal station placement strategy is derived through solving a Bayesian game among the service providers. To investigate the interplay of the travel pattern, the consumer behavior, urban road network, power grid network, and the charging station placement, a simulation platform (The EV Virtual City 1.0) is developed using Java on Repast. We conduct a case study in the San Pedro District of Los Angeles by importing the geographic and demographic data of that region into the platform. The simulation results demonstrate a strong consistency between the charging station placement and the traffic flow of EVs. The results also reveal an interesting phenomenon that service providers prefer clustering instead of spatial separation in this oligopoly market.

The algorithm is based on an adaptive background estimation procedure followed by a background subtraction at every video frame. The vehicle detection is performed through a further mathematical morphology and statistical analysis on the computed connected components. The traffic density has been estimated based on a lower resolution grid superimposed on the scene. In particular, at every subregion the number of the detected vehicles is calculated and the density is then estimated for the entire road network at every frame. The developed algorithm has been quantitatively evaluated. The quite promising results indicate the potentials of the proposed approach, while parallel gpu implementations can allow for real-time performance.

In addition, the paper tries to explore a more rational traffic rule to reach a better balance between traffic flow and safety. To address the problem, we develop a two-lane cellular automaton model. In our model, we divide the vehicles into two categories according to their willingness to overtake and emphasize on the overtaking behavior of the vehicles based on the Keep-Right-Except-To-Pass rule. To test the rule, we check the relation between traffic density and traffic flow. And we find adopting the rule can raise the traffic flow by an average of 21.4% in light traffic and 24.8% in high traffic compared to not allowing overtaking. This means this rule of overtaking can improve the efficiency of traffic. Moreover, we develop our own Convert-Only-Once rule on the basis of our model. And simulation proves that compared to the Keep-Right-Except-To-Pass rule, our new rule can boost the traffic flow by 14.3% and enhance the safety index K by 1.2%. Furthermore, we analyze the influence of the Coriolis force on our model when we adjust our model to the situation of driving on the left. In order to fit our model into an intelligent system, we exclude the influence of willingness to overtake and make some adjustment to a certain parameters. And the conclusion is similar, Convert-Only-Once rule can still hold 8.4% more traffic flow than the Keep-Right-Except-To-Pass rule.

The proposed framework links the power system with transportation system through the charging navigation of EVs. It benefits the two systems by attracting EVs to charge at offpeak hours and saving the time of EV owners with real-time navigation. Based on the formulated framework, a noncooperative game approach is proposed in this study to model the competition between electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). The simulation results show that the proposed integrated charging navigation approach is effective in improving both the reliability and economic profits of the power system.

In order to improve the accuracy in dynamic estimates of the sector capacity, a combined SOM and K-means method of clustering is proposed for the estimates in this paper. Firstly, the traffic flow data in term of the number of aircrafts within a time interval and a specific sector are acquired by using the outputs of the surveillance radar. The data are refreshed by sliding a window. The traffic flow data are then clustered by using the combined SOM and K-means method. The clustered results are compared with the results obtained by using the pure K-means method. The clustered results with high accuracy are suggested to be used. The sector capacity for each pattern is hence obtained by calculating the maximum flow for each sector. In the similar way, the late-coming data are matched with the patterns. The dynamic estimates of the sector capacity are hence completed. Using the real radar data we have performed the dynamic estimates of the sector capacity by following the above processes. The results show that the combined SOM and K-means method is efficient in the dynamic estimates of the sector capacity and may be useful for air traffic management.

DETERMINATION OF PASSENGER-TRAFFIC FLOWS IN REGIONAL TRANSPORT SYSTEM ON THE BASIS OF MODIFIED GRAVITY MODELS	SCIENCE & TECHNIQUE			Russian	Article						transportation demand; passenger flow forecasting; correspondence estimation; vehicle route modeling		The paper considers a transportation system of one poorly developed region of the Eastern Siberia where it is planned to make investments for improvement of the corresponding infrastructure. The efficient investment disbursement presupposes study of the existing demand for transport services in the field of passenger traffic. Results of the observations can be used for development planning of a road network and a bus service system. Due to lack of direct data on the existing demand efforts have been made to obtain its model description while using modified gravity models that make it possible to estimate volumes of population transportation which is carried out between residential areas by public transport buses and private vehicles. The given models have permitted to make analysis of more than 5000 populated locality pairs for 86 residential areas where the population constitutes more than 80 % and its passenger flow formation component in equal to 60%. Traffic flows between these settlement pairs have been estimated with the help of gravity models with various attraction functions and Arrowsmith method for provision of transportation balances. The most adequate results have been obtained while using an exponential attraction function for individual vehicles and a power attraction function for passenger route auto transport. Such approach is consistent with the preference of the route auto transport in case of long-distance transport service. A tree-like structure of the existing traffic system has given the possibility to avoid consideration of alternative routes in case of passenger transportation and directly calculate transport flows for certain road sections. Comparative analysis of the transport flows using the proposed methodology and the existing partial data of the executed observations reveals satisfactory coincidence of empirical data for the main part of the traffic system. The obtained results demonstrate an efficiency of the described approach and the presented data can be used as a benchmarking tool for transport planning.	[Nurminskiy, E.

ACCIDENT PREDICTION METHODOLOGY USING CONFLICT ZONE METHOD FOR "TRANSIT TRANSPORT - PEDESTRIAN" CONFLICT SITUATION AND MODELS OF TRAFFIC FLOWS AT CONTROLLED INTERSECTION	SCIENCE & TECHNIQUE			Russian	Article						"transit transport - pedestrian" conflict; potential danger; accident prediction; conflict zones		Accidents are considered as the most significant cost of road traffic. Therefore any measures for road traffic management should be evaluated according to a minimization criterion of accident losses. In order to develop a method for evaluation of the accident losses it is necessary to prepare a methodology for cost estimate of road accidents of various severity with due account of their consequences and prediction (economic assessment) and severity level of their consequences (quantitative risk assessment). The research has been carried with the purpose to devise appropriate models for accident prediction at a decision-making stage while organizing road traffic in respect of the "transport - pedestrian" conflict. An interaction of pedestrian and transit road traffic flows is characterized by rather high risk level. In order to reduce number of road accidents and severity of their consequences in the observed conflict, it is necessary to evaluate proposed solutions, in other words to predict accidents at the stage of object designing and development of measures. The paper presents its observations on specificity of road traffic and pedestrian flow interactions and analysis of spatial conflict point formation and conflict zone creation in the studied conflict between transport facilities and pedestrians at controlled pedestrian crossings which are located in the area of intersections. Methodology has been developed for accident prediction in accordance with the conflict zone method for various traffic modes at intersections. Dependences of the represented road traffic accidents (according to consequence severity) on potential danger of conflicts have been determined for various traffic modes and various conditions of conflict interaction.

J	Li, ZB; Ye, M; Li, Z; Du, MQ				Li, Zhibin; Ye, Mao; Li, Zheng; Du, Muqing			Some Operational Features in Bicycle Traffic Flow Observational Study	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								This study investigated the operational features in bicycle traffic flow on bicycle-only paths. A field investigation was conducted on four bicycle only paths in the vicinity of bottlenecks in the city of Nanjing, China; two were one-lane paths and two were two-lane paths. The cumulative curve method was used to extract from videos traffic flow information, such as bicycle speeds, flow, and density. The fundamental diagram with free-flow and congested traffic state was constructed with the use of actual traffic data. Data analysis showed that the capacity of bicycle traffic flow on the one-lane and two-lane paths was 3,960 bicycles per hour and 8,100 bicycles per hour, respectively. The critical density was approximately 100 bicycles per kilometer per lane. Average bicycle speed and speed variation decreased as bicycle density increased. The probability of overtaking was highest when bicycle traffic was slightly congested. The observational study showed that even when average speed was quite low, bicycle traffic could still maintain a relatively large flow. This differed from the results of simulation studies. The findings of this study can help traffic engineers better understand the features of bicycle traffic flow and propose measures to improve bicycle operations.

The responses of users must include route, departure time, and mode choices. To capture the effects of these decisions, this paper lays out a framework for the integration of the relevant elements of an activity-based model (ABM) with a dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) model and a simulation framework to support the analysis and evaluation of various pricing schemes. In this paper, a multicriterion dynamic user equilibrium traffic assignment model is used; the model explicitly considers heterogeneous users who seek to minimize travel time, out-of-pocket cost, and travel time reliability in the underlying route choice framework. In addition to the methodological developments, various demand and supply parameters are estimated and calibrated for the selected application network (the Greater Chicago, Illinois, network). This paper showcases the integration of ABM components and a DTA in one coherent modeling framework for the implementation and evaluation of congestion pricing in an actual large-scale network.

The connection between the microscopic and macroscopic scales is often done via empirical relationships such as the fundamental diagram for macroscopic models, relating traffic flow or average velocity and traffic density. In this paper, we consider a microscopic model consisting of a large number of rational, utility-maximizing drivers interacting on a single road. We then use the theory of Mean Field Games (MFG) to deduce a macroscopic model of traffic density emerging from these interactions. We show how to determine a microscopic utility function for the drivers compatible with standard empirical macroscopic fundamental diagrams. In addition to connecting the microscopic and macroscopic models analytically rather than empirically, our approach can offer additional flexibility to model drivers at the macroscopic level, using a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation coupled with the standard conservation law for the vehicles.

This control scheme aims at stabilising the accumulation of vehicles of the so-called network fundamental diagram near critical accumulation to achieve maximum network throughput. Nevertheless, the maximum throughput in urban road networks may be observed over a range of accumulation-values. In this work, an adaptive perimeter flow control strategy is proposed that allows the automatic monitoring of the critical accumulation to help maintain the accumulation near the optimal range of accumulation-values, while network's throughput is maximised. To this end, we design a Kalman filter-based estimation scheme that utilises real-time measurements of circulating flow and accumulation of vehicles to produce estimates of the currently prevailing critical accumulation. We use real data from an urban area with 70 sensors and show that the area exhibits a network fundamental diagram with low scatter. We demonstrate that the fundamental diagram is reproduced under different days but its shape and critical occupancy depend on the applied semi-real-time signal control and the distribution of congestion in the network. Results from the application of the estimation algorithm to the experimental data indicate good estimation accuracy and performance, and rapid tracking behaviour.

The paper proposes the extension of the control design with local traffic information in such a way that a balance between the designed speed and the traffic flow is guaranteed. A method has been elaborated for the design of a decision algorithm for lane-change maneuvers based on the consideration of surrounding vehicles. The method is illustrated through a complex simulation example based on the CarSim software.

S	Chu, TS; Wang, J			IEEE	Chu, Tianshu; Wang, Jie			Traffic Signal Control with Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams	2015 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ACC)	Proceedings of the American Control Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	American Control Conference	JUL 01-03, 2015	Chicago, IL	Amer Automat Control Council, IFAC, Adaptics Inc, Altair, dSPACE, Eaton Corp, Elsevier, Int Journal Automat & Comp, Journal Franklin Inst, Plexim Inc, Soc Ind & Appl Math, Springer, CRC Press Taylor & Francis Grp Cogent OA, United Technologies Res Ctr, Wiley, Boeing, Ford Motor Co, GE Global Res, Honeywell, MathWorks, Mitsubishi Elect Res Lab, Quanser				The recent breakthrough finding of macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) establishes the foundation of macroscopic analysis in urban transportation studies. However, the implementation of MFD for traffic signal control remains challenging. This is because the compact network-wide information provided by MFD is insufficient for searching for the optimal microscopic control policy. In this paper, rather than implementing only MFD, we integrate MFD into our microscopic urban traffic flow model to constrain the searching space of control policies. This approach is able to maximize the contribution of MFD, without losing microscopic information in the control model. Specifically, we first build a traffic flow model and introduce the stochastic driver behaviors by a turning matrix. We then implement the approximate Q-learning with restricted control to reduce the computational cost of the large-scale stochastic control problem. Here, the information of MFD is used to design both the heuristic regularization term in the stage cost and the state-based feature vector of the approximate Q-function. By this approximate Q-learning algorithm, the traffic density distribution of the network tends to become homogenous, with the mean value around the optimal density of the MFD. The numerical experiments demonstrate that compared to a fixed policy, our policy could efficiently make a heterogeneous network more homogeneous, and thus guarantee a more robust shape of the MFD. Furthermore, our policy has a better performance on trip completion flow maximization compared to either a fixed or a greedy policy, since it can achieve the optimal density in the MFD.

J	Calvi, A; Bella, F; D'Amico, F				Calvi, Alessandro; Bella, Francesco; D'Amico, Fabrizio			Diverging Driver Performance Along Deceleration Lanes Driving Simulator Study	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							SAFETY; MODELS	Highway diverge areas are often characterized by high crash rates. Worldwide, geometric design guidelines propose deceleration lanes with a parallel or tapered layout to promote a free-vehicle condition, while the guidelines neglect the potential effects of traffic flow and risky driving behaviors that are induced by the wrong perceptions of road geometry and vehicle interference. A driving simulation study was conducted to analyze the effects of traffic flow and deceleration lane geometry on the driving performance of diverging drivers. Two types of deceleration lanes (parallel and tapered) were implemented in a simulator, and two traffic conditions (low and high traffic flows) were simulated for each type of lane. Thirty-one drivers took part in the experiments. The effects of traffic flow on driving performance while drivers approached the diverge area and during their deceleration were investigated. The study found that lane type significantly affected the speeds of diverging drivers, independent of traffic conditions, with greater interference with the through traffic on the tapered lane. Traffic conditions were found to influence the driver's trajectory along the tapered lane, and this trajectory delayed the exiting maneuver under heavy traffic conditions. This effect was not found to have been significant for parallel deceleration lanes on which the deceleration rates were significantly affected by traffic conditions: higher decelerations were recorded under light traffic conditions. No significant traffic effects on deceleration rates were found on the tapered lane.

J	Liu, P; Mu, D				Liu, Pei; Mu, Dong			Evaluating Sustainability of Truck Weight Regulations: A System Dynamics View	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-JIEM			English	Article						overweight transportation; sustainability; freight transportation; system dynamics	MODEL MARS; LAND-USE; TRANSPORT	Purpose: Targeting the problem of overloaded trucking regarding the Highway Transportation of iron ore from Caofeidian to Tangshan (HTCT), this paper aims to assess the long-term effects of alternative Truck Weight Regulation (TWR) policies on the sustainability of the HTCT. Design/methodology/approach: This paper develops a model for policy evaluation using System Dynamics (SD). The model, comprising six interrelated modules, is capable of simulating the effects of TWR policies on trucking issues, such as freight flow, truck traffic flow, pavement performance, highway transport capacity and trucking time. The model further sheds light on the Cumulative Economic Cost (CEC), including the transport cost and time cost of freight owners, and the Cumulative Social Cost (CSC), including the pavement maintenance cost, greenhouse gas emission cost, atmospheric pollutants emission cost and traffic accidents cost, so the effects of TWR policies on the sustainability of the HTCT could be evaluated. Findings: According to the different values of the overload ratio that are allowed by policy, alternative TWR policies are classified into three types, which are The Rigid Policy (TRP), The Moderate Policy (TMP) and The Tolerant Policy (TTP). The results show that the best policy for the sustainability of the HTCT depends on the relative importance of CSC, which is expected by the local government. To be specific, (1) if CSC is considered to be much less important than CEC, the local government should continue implementing TTP with the maximum overload ratio; (2) if CSC is considered to be much more important than CEC, then TRP is recommended; and (3) if CSC is considered to be slightly more important than CEC, TMP with an overload ratio of 80% is best. Practical implications: The conclusions of this paper may help the local government design appropriate TWR policies to achieve the sustainability of the HTCT. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to evaluate TWR policies on the sustainability of the highway freight system based on SD.

We analyzed the travel time for 12 hours per day for 5 consecutive months. The collected data are posted by Google maps, which are collected using hypertext transfer protocol requests. This paper provides a construction of the Holt-Winters forecasting model that streamlines the estimation of travel time for a specific hour of the day. The Holt-Winters model with exponential smoothing average has the best estimate of travel time. The model goodness of fit for the data collected at 07: 00AM shows that the multiplicative Holt-Winters model has the best performance (mean square error 15.733 with R-2 value of 0.8435). A fleet driver can use the results to decide to travel at a given hour. Moreover, decision makers can use the results to plan for road events.

Next, we use a dimension reduction method based on principal components analysis to describe the spatio-temporal distribution of traffic flow condition in subgraphs. A short-term (up to 1 h) traffic flow prediction in each subgraph is calculated by an adaptive linear combination of elementary predictions. In this paper, the elementary predictions are Box-Jenkins time-series models, support vector regression, and the method of potential functions.

Hence, the main objective of this study is to develop a general and flexible prediction model that simulates the freeway system as it responds to traffic state transition. To this end, a spatial-temporal-based model without the prior need for off-line parameter calibration is proposed for traffic flow prediction. The model predicts flow rates at a given freeway network based on contributions from their recent temporal profiles as well as the spatial contributions from neighbouring sites. An in-depth investigation of the variables pertinent to traffic flow prediction is conducted to examine the extent of the temporal and spatial contributions and their effects on prediction accuracy. The predictions of the proposed models have been compared with the field-measured flow rates, and show that the results predicted by the proposed model are quite close to the measurement values for all the investigated sites. The benefit from full-spatial contribution as opposed to no contribution at all (ARIMA model) is evident in all investigated sites, and the accuracy can be improved by 5% as an average. Compared with the linear regression model with only spatial contributions, the average prediction error of the proposed model is 9% lower. Through comparison, the result shows that the temporal input factor provides more accurate information to the flow rate prediction, but it can hardly track the flow rate drops during the congestion. During the flow rate drops, the spatial input factor would secure the prediction accuracy.

Exploring peculiarities of traffic flows with a viscoelastic model	TRANSPORTMETRICA A-TRANSPORT SCIENCE			English	Article						viscoelastic traffic model; ramp flow effect; relaxation time; elasticity	WAVES	In this paper, a visco-elastic traffic flow model is described and applied to explore peculiarities of traffic flows on a loop road with ramp effects numerically. Based on different expressions for traffic pressure, sound speed and relaxation time, the viscoelastic model is derived from mass and momentum conservations and a linear viscoelastic constitutive relation. Numerical simulations of loop traffic flows have been carried out, with the ramp flow rate being assumed to be randomly dependent on the local main flow at the intersection. The results revealed that the on-ramp effect can cause the occurrence of traffic shock waves, the off-ramp effect can lead to the decrease of traffic density on the loop road. The viscoelastic effect does cause the significant changes of traffic flow pattern, indicating that self-organisation of loop traffic is a crucial impacting feature.	[Bogdanova, A.; Smirnova, M.

SPFs are fundamental to procedures in the Highway Safety Manual (HSM) and Safety Analyst, both of which require calibration of the SPFs to local conditions. In the case of infrastructure in which the traffic flow is physically divided, such as motorways, there are two different methods to calibrate an SPF; one is based on a consideration of two directional segments, the other one is based on monodirectional segments with a correction factor that takes into account the presence of two directional traffic, as proposed by Safety Analyst. In the first case, traffic flows are the sum of traffic flows for each direction. The two methods give a different calibration factor for local condition, i.e., different performance in terms of goodness of fit and SPF transferability. This paper seeks to address these differences by investigating the two approaches to estimate crash count using a motorway sample data from Italy and focusing on a comparison in terms of model transferability. Furthermore two different SPFs were calibrated on the same data using the two different functional equation form, to evaluate the goodness of fit of the two different traffic based segmentation. The goodness of fit of the models is investigated using CURE plots and the R-2 values. The four sets of models give good results in terms of goodness of fit but they have different values for the calibration factor. The calibration factor of the calibrated monodirectional model is closer to a value of one, suggesting a better goodness of fit on the contrary the HSM model gives the better performance in terms of transfer ability where crash data are not available.

The approach divides the weaving segment into weaving lanes and nonweaving lanes to reduce the disturbance between weaving and nonweaving traffic streams. The proposed DLA strategy is optimized by nonlinear integer programming under various on-ramp traffic volumes and weaving volume ratios. The applicability of DLA is tested with numerical experiments under different weave types, traffic flow rates, weaving volume ratios, and segment lengths. A VISSIM microsimulation model was developed and used to evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy. Test results drawn from the numerical experiments and simulation indicate that the proposed DLA approach is applicable when the main-line weaving volume ratio is relatively low and it can increase the capacity and decrease the traffic delay for the weaving and upstream segments.

Frank			Estimation of Statewide Origin-Destination Truck Flows from Large Streams of GPS Data Application for Florida Statewide Model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								This paper demonstrates the use of large streams of truck GPS data from the American Transportation Research Institute for the estimation of statewide freight truck flows in Florida. Raw GPS data streams, which comprised more than 145 million GPS records, were used to derive a database of more than 1 2 million truck trips that started or ended in Florida. The paper sheds light on the extent to which the trips derived from the GPS data captured the observed truck traffic flows in Florida. The paper includes insights into (a) the truck type composition, (b) the proportion of the observed truck traffic flows covered by the data, and (c) the geographical differences in the coverage. The paper applies origin destination (O-D) matrix estimation to combine the GPS data with the observed truck traffic volumes at different locations within and outside Florida to derive an O-D table of truck flows within, into, and out of the state. The procedures, implementation details, and findings discussed in the paper are expected to be useful to agencies that are considering the use of GPS data in freight travel demand modeling.

Analytical Five-Phase Bus Rapid Transit Traffic Flow Model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Bus rapid transit (BRT) systems are becoming increasingly popular in cities worldwide because of their (a) efficiency and reliability advantages over traditional bus service and (b) cost advantages over rail transit systems. As transportation decision makers consider the implementation and planning of BRT systems, it is important that they be able to analyze different operational components of these systems. This paper describes an analytical five-phase BRT traffic flow model that is able to model the movement of a bus throughout an entire BRT corridor and network. The five-phase model includes (a) a queuing model to determine the time a bus spends waiting for access to the loading area, (b) an access time model to determine the time that it takes a bus to access a loading area position from the queue when a loading position becomes available, (c) a nonlinear dwell time model to determine the time that a bus spends at a loading area position, and (d and e) a two-part model of the following behavior of buses between bus stations, dependent on whether there is a bus between the following bus and the approaching station. The five-phase BRT traffic flow model provides a comprehensive modeling framework for a networkwide simulation of a separate right-of-way BRT system. The model builds on research in the areas of car-following (and more recently bus-following) models, dwell time models, and bus station queuing models.

The effects of the urban development can be easily defeated without proper functional, technical and organisational integration of such developments with the existing transport networks. This paper deals with the existing and proposed commercial developments of Skudai town in Johor Bahru as a case study to deduce the corresponding trip rates. In this endeavour, this paper aimed at the following objectives; (i) to estimate the current traffic flow rate; (ii) to estimate the mean trip rate per 100 m(2) of gross floor area (GFA) under commercial land use; (iii) to quantify the impact of additional traffic from the commercial area on the existing road network system in Skudai and finally (iv) To propose an appropriate transport improvement for the road network within the study area. The results obtained predict the additional trips for the horizon year 2015. The transport improvements are suggested under two principal categories of transport-supply adaptation and travel-demand reduction strategies. Although, the study is totally confined to commercial land uses, the assessment framework and the methodology of traffic impact assessment could be used for other major land use types. Knowledge is obtained about trip-rates following commercial developments that community decision makers as well as real estate developers can use to predict the anticipated impacts. Further studies will be required to develop guidelines for city authorities to allow type and intensity of commercial development.

We show that the traffic state estimation plays an important role in traffic prediction and control. Two approaches are presented for the estimation of the main traffic variables (traffic density and mean speed). The state constructors obtained are then used for traffic flow control. Several numerical simulations show very promising results for both traffic state estimation and control.

Fuzzy state transform and Kalman filter (KF) have been applied in this field separately. But the studies show that the former method has good performance on the trend forecasting of traffic state variation but always involves several numerical errors. The latter model is good at numerical forecasting but is deficient in the expression of time hysteretically. This paper proposed an approach that combining fuzzy state transform and KF forecasting model. In considering the advantage of the two models, a weight combination model is proposed. The minimum of the sum forecasting error squared is regarded as a goal in optimizing the combined weight dynamically. Real detection data are used to test the efficiency. Results indicate that the method has a good performance in terms of short-term traffic forecasting.

ESTIMATION OF THE DYNAMIC EFFECT OF VEHICLES ON AN ASPHALT ROAD SURFACE	SCIENTIFIC HERALD OF THE VORONEZH STATE UNIVERSITY OF ARCHITECTURE & CIVIL ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION & ARCHITECTURE			English	Article						dynamic shift; motions; videometers; roadway; asphalt surfacing		Statement of the problem. Determining the status of an asphalt concrete surface of the road is a necessary undertaking in monitoring transport facilities. There are many ways and methods of determining the stress- strain state of the surfacing material, and basically this involves measuring static loading conditions. However, roadway surfaces are mainly affected by traffic, which leads to various distresses asphalt which is not common for a static force. Obviously, by evaluating the resulting distresses in the surfacing, a long-term durability of the roadway can be determined. Results. An experimental technique for determining the dynamic effects of vehicles on the asphalt road surface, allowing random monitoring of its condition and determine the fatigue durabiliy of asphalt concrete surfaces under the actual operating conditions. The field studies were carried out of the evenness of the surfaces in places showing distresses. A correlation between the parameters of the traffic flow and the structure of the distresses on the surfacing was found. Conclusions. The study found that in addition to the well-known and described in the literature of asphalt concrete surfaces distresses, waves and comb, there is also a separate distress which manifests itself as an evenly spaced at an angle to the axis of the road wavelike unevenness formed by the force of moving vehicles on the surfacing. The dynamic force of vehicles on the asphalt road surface can be assessed by measuring the resulting wave.	[Volkov, V.

Wavelet neural network is a preferable method for predicting traffic flow. However, its performance is not satisfactory since it's easy to fall into local optimum. This paper proposed an Error Correction Wavelet Neural Network prediction method (EC-WNN) to predict short-term traffic flow. First, we use Wavelet Neural Network to predict the traffic flow, and build the error prediction model of Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) based on the error series. Then we use the prediction errors to update the prediction results. Finally, the real detected traffic data are used to evaluate the precision of the model, the results show that EC-WNN is superior to traditional WNN in accuracy of prediction.

The mobility force is defined as the interactive force of motorcycle by surrounding vehicles and environment of lane layout. The kinetic behavior of the motorcycle will be induced and constrained by the force created due to the spaces surrounding. The concept is to describe the driving behavior using a series of forces of the attraction and repulsion related to the vehicle and spaces surrounding in front of the motorcycle. The model can describe both of the lateral motion and longitudinal motion in views to the motorcycle driving feature. Through a series of calibration for the parameters of the model, the regression statistical significance and the validation of the model output using the field survey data, the results illustrated the enough accuracy of the result of model output. The model is then verified to be suitable to describe the real motorcycle driving behavior preliminarily.

J	Cao, J; Menendez, M				Cao, Jin; Menendez, Monica			Generalized Effects of On-Street Parking Maneuvers on the Performance of Nearby Signalized Intersections	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							HIGHWAY; WAVES; FLOW	An on-street parking maneuver can often start a temporary bottleneck that leads to additional delay of following vehicles. When the maneuver occurs upstream near a signalized intersection, the scope of the impact can be magnified. In this case, the intersection might be starved for traffic because of the parking maneuver, so a portion of the intersection capacity is wasted. The authors of this paper estimate the reduction in service rate attributable to the delay from an upstream parking maneuver at different locations and provide suggestions for avoiding such a reduction. The perturbation caused by the parking maneuver is calculated from the hydrodynamic theory of traffic flow. By using dimensional analysis, the authors analyze the relationship between background conditions (i.e., traffic volume, traffic saturation condition, signal control settings) time and location of the parking maneuver, and reduction in service rate at the intersection. Combined with a previous study, this research completes an analysis of the effects of parking maneuvers at different locations near a signalized intersection (as both upstream and downstream maneuvers are included). The results show that, generally, for an undersaturated intersection, parking downstream of the intersection causes fewer negative effects on the service rate than does parking upstream. However, for an oversaturated intersection, parking downstream near the intersection might reduce the service rate significantly. These conclusions may help guide parking planning-management under different background conditions and assist the development of parking regulations (such as dynamic parking supply according to real-time traffic conditions).

The paper focuses on the effect of platoon dispersion on proportion of time blocked, conflicting flow rate, and capacity flow rate for the major street left-turn movement at a TWSC intersection. Existing HCM 2010 methodology shows little effect on conflicting flow or capacity for various distances downstream from the signalized intersection. Two methods are suggested for computing the conflicting flow and capacity of minor stream movements at a TWSC intersection that have more desirable properties than the existing HCM method. Further, if the existing HCM 2010 method is retained, results suggest that the upstream signals model be dropped from the HCM method for TWSC intersections.

A German Approach to Freeway Facility Evaluation	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								In the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 (HCM 2010), Chapters 10 to 13 provide the methodology for analyzing freeway facilities in relation to level of service (LOS). Supplemental Chapter 25 contains additional details on the analytical methodology, which is tied to a computer program (FREEVAL) that implements the methodology and computer performance measures for oversaturated conditions. In the German Highway Capacity Manual (MS), the methodology for oversaturated freeway facility analysis both assigns the complete facility with LOS F once the volume-to-capacity ratio on any of the component segments reaches 1.0 and terminates the analysis without further examination of the oversaturated segments. In German analysis practice, an alternative analysis should be performed next and represented, for example, by microscopic traffic flow simulation. But in practice, such simulation analyses are not often performed because of the complexity in the case of large freeway facilities. Therefore, a macro-scopic model able to handle the oversaturated traffic conditions is required. The FREEVAL implementation of HCM was tested for its usage in Germany but proved to be excessively U.S. specific and not applicable in Germany. The characteristics of the German facilities differ from those of the U.S. ones in driver behavior, capacity, and regulations and design standards. Therefore, a new approach was created to comply with German freeway design and operating standards, informed by lessons learned from the U.S. methodology. This paper presents the most important aspects of the German approach to freeway facility analysis and a direct comparison with implementation of the HCM software.

On the Treatment of Trucks in Roundabout Analyses	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Trucks are not always addressed explicitly in planning studies and operational analyses, even though they are a very important part of the nation's economic engine. Most planning studies account for trucks as a percentage of the total traffic flow. The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) converts trucks into autos through the use of a passenger car equivalency (PCE) factor. If the PCE is 2, then a truck is assumed to be equivalent to two autos. However, trucks are beginning to receive more attention, including that in the context of capacity assessments. A recent research effort focused on developing a level-of-service assessment for trucks and for enhancing the way that the impact of trucks is taken into account on freeways, arterials, and roundabouts. This paper focuses on the roundabout aspects of that research. The three roundabout-related objectives in the project were (a) to refine the PCE values used to convert trucks into auto equivalents for the flow on roundabout approaches, (b) to recalibrate the capacity equation so that it more appropriately accounts for trucks, and (c) to develop ways to estimate truck speeds so that travel times through the roundabout could be computed. The results of these analyses are presented as well as the methodology and data employed.

Based on analysis of the current random forests algorithm, which is a learning algorithm of high accuracy and fast speed, new optimum random forests about filtrating outlier in the sample are proposed, which employ bagging strategy combined with boosting strategy. Random forests of different number of trees are applied to analyze status classification of meaningless outliers in traffic detective data sets, respectively, based on traffic flow, spot mean speed, and roadway occupancy rate of traffic parameters. The results show that optimum model of random forest is more accurate to filtrate meaningless outliers in traffic detective data collected from road intersections. With filtrated data for processing, transportation information system can decrease the influence of error data to improve highway traffic information services.

Through combining them, it can accomplish fixed timing control, multi-time control and adaptive control, which can adapt to different timing requirements and response to the current road conditions intuitively. By analyzing simulation result datas, it can be used for urban traffic signal timing optimization. To some degree, this software can ease the traffic congestion.

Secondly, because the FCM algorithm is difficult to distinguish the states good or bad in the same phase, this paper establishes a dynamic traffic state identification model based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which uses the comprehensive index to evaluate each state sample, and uses similarity between the results of improved FCM and DEA to evaluate this model. Thirdly, this paper analyzes the statistical features of traffic state changes from relative smooth to congestion (congestion to severe congestion) combining with time sequence, and proposes the pre-identification number of long-time congestion. Finally, the actual data of a urban arterial road in H city as an example are verified the effects of the method, the similarity of two models is 86.5%, which illustrates the method of this paper is feasible, and the pre-identification number is three.

The traffic flow model and traffic safety evaluation model were studied in this paper to analysis the traffic operation under a new traffic rule of variable traffic flow density. The classic car-following model is used to describe the traffic flow under the intelligent traffic system, and the variable traffic flow density is derived according to the constraints of the left overtaking. The corresponding interval values of average speed discrete degree are obtained to score the traffic safety degree. Then cellular automata is used to simulate the model, finding that traffic flow remains unchanged, while the safety of the traffic increases.

Calibration and validation of these models require detailed vehicle trajectory data. Trajectory data about traffic in cities in the developing world are not publicly available. These cities are characterized by a heterogeneous mix of vehicle types and by a lack of lane discipline. This paper reports on an effort to create a data set of vehicle trajectory data in mixed traffic and on the first results of analysis of these data. The data were collected through video photography in an urban midblock road section in Chennai, India. The trajectory data were extracted from the video sequences with specialized software, and the locally weighted regression method was used to process the data to reduce measurement errors and obtain continuous position, speed, and acceleration functions. The collected data were freely available at http://toledo.net.technion.ac.il/downloads. The traffic flow characteristics of these trajectories, such as speed, acceleration and deceleration, and longitudinal spacing, were investigated. The results show statistically significant differences between the various vehicle types in travel speeds, accelerations, distance keeping, and selection of lateral positions on the roadway. The results further indicate that vehicles, particularly motorcycles, move substantially in the lateral direction and that in a substantial fraction of the observations, drivers are not strictly following their leaders. The results suggest directions for development of a driving behavior model for mixed traffic streams.

Minimum passing zone lengths of 120 m were established by FHWA and AASHTO. Some studies indicate that lengths may need to be increased, but no changes have been recommended, pending further research. The objective of this study was to develop design and marking criteria for minimum passing zone lengths, with traffic operational efficiency and safety taken into consideration. First, a traffic microsimulation was conducted with AIMSUN software. The calibration and validation included the observation of 1,750 passing maneuvers in Spain. Results indicated that passing zones shorter than 250 m added little to operational efficiency. Second, a reliability analysis was applied. The analysis quantified the probability that a passing maneuver was completed beyond the end of the passing zone (noncompliant passing maneuver). Then the number of noncompliant passing maneuvers was calculated. Traffic flow and passing zone length were contributing factors. Findings from the analysis indicated that the minimum passing zone length should be increased to a minimum of 275 m for high traffic volumes, 300 m for medium traffic volumes, and 350 m for low traffic volumes. With these lengths, noncompliant passing maneuvers decrease. The marginal increase in the minimum length of passing zones can potentially improve safety without significantly reducing operational efficiency. The results can be used by practitioners to establish minimum passing zone length on the basis of hourly volumes and level of risk.

J	Lan, CL; Chang, GL				Lan, Chien-Lun; Chang, Gang-Len			Empirical Study of Scooter-Vehicle Mixed Traffic Propagation on Urban Arterials	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Despite the popularity of scooters as a primary transportation mode in many developing countries, design guidelines and software for arterial signals for accommodating heavy scooter vehicle mixed flows are not yet available. Because of insufficient research on the fundamental properties of such mixed flow, traffic professionals often must apply existing signal models or simulation programs, developed mainly for nonscooter traffic flows, to intersections plagued by scooters' complex lane-changing and filtering maneuvers. This study conducts field observations of the complex interactions between scooters and vehicle flows from discharging during the green phase to the formation of stop queues at the downstream intersection. By using statistical analysis results, the study develops a series of formulations to describe the behavior of mixed traffic flows, including estimation of discharging rates, lane choice decision, speed evolution, propagation to join stop queues, and the filtering process of scooters. The study uses field data to evaluate the collective results of the calibrated models for two key signal design parameters: discharging rates for scooters and passenger cars in various mixed flow rates and the time-varying, cumulative queue length at the intersection stop line. Empirical comparison results confirm the promising properties of the developed models, which can serve as the basis for design control plans for arterials with heavy scooter vehicle mixed flows.

J	He, ZJ; Cao, BY; Liu, Y				He, Zongjian; Cao, Buyang; Liu, Yan			Accurate Real-Time Traffic Speed Estimation Using Infrastructure-Free Vehicular Networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article								Real-time traffic speed is indispensable for many ITS applications, such as traffic-aware route planning and eco-driving advisory system. Existing traffic speed estimation solutions assume vehicles travel along roads using constant speed. However, this assumption does not hold due to traffic dynamicity and can potentially lead to inaccurate estimation in real world. In this paper, we propose a novel in-network traffic speed estimation approach using infrastructure-free vehicular networks. The proposed solution utilizes macroscopic traffic flow model to estimate the traffic condition. The selected model only relies on vehicle density, which is less likely to be affected by the traffic dynamicity. In addition, we also demonstrate an application of the proposed solution in real-time route planning applications. Extensive evaluations using both traffic trace based large scale simulation and testbed based implementation have been performed. The results show that our solution outperforms some existing ones in terms of accuracy and efficiency in traffic-aware route planning applications.

The object of this paper is to investigate the cascade failures on road traffic network, considering the aeolotropism of road traffic network topology and road congestion dissipation in traffic flow. An improved coupled map lattice (CML) model is proposed. Furthermore, in order to match the congestion dissipation, a recovery mechanism is put forward in this paper. With a real urban road traffic network in Beijing, the cascading failures are tested using different attack strategies, coupling strengths, external perturbations, and attacked road segment numbers. The impacts of different aspects on road traffic network are evaluated based on the simulation results. The findings confirmed the important roles that these characteristics played in the cascading failure propagation and dissipation on road traffic network. We hope these findings are helpful to find out the optimal road network topology and avoid cascading failure on road network.

The traditional approaches seem insufficient for the estimation of the queue length when the traffic state fluctuates greatly. In this paper, the problem is solved by introducing the Cell Transmission Model, a macroscopic traffic flow, to describe the vehicles aggregation and discharging process at a signalized intersection. To apply the model to urban traffic appropriately, some of its rules were improved accordingly. Besides, we can estimate the density of each cell of the road in a short time interval. We, first, identify the cell, where the tail of the queue is located. Then, we calculate the exact location of the rear of the queue. The models are evaluated by comparing the estimated maximum queue length and average queue length with the results of simulation calibrated by field data and testing of queue tail trajectories. The results show that the proposed model can estimate the maximum and average queue length, as well as the real-time queue length with satisfactory accuracy.

Real-Time Travel Time Prediction Framework for Departure Time and Route Advice	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL	Heavily used urban networks remain a challenge for travel time prediction because traffic flow is rarely homogeneous and is also subject to a wide variety of disturbances. Various models, some of which use traffic flow theory and some of which are data driven, have been developed to predict traffic flow and travel times. Many of these perform well under set conditions. However, few perform well under all or even most urban traffic conditions. As part of the Amsterdam Practical Trial, a comprehensive field operation test for traffic management, a real-time travel time prediction framework, was developed to make use of an ensemble of traffic modeling techniques to predict travel times with great accuracy for arterial roads as well as urban roads. The various models in the framework include both traffic theoretical models and data-driven approaches, making use of some of the largest real-time traffic data sets currently available to limit errors to less than 20% for any time of day or week. The impending implementation of the framework sets it at the forefront of practical real-time implementation of urban travel time prediction.

Completing the missing data is one of the most important steps in achieving the functions of intelligent transportation systems. In this paper an approach based on fuzzy C-means (FCM) imputes missing traffic volume data in loop detectors. With spatial temporal correlation between detectors, the conventional vector-based data structure is first transformed into a matrix-based data pattern. Then, the genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the parameters of cluster size and weighting factor in the FCM model. Finally, the actual traffic flow volume collected at different locations is designed as a testing data set, and two indicators including root mean square error and relative accuracy are used to evaluate the imputation performance of the proposed method by comparison with some conventional methods (multiple linear regression, autoregressive integrated moving average model, and average historical method) by missing ratio. The applications in four scenarios demonstrate that the FCM-based imputation method outperforms conventional methods.

This work presents a complete procedure for constructing bivariate time headway (TH)-vehicle speed (VS) distributions starting from raw traffic data on two-way two-lane roads. The general framework of the procedure, together with functional components and their mutual interactions, was designed and implemented. The effect of flow rate in both directions (analyzed and opposite) on TH-VS distributions was examined. The possibility of associating the TH-VS probability density function with several kinds of traffic conditions in both directions and lanes is a significant and interesting advance with respect to previous works. The procedure was applied to a set of four cross sections belonging to the road network of the province of Venice (northeast Italy). This application enabled testing of the various steps of the procedure and acquisition of better knowledge concerning the way the findings can be used for traffic flow description and simulation.

J	Gan, QJ; Jin, WL				Gan, Qi-Jian; Jin, Wen-Long			Left-Lane Changes in Laterally Unbalanced Traffic: Estimating Number of Lane Changes with Data from Lane-Based Loop Detectors	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							FLOW	Lane changes caused by weaving traffic flows at freeway merging, diverging, and weaving sections can lead to a drop in capacity and can significantly disrupt the entire traffic facility. The lane-changing pattern of on-ramp vehicles has been studied by using vehicle trajectory data when traffic is laterally balanced. However, in reality, detailed vehicle trajectory data are hard to obtain, and traffic at freeway weaving sections can be laterally unbalanced. This study offers a simple but practical approach that uses data from lane-based loop detectors for estimating the number of left-lane changes when traffic is steady but laterally unbalanced. Stationary states with nearly constant flow rates and speeds were obtained from the loop detector data at a freeway weaving section on SR-91 in Buena Park, California. Under near-stationary traffic conditions inside the weaving section, (a) traffic flow conservation was found generally to hold, and (b) traffic was laterally unbalanced with dissimilar additions of vehicles in the lanes. The number of left-lane changes was estimated by using the lane flow-rate differences between the upstream and the middle main-line detectors at the weaving section. Results showed that (a) the number of left-lane changes within two adjacent lanes linearly increases from the leftmost lane to the shoulder lane and (b) the total number of left-lane changes is not sensitive to main-line traffic conditions but increases linearly with the on-ramp flow rate. This study further corroborates the validity of the macroscopic lane-changing model for the lateral distribution of left-lane changes in laterally unbalanced traffic, especially in congested traffic.

Specifically, drivers' adaptive behaviors and the corresponding influence on traffic flows are emphasized. Two piecewise linear regression models are proposed to describe the relationship of flow and density (occupancy). Several types of cellular connections are designed to depict urban rapid roads with on/off-ramps and junctions. Based on the data collected on freeway of Queen Elizabeth, Ontario, Canada, we show that the new model provides a relatively higher accuracy of temporal-spatial evolution of traffic congestions.

The equilibrium point equation of the model is obtained. The stop-and-go traffic phenomenon is described in phase plane and the relationship between traffic jams and system instability is clearly shown in the phase plane diagrams. Using the improved model, some traffic phenomena on a highway with ramps are found in this paper. The numerical simulation is carried out to investigate various nonlinear traffic phenomena with a single ramp generated by different initial densities and vehicle generation rates. According to the actual road sections of Xi'an-Baoji highways, the situations of morning peak with several ramps are also analyzed. All these results are consistent with real traffic, which shows that the improved model is reasonable.

However, traffic flow in urban traffic systems is rather complicated largely due to the presence of traffic signals. By introducing the signalized two-route traffic systems, this paper has investigated the eleven traffic information feedback strategies from system and user aspects for the first time, based on a set of two-route scenarios which simulate various combinations of traffic signal timing and location. The experimental results reveal the following findings. None of the test strategies can effectively improve road capacity for the scenarios where traffic lights are installed on both routes. The traffic information feedback strategies which use global information can reduce travel time to varying degrees, when dynamic vehicles become dominant on the roads. Furthermore, the eleven information feedback strategies have also been examined from the user equilibrium aspect and the corresponding results imply three congestion-based strategies can better approximate the user equilibrium as compared to the others. Finally, experiments demonstrate that the most inefficient strategy to achieve system optimality is the travel time feedback strategy.

Design/methodology/approach: We propose overtaking rules, head-on rules and a cellular automaton model for variable two-way waterway on AIS-based on the basis of NaSch (Nagel-Schreckenberg) model. Findings: By numerical simulation to the two situations which allow changing lane and prohibit changing lane, we obtain fundamental functions between traffic flux (speed) and density and find that changing lane can promote traffic flux and average speed of two-way waterway system under the premise of no impact to the traffic order, and when waterway ship traffic is dense, flux of waterway system has a visible promotion, and when traffic is sparse, average speed of waterway system adds significantly. Practical implications: As an implication, we can reach a compromise between traffic efficiency and safety. When no collision risk incurred, the marine administrations should allow involved ships to change lane for overtaking. Social implications: As a suggestion, Rule 9 and Rule 10 of COLREGs should make some adjustments correspondingly. Originality/value: The paper presents a method to analyze and promote transit capacity of two-way waterway.

However, existing products and research work on density queries still have several limitations which, if can be resolved, will bring more significant benefits to our society. For example, we identify an important problem that has never been studied before. That is none of the existing works on traffic prediction consider the influence of the predicted dense regions on the subsequent traffic flow. Specifically, if road A is estimated to be congested at timestamp t(1), the prediction of the condition on other roads after t(1) should consider the traffic blocked by road A. In this paper, we formally model such influence between multiple density queries and propose an efficient query algorithm. We conducted extensive experiments and the results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

This paper proposes a method that integrates variable speed limits and ramp metering for freeway bottleneck region control to relieve the chaos in bottleneck region. To this end, based on the analyses of spatial-temporal patterns of traffic flow, a macroscopic traffic flow model is extended to describe the traffic flow operating characteristic by considering the impacts of variable speed limits in mainstream bottleneck region. In addition, to achieve the goal of balancing the priority of the vehicles on mainline and on-ramp, increasing capacity, and reducing travel delay on bottleneck region, an improved control model, as well as an advanced control strategy that integrates variable speed limits and ramp metering, is developed. The proposed method is tested in simulation for a real freeway infrastructure feed and calibrates real traffic variables. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can substantially improve the traffic flow efficiency of mainline and on-ramp and enhance the quality of traffic flow at the investigated freeway mainline bottleneck.

Firstly, the paper proposes the concept of associate-forecast and the weight distribution method based on reciprocal absolute percentage error and then uses GM(1,1), ARIMA, and GRNN to establish a combinational model of highway traffic flow according to the fixed weight coefficients. Then the paper proposes the use of neural networks to determine variable weight coefficients and establishes Elman combinational forecast model based on GM(1,1), ARIMA, and GRNN, which achieves the integration of these three individuals.

J	Khalighi, F; Christofa, E				Khalighi, Farnoush; Christofa, Eleni			Emission-Based Signal Timing Optimization for Isolated Intersections	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							VEHICLE; SPEED	Continuous growth in transportation demand in recent years has led to many traffic issues in urban areas. Among the most challenging are traffic congestion and the associated vehicular emissions. Efficient design of traffic signal control systems is a promising approach for addressing these problems. This research developed a real-time signal control system that optimizes signal timings at an undersaturated isolated intersection by minimizing total vehicular emissions. A combination of previously introduced analytical models based on traffic flow theory was used. These models estimated time spent per operating mode (i.e., time spent accelerating, decelerating, cruising, and idling) as functions of demand, vehicle arrival times, saturation flow, and signal control parameters. Information on vehicle activity was used along with the vehicle-specific power approach that provided emission rates per time spent in each operating mode to estimate the total emissions per cycle. For the evaluation of the proposed method, data from the intersection of Mesogeion and Katechaki Avenues in Athens, Greece, were used. The evaluation was performed through deterministic arrival tests under the assumption of perfect information of vehicle arrival demand and times, as well as through stochastic arrival tests in a microsimulation environment. The results reveal that the proposed emission-based optimization can substantially reduce total emissions at signalized intersections and can also lead to reduced person delay compared with the commonly used vehicle-based optimization for most cases, even under the uncertainty of stochastic arrivals.

Sequence Optimization at Signalized Diamond Interchanges Using High-Resolution Event-Based Data	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							PERFORMANCE-MEASURES	Signalized diamond interchanges are pairs of ramp intersections characterized by interlocked left turns and relatively close spacing. This paper describes a series of performance measures derived from high-resolution signal controller event data that can be used to optimize the internal phase sequence and offset to improve traffic flows within diamond interchanges and to assess the progression of the interior movements qualitatively and quantitatively. The new heuristic developed in this paper improves on traditional green band optimization techniques by incorporating actual demand profiles measured in the field. A field analysis was performed on a diamond interchange at 1-69 and 96th Street in northwest Indianapolis, Indiana, where the existing sequence data were collected and used to model the alternative sequences to identify the optimal sequence. Interior operations were improved under the optimized settings: the percentage of vehicle arrivals on green increased by 19% during the 09:00-to-15:00 midday plan. Video observations were used to corroborate the data and are included in a video synthesis of the time space trajectories.

This new approach assembles information from relevant traffic time series and has the following advantages: (1) it integrates both individual and similar flow patterns in making prediction, (2) the training data set does not need to be large, (3) it has more generalization capabilities in predicting unpredictable and much complex urban traffic flow than previously used methods. To assess the new model, we have performed extensive experiments on a real data set, and the results give evidence of its superiority over existing methods.

J	Hui, M; Bai, L; Li, YB; Wu, QS				Hui, Meng; Bai, Lin; Li, YanBo; Wu, QiSheng			Highway Traffic Flow Nonlinear Character Analysis and Prediction	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								In order to meet the highway guidance demand, this work studies the short-term traffic flow prediction method of highway. The Yu-Wu highway which is the main road in Chongqing, China, traffic flow time series is taken as the study object. It uses phase space reconstruction theory and Lyapunov exponent to analyze the nonlinear character of traffic flow. A new Volterra prediction method based on model order reduction via quadratic-linear systems (QLMOR) is applied to predict the traffic flow. Compared with Taylor-expansion-based methods, these QLMOR-reduced Volterra models retain more information of the system and more accuracy. The simulation results using this new Volterra model to predict short time traffic flow reveal that the accuracy of chaotic traffic flow prediction is enough for highway guidance and could be a new reference for intelligent highway management.

This study compares the performance of the two simulation tools in modeling dual lane and triple lane roundabouts under different scenarios such as traffic volume, proportion of left turning movement, and proportion of trucks in the traffic flow. The two simulation tools did not show statistically significant difference in general. However; in the case of high traffic volumes, VISSIM showed higher average delays than those from SimTraffic compared to nearly identical results in the case of low traffic volumes.

Michael			Estimation of Bimodal Urban Link Travel Time Distribution and Its Applications in Traffic Analysis	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								Vehicles travelling on urban streets are heavily influenced by traffic signal controls, pedestrian crossings, and conflicting traffic from cross streets, which would result in bimodal travel time distributions, with one mode corresponding to travels without delays and the other travels with delays. A hierarchical Bayesian bimodal travel time model is proposed to capture the interrupted nature of urban traffic flows. The travel time distributions obtained from the proposed model are then considered to analyze traffic operations and estimate travel time distribution in real time. The advantage of the proposed bimodal model is demonstrated using empirical data, and the results are encouraging.	[Ji, Yuxiong; Jiang, Shengchuan; Du, Yuchuan; Zhang, H.

J	Koukol, M; Zajickova, L; Marek, L; Tucek, P				Koukol, Milan; Zajickova, Lenka; Marek, Lukas; Tucek, Pavel			Fuzzy Logic in Traffic Engineering: A Review on Signal Control	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Review							MODEL	Since 1965 when the fuzzy logic and fuzzy algebra were introduced by Lotfi Zadeh, the fuzzy theory successfully found its applications in the wide range of subject fields. This is mainly due to its ability to process various data, including vague or uncertain data, and provide results that are suitable for the decision making. This paper aims to provide comprehensive overview of literature on fuzzy control systems used for the management of the road traffic flow at road junctions. Several theoretical approaches from basic fuzzy models from the late 1970s to most recent combinations of real-time data with fuzzy inference system and genetic algorithms are mentioned and discussed throughout the paper. In most cases, fuzzy logic controllers provide considerable improvements in the efficiency of traffic junctions' management.

The main goal is to put forward traffic correlation model and real-time correction algorithm for traffic flow forecasting. Traffic correlation model is established based on the temporal-spatial-historical correlation characteristic of traffic big data. In order to simplify the traffic correlation model, this paper presents correction coefficients optimization algorithm. Considering multistate characteristic of traffic big data, a dynamic part is added to traffic correlation model. Real-time correction algorithm based on Fuzzy Neural Network is presented to overcome the nonlinear mapping problems. A case study based on a real-world road network in Beijing, China, is implemented to test the efficiency and applicability of the proposed modeling methods.

J	Kosun, C; Celik, HM; Ozdemir, S				Kosun, Caglar; Celik, Huseyin Murat; Ozdemir, Serhan			AN ANALYSIS OF VEHICULAR TRAFFIC FLOW USING LANGEVIN EQUATION	PROMET-TRAFFIC & TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						Langevin equation; traffic dynamics; Brownian motion; traffic regimes; traffic flow; stochastic forces; drift; diffusion	STOCHASTIC-MODEL	Traffic flow data are stochastic in nature, and an abundance of literature exists thereof. One way to express stochastic data is the Langevin equation. Langevin equation consists of two parts. The first part is known as the deterministic drift term, the other as the stochastic diffusion term. Langevin equation does not only help derive the deterministic and random terms of the selected portion of the city of Istanbul traffic empirically, but also sheds light on the underlying dynamics of the flow. Drift diagrams have shown that slow lane tends to get congested faster when vehicle speeds attain a value of 25 km/h, and it is 20 km/h for the fast lane. Three or four distinct regimes may be discriminated again from the drift diagrams; congested, intermediate, and free-flow regimes. At places, even the intermediate regime may be divided in two, often with readiness to congestion. This has revealed the fact that for the selected portion of the highway, there are two main states of flow, namely, congestion and free-flow, with an intermediate state where the noise-driven traffic flow forces the flow into either of the distinct regimes.

J	Fortuijn, LGH; Hoogendoorn, SP				Fortuijn, Lambertus G. H.; Hoogendoorn, Serge P.			Capacity Estimation on Turboroundabouts with Gap Acceptance and Flow Level Methods	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								In the literature, linear models and exponential models based on gap acceptance theory are distinguished. Parameters for the linear models can be estimated only at the level of traffic flow, whereas the gap acceptance theory assumes that behavioral parameters (critical gap, follow-on time, and minimum headway) can be estimated at the vehicle level, and then capacity can be determined. However, in the latter method, measurements must also be made under saturated conditions because of so-called pseudoconflict (caused by vehicles leaving the roundabout in the opposite leg direction). An analysis of data sources (vehicle level and traffic flow level) indicates that the parameters estimated at the vehicle level correspond with those estimated at the level of traffic flow for single-lane roundabouts, but not for more complex situations. Despite this deficiency, better results can be gained with a model based on the present gap acceptance theory than with a linear model, provided that the parameters are adjusted to consider traffic flow measurements under saturated conditions. Additional research will be necessary to determine which underlying assumptions of the gap acceptance models cause these deficiencies. In Germany, capacity is higher in turboroundabouts than in compact two-lane roundabouts because of better use of the inner lane in the turboroundabout.	[Fortuijn, Lambertus G.

Through the analysis of actual survey data, we found that the relationship between the traffic volume and velocity does not conform to the traditional parabola model, when traffic flow changes from free flow state to congestion state, with the increase of the traffic volume, the average velocity decline of the motor vehicle is small. First, we established the model of the relationship between the traffic volume and the velocity based on linear equation, then we established the determination method of two parameters in the relation model, respectively considering the traffic volume and velocity of the free flow state and the close to congestion state. After validating the model by actual survey data, the results showed that the model has higher fitting precision.

Complicating the collection of traffic data with these short-term devices is the seasonal variation in vehicle operations throughout the year. This work focused on predicting the spatial distribution of seasonal traffic resulting from agricultural activities by using a new method that combines geographic information system spatial functions and the four-step travel demand model. This research collected information about township grids for Montana (as proxies for trip origins), grain elevators (trip destinations), agricultural ground cover, and crop yield estimates to estimate flows in tonnage at the grid level on the road network. Results suggest that the proposed method using the location of major crops and the locations of grain elevators can be used to predict tonnage of product that will be added to individual routes. The predicted values can then be compared with reported heavy-truck traffic to locate sites that may have underrepresented traffic flows. Although this work considered specifically three crops, the method can be applied to any resource flow that has known origin and destination information. The method can be enhanced by refining assumptions of the composition of heavy trucks transporting agricultural products and by field measurements of vehicle flows to better test the validity of the model.

The results for identifying traffic conditions are obtained using macroscopic fundamental diagram. Because of the difficulty of collecting the traffic parameter of travel speed from widely distributed fixed detectors directly, in this paper, the relationship between average travel speed and queue lengths at signalized intersections within the urban area is established based on an equivalent assumption. Finally, the average travel speed estimation model proposed in this paper is tested with microscopic simulation platform, and the results showed that the average travel speed estimation model performed well with satisfactory accuracy. In addition, the best performance of the network efficiency can be identified based on the reflections of macroscopic fundamental diagram, and the evaluation system is simple enough for application in engineering. Therefore, the result is instructive both for generating traffic control strategies and for making route choices.

The work presented in this paper deals with the estimation of traffic state variables (density and speed), using the so called Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Observer (STSM). Several numerical simulations, using simulated and real data, show the relevance of the proposed approach. In addition, a comparative study with the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is carried-out. The comparison indices concern convergence and stability, dynamic performance and robustness. The design of the two observers is achieved using a nonlinear second order traffic flow model in the same highway traffic and geometric conditions.

The impacts of adverse weather and its interactions with drivers and roadway on the operation and management of expressway or expressway bridges have drawn the researchers' and managers' attention to develop traffic management frameworks to mitigate the negative influence. Considering the peculiar geographical location and meteorological conditions, the Guangshen Coast Expressway-Shenzhen Segment (GSCE-SS) was selected as a case in this study to illustrate the proposed traffic management framework on rain days. Conditions categorized by rainfall intensity and traffic flow were the main precondition to make the management decisions. CORSIM simulator was used to develop the alternate routes choice schemes, providing reference for other systems in the proposed traffic management framework. Maps of (a) entrance ramp control (ERC) strategies; (b) mainline control strategies; (c) alternate routes choice; (d) information release schemes, under scenarios of different volume and rainstorm warning grades (BLUE to RED), were drawn to present a reference or demonstration for managers of long-span expressway bridges not only in China, but even in the world.

While predicting the online traffic conditions of road segments entails a variety of challenges, it contributes much to travel time prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose O-Sense, an innovative online-traffic-prediction based route finding mechanism, which organically utilizes large scale taxi GPS traces and environmental information. O-Sense firstly exploits a deep learning approach to process spatial and temporal taxi GPS traces shown in dynamic patterns. Meanwhile, we model the traffic flow state for a given road segment using a linear-chain conditional random field (CRF), a technique that well forecasts the temporal transformation if provided with further supplementary environmental resources. O-Sense then fuses previously obtained outputs with a dynamic weighted classifier and generates a better traffic condition vector for each road segment at different prediction time. Finally, we perform online route computing to find the fastest path connecting consecutive road segments in the route based on the vectors. Experimental results show that O-Sense can estimate the travel time for driving routes more accurately.

The key of Intelligent Transportation System is the real-time and accurate traffic flow prediction. Taking effective measures in a timely manner would prevent the occurrence of traffic accidents since traffic congestion brings much traffic inconvenience to people. Real-time traffic flow prediction plays a significant role in easing traffic congestion and guiding convenient travelling. Therefore, considering the characteristics of traffic flow, this paper presents a neural network, wavelet analysis method, and the EMD and wavelet neural network method respectively. Three methods are utilized in simulating the same set of traffic data and then the most effective way of solving traffic congestion is obtained by taking contrast analysis of simulation result.

We analyze factors like traffic flow and safety performance respectively, and propose the theory basis for making more reasonable rules of the road. We first establish an evaluation system of traffic flow, which can be designed based on the average speed, the traffic density, the following ratio and the overtaking ratio. And we separately calculate the average speed and traffic density in heavy traffic and the opposite. Meanwhile, we obtain a relation of traffic flow and overtaking ratio or following ratio via fitting. We next construct an assessment system, based on IHSDM, and reach the conclusion that the more different the speed of vehicles is, the higher the relevant accident rate will be. As the accident rate reflects the safety performance directly, combining the conclusion with the overtaking model, we can probe into safety performance of freeways under different traffic rules. Afterwards, we compare the freeway network to power network to find a solution, and establish a traffic flow model based on power flow (TFPF). It calculates power flow. We utilize cellular automata (CA) method to simulate traffic circulation, and verify the accuracy of the above model with the obtained data. The verification shows the model is feasible in certain degree. Finally, the intelligent control of urban traffic flow applies to both light and heavy traffic. And it cannot only reduce the required time controlled by human factor, but also guide and schedule reasonably through the network monitoring, so as to ease traffic congestion and traffic accidents, and improve the efficiency of transportation.

The key issue to achieve traffic control guidance is to realize real-time and accurate short-term traffic flow forecasting. And the accuracy and real-time of prediction directly impact traffic control and induced effect. Achieving an accurate prediction of urban road short-term traffic flow is the key of urban road traffic control and traffic guidance. Since the single prediction method for the current is of low precision, we proposed wavelet and support vector machine (SVM) method to predict new fusion; in order to avoid falling into local optimal problem in the process while learning SVM knowledge, we use the particle swarm optimization (PSO) to optimize the key parameters of SVM and in order to improve the prediction accuracy of short-term traffic flow.

This study proposes a methodology to estimate the impact of traffic incident on urban expressway on the basis of modified cell transmission model. The metastable state was taken into account in the proposed method to reflect the actual operating state of traffic flow on urban expressway as much as possible. Regarding the location of traffic incident, the method of cell restructuring settings was discussed. We then proceed to introduce a new concept of the effected length in a given time period as the evaluation indicator to directly depict the influence of traffic incident. The proposed method was tested on a 6516-meter urban expressway section of west second ring road in Beijing. The simulation results indicated that the proposed methodology performs well to predict the impact of traffic incident on urban expressway.

Due to the high mobility and dynamic topology of VANETs, how to support video streaming using wireless communications between vehicles and road-side access points still remains an open issue. In this paper, we propose a geographical uploading scheme, called MPVUS, which uses the moving prediction to keep the stable forwarding and reduce the high link failure probability over VANETs. The scheme also decides the AP switch opportunity by traffic flow estimation, so as to adjust the forwarding direction timely to avoid the short-sighted switch decision. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme, which can achieve good performance in terms of the start-up delay, playback interruption ratio and video frame distortion.

Downtown parking meter demand in a border metropolitan economy	APPLIED ECONOMICS			English	Article						parking meter demand; border economics; applied econometrics	EXCHANGE-RATES; SPECIFICATION; ELASTICITIES; LOCATION; PRICES; CHOICE; TRAVEL; MODEL	Prior research establishes that the price of parking in the city centre often impacts the decision to travel downtown and the mode of transportation utilized. Other factors that influence the decision to drive and park downtown have received less attention. This study uses time series data to analyse the demand for metered parking spaces in El Paso, Texas, USA. In addition to meter rates, the determinants of demand include personal income, gasoline prices and the price of a substitute good, parking garage spaces. Because international bridges connect downtown El Paso to neighbouring Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico, the impacts of transboundary traffic flows, bridge tolls and other cross-border economic variables are also included as potential determinants of metered parking demand. Results indicate that parking meter rates, other transportation-related costs, and economic conditions in both countries affect meter use.	[Fullerton, T. M.; Walke, A.

However, previous CA models have several limitations, resulting in differences between the simulated and the observed traffic flow features. The primary objective of this study is to propose a modified CA model for simulating the characteristics of mixed bicycle traffic flow. Field data were collected on physically separated bicycle path in Shanghai, China, and were used to calibrate the CA model using the genetic algorithm. Traffic flow features between simulations of several CA models and field observations were compared. The results showed that our modified CA model produced more accurate simulation for the fundamental diagram and the passing events in mixed bicycle traffic flow. Based on our model, the bicycle traffic flow features, including the fundamental diagram, the number of passing events, and the number of lane changes, were analyzed. We also analyzed the traffic flow features with different traffic densities, traffic components on different travel lanes. Results of the study can provide important information for understanding and simulating the operations of mixed bicycle traffic flow.

Urban soil samples near industrial locations in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Ontario, Canada were analyzed for metal (Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Pb) contamination. Multivariate geo-statistical analysis (correlation matrix, cluster analysis, principal component analysis) was used to estimate the variability of the soil chemical content. The correlation matrix exhibits a negative correlation with Cr. The principal component analysis (PCA) displays two components. The first component explains the major part of the total variance and is loaded heavily with Cr, Mn, Fe, Zn, and Pb, and the sources are industrial activities and traffic flows. The second component is loaded with Ni, and Cd, and the sources could be lithology and traffic flow. The results of the cluster analysis demonstrate three major clusters: 1) Mn-Zn, 2) Pb-Cd-Cu and Cr, 3) Fe-Ni. The geo-accumulation index (I (geo)) and the pollution load index (PLI) were determined and show the main I (geo) values to be in the range of 0-1.67, indicating the studied soil samples are slightly to moderately contaminated with Cr, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Cd, and moderately contaminated with Pb, while Ni, and Mn fall into class "0". Regarding the PLI, the lowest values are observed at stations 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 25, 27 and 28, while the highest values are recorded for stations 1, 5, 6, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22 and 24, and very high PLI readings are seen for stations 5, 13, 16, 17, 18, 22 and 24. These data confirm that in addition to heavy traffic flows, the chemical and metallurgical type of industries are the major source for soil pollution in the GTA.

Based on the classical gap-acceptance model, two calculating models were established specifically considering randomly arriving vehicles and individual difference in driving behaviours. Monte-Carlo simulation was implemented to reproduce the maximum traffic volume on the designed freeway merge area under different situations. The results demonstrated that the proposed calculating models have better performance than the conventional gap-acceptance theory on accurately predicting the capacity of freeway merge areas. The findings of research could be helpful to improve the microscopic traffic flow simulation model from a more practical perspective and support the designing of freeway merge areas as well.

This analysis seeks to answer the question: when and under what conditions Emergency Message (EM) sent by Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) system reaches the final target to help in preventing of serious accidents, such as multi-vehicle collisions. The model of calculation based on the key principles of vehicle braking enables finding the time to possible collision and the residual velocity of the vehicle. In the calculations, the average values of the driver's reaction time are accepted; in addition, a sent emergency message is considered to be free of interference. Upon choosing different road and driving conditions, it is found what vehicle of the motorcade stops before the possible obstacle on emergency braking. The performance of vehicles with and without VANET system is compared.

The knowledge of the past can be useful for the future as traffic patterns normally follow a predictable pattern with respect to time of day, and day of week. In this paper, we systematically evaluated the prediction accuracy and speed of several supervised machine learning algorithms towards congestion identification based on six weeks real-world traffic data from August 1st, 2012 to September 12th, 2012 in the Maryland (MD)/Washington DC, and Virginia (VA) area. Our dataset consists of six months traffic data pattern from July 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012, of which 6 weeks was used as a representative sample for the purposes of this study on our reference roadway -I-270 [2-4]. Our experimental data shows that with respect to classification, classification tree (Ctree) could provide the best prediction accuracy with an accuracy rate of 100% and prediction speed of 0.34 seconds. It is pertinent to note that variations exist respecting prediction accuracy and prediction speed; hence, a tradeoff is often necessary respecting the priority of the applications in question. It is also imperative to note from the outset that, algorithm design and calibration are important factors in determining their effectiveness.

In the midst of it, the routine traffic data exists in a large number of isolated data in real time without establishing relationships with other data, and detects the amount of data which is greater than that at present. The usage of these data which is relatively shallow requires an in-depth analysis of its data model. Therefore, this paper uses a fuzzy clustering analysis method of feature points to study the traffic flow, uses a Markov decision chain model to study traffic jams, uses quantitative sample points based on the information entropy to calculate traffic flow trends and uses a heuristic prediction model to predict the road congestion. Through the simulation experiment which verifies the correctness of the model, this research is to advance the development of the road and to provide a basis for a dredging plan.

In order to achieve these goals, various ITS technologies need to work synergistically. Nonetheless, ITS's reliance on wireless connectivity makes it vulnerable to cyber threats. Thus, it is critical to understand the impact of cyber threats on ITS. In this paper, using real-world transportation dataset, we evaluated the consequences of cyber threats - attacks against service availability by jamming the communication channel of ITS. In this way, we can have a better understanding of the importance of ensuring adequate security respecting safety and life-critical ITS applications before full and expensive real-world deployments. Our experimental data shows that cyber threats against service availability could adversely affect traffic efficiency and safety performances evidenced by exacerbated travel time, fuel consumed, and other evaluated performance metrics as the communication network is compromised. Finally, we discuss a framework to make ITS secure and more resilient against cyber threats.

An original 2D macroscopic model of multilane traffic is developed to depict flows for the real road geometry. The model uses the analogy with the quasi-gas-dynamic equations. Test predictions demonstrate good agreement with phenomena observed in practice. High parallelization efficiency is achieved at computations on a supercomputer system.

A Queuing Model for Road Traffic Simulation	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF NUMERICAL ANALYSIS AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS 2014 (ICNAAM-2014)	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Numerical Analysis and Applied Mathematics (ICNAAM)	SEP 22-28, 2014	Rhodes, GREECE			traffic flow modeling; queuing systems; state dependent		We present in this article a stochastic queuing model for the raod traffic. The model is based on the M/G/c/c state dependent queuing model, and is inspired from the deterministic Godunov scheme for the road traffic simulation. We first propose a variant of M/G/c/c state dependent model that works with density-flow fundamental diagrams rather than density-speed relationships. We then extend this model in order to consider upstream traffic demand as well as downstream traffic supply. Finally, we show how to model a whole raod by concatenating raod sections as in the deterministic Godunov scheme.

Criticism of Generally Accepted Fundamentals and Methodologies of Traffic and Transportation Theory	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF NUMERICAL ANALYSIS AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS 2014 (ICNAAM-2014)	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Numerical Analysis and Applied Mathematics (ICNAAM)	SEP 22-28, 2014	Rhodes, GREECE			traffic flow models; traffic network optimization and control; Wardrop's principles; dynamic traffic assignment; breakdown minimization (BM) principle; three-phase traffic theory		It is explained why the set of the fundamental empirical features of traffic breakdown (a transition from free flow to congested traffic) should be the empirical basis for any traffic and transportation theory that can be reliable used for control and optimization in traffic networks. It is shown that generally accepted fundamentals and methodologies of traffic and transportation theory are not consistent with the set of the fundamental empirical features of traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck. To these fundamentals and methodologies of traffic and transportation theory belong (i) Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) theory, (ii) the General Motors (GM) model class (for example, Herman, Gazis et al. GM model, Gipps's model, Payne's model, Newell's optimal velocity (OV) model, Wiedemann's model, Bando et al. OV model, Treiber's IDM, Kraub's model), (iii) the understanding of highway capacity as a particular stochastic value, and (iv) principles for traffic and transportation network optimization and control (for example, Wardrop's user equilibrium (UE) and system optimum (SO) principles). Alternatively to these generally accepted fundamentals and methodologies of traffic and transportation theory, we discuss three-phase traffic theory as the basis for traffic flow modeling as well as briefly consider the network breakdown minimization (BM) principle for the optimization of traffic and transportation networks with road bottlenecks.

We introduce the notion of class of vehicles to refer to vehicles of different transport modes. Our model describes the traffic on highways (which may contain several lanes) and network transit for pubic transportation. The model is drafted with Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates and uses a Logit model to describe the traffic assignment of our multiclass vehicular flow description on shared roads. The paper also discusses traffic streams on dedicated lanes for specific class of vehicles with event-based traffic laws. An Euler-Lagrangian-remap scheme is introduced to numerically approximate the model's flow equations.	[Sossoe, K.

Other users are exposed to hazard situation and risks of accident if the driver who changes his/her course failed to give signal as required. This paper describes the application of logistic regression model for the analysis of driver's signalling practices on multilane highways based on possible factors affecting driver's decision such as driver's gender, vehicle's type, vehicle's speed and traffic flow intensity. Data pertaining to the analysis of such factors were collected manually. More than 2000 drivers who have performed a lane changing manoeuvre while driving on two sections of multilane highways were observed. Finding from the study shows that relatively a large proportion of drivers failed to give any signals when changing lane. The result of the analysis indicates that although the proportion of the drivers who failed to provide signal prior to lane changing manoeuvre is high, the degree of compliances of the female drivers is better than the male drivers. A binary logistic model was developed to represent the probability of a driver to provide signal indication prior to lane changing manoeuvre. The model indicates that driver's gender, type of vehicle's driven, speed of vehicle and traffic volume influence the driver's decision to provide a signal indication prior to a lane changing manoeuvre on a multilane urban highway. In terms of types of vehicles driven, about 97% of motorcyclists failed to comply with the signal indication requirement. The proportion of non-compliance drivers under stable traffic flow conditions is much higher than when the flow is relatively heavy. This is consistent with the data which indicates a high degree of non-compliances when the average speed of the traffic stream is relatively high.

Traffic bottleneck problems caused by bus stops are simulated in multiple lanes roads with no-bay bus stations. With the mixed traffic flow composed of different bus arrival rate, flow-density graph, density distribution graph, and temporal-spatial graph are presented. Furthermore, the mixed traffic flow characteristics are analyzed. Numerical experiment results show that the proposed model can generate a variety of complicated realistic phenomena in the traffic system with bus stops and provide theoretical basis for better using of traffic flow model.

The leaching-enriching effect among the soil of vertical section with different distance to the highway was analyzed. The relations between the Muller pollution index of lead in the soil along highway and under the vertical depth of the soil were simulated by means of the software origin 8.1. Also the grey relevant degree between the topsoil above 15 cm versus the traffic flow of highway and whole operating life and the pollution level of the subsoil were calculated. It was concluded that the mathematical model between lead pollution index and the soil vertical section is (y(i)) over bar = 1.32exp(-x/16.15) + 0.011 that means the traffic flow donates more than the road operating life to the roadside lead pollution, and it can be seen that the pollution level between topsoil and subsoil has a high relativity. This investigation provides a scientific basis for soil phytoremediation and groundwater conservation, and for correct planning land utilization along the highway.

Motivated by this problem, the paper presents a real-time signal control strategy of URTNs, called the UTBC (Urban Traffic Balance Control) strategy, under which the traffic states of URTNs can realize asymptotic stable consensus, i.e., the network can reach balanced distribution of traffic flows. We first propose a signal control model of URTNs based on basic conservation principle of vehicle flows, which is a discrete-time linear time-invariant control system, with green time durations of phases being control input. Furthermore, the state-feedback signal control law (i.e. the UTBC strategy) is proposed, under which the proposed signal control system can realize asymptotic stable consensus. At last, we illustrate the UTBC strategy by conducting simulation tests for a real-word network in Wangjing district in Beijing. The simulation results show that the UTBC strategy is feasible and effective.

J	Xu, W; Sumalee, A				Xu, Wei; Sumalee, Agachai			Evolutionary Marginal Cost Pricing Scheme Implementation Based on Stochastic Traffic Flow Information	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							NETWORK DESIGN PROBLEM; TRANSPORTATION NETWORK; ROAD NETWORKS; TOLL DESIGN; DEMAND; UNCERTAINTY; ASSIGNMENT; MODELS	Traditionally, to implement the first-best marginal cost pricing scheme in a traffic network requires the information on the exact demand function or true origin-destination demand, which, however, is rarely available in practice. To overcome this dilemma, the trial-and-error method has been proposed to find the marginal cost toll through an iterative process using the observed traffic volumes. This method guarantees the convergence of tolls and flows to the system optimal state under the assumption of deterministic traffic conditions. However, in reality, the uncertainty of transportation network has been recognized well that induces the variability of link flow and travel time. Therefore, this paper proposes an evolutionary implementation method that iteratively finds the first-best marginal cost toll pattern according to the observed stochastic link flow information and the known travel time functions. The proof of the convergence of the iterative algorithm is presented. The paper also analyzes the effect of the sampling error of the link flow data on the convergence of the algorithm and shows that the biases from the flow observation will not affect the convergence. The numerical tests are provided for the illustration of the algorithm.

J	Wang, YP; Zacharias, J				Wang, Yupeng; Zacharias, John			Landscape modification for ambient environmental improvement in central business districts - A case from Beijing	URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING			English	Article						Mega-projects; Simulation; Traffic volume; Urban environment; Urban vegetation	URBAN HEAT-ISLAND; INDUCED TRAVEL; AIR-QUALITY; LAND-USE; MODEL; TRANSPORTATION; URBANIZATION; VEGETATION; CAPACITY; SURFACES	Hundreds of large central business district (CBD) developments are in planning or development in China and other developing countries. Poor environmental performance in these large projects is thought to result from a lack of understanding of basic engineering requirements, especially transport-related. Large energy demand and air pollution are the obvious consequences. While many studies have focused on functional, symbolic and aesthetic requirements of these developments, environmental engineering has in general been neglected. In this study, a typical large-scale planned CBD in Beijing was investigated just several years after its completion and occupancy. The current transportation requirements of the development were measured. It was found that the road traffic provision exceeded demand. Redesign of road infrastructure and urban greening were evaluated for their contribution to alleviating heat stress in summer, providing a comfortable walking and living environment. Reducing the under-used road infrastructure, without affecting the traffic flow, would allow more space for urban vegetation. In particular, the thermal environment for pedestrians in the whole area could be substantially improved through the redesign of ground-level space. Using ENVI-met microclimate fluid dynamic model to measure the impact of greater green landscape area, it was found that the median air temperature (T-a) could be reduced by as much as 0.5 degrees C. The environmental advantages increase with time, as the tree canopies grow. In the micro-scaled simulation (300 x 600 m), the T-a was reduced by 1 degrees C. That is to say, urban summer T-a mitigation could be achieved if such effective modification schemes were expanded from the micro-scale urban community to the whole city. This research provides support for the use of urban landscape greening as a means to improve environmental conditions and energy demands in large-scale commercial urban development. Reducing redundant road infrastructure and improving the walking environment with urban greening could potentially suppress motorized traffic demand growth and contribute to a more sustainable urban environment.

Traffic Congestion and Air Pollution Exposure for Motorists: Comparing Exposure Duration and Intensity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						motor vehicle emissions; pollution exposure; traffic congestion	VEHICLE-INDUCED TURBULENCE; FINE PARTICULATE MATTER; TRANSPORT MICROENVIRONMENTS; CARBON-MONOXIDE; EXHAUST-GAS; LOS-ANGELES; IN-CABIN; DISPERSION; POLLUTANTS; PARAMETERS	This article investigates the effects of congested freeway traffic conditions on motorists' exposure to traffic-related air pollution using real-world traffic data and a framework of established emissions and dispersion models. The intent is to isolate and compare the influences of congested traffic characteristics on exposure duration and exposure intensity. Mass inhalation of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) is estimated for 45,226 simulated trips through a 14-mile congested freeway corridor. Results show that congestion increases total trip pollutant inhalation primarily through motorist delay (exposure duration), and to a lesser extent through increased concentrations (exposure intensity). The effects of varying wind and background concentration can be sufficient to obscure the influence of congestion on exposure intensity. The variability of exposure intensity due to traffic is mitigated by offsetting impacts among traffic flow, emissions rates, and pollutant dispersion. Exposure intensity increases with higher traffic flow and with lower traffic speed, but the impact of lower traffic speeds (through increased emissions rates and decreased dispersion) is smaller. The importance of exposure hot spots at traffic bottlenecks also increases in congestion. These findings suggest that traffic-based motorist exposure mitigation should focus on reducing travel duration on high-volume corridors through reduced vehicle flows (i.e., demand-side congestion mitigation). This analysis does not include non-congestion-based mitigation strategies such as cleaner vehicle engine technology or improvements in vehicle cabins, which can also reduce exposure intensity. On an individual scale, motorists can greatly reduce their own exposure during travel by, among other strategies, adjusting their departure time to less congested, lower volume periods.

The model incorporates drivers' individual characteristics and acceleration constraints of vehicles in the definition of lane changing decision process. The aim is to make the lane change process more in line with real features. Thus, the drivers' representation in the model is more like human response by reconstructing the local behavior on a microscopic level. Simulation results on a system with periodic conditions show that lane usage inversion, lane change rate versus density and different traffic states are reproduced by the model. Besides, in this model the flow is not dominated by the introduction of larger vehicles with smaller maximum velocity, even if their lane change is not prohibited. Moreover, ping-pong lane changes are reduced. The model preserves the computational simplicity of CA models.

The vehicles including car-pickups, minibus-vans, truck-buses and motorcycles passing through the roads are considered. The results show that day average and night average of LA(eq)(15 min) values were 73.34 dBA and 72.59 dBA respectively, higher than the World Health Organisation (WHO) outdoor environmental noise guidelines. The highest mean value of LAeq(15 min) was recorded as 74.05 dBA. It was found, minibus-vans and truck-buses were mainly responsible for producing traffic noise in these roads. In conclusion, the most important element to reduce traffic noise in the two main roads is to impose control programs on the two groups of vehicles. Furthermore, it is suggested to use sound barriers along the two roads of Sanandaj city.

This model was developed from the Germany Richtlinien fur den Larmschutz an Strassen (RLS 90) model by adding the water surface condition, absorption and gradient along vessel travel direction correction terms to the governing equations. The re-described parameters, including traffic flow and composition, vessel speed, air absorption, and water surface, ground and atmospheric conditions, etc., were chosen as inputs into the calculating equations. The verification results showed that the absolute error between the predicted and measured noise levels within the range of +/- 1.4 dBA was 82.9%. The mean difference between the predicted and measured noise levels was 0.02 +/- 1.25 dBA. The comparison results with the RLS 90 model and the modified Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) model also showed that the developed model in this study had better precision and accuracy.

Simulation study of car accidents at the intersection of two roads in the mixed traffic flow	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Cellular automata; NaSch Model; intersection; car accidents; mixed traffic flow; road length	VEHICLES; MODEL	Using cellular automata (CA) Nagel-Schreckenberg (NaSch) model, we numerically study the probability P-ac the occurrence of car accidents at nonsignalized intersection when drivers do not respect the priority rules. We also investigated the impact of mixture lengths and velocities of vehicles on this probability. It is found that in the first case, where vehicles distinguished only by their lengths, the car accidents start to occur above a critical density rho(c). Furthermore, the increase of the fraction of long vehicles (F-L) delays the occurrence of car accidents (increasing rho(c)) and increases the risk of collisions when rho > rho(c). In other side, the mixture of maximum velocities (with same length for all vehicles) leads to the appearance of accidents at the intersection even in the free flow regime. Moreover, the increase of the fraction of fast vehicles (F-f) reduces the accident probability (P-ac). The influence of roads length is also studied. We found that the decrease of the roads length enhance the risk of collision.

J	Zhao, C; Jia, N				Zhao, Chao; Jia, Ning			The impact of iterated games on traffic flow at noncontrolled intersections	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Iterated game; noncontrolled intersection; traffic flow model; cooperation; fundamental diagram	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; DYNAMICS; EVACUATION; LANE	Intersections without signal control widely exist in urban road networks. This paper studied the traffic flow in a noncontrolled intersection within an iterated game framework. We assume drivers have learning ability and can repetitively adjust their strategies (to give way or to rush through) in the intersection according to memories. A cellular automata model is applied to investigate the characteristics of the traffic flow. Numerical experiments indicate two main findings. First, the traffic flow experiences a "volcano-shaped" fundamental diagram with three different phases. Second, most drivers choose to give way in the intersection, but the aggressive drivers cannot be completely eliminated, which is coincident with field observations. Analysis are also given out to explain the observed phenomena. These findings allow deeper insight of the real-world bottleneck traffic flow.

J	Hu, X; Lu, J; Wang, W; Ye, ZR				Hu, Xiaojian; Lu, Jian; Wang, Wei; Ye Zhirui			Traffic Signal Synchronization in the Saturated High-Density Grid Road Network	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							INTERSECTIONS; SYSTEMS	Most existing traffic signal synchronization strategies do not perform well in the saturated high-density grid road network (HGRN). Traffic congestion often occurs in the saturated HGRN, and the mobility of the network is difficult to restore. In order to alleviate traffic congestion and to improve traffic efficiency in the network, the study proposes a regional traffic signal synchronization strategy, named the long green and long red (LGLR) traffic signal synchronization strategy. The essence of the strategy is to control the formation and dissipation of queues and to maximize the efficiency of traffic flows at signalized intersections in the saturated HGRN. With this strategy, the same signal control timing plan is used at all signalized intersections in the HGRN, and the straight phase of the control timing plan has a long green time and a long red time. Therefore, continuous traffic flows can be maintained when vehicles travel, and traffic congestion can be alleviated when vehicles stop. Using the strategy, the LGLR traffic signal synchronization model is developed, with the objective of minimizing the number of stops. Finally, the simulation is executed to analyze the performance of the model by comparing it to other models, and the superiority of the LGLR model is evident in terms of delay, number of stops, queue length, and overall performance in the saturated HGRN.

Using various key metrics of interest, including node degree, neighbor distribution, number of clusters, and link duration, we provide a realistic analysis of the VANET topology characteristics over time and space for a highway scenario. In this analysis, we integrate real-world road topology and real-time data extracted from the freeway Performance Measurement System (PeMS) database into a microscopic mobility model to generate realistic traffic flows along the highway. Moreover, we use a more realistic, recently proposed, obstacle-based channel model and compare the performance of this sophisticated model to the most commonly used and more simplistic channel models, including unit disk and lognormal shadowing models. Our investigation on the key metrics reveals that both lognormal and unit disk models fail to provide realistic VANET topology characteristics. We therefore propose a matching mechanism to tune the parameters of the lognormal model according to the vehicle density and a correlation model to take into account the evolution of the link characteristics over time. The proposed method has been demonstrated to provide a good match with the computationally expensive and difficult-to-implement obstacle-based model. The parameters of the proposed model have been validated to depend only on the vehicle traffic density based on the real data of four different highways in California.

In order to verify this relationship, empirical data are analyzed with the following findings: (1) linear relationship between the actual space gap and speed can be identified when the speed difference between vehicles approximates zero; (2) vehicles accelerate or decelerate around the desired space gap most of the time. To explain these phenomena, we propose that, in congested traffic flow, the space gap between two vehicles will oscillate around the desired space gap in the deterministic limit. This assumption is formulated in terms of a cellular automaton. In contrast to FDA and KTPT, the new model does not have any congested steady-state solution. Simulations under periodic and open boundary conditions reproduce the empirical findings of KTPT. Calibrating and validating the model to detector data produces results that are better than that of previous studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The two-fluid vehicular traffic flow model describes traffic flow on a street network as a mix of stopped and running vehicles. The parameters of the model essentially represent 'free flow' travel time and the level of interaction among vehicles. These parameters have traditionally been used to evaluate roadway networks and corridors with partially limited access. However, the two-fluid model has been found to be a direct result of driver behavior, and can also be used to represent behavioral aspects of driver populations, e.g., aggressiveness, passiveness, etc. Through these behavioral aspects they can also be related to safety on roadways. Due to which the two-fluid model can be considered to be a safety footprint for a particular road or individual driver. Due to which it is critical to understand factors that influence the two-fluid model. In this study, two-fluid models were estimated using naturalistic driving data collected with GPS data loggers in San Luis Obispo (SLO), California. Linear referencing in ArcMap was used to link the GPS data with roadway characteristic data for each element of the roadway network. The linear referencing methodology is the key to relate the GPS driving data with the elements of roadway network. This study explores two fundamental questions: (1) how sensitive are the estimates of the two fluid parameters to various samples? This question is fundamentally important to help define the integrity of the two-fluid model for planning and operational purposes. To this end we use a random sampling approach to address this question. (2) Are there behavioral differences across gender? This provides important behavioral insights on driving behavior across gender. Significant differences were observed between male and female drivers, with female drivers being more aggressive.

J	Sun, ZB; Hao, P; Ban, XG; Yang, DG				Sun, Zhanbo; Hao, Peng; Ban, Xuegang (Jeff); Yang, Diange			Trajectory-based vehicle energy/emissions estimation for signalized arterials using mobile sensing data	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Vehicle fuel consumption; Vehicle emissions; Vehicle trajectory reconstruction; Mobile sensing data; State-dependent acceleration	KINEMATIC WAVES; VARIATIONAL FORMULATION; FUEL CONSUMPTION; EMISSIONS; IMPACT; SPEED	While fuel economy and global environment being increasingly recognized, it has become an imperative task to estimate vehicular fuel consumption and emissions for broad areas, including both freeway segments and signalized arterials. This task is much more challenging for signalized arterials compared with its counterpart on freeways, due to the disturbance brought by traffic signals and pedestrians. In this paper, a trajectory-based energy/emissions estimation method is proposed for signalized arterials, which offers a cost-effective way to estimate fuel consumption/emissions for large areas. Using mobile sensing data (e.g., GPS traces) collected from a sample of the traffic flow, the proposed method first estimates the trajectories for the entire traffic population, including free-flow vehicles and queued vehicles. The estimated trajectories reflect not only the traffic state (e.g., queuing and free-flowing), but also vehicle's driving mode (e.g., cruise, idle, acceleration and deceleration). Vehicle-based fuel consumption/emissions are then estimated, using the Comprehensive Modal Emissions Model (CMEM), based on which the total vehicular fuel consumption and emissions of the entire traffic flow can be estimated. The proposed method is tested using real world field data (NGSIM) and micro-simulation data. The estimation results indicate that adding random noise to the cruise mode and using a state-dependent acceleration process lead to improved estimation results. The estimation errors of total fuel consumption and emissions are typically within 10-20%. The vehicle-based estimation results reveal that if the number of vehicles can be well estimated, the corresponding fuel/emission results are usually close to the ground truth values.

TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Microscopic traffic model; Car-following; Vehicle emissions; Fuel consumption; Calibration; Sensitivity analysis	FLOW MODELS; SIMULATION; HIGHWAY; IMPACT; WAVES	Fuel consumption or pollutant emissions can be assessed by coupling a microscopic traffic flow model with an instantaneous emission model. Traffic models are usually calibrated using goodness of fit indicators related to the traffic behavior. Thus, this paper investigates how such a calibration influences the accuracy of fuel consumption and NOx and PM estimations. Two traffic models are investigated: Newell and Gipps. It appears that the Gipps model provides the closest simulated trajectories when compared to real ones. Interestingly, a reverse ranking is observed for fuel consumption, NOx and PM emissions. For both models, the emissions of single vehicles are very sensitive to the calibration. This is confirmed by a global sensitivity analysis of the Gipps model that shows that non-optimal parameters significantly increase the variance of the outputs. Fortunately, this is no longer the case when emissions are calculated for a group of many vehicles. Indeed, the mean errors for platoons are close to 10% for the Gipps model and always lower than 4% for the Newell model. Another interesting property is that optimal parameters for each vehicle can be replaced by the mean values with no discrepancy for the Newell model and low discrepancies for the Gipps model when calculating the different emission outputs. Finally, this study presents preliminary results that show that multi-objective calibration methods are certainly the best direction for future works on the Gipps model. Indeed, the accuracy of vehicle emissions can be highly improved with negligible counterparts on the traffic model accuracy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Traffic density estimation in vehicular ad hoc networks: A review	AD HOC NETWORKS			English	Review						Vehicle density estimation; VANET; Traffic information; Density-aware	STATE ESTIMATION; ALGORITHM; SYSTEM; TIME	Nowadays, vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) are gaining enormous research interest. Even though the leading reason for developing VANETs is traffic safety, many applications such as traffic status monitoring, road traffic management, routing and distribution of data, have been considered. Road traffic density estimation provides important information for such applications. Various infrastructure-based mechanisms were proposed to estimate traffic density relying on vehicle detection devices that require pre-deployment. However, as utilizing wireless communication capabilities in vehicles is developing rapidly, more accurate and real-time infrastructure-free density estimation methods are emerging day-to-day. Some of the infrastructure-free methods depend mainly on statistical estimations, while others are based on VANET communications and traffic flow information. In addition, clustering and group members counting are the main characteristic of a third type of infrastructure-free methods. This review paper explored different techniques and algorithms used in both infrastructure-based and infrastructure-free density estimation methods. Furthermore, the main features, limitations and critical issues for each density estimation method are depicted. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Panichpapiboon, S				Panichpapiboon, Sooksan			Time-Headway Distributions on an Expressway: Case of Bangkok	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Time-headway; Traffic flow analysis; Statistical modeling	MODELS	Traffic flow modeling is one of the fundamental keys to solving a traffic engineering problem. Among many parameters, time headway is frequently used to model traffic flow characteristics. A statistical analysis of time headways is immensely important to both theoretical traffic modeling and simulation-based traffic modeling. Basically, it allows researchers to describe an inherently random pattern of traffic flows. Past studies have mainly focused on the time headways of vehicles on highways, freeways, and arterials. However, studies of time headways on urban expressways are rather limited and still need further investigation. In this paper, the author investigates and characterizes the time-headway distributions of vehicles traveling on an urban expressway in Bangkok, Thailand. Particularly, the exponential distribution, the lognormal distribution, and the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution are used to model the time headways. It is found that the GEV distribution is most effective in modeling time headways. In fact, the GEV distribution can describe more than 90% of the empirical distributions on most lanes and sections of the expressway. On the other hand, the exponential distribution is the least effective distribution. It can only describe the empirical distributions during the periods when the traffic is extremely light.

This paper provides the analysis of the impact of vegetation on water erosion, winter conditions, visibility of formation line, glare effect, inhibition of energy, wind strength, presence of animal habitats and creation of specific microclimate. Apart from typical ecological functions, they also impact the risk for people involved in the traffic flow. These influences have both a positive and negative impact on the safety of vehicle flow on roads. The paper uses the method of data analysis, and accident rates were calculated with the participation of environmental conditions - driving into a tree, hitting an animal, rainfall, snowfall, blinding sun and strong wind gusts. The main conclusions of the study include: (1) roadside vegetation has many positive characteristics and also influences the safety of road users, (2) taking into consideration different environmental conditions, most road accidents are caused by driving into a tree, (3) the overall number of road accidents in Poland influenced by environmental conditions is decreasing despite the growth in the number of vehicles, (4) by employing the standards of woodlot shaping, it is possible to retain the positive influence of the vegetation on the space and, simultaneously, make the space safe for road users.

Driving Security Determination and Assistance Overtaking System(DSDAOS) is established to analyze the relationship between security, speed limit and traffic flow while Intelligent System(IS) is theoretically designed on the basis of DSDAOS and it has better impact on promoting traffic flow from aspects of speed limit and lane conditions when compared to DSDAOS. DSDAOS is a system that utilizes computer to produce vehicles in the simulation, give some properties to them which are made to run in lanes according to certain rules, and finally output security level and relational traffic flow. IS is a system in which computers use information-gathering device to automatically gather information, then deal with the information and get relating response which refers to the function of shifting speed limit of lanes and changing lanes to promote traffic flow. All in all, IS makes great difference to promote use ratio and carrying capacity of lanes. What is more important is that Intelligent System is a circulating system with high independence.

Thus, in order to achieve the dream of a smart city, special attention was given to the treatment of cities' traffic management problem; especially in junctions which constitute bottlenecks for traffic flow leading to a poor quality of urban mobility. The aim of this study is to examine further the RED approach for traffic lights management recently proposed for the design of an adaptive signal control system In the context of ITL (Intelligent Traffic Lights) systems, based generally on sensors, and communication technologies. Traffic management is a well known problematic in data networks. Thus, several researchers have studied methods for providing congestion avoidance at the gateway called also router. Inspired by advanced technologies in Internet traffic management, we propose a system based on the RED (Random Early Detection) mechanism widely used by routers to avoid congestion. Our contribution consists of the adaptation of this mechanism to the ITS context by applying it for traffic lights management. Our system will certainly contribute to decrease waiting times, fuel consumption and pollution. This paper will present the complete adaptation of the RED algorithm to the context of the intelligent transport systems. In addition, the RED-based design performance is compared with that of the pre-timed model to gain insights between the two systems.

In addition traditional vehicle actuated coordinated control will fail in oversaturated traffic status and other limitations. To overcome these limitations, this paper adopts active electronic tags to get the update ratio of the vehicles in the test range, changes time interval between vehicles as control basis in traditional vehicle actuated control theory, puts forward putting vehicle density as whether green light extension control basis by using RFID electronic tag in vehicle actuated control. When the vehicle density is higher than the setting threshold value, green light continues, on the contrary, switching the phase. The method not only can overcome the drawback that traditional vehicle actuated coordinated control will fail in oversaturated traffic status, but also can effectively improve the utilization of green light and decrease the average delay in the intersection, which has been verified by simulated experiment through VISSIM.

A set of LMI conditions are derived for robust :6-gain performance of such a system in the framework of multiplier-based LPV synthesis. The results have been oriented to be applied in traffic flow control in motorways by ramp metering. First, with the use of a proper transformation, the nonlinear traffic flow model has been represented as the interconnection of LPV subsystems. Then the developed synthesis results have been used to design a gain-scheduled distributed state-feedback controller that keeps the density of all segments around a desired value by the use of ramp metering.

We describe the single-region traffic dynamics by utilising the so-called Macroscopic or Network Fundamental Diagram (MFD or NFD), a nonlinear relation between network-wide mean flow and accumulation of vehicles. By using MFD relaxation conditions and structuring uncertainties, we reformulate the nonlinear flow dynamics to set of uncertain Linear Parametrically Varying (LPV) ones. In controller design stage one, we apply the concept of a two degree of freedom, induced L-2 norm minimising LPV controller. Within the generalised performance output, we include tracking performance to follow a pre-defined critical accumulation in uncertain model environment. Output feedback LPV controller ensures generalised disturbance attenuation conditions with appropriate gated input flow at the perimeter. Second, an optimal quadratic control allocation algorithm is employed to distribute the ordered flow to entrance link green stages (flow equivalent green time) in a number of candidate junctions at the perimeter of the network. The constrained allocation techniques complement the robust controller enabling real-time applicability of the proposed methodology. Finally, the proposed robust control scheme is tested and compared with a reference tracking bang-bang controller in macroscopic simulation. Results indicate the viability of the proposed LPV controller and its rapid and accurate tracking behaviour under highly uncertain parameters of the MFD.

We extend previous results on the structure of steady-state solutions of the Cell Transmission Model and use them to optimize over the set of equilibria. By using duality arguments, we derive optimality conditions and show that closed-loop equilibria of certain decentralized feedback controllers, in particular the practically successful "ALINEA" method, are in fact globally optimal.

In this context, the use of low cost technologies is mandatory to avoid scalability issues that would prevent the adoption of monitoring solutions at the full city scale. In this paper, we introduce a low power and low cost sensor equipped with embedded vision logics that can be used for building Smart Camera Networks (SCN) for applications in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS); in particular, we describe an ad hoc computer vision algorithm for estimation of traffic flow and discuss the findings obtained through an actual field test.

Mitigating Congestion at Sags with Adaptive Cruise Control Systems	2015 IEEE 18TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	18th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems	SEP 15-18, 2015	SPAIN	IEEE, Int Transportat Syst Soc, CVCEI, Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Ayuntamentiao Las Palmas Gran Canaria, LPA, IEEE Comp Soc, Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Inst Univ Ciencias Tecnologias Ciberneticas				Sags are segments of the road where there is a significant change in gradient from downhill to uphill in a short distance. Empirically, it has been observed that drivers do not compensate adequately for the changing grade resistance force at sags, which limits vehicle acceleration. As a consequence, congestion forms at sags. This paper proposes and compares the implementation of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Traffic State-Adaptive ACC (TSA-ACC), and Cooperative ACC (CACC) at sags. The controllers are implemented in a traffic simulation environment with a single-lane road stretch and a platoon of 200 vehicles of which 10% follow the movements set by the controller and 90% follow the normal driving rules. The simulation results show that all controllers reduce the travel time of the equipped vehicles and have significantly positive effects on the total travel time of the platoon. TSA-ACC produces the most travel time savings. The findings of this paper show that the proposed controllers can be used to improve the performance of traffic flow at sags.

We assess the effects of detector data delay on traffic state prediction and on the effectiveness of in-car tactical advice using microscopic simulation. Interestingly, effectiveness does not reduce with data delays from 0s up to 180s, indicating that for the presented case, congestion is predicted with sufficient accuracy. However, estimation errors in speed and flow increase, and accuracy of advices (including false negatives and positives) decreases. Consequently, compliance, and as a result effectiveness, may be expected to reduce for larger data delay. This paper shows that in-car tactical advice may reduce travel time delay with about 33% even if drivers are attentive and relatively efficient without advice.

In dense traffic lane-changes and merging are often key ingredients to cause safety hazards, traffic breakdowns and travel delays. In this paper, we propose an efficient cooperative lane-changing algorithm CLA for sensor-and communication-enabled automated vehicles to reduce the lane-changing bottlenecks. For discretionary lane-changing, we consider the advantages of the subject vehicle, the follower in the current lane and k (an integer) lag vehicles in the target lane to maximize speed gains. Our algorithm simultaneously minimizes the impact of lane-change on traffic flow and the overall trip time, fuel-consumption and pollutant-emission. For mandatory lane-changing CLA dissociates the decision-making point from the actual mandatory lane-changing point and computes a suitable lane-changing slot in order to minimize lane-changing (merging) time. Our algorithm outperforms the potential cooperative lane-changing algorithm MOBIL proposed by Kesting et al. [1] in terms of merging time and rate, waiting time, fuel consumption, average velocity and flow (especially at the point in front of the merging point) at the cost of slightly increased average trip time for the mainroad vehicles compared to MOBIL. We also highlight important directions for further research.

In this study, we attempt to find new knowledge between traffic congestion and weather by using big data processing technology. Changes in traffic congestion due to the weather are evaluated by using multiple linear regression analysis to create a prediction model and forecast traffic congestion on a daily basis. For the regression analysis, we use 48 weather forecasting factors and six dummy variables to express the days of the week. The final multiple linear regression model is then proposed based on the three analytical steps of (i) the creation of the full regression model, (ii) the removal of the variables, and (iii) residual analysis. We find that the R-squared value of the proposed model has an explanatory power of 0.6555. To verify its predictability, the proposed model then evaluates traffic congestion in July and August 2014 by comparing predicted traffic congestion with actual traffic congestion. By using the mean absolute percentage error valuation method, we show that the final multiple linear regression model has a prediction accuracy of 84.8%.

To better facilitate or understand the infrastructure status and demands, a huge amount of transportation data such as traffic flow counts has been collected from numerous transportation monitoring systems. Making full use of harvested data samples to discover important patterns has become an increasingly appealing research topic, in which a sophisticated and uncertainty-processing framework is required. In this paper, a big-data processing framework is introduced to analyse the transportation data, particularly taking the classification problem of the parking occupation status as an illustrative example. Three modules are implemented to crawl the raw records, generate high-level features, and apply the machine learning algorithm for classification. In addition, the fuzzification algorithm is also introduced to quantify the key attributes of the data, which helps in removing the data redundancy and inconsistency. The proposed framework then is evaluated using a real-world dataset collected from twelve car parks in a university. Simulation results show that the proposed framework performs well with a convincing classification accuracy.

A number of models and algorithms based on time series prediction and machine learning were applied to short-term traffic flow prediction and achieved good results. However, most of the models require the length of the input historical data to be predefined and static, which cannot automatically determine the optimal time lags. To overcome this shortage, a model called Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM RNN) is proposed in this paper, which takes advantages of the three multiplicative units in the memory block to determine the optimal time lags dynamically. The dataset from Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) is used for building the model and comparing LSTM RNN with several well-known models, such as random walk(RW), support vector machine(SVM), single layer feed forward neural network(FFNN) and stacked autoencoder(SAE). The results show that the proposed prediction model achieves higher accuracy and generalizes well.

Integrated with the equilibrium traffic flow, a comprehensive optimization strategy aiming at achieving siting and sizing planning of charging stations on the road network is presented in this paper. The system optimization model is used for generating and assigning the equilibrium traffic flow in typical time periods based on the original destination (OD) data. On this basis, queuing theory is used to deploy the capacity of each station in the alternative plan. Furthermore, an economic optimal planning model, including different types of cost functions, is proposed for the final decision, integrated with the proposed load capability constraint. Case studies have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed planning strategy.

Besides, applications of Intelligent Transport System like advanced Traffic Transport System dependents on proper utilization of road traffic state information. There are different factors affecting quality of road traffic state estimation activity-data collection technologies, state estimation models etc. Based on the analysis of relevant studies on road traffic state estimation, a framework dealing with In-vehicle mobile phone probe data along with a Neural Network estimation model to estimate traffic states on urban roads is proposed in this paper. The framework integrates several models with appropriate technologies to realize traffic data collection, processing, analysis, state estimation and optimization and presentation of traffic flow information to road users. To evaluate the framework, simulation data based on the microscopic simulator "Simulation of Urban Mobility" (SUMO) which is used to model the arterial road network and real world data using In-vehicle A-GPS mobile phone moving in all journey of a vehicle on the sample roads is used. Performance indicators RMSE and MPAE are used to evaluate ANN model and on average the MPAE is less than 1.2%. The trained ANN model is also used to estimate the sample road link speeds and compared with ground truth speed (aggregate edge states) on a 10-minute interval for 1hr. The estimation accuracy using MAE and estimation availability indicated that reliable link speed estimation can be generated and used to indicate real-time urban road traffic condition.

Multi-agent models such as MATSim (multi-agent transport simulation) have been highlighted for recent years as a solution to address these complex and microscopic simulation requirements. They are viewed as an emergent and collective behavior of agents, (i. e., vehicles). However, as the simulations scale up, their computational requirements could get increased beyond the capability of a single CPU and thus should be fulfilled with parallelization. Multithreading can partially contribute to parallelization by utilizing multi-cores, but cannot give full scalability of both CPU power and memory space. To support distributed-memory parallelization for multi-agent models, we have developed the MASS (multi-agent spatial simulation) library. This paper presents how to parallelize MATSim using the MASS library and demonstrates the library's portability and execution performance in practical transport simulations.

ADAPTIVE ROUTING AND GUIDANCE APPROACH FOR TRANSPORTATION EVACUATION	2015 WINTER SIMULATION CONFERENCE (WSC)	Winter Simulation Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)	DEC 06-09, 2015	Huntington Beach, CA				TIME-VARYING TRANSPORTATION; NETWORKS; PATHS	We propose an adaptive routing and guidance approach called Adjacent Node Score (ANS). This approach is integrated with an agent-based simulation model and avoids several common assumptions made in conventional evacuation models. ANS does not assume altruistic travelers and considers traffic interaction, variable link travel times, and their dependencies. This makes it more realistic than network flow models and stochastic routing algorithms. ANS can generate effective and good solutions at a low computational cost. It only requires local network information for routing and guidance. ANS can be easily implemented in practice. We test the ANS method on two networks and compare it with other four network routing strategies including the user-equilibrium condition, myopic, aggressive, and a naive strategy that is based on static network information. Experimental results show that ANS can disperse highly concentrated traffic flows and reduce network clearance time compared with other methods.

We simulate a metropolitan traffic flow for Tokyo and surrounding four prefectures with fine-grained traffic demand obtained from Tokyo Person Trip survey. Though this simulator has an ability to manage signal control, it is difficult to obtain the real signal data of the city. Without signal data, the behavior of vehicles in a city becomes too smooth because they do not stop at intersections. This causes differences in traffic volume distribution. In this paper, we introduce a virtual vehicle that appears virtually in the front of the lead vehicle on each road to achieve natural deceleration with a car following speed model. We evaluate the aggregated effect of the virtual vehicle by comparing simulated traffic volume and trip length with real traffic data including road traffic census and person trip survey data.

STG is a directed graph in which vertices and edges are associated with spatio-temporal properties (e.g. the traffic flow on a road and the geospatial location of an intersection). In this paper, we instantly detect interesting phenomena, entitled black holes and volcanos, from an STG. Specifically, a black hole is a subgraph (of an STG) that has the overall inflow greater than the overall outflow by a threshold, while a volcano is a subgraph with the overall outflow greater than the overall inflow by a threshold (detecting volcanos from an STG is proved to be equivalent to the detection of black holes). The online detection of black holes/volcanos can timely reflect anomalous events, such as disasters, catastrophic accidents, and therefore help keep public safety. The patterns of black holes/volcanos and the relations between them reveal human mobility patterns in a city, thus help formulate a better city planning or improve a system's operation efficiency. Based on a well-designed STG index, we propose a two-step black hole detection algorithm: The first step identifies a set of candidate grid cells to start from; the second step expands an initial edge in a candidate cell to a black hole and prunes other candidate cells after a black hole is detected. Then, we adapt this detection algorithm to a continuous black hole detection scenario. We evaluate our method based on Beijing taxicab data and the bike trip data in New York, finding urban anomalies and human mobility patterns.

These include, in addition to transport, handling and storage of goods, the management of inventory, and all related pickup and delivery operations. Traffic management and control deals with all operational aspects related to the traffic flow and (re)design of infrastructure. These aspects include the possibility to turn normal traffic lanes into reserved bus lanes or to define special routes to be operated only by freight transport. In this paper we discuss and model one of the effective management strategies for city logistics and traffic management in a metropolitan area. This strategy is based on a two-tiered system for which we propose an optimization model, in natural variables, and discuss some of its related challenges and solution approaches. We then propose an instance generator for this optimization model and show the solutions of one of these instances. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Data-driven modeling of transportation systems and traffic data analysis during a major power outage in the Netherlands	4TH INTERNATIONAL YOUNG SCIENTIST CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE	Procedia Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Young Scientists Conference on Computational Science (YSC)	JUN 25-JUL 03, 2015	Athens, GREECE			transportation systems; data-driven modeling; complex networks; traffic flow; multiscale modeling; traffic sensor data; power outage	ROAD NETWORKS; FLOW	Efficient methods and tools for road network planning and traffic management are critically important in the ever more urbanized world. The goal of our research is the development of a data-driven multiscale modeling approach for accurate simulation of road traffic in real-life transportation networks, with applications in real-time decision support systems and urban planning. This paper reviews the multiscale traffic models, describes the traffic sensor data collected from 25000 sensors along the arterial roads in the Netherlands, and discusses the applicability of sensor data to model calibration and validation on each modeling scale. We also present a road network graph model and the reconstructed Dutch road network. Finally, we show the results of traffic data analysis during the major power outage in North Holland on 27 March 2015, paying special attention to one of the most affected locations around the A9/E19 interchange near Amsterdam airport Schiphol.

It is the country with the 10th highest population density in the world. On average, it has 645 people per square kilometer. In its densest city, the population density reaches as high as 10,000 people per square kilometer. Limited by its terrain and economic and historical development, scooters are Taiwan's primary means of transportation. According to official statistics, Taiwan has a population of 23.37 million people with 15.14 million scooters and 7.18 million automobiles. Therefore, Taiwan's roads are filled with moving cars, scooters, and cars parked on the sides of roads. This results in door crash accidents. To prevent door crash accidents, observing the behavioral patterns of drivers opening car doors is essential. These observations facilitate a further understanding of how drivers note vehicles to the rear. In this study, we arranged 3 parking places and installed cameras on cars and electroencephalography devices on drivers to observe 17 subjects. The results indicate the following: 1. When opening their car doors, drivers note vehicles to their rear in one of the four models. 2. Because road width and traffic flow are low, drivers open their car doors directly with relatively poor attention. 3. Drivers who turn their heads to note vehicles to the rear from their left-rear windows spend more time opening their car doors and have relatively poor attention. Therefore, we make the following recommendations: 1. Taiwanese automobiles should have two-stage door opening mechanisms to force drivers to note vehicles to the rear. 2. Mirrors should collapse after drivers exit their cars. 3. Drivers should not turn their heads to note vehicles to the rear from their left-rear windows because the effectiveness of this model is poor. In the future, we will expand the scale of these experiments and improve the experimental analysis methods to enhance the quality of the experiments and truly provide a design reference for the avoidance of door crash accidents.

J	Tropea, M; Santamaria, AF				Tropea, Mauro; Santamaria, Amilcare Francesco			VEHICULAR TRAFFIC OPTIMIZATION IN VANETS: A PROPOSAL FOR NODES RE-ROUTING AND CONGESTION REDUCTION	ADVANCES IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						802.11p; congestion; DSRC; traffic flow; VANET; WAVE	NETWORKS	Recently, vehicular networking has grown up in terms of interest and transmission capability, due to the possibility of exploiting the distributed communication paradigm in a mobile scenario, where moving nodes are represented by vehicles. The different existing standards for vehicular ad-hoc networks, such as DSRC, WAVE/IEEE 802.11p, have given to the research community the possibility of developing new MAC and routing schemes, in order to enhance the quality and the comfort of mobile users who are driving their vehicles. In this paper, we focus our attention on the optimization of vehicular traffic flowing, where the vehicle-2-roadside device is available. As shown in the next sections, the proposed idea exploits the information that is gathered by road-side units with the main aim of redirecting traffic flows (in terms of vehicles) to less congested roads, with an overall system optimization, also in terms of Carbon Dioxide emissions reduction. Several campaigns of simulations have been carried out to give more effectiveness to our proposal.

Fuzzy modeling of freeway accident duration with rainfall and traffic flow interactions	ANALYTIC METHODS IN ACCIDENT RESEARCH			English	Article						Accident duration; Traffic and environmental variables; Multivariate analysis; Fuzzy modeling	INCIDENT DETECTION; SYSTEM APPROACH; FREQUENCY; FORECAST	Accident duration modeling has been considered as a difficult problem due to the variety of information (accident characteristics, traffic and weather information, geometry of the accident location and so on) that should be taken into account to improve predictions and explain the phenomenon. We introduce Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems to model freeway accident duration and cope with the uncertainties and complexities hindering in accident monitoring systems. The models are also compared to classical hazard-based regression models, as well as Multi-Layer Perceptrons. Results show that a Fuzzy Rule-Based System may predict accident duration with fair accuracy using limited information on traffic and weather conditions. Introducing the entire amount of information on accidents to the Fuzzy Rule-Based System leads to reduced modeling accuracy, probably due to the difficulties in converging to a solution. Nevertheless, the Fuzzy Rule-Based System with limited information may predict more accurately than classical hazard based duration models and with comparable accuracy to a Multi-Layer Perceptron, which is presented with information on accident characteristics, traffic and weather conditions, as well as the geometry of the accident location.

THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN TRAFFIC FLOW ON MAMMAL ROAD KILL COUNTS	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						traffic mortality; road kill; mammal monitoring	EASTERN BARRED BANDICOOT; PERAMELES GUNNII; NEW-ZEALAND; ABUNDANCE; TRENDS; TASMANIA; INDEX	It is estimated that one million wild animals are killed on UK roads each year and these casualties are potentially a valuable source of data relating to the size and distribution of populations. Road kill surveys have the potential to form the basis of a nationwide mammal monitoring scheme with multi-species coverage and excellent area sampling. However it has been argued that road casualty counts cannot be used to monitor population change because variation in the number of road deaths is related more to variation in traffic flow than to population density. We used rabbit and hedgehog as study species to examine if there was a relationship between traffic flow and road kill counts. We found no correlation between changes in traffic flow and road counts of hedgehog or rabbit. We conclude that a decrease in road kill counts of these species is highly likely to represent a decrease in absolute abundance and would therefore be a good index with which to monitor population decline.

Advantages of a city-scale emission inventory for urban air quality research and policy: the case of Nanjing, a typical industrial city in the Yangtze River Delta, China	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							ANTHROPOGENIC ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTANTS; CARBONACEOUS AEROSOLS; TROPOSPHERIC NO2; NITROGEN-OXIDES; CO2 EMISSIONS; TRENDS; QUANTIFICATION; POLLUTION; BOTTOM; REGION	With most eastern Chinese cities facing major air quality challenges, there is a strong need for city-scale emission inventories for use in both chemical transport modeling and the development of pollution control policies. In this paper, a high-resolution emission inventory (with a horizontal resolution of 3 x 3 km) of air pollutants and CO2 for Nanjing, a typical large city in the Yangtze River Delta, is developed, incorporating the best available information on local sources. Emission factors and activity data at the unit or facility level are collected and compiled using a thorough on-site survey of major sources. Over 900 individual plants, which account for 97% of the city's total coal consumption, are identified as point sources, and all of the emission-related parameters including combustion technology, fuel quality, and removal efficiency of air pollution control devices (APCD) are analyzed. New data-collection approaches including continuous emission monitoring systems and real-time monitoring of traffic flows are employed to improve spatiotemporal distribution of emissions. Despite fast growth of energy consumption between 2010 and 2012, relatively small interannual changes in emissions are found for most air pollutants during this period, attributed mainly to benefits of growing APCD deployment and the comparatively strong and improving regulatory oversight of the large point sources that dominate the levels and spatial distributions of Nanjing emissions overall. The improvement of this city-level emission inventory is indicated by comparisons with observations and other inventories at larger spatial scale. Relatively good spatial correlations are found for SO2, NOx, and CO between the city-scale emission estimates and concentrations at nine state-operated monitoring sites (R = 0.58, 0.46, and 0.61, respectively). The emission ratios of specific pollutants including BC to CO, OC to EC, and CO2 to CO compare well to top-down constraints from ground observations. The interannual variability and spatial distribution of NOx emissions are consistent with NO2 vertical column density measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). In particular, the Nanjing city-scale emission inventory correlates better with satellite observations than the downscaled Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) does when emissions from power plants are excluded. This indicates improvement in emission estimation for sectors other than power generation, notably industry and transportation. A high-resolution emission inventory may also provide a basis to consider the quality of instrumental observations. To further improve emission estimation and evaluation, more measurements of both emission factors and ambient levels of given pollutants are suggested; the uncertainties of emission inventories at city scale should also be fully quantified and compared with those at national scale.

Traffic Flow Control in the Class of Distributed Parameters Systems	CYBERNETICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Fractional structures with a spatial transition of the projection; redictive systems with distributed parameters; fractional approximated dimension control		In this paper a new structure and a method are suggested for the design of a control system with a distributed parameters plant. The discussed system with distributed spatial dimensions substantially differs from the control systems with concentrated parameters plants, because in it the task of the plant spatial transition of the controlled distributed variables is structurally solved. The solution of this task is based on the usage of models and filters, included in its structure and an algorithm, through which the system has real capability for distributed plants control with the desired quality. In the paper a fractal predictive system with approximated dimensions of the spatial distribution for control of the transport traffic density in highways is designed for a particular numerical example. The system model is simulated. The characteristics of the designed system are illustrated and analyzed.

J	Lu, HP; Sun, ZY; Qu, WC				Lu, Hua-pu; Sun, Zhi-yuan; Qu, Wen-cong			Big Data-Driven Based Real-Time Traffic Flow State Identification and Prediction	DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY			English	Article								With the rapid development of urban informatization, the era of big data is coming. To satisfy the demand of traffic congestion early warning, this paper studies the method of real-time traffic flow state identification and prediction based on big data-driven theory. Traffic big data holds several characteristics, such as temporal correlation, spatial correlation, historical correlation, and multistate. Traffic flow state quantification, the basis of traffic flow state identification, is achieved by a SAGA-FCM (simulated annealing genetic algorithm based fuzzy c-means) based traffic clustering model. Considering simple calculation and predictive accuracy, a bilevel optimization model for regional traffic flow correlation analysis is established to predict traffic flow parameters based on temporal-spatial-historical correlation. A two-stage model for correction coefficients optimization is put forward to simplify the bilevel optimization model. The first stage model is built to calculate the number of temporal-spatial-historical correlation variables. The second stage model is present to calculate basic model formulation of regional traffic flow correlation. A case study based on a real-world road network in Beijing, China, is implemented to test the efficiency and applicability of the proposed modeling and computing methods.

J	Zhou, D; Jin, S; Ma, DF; Wang, DH				Zhou, Dan; Jin, Sheng; Ma, Dongfang; Wang, Dianhai			Modeling Mixed Bicycle Traffic Flow: A Comparative Study on the Cellular Automata Approach	DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY			English	Article							STATES	Simulation, as a powerful tool for evaluating transportation systems, has been widely used in transportation planning, management, and operations. Most of the simulation models are focused on motorized vehicles, and the modeling of nonmotorized vehicles is ignored. The cellular automata (CA) model is a very important simulation approach and is widely used for motorized vehicle traffic. The Nagel-Schreckenberg (NS) CA model and the multivalue CA (M-CA) model are two categories of CA model that have been used in previous studies on bicycle traffic flow. This paper improves on these two CA models and also compares their characteristics. It introduces a two-lane NS CA model and M-CA model for both regular bicycles (RBs) and electric bicycles (EBs). In the research for this paper, many cases, featuring different values for the slowing down probability, lane-changing probability, and proportion of EBs, were simulated, while the fundamental diagrams and capacities of the proposed models were analyzed and compared between the two models. Field data were collected for the evaluation of the two models. The results show that the M-CA model exhibits more stable performance than the two-lane NS model and provides results that are closer to real bicycle traffic.

The candidate's set of explanatory parameters were: traffic flow parameters, geometric infrastructure characteristics and pavement conditions. Statistical analysis is done by SPSS on the basis of nonlinear regression modeling and during the analysis, principal components are identified to assist the principal component analysis method and more important variables recognized that could indicate the best description of crash occurrence on the basis of available logics. Results indicate that the number of accidents per year increase with: length, peak hour volume and longitudinal slope whereas it decreases with radius. The presented models show that the crashes occurrence increase with the increase in each of section length, peak hour volume and longitudinal slope variables whereas it is decreased with the decrease of curvature. The remarkable result in this study was the effect of longitudinal slope variable on the crash occurrence.

It performs remarkably better than the least square fitting and the local spatial context based methods. Some interesting phenomena have been observed in the experiments: (1) In general, hundreds of sensors distributed on the whole road network are relevant to a prediction task, which implies a much wider correlation range than what was assumed previously. (2) The number of relevant sensors is subject to the targeted sensor undergoing prediction due to location-specific network topology. (3) The spatial correlation scale increases with the increment of time lag while the performance degradation is less than that of the local spatial context based methods. As the scope of human mobility is subject to time lag, identifying the varying spatial context against time lag is crucial for prediction.

In order to depict the real car-following behaviors better, in this paper we present a new car-following model by introducing the minimum safe distance and proposing the concepts of maximum escape speed (MES) after taking into account the leading vehicle position in the road and the impact of the centerline separation between the leading vehicle and the following vehicle on the car-following behavior, extending the car following model into two-dimensional model. Finally, the numerical simulation analysis was made using the built model by the Matlab simulation platform. It is found that required minimum safety distance of the presented model is less than the base models did for the conventional car following case. Meanwhile, the model can describe some macroscopic phenomena in the actual traffic flow and can improve effectively the road capacity and smooth.

The different luminance requirements of different zones of highway tunnel were identified on the basis of the analysis of tunnel lighting considering drivers' visually self-accommodating physiological function for luminance change. Taken Huashuyan Tunnel of G109 Highway located in Hohhot of Inner Mongolia in China as the case study, the system design of solar optical fiber lighting for enhanced lighting in threshold zone of highway tunnel was made. It was indicated through calculation that the design length of solar optical fiber enhanced lighting was related to the design speed, longitudinal slope, and overhead clearance of the tunnel, and the design luminance of solar optical fiber enhanced lighting was related to the luminance outside the tunnel, the design speed, and the design traffic flow of the tunnel. Luminance analysis of the solar optical fiber lighting system of Huashuyan Tunnel was made based on the on-site experiment. Also, the 3D illuminance simulation results by DIALux software were made to indicate that the solar optical fiber lighting system in Huashuyan Tunnel still well met the enhanced lighting demand even not considering the contribution of LED lighting.

To capture the complex interactions between these two types of vehicles, a novel occupancy rule is adopted in the proposed model to consider the variable lateral distances of mixed vehicular traffic. Based on massive simulations, microscopic fundamental diagrams under different bicycle densities are devised. With these, the bicycle's spilling behavior is then investigated and discussed. In order to reflect the interference of a bicycle on a car, the interference transformation from friction state to block state is modeled explicitly. Finally, different simulation results under different occupancy rules indicate that the constant and fixed occupancy rule adopted in the previous studies might lead to overestimation of car flux in the heterogeneous traffic flows with different bicycle densities.

Therefore, the structure of road networks the pattern by which roads are connected can affect the safety of non-motorized road users. To understand the impact of roads' structural features on pedestrian and bicyclist safety, this study analyzes the associations between road network structure and non-motorist-involved crashes using data from 321 census tracts in Alameda County, California. Average geodesic distance, network betweenness centrality, and an overall clustering coefficient were calculated to quantify the structure of road networks. Three statistical models were developed using the geographically weighted regression (GWR) technique for the three structural factors, in addition to other zonal factors including traffic behavior, land use, transportation facility, and demographic features. The results indicate that longer average geodesic distance, higher network betweenness centrality, and a larger overall clustering coefficient were related to fewer non-motorist-involved accidents. Thus, results suggest that: (1) if a network is more highly centered on major roads, there will be fewer non-motorist-involyed crashes; (2) a network with a greater average number of intersections on the shortest path connecting each pair of roads tends to experience fewer crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists; and (3) the more clustered road networks are into several sub-core networks, the lower the non-motorist crash count. The three structural measurements can reflect the configuration of a network so that it can be used in other network analyses. More information about the types of road network structures that are conducive to non-motorist traffic safety can help to guide the design of new networks and the retrofitting of existing networks. The estimation results of GWR models explain the spatial heterogeneity of correlations between explanatory factors and non-motorist crashes, which can support regional agencies in establishing local safety policies.

Abd			DEVELOPMENT OF A REALISTIC DRIVING BEHAVIOR BY MEANS OF FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM	JURNAL TEKNOLOGI			English	Article						Microscopic traffic flow model; intelligent vehicle; Fuzzy Inference System (FIS); realistic decision module		Realistic traffic flow simulation is possible when the vehicles inside the simulation are able to mimic human driving behavior. In view of this, this paper will discuss the implementation of fuzzy logic inside the Behavior Model framework with the intention to develop intelligent simulated vehicles. This Behavior Model consists of three different units, namely; Vision and Perception, Decision and Motion Control Unit. Vision and Perception Unit acts as the eyes for the intelligent vehicle. Decision Unit will decide the maneuvering decision. Finally, Motion Control Unit will transfer the decision into motion. However, the implementation of fuzzy logic with the integration of fuzzy rules and defuzzification techniques is done in the first and second units. This Behavior Model is controlled by two sets of fuzzy inference systems (FIS) which are free flow vehicles following and changing lanes. The finding of this research shows that the Behavior Model with fuzzy logic is able to create an intelligent vehicle that is able to self-maneuveri inside the traffic flows, realistically.

Impact of Multilane Median Openings Zone on Travel Speed	JURNAL TEKNOLOGI			English	Article						U-turn facility; median openings; highway; travel speed; flow		Thispaperaims to assess the impact of median openings zone of travel speed. Median openings or Midblock U-turn facilities are often constructed to provide motorists with detour option in circumstances where traffic conflict manoeuvres are eminent and prevalent. In previous studies, it has been shown that median openings will reduce the number of conflicts at relevant intersection. Hence median openings were built on multilane highways in Malaysia. Theirconstruction provoked debate on safety and traffic flow impediment issues. Based on the hypothesis that multilane median openings would cause travel speed reduction; an impact study was carried out at selected sites in Johor, Malaysia during daylight and dry weather conditions. Traffic volume, speed, and vehicle types were collected per road section for two directions continuously for eight weeks. The survey data were supplemented with highway design information culled from the Malaysian Public Works Departments manual. Travel speeds at median opening zone were estimated for both directional traffic flows. Results show significant decrease in travel speed of up to54.2% at the diverging section of the median openings zone. A slight drop of about 5% resulted from median openings zone at the merging section. The paper concluded that median openings zone facilities irrespective of their traffic conflicts minimisation merits will trigger significant travel speed reduction.

However, such systems require intelligent and effective route planning solutions to reduce travel time and promote stable traveling speeds. To achieve such goal these systems should account for both estimated and real-time traffic congestion states, but obtaining reliable traffic congestion estimations for all the streets/avenues in a city for the different times of the day, for every day in a year, is a complex task. Modeling such a tremendous amount of data can be time-consuming and, additionally, centralized computation of optimal routes based on such time-dependencies has very high data processing requirements. In this paper we approach this problem through a heuristic to considerably reduce the modeling effort while maintaining the benefits of time-dependent traffic congestion modeling. In particular, we propose grouping streets by taking into account real traces describing the daily traffic pattern. The effectiveness of this heuristic is assessed for the city of Valencia, Spain, and the results obtained show that it is possible to reduce the required number of daily traffic flow patterns by a factor of 4210 while maintaining the essence of time-dependent modeling requirements.

The action "Noise and vibration control at source - Acoustically green vehicles" validates noise score rating models in a case in the Athens area, including Q-Zones (Quiet zones) and embedded parks, identifying perceived benefits on noise. Annoyance for PTW (powered two-wheeler) is masked in general traffic annoyance. However, a PTW pass may become recognizable and clearly distinct within the traffic noise environment formed by the road traffic flow and synthesis. Several strategic noise mapping scenarios with high noise levels from PTWs, as well as low frequency noise annoy ance events, were evaluated proving that the noise levels in a Q-Zone and embedded parks may be reduced with an increased park capacity. Measures with a special focus on the reduction of conventionally powered motorbikes and scooters (PTWs) were evaluated. PTW's emission values were derived, from known values and past measurements, in the form of a correction function as a function of speed to perform simulation analysis for various analogies of conventionally versus electrically driven PTWs. Relevant noise difference maps indicate noise reductions, especially when additional measures are included, such as speed limits.

The phase diagrams showing different traffic states are presented. The effect of strength of bottleneck has been analyzed, and it is found that the strength parameter has no qualitative effect in the explicit case while has considerable effect in the implicit case. Furthermore, the results of both the approaches are compared, and the consistency between them is discussed.

Firstly, we build a cell transmission model (CTM) for freeway traffic. After that, we design several ramp controllers based upon CTM and feedback control method, and give the optimization process of a genetic algorithm in detail for optimizing the PI parameters. Finally, we simulate the ramp controllers by computer. Simulation reveals that the ramp metering controllers based on genetic algorithm optimization are of good performance. This control method can stabilize traffic flow as well as improve traffic situations.

Different Intelligent Transport System applications like advanced Traffic Transport System are dependent on proper road traffic state information. Among the different activities in road traffic flow estimation, road traffic data collection plays the great role. The current state-of-the-practice road traffic data collection tools used to gather information about traffic flow are fixed sensor technologies which are limited in road coverage and affected by maintenance and deployment costs. Using the existing cellular network infrastructure to gather road traffic data offers large coverage capability and it is faster to set up, easier to install and needs less maintenance. Based on the analysis of relevant studies on road traffic state estimation, this paper proposes a universal framework based on experimentally evaluated hybrid Assisted Global Positioning System (A-GPS) and Uplink Time Difference Of Arrival (U-TDOA) real-time road traffic data collection system. The framework integrates several models with appropriate technologies to realize traffic data collection, processing, analysis, state estimation and optimization and presentation of traffic flow information to road users. In Data analysis component a new approach of taking probe sample, i.e. dynamic "Pinpoint-Temporal" sampling frequency method is proposed.

Starting with an analysis of the relevance of noise attenuation factors, function of the distance and the type of sources, it was decided to explore the sensitivity of the acoustic model with respect to weather conditions, in suburban context, and vehicular traffic flow conditions, in urban context. The noise calculation algorithm adopted is XPS 31-133/NMPB. The sensitivity of the model with respect to the occurrence of favourable or homogeneous weather conditions, has been assessed through repeated simulations in which only weather conditions vary. The refraction of sound rays in the atmosphere layers (favourable conditions) results in a greater persistence of the sound wave near the ground and therefore in a greater interaction with it. Hence the characteristics of land cover appear to be a discriminating factor to evaluate the influence of weather conditions on noise propagation. Several scenarios have been simulated calculating noise levels at an array of receptors with varying weather conditions, ground type and relative source-receiver height. Source conditions were instead kept constant. The results can guide the acquisition of local weather information required in the simulation process according to the different weather conditions settings. In urban areas instead, traffic flow conditions have a direct influence on the sound power of the road source. Through different scenarios, the relationship between sound power of road source is then calculated in function of: type of flow (continuous, accelerated, decelerated and interrupted), percentage of heavy vehicles, average speed.

The operations involve the collection of temporal trends of noise levels in order to create a statistically significant sample for post-processing analysis. The monitoring activities encompass the following steps: - collection and selection of previous noise data concerning the road sources; - identification and selection of monitoring sites based on specific criteria such as road geometric characteristics, the functional road classification (A, D, E, F), the type of traffic, the absence of other noise sources, etc.; - acquisition of the acoustic data by weekday using various types of units for the long-term noise monitoring; - correlation of acoustic data with weather data and deletion of data when levels of rainfall and wind speed exceeding threshold values; - identification and removal of abnormal events through sonogram analysis; - acquisition of series of equivalent sound levels, measured on different time intervals: 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 60 minutes; - acquisition of traffic flow data related to road stretches, via statistical modeling or on-site measurements. All acquired data are stored in a geodatabase useful for further processing, such as cluster analysis and the development of an acoustic model for the city of Milan. The acquisition of noise data will also provide useful indications to size a monitoring network of low-cost sensors, one of the main target of the DYNAMAP project.

Considering the increasing number of circulating electric vehicles in urban cities, pedestrian safety represents a significant deal for local and global authorities. The difficulty to recognize the approaching electric vehicles at lower speeds has already been investigated by the research community, both for blind and sighted people. Few indications were instead provided to assess the changes in pedestrian perception when more electric vehicles are driven on urban roads. In this paper a simulation of a futuristic scenario, characterized by only electric vehicles, was performed in an immersive virtual reality environment: the research aim was focused on the assessment of possible variations in the behaviour of sighted pedestrians at a road crossing when more electric vehicles were approached from two different road sides, in different speed and traffic flows conditions. For the audio-video simulation, the car fleet was consisted of all compact electric vehicles.

Although the issue has been studied previously, most existing work focus on arterial roads only, where sensors are configured closely for collecting complete real-time data. For collector roads where sensors sparsely cover, however, speed predictions are often ignored. With GPS-equipped floating car signals being available nowadays, we aim at forecasting collector road speeds by utilizing these signals. The main challenge compared with arterial roads comes from the missing data. In a time slot of the real case, over 90% of collector roads cannot be covered by enough floating cars. Thus most traditional approaches for arterial roads, relying on complete historical data, cannot be employed directly. Aiming at solving this problem, we propose a multi-view road speed prediction framework. In the first view, temporal patterns are modeled by a layered hidden Markov model; and in the second view, spatial patterns are modeled by a collective matrix factorization model. The two models are learned and inferred simultaneously in a co-regularized manner. Experiments conducted in the Beijing road network, based on 10K taxi signals in 2 years, have demonstrated that the approach outperforms traditional approaches by 10% in MAE and RMSE.

The aim of the study is to increase the environmental safety of road transport by establishing patterns of its influence on the formation of mass emissions of heavy metals taking into account the seasonal conditions and on this basis to develop calculation methods for charge for the environmental pollution. The object of the study is the process of heavy metal pollution of roadside areas in the operation of road transport. The subject of the study is the patterns of change in mass emissions of heavy metals from cars in the roadside areas, depending on the seasonal conditions of vehicle operation. Results of the studies: the patterns of formation of heavy metal mass emissions, taking into account the seasonal variations in the ambient temperature and parameters of the traffic flow (speed and intensity), have been established; the mathematical models of the effect of ambient temperature, speed and intensity of the traffic flow on changes in the concentration of heavy metals in the roadside areas have been developed; the numerical values of the mathematical models parameters have been experimentally determined. The practical value of the work is to develop methods for calculating charge for soil contamination by road transport taking into account the ambient temperature, speed and intensity of the traffic flow.

A non-continuum lumped-parameter dynamic model applied to Indian traffic	SYSTEMS SCIENCE & CONTROL ENGINEERING			English	Article						dynamic traffic flow modelling; lumped-parameter approach; extended Kalman filter; real-time traffic state estimation	EXTENDED KALMAN FILTER; FLOW; DENSITY	Dynamic traffic flow models are essential for obtaining information about the time evolution of variables describing the traffic flow phenomena and have a critical role in the development and implementation of real-time applications such as Intelligent Transportation Systems. Macroscopic traffic flow models that treat the traffic as a continuum are preferred for such applications. But, existing macroscopic models characterize homogeneous traffic, and may not be directly applicable to capture the vehicle heterogeneity seen on Indian roads. To address this issue, a non-continuum macroscopic dynamic traffic flow model based on the lumped-parameter approach was developed in this study. The model was developed based on the conservation of vehicles equation and a dynamic speed equation, incorporating an empirically developed traffic stream model, which is an important contribution of this study. Using this model, an estimation scheme has been developed based on the Kalman filtering technique to estimate traffic states in real time. The proposed scheme was implemented and corroborated for the heterogeneous traffic conditions existing in India. The performance of this scheme has been evaluated and the results obtained have been found to be promising.

A Model of Car-Following Behavior at Sags	TRAFFIC AND GRANULAR FLOW '13			English	Proceedings Paper	Traffic and Granular Flow	SEP 25-27, 2013	Julich, GERMANY				TRAFFIC FLOW	Sags are bottlenecks in freeway networks. The main reason is that the increase in slope has a negative effect on vehicle acceleration, which results in local changes in car-following behavior that reduce traffic flow capacity. Existing car-following models are not able to reproduce the acceleration behavior of drivers at sags and the resulting traffic flow dynamics in a sufficiently realistic way. This paper presents a new car-following model that aims to fill that gap. The model assumes that drivers have a limited ability to compensate for the negative effect that an increase in gradient has on vehicle acceleration. Compensation is assumed to be linear over time; the maximum compensation rate is defined as a parameter. The paper presents the results of a case study using the proposed car-following model. The study site is a particular sag in Japan. Similar traffic flow patterns are observed in simulation and in empirical data from that site. In particular, the model generates a bottleneck caused by the increase in freeway slope, reproducing its location very accurately.

Real time traffic flow outlier detection using short-term traffic conditional variance prediction	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Outlier detection; Intervention analysis; Traffic flow series; Short term traffic forecasting; SARIMA plus GARCH; Kalman filter	PARAMETERS; MODEL	Outliers in traffic flow series represent uncommon events occurring in the roadway systems and outlier detection and investigation will help to unravel the mechanism of such events. However, studies on outlier detection and investigations are fairly limited in transportation field where a vast volume of traffic condition data has been collected from traffic monitoring devices installed in many roadway systems. Based on an online algorithm that has the ability of jointly predict the level and the conditional variance of the traffic flow series, a real time outlier detection method is proposed and implemented. Using real world data collected from four regions in both the United States and the United Kingdom, it was found that outliers can be detected using the proposed detection strategy. In addition, through a comparative experimental study, it was shown that the information contained in the outliers should be assimilated into the forecasting system to enhance its ability of adapting to the changing patterns of the traffic flow series. Moreover, the investigation into the effects of outliers on the forecasting system structure showed a significant connection between the outliers and the forecasting system parameters changes. General conclusions are provided concerning the analyses with future work recommended to investigate the underlying outlier generating mechanism and outlier treatment strategy in transportation applications.

How to combine different microsimulation tools to assess the environmental impacts of road traffic? Lessons and directions	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Integrated simulation platform; Road traffic; Microscopic traffic models; Emission; Simulation scenarios	INTEGRATED MODELING APPROACH; VEHICLE EMISSIONS; SIMULATION-MODEL; TIME; EXPOSURE; MOVES	In the last decades, traffic microsimulation platforms have a growing complexity allowing a detailed description of vehicle traffic dynamics in a second-by-second basis. However, to project spatially their outputs, some precautions must be followed. Therefore, we analyze some variables used in the microscopic traffic models which have a high impact on further applications, especially when a spatial projection is required. To assess these objectives, a microsimulation framework which includes traffic and emission models was defined to characterize traffic flows and to evaluate vehicular emissions. This general methodology was then applied in a European medium sized city using two scenarios: (i) considering a Lagrangian approach and (ii) using an Eulerian approach of the simulation road traffic platform. The Lagrangian approach shows that if we have long links (some hundred meters, e.g. >500 m), we lose the spatial detail on emissions. On the other hand, using the Eulerian approach to define very small links (some few meters, e.g. <30 m), a significant statistic representation of traffic dynamics, in that link, was not obtained, particularly in areas with low traffic flow. The latter situation can occur because the vehicle speed can be high enough that did not allow recording any information in that link, even considering a high time resolution analysis (second-by-second). Thus, a non-linear trend of the error is identified when such data are analyzed geographically. Accordingly, depending on the use of those microsimulation tools, we identify some best practices related with the traffic model design that must be followed to minimize those errors.

We compared the performances of eight roundabout types, differing in geometric layout, number of lanes and traffic flow regulation from each other, with regard to vehicle delays and CO2, NOx, PM2.5 and PM10 pollutant emissions. Recently-designed roundabouts - target roundabouts and flyover roundabouts - have also been studied for their undoubted practical interest. By means of closed-form capacity models and CORINAIR methodology, several traffic simulations were carried out to examine a typical annual traffic demand curve in a suburban context, three different distribution test matrices for traffic flows (rho 1, rho 2, rho 3) and maximum annual traffic flow values Q(max) ranging between 1300 and 3300 veh/h. Estimating vehicle delays and annual pollutant emissions, along with construction and management costs, allowed obtaining overall costs for each roundabout examined, in function of traffic demand and several other parameters.

Dynamic Traffic Flow Model for Travel Time Estimation	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Travel time, as a fundamental measurement for intelligent transportation systems, is becoming increasingly important. Because of the wide deployment of fixed-point detectors on freeways, if travel time can be accurately estimated from point detector data, the indirect estimation method is cost-effective and widely applicable. This paper presents a modified dynamic traffic flow model for accurately estimating the travel time of freeway links under transition and congestion conditions with fixed-point detector data. The modified estimation model is based on a thorough analysis of the dynamic traffic flow model. The applications and the limitations of the model are analyzed for theory, equation derivation, and modifications. Through a simulation study and real traffic data, the (modified) dynamic models are compared according to performance measurements. A comparison of the estimated results and measurement errors shows the accuracy of the modified dynamic model for estimating the travel times of freeway links under transition and congestion traffic conditions.

Empirical Longitudinal Driving Behavior in Authority Transitions Between Adaptive Cruise Control and Manual Driving	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							SIMULATOR	Automated vehicles are expected to have a substantial impact on traffic flow efficiency, safety levels, and levels of emissions. However, field operational tests suggest that drivers may prefer to disengage adaptive cruise control (ACC) and resume manual control in dense traffic conditions and for maneuvers such as changing lanes. These so-called authority transitions can have substantial effects on traffic flow. To gain insight into these effects, a better understanding is needed of the relationships between these transitions, longitudinal dynamics of vehicles, and behavioral adaptations of drivers. In this context, a driving simulator experiment was set up to gain insight into the effects of authority transitions between ACC and manual driving on longitudinal dynamics of vehicles. Participants were assigned randomly to one of three conditions. In the control condition, participants drove manually. In the first experimental condition, a sensor failure was simulated at a specific location where drivers were expected to resume manual control. In the second experimental condition, drivers switched ACC off and on by pressing a button whenever they desired. Statistical tests indicated that the distributions of speed, acceleration, and time headway differed significantly between the three conditions. In the first experimental condition, the speed dropped after the sensor failure, and the time headway increased after the discretionary reactivation of ACC. These results seem to be consistent with previous findings and suggest that authority transitions between ACC and manual driving may significantly influence the longitudinal dynamics of vehicles and potentially mitigate the expected benefits of ACC on traffic flow efficiency.

For that reason merging models are an important component of microscopic traffic simulation. In this paper an asymmetric two lanes cellular automata (CA) model with an on-ramp for traffic flow simulation is presented. The model takes into account mechanical restrictions of vehicles and drivers psychological behavior and preserves the computational simplicity of CA traffic models. The aim is to explore the usefulness of CA to model and simulate properly the access of vehicles from onramps to the main lanes of a road. Extensive simulation results indicate that CA models can adequately capture the complexity, in terms of traffic phases, of on-ramp merging in real traffic and reproduce the bottlenecks induced by large volumes of traffic flow demanding access to the road.

This paper proposes a methodology for testing optimal public transport (PT) to passenger car (PC) usage ratios in order to reduce negative environmental impacts and external costs as a part of social costs by implementing proposed transport policy measures. The effects of different city transport policies on the total transport demand of PC and PT during morning peak period in Novi Sad, Serbia, were tested through a traffic macroscopic simulation procedure. Traffic flow distribution outputs were used to estimate external costs and pollution emissions in proposed current situation scenarios. The results of this study enable the development of sustainable transport strategies through identification of different combinations of mobility management measures that would produce desired outcomes.

The numerical results illustrate that battery exchange will produce one prominent starting process at the upstream of the charging station and one prominent braking process at the downstream of the charging station and enhance each vehicle's running time and the system's total running time and that the influences of battery exchange on each vehicle's driving behavior (including the starting and braking processes, the personal running time and the system's total running time) are directly related to each vehicle's arrival rate at the origin, the electric vehicle's proportion and each electric vehicle's series number in the vehicle fleet. The results can help traffic engineer to reasonably design the on-line charging station and optimize each vehicle's arrival rate at the origin. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, X; Sun, JQ				Li, Xiang; Sun, Jian-Qiao			Effect of interactions between vehicles and pedestrians on fuel consumption and emissions	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Vehicle following model; Pedestrian crossing model; Interaction of vehicle and pedestrian; Fuel consumption; Emissions	MICRO-SIMULATION; JAMMING TRANSITION; TRAFFIC DYNAMICS; NARROW CHANNEL; WALKING SPEED; BEHAVIOR; MODEL	This paper presents a study of variations of fuel consumption and emissions of vehicles due to random street crossings of pedestrians. The pedestrian and vehicle movement models as well as the interaction model between the two entities are presented. Extensive numerical simulations of single and multiple cars are carried out to investigate the traffic flow rate, vehicle average speed, fuel consumption, CO, HC and NOx emissions. Generally more noncompliant road-crossings of pedestrians lead to higher level of fuel consumptions and emissions of vehicles, and the traffic situation can be improved by imposing higher vehicle speed limit to some extent. Different traffic characteristics in low and high vehicle density regions are studied. The traffic flow is more influenced by crossing pedestrians in the low vehicle density region, while in the high vehicle density region, the interactions among vehicles dominate. The main contribution of this paper lies in the qualitative analysis of the impact of the interactions between pedestrians and vehicles on the traffic, its energy economy and emissions.

J	Hill, G; Bell, M; Blythe, P				Hill, Graeme; Bell, Margaret; Blythe, Phil			Quantifying a cellular automata simulation of electric vehicles	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow; Cellular automata; Electric Vehicles; Simulation model		Within this work the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NS) cellular automata is used to simulate a basic cyclic road network. Results from SwitchEV, a real world Electric Vehicle trial which has collected more than two years of detailed electric vehicle data, are used to quantify the results of the NS automata, demonstrating similar power consumption behavior to that observed in the experimental results. In particular the efficiency of the electric vehicles reduces as the vehicle density increases, due in part to the reduced efficiency of EVs at low speeds, but also due to the energy consumption inherent in changing speeds. Further work shows the results from introducing spatially restricted speed restriction. In general it can be seen that induced congestion from spatially transient events propagates back through the road network and alters the energy and efficiency profile of the simulated vehicles, both before and after the speed restriction. Vehicles upstream from the restriction show a reduced energy usage and an increased efficiency, and vehicles downstream show an initial large increase in energy usage as they accelerate away from the speed restriction.

Effects of Operation Time of Pavement and Traffic Flow on the Traffic Noise of the Highways in an Urban Area	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						acoustic measurement; traffic noise; highway pavement; traffic flow; noise pollution; traffic noise pressure	MODEL; SWAT	In developed as well as less developed countries, traffic noise is one of the main sources of societal noise pollution. In this research, a series of field experiments are conducted on highways with new and old pavements. The variations of the traffic flow and traffic noise pressure levels together with the functional relationship between them are analyzed based on the noise data collected from the highways in an urban area. With the collected data, the maximum traffic flow and traffic noise pressure levels are determined in a time specified manner. Logarithmic functional relationships are found between the traffic noise pressure level and traffic flow for both the old and new pavements. It is also found in the research, the improvement in the road re-pavement may promote the absorption of the traffic noise. A single value index is developed for quantitatively and conveniently evaluating the acoustic quality of highways. The findings in this research may give some inspiration for construction and management of low noise highways.	[Huang, K.; Dai, L. M.] Univ Regina, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [Dai, L.

J	Zhou, LZ; Zhong, SQ; Ma, SF; Jia, N				Zhou, Lizhen; Zhong, Shiquan; Ma, Shoufeng; Jia, Ning			Prospect theory based estimation of drivers' risk attitudes in route choice behaviors	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Route choice behavior; Prospect theory; Parameter estimation; Risk attitudes	PROBABILITY WEIGHTING FUNCTION; PARAMETER-FREE ELICITATION; TRAVEL-TIME UNCERTAINTY; DECISION; INFORMATION; GUIDANCE; MODEL; HETEROGENEITY; VARIABILITY; RELIABILITY	This paper applied prospect theory (PT) to describe drivers' route choice behavior under Variable Message Sign (VMS), which presented visual traffic information to assist them to make route choice decisions. A quite rich empirical data from questionnaire and field spot was used to estimate parameters of PT. In order to make the parameters more realistic with drivers' attitudes, they were classified into different types by significant factors influencing their behaviors. Based on the travel time distribution of alternative routes and route choice results from questionnaire, the parameterized value function of each category was figured out, which represented drivers' risk attitudes and choice characteristics. The empirical verification showed that the estimates were acceptable and effective. The result showed drivers' risk attitudes and route choice characteristics could be captured by PT under real-time information shown on VMS. For practical application, once drivers' route choice characteristics and parameters were identified, their route choice behavior under different road conditions could be predicted accurately, which was the basis of traffic guidance measures formulation and implementation for targeted traffic management. Moreover, the heterogeneous risk attitudes among drivers should be considered when releasing traffic information and regulating traffic flow. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The safety standards for CO concentration depend on people's exposure time: 125 mg/m(3) for 5 min, 100 mg/m(3) for 15 min, and 35-44 mg/m(3) for 1 h. Airflow and contaminant equations were established and solved based on one-dimensional and steady state assumptions. Three naturally ventilated and two mechanically ventilated urban vehicular tunnels were investigated from 11/2013 to 1/2014 using TSI7575-X and KIMO-VT200 for continuous and single-point measurements during congested periods. The survey reveals that piston winds existed in each tunnel but the effect in mechanically ventilated tunnels was more apparent compared to that in naturally ventilated tunnels. Furthermore, all temperature as well as CO and CO2 concentrations increased from inlets to outlets. The theory model was validated by comparing the analytical air velocity and CO concentration of the XIANMEN Tunnel to that of the field measurement. Further theoretical analyses indicate that under a constant traffic flow of 1700 veh/h.lane, the air velocities depend largely on the vehicle speed v(t) and the opening area ratio R-f, moreover, the maximum CO concentrations increase with a decrease in v(t) and an increase in tunnel length L but are minimally affected by R-f. At 20 km/h, drivers are exposed for different times based on the tunnel length, and they are always safe against CO exposure in tunnels up to 3000 m. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By adding a white noise to drivers' desired acceleration in free-flow, oscillations are produced that accord well with observation. This theory suggests that driver error is a function of roadway geometry, that it determines the average speed at the bottleneck, as well as oscillation period and amplitude. The model has been implemented with a single additional parameter compared to the kinematic wave model with bounded accelerations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Heavy vehicles have different characteristics and manoeuvrability compared with passenger cars. These differences could create problems in freeway operations and safety under congested traffic conditions (level of service E and F) particularly when there is high proportion of heavy vehicles. With increasing numbers of heavy vehicles in the traffic stream, model estimates of the traffic flow could be degrades because existing car-following models do not differentiate between these vehicles and passenger cars. This study highlighted some of the differences in car-following behaviour of heavy vehicle and passenger drivers and developed a model considering heavy vehicles. In this model, the local linear model tree approach was used to incorporate human perceptual imperfections into a car-following model. Three different real world data sets from a stretch of freeway in USA were used in this study. Two of them were used for the training and testing of the model, and one of them was used for evaluation purpose. The performance of the model was compared with a number of existing car-following models. The results showed that the model, which considers the heavy vehicle type, could predict car-following behaviour of drivers better than the existing models. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this paper, we first use empirical data to study the impacts of lane width and the number of lanes on multilane traffic flow, then propose a new multilane traffic flow model and finally use numerical tests to explore the influences of the variation of lane width, closing lane and changing the number of lanes on each lane's traffic flow. The numerical results show that the new model can qualitatively reproduce the complex traffic phenomena resulted by the variation of lane width, closing lane and changing the number of lanes and that changing each lane's width, closing lane and changing the number of lanes may reduce the reliability of the multilane traffic system. In addition, some numerical results are qualitatively consistent with the phenomena that are resulted by the heavy rain in Beijing on July 21, 2012, which shows that our model can perfectly reproduce some complex traffic phenomena in multilane system from the qualitative perspective.

The traffic flow data are first represented by a linear combination of multiple Gaussian functions for characterizing related timing and geographical parameters and for reducing the quantity of collected traffic data. To further examine dynamically changing behaviors, the phase-transition approach is used for identifying various traffic flow patterns and their dynamic switching behaviors. Furthermore, the information entropy on the traffic data collected at various vehicle detectors can be calculated for characterizing the location significance of these detectors. Detailed experimental analyses showed that five types of traffic flow patterns can be identified based on a six-month traffic data set from Taiwanese highway systems. Each traffic flow pattern indicates a distinct interpretation of a special dynamic traffic behavior.

J	Xu, YY; Kong, QJ; Klette, R; Liu, YC				Xu, Yanyan; Kong, Qing-Jie; Klette, Reinhard; Liu, Yuncai			Accurate and Interpretable Bayesian MARS for Traffic Flow Prediction	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Bayesian inference; interpretable model; Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC); multivariate adaptive-regression splines (MARS); spatiotemporal relationship analysis; traffic flow prediction	REGRESSION; VOLUME	Current research on traffic flow prediction mainly concentrates on generating accurate prediction results based on intelligent or combined algorithms but ignores the interpretability of the prediction model. In practice, however, the interpretability of the model is equally important for traffic managers to realize which road segment in the road network will affect the future traffic state of the target segment in a specific time interval and when such an influence is expected to happen. In this paper, an interpretable and adaptable spatiotemporal Bayesian multivariate adaptive-regression splines (ST-BMARS) model is developed to predict short-term freeway traffic flow accurately. The parameters in the model are estimated in the way of Bayesian inference, and the optimal models are obtained using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. In order to investigate the spatial relationship of the freeway traffic flow, all of the road segments on the freeway are taken into account for the traffic prediction of the target road segment. In our experiments, actual traffic data collected from a series of observation stations along freeway Interstate 205 in Portland, OR, USA, are used to evaluate the performance of the model. Experimental results indicate that the proposed interpretable ST-BMARS model is robust and can generate superior prediction accuracy in contrast with the temporal MARS model, the parametric model autoregressive integrated moving averaging (ARIMA), the state-of-the-art seasonal ARIMA model, and the kernel method support vector regression.

J	Celikoglu, HB				Celikoglu, Hilmi Berk			Dynamic Classification of Traffic Flow Patterns Simulated by a Switching Multimode Discrete Cell Transmission Model	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Cell transmission model; simulation; state estimation; traffic flow	EXTENDED KALMAN FILTER; KINEMATIC WAVES; TRAVEL-TIMES; FREEWAY; NETWORKS	In this paper, a dynamic approach to specify flow pattern variations simulated by a multimode macroscopic flow model is followed, incorporating the neural network theory to reconstruct real-time traffic dynamics. In order to deal with the noise in and the wide scatter of traffic data, filtering is applied prior to overall modeling process. Filtered data are dynamically and simultaneously input to neural density estimation and traffic flow modeling processes. Traffic flow is simulated by modifying the cell transmission model in order to explicitly account for flow condition transitions considering wave propagations. Cell-specific flow dynamics are used to determine the mode of prevailing traffic conditions, which are, in turn, sought to be reconstructed by neural methods. The classification of flow patterns over the fundamental diagram is obtained by considering traffic density as a pattern indicator. The fundamental diagram of speed-density is updated to specify the current corresponding flow pattern. The modified classification returned promising results in capturing sudden changes on test stretch flow patterns that are simulated by the switching multimode discrete macroscopic model.

J	Mishra, S; Kang, MW; Jha, MK				Mishra, Sabyasachee; Kang, Min-Wook; Jha, Manoj K.			Empirical Model with Environmental Considerations in Highway Alignment Optimization	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Highway alignment optimization; Bi-level optimization; Tri-level optimization; Highway cost; User cost; Environmental emission	DESIGN; ALGORITHM; SYSTEM	The highway alignment optimization (HAO) process is a complex combinatorial optimization problem in which several conflicting factors, such as highway costs, user preferences, and environmentally sensitive factors, must be simultaneously considered. In previous studies, single-level and bi-level optimization approaches were developed to optimize three-dimensional highway alignments. One drawback of previous approaches is that environmental factors, such as vehicular emissions, were not adequately considered in conjunction with other factors (such as user preferences and highway costs) in the optimization process. This paper builds on our previous studies and proposes two separate approaches for considering environmental emissions in the HAO process. The first approach involves a separate analysis of user and decision-maker preferences, in which a conceptual formulation of various environmental factors is presented. In the second approach, a novel tri-level optimization framework is proposed for optimizing highway alignments. At the upper level, optimization is performed using the traditional criteria of cost minimization. At the intermediate level, total systems emission is calculated. Finally, at the lower level, the user equilibrium traffic flow is optimized. The developed approaches are illustrated through case study examples. The proposed approaches will be beneficial for designing highway alignments when considering environmental emissions. Future studies may make additional refinements to the formulation and sensitivity analyses. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

This study proposes risk-control approaches for two bottleneck transportation problems with random variables and preference levels to objective functions with risk parameters. Each proposed model is formulated as a multiobjective programming problem using robust-based optimization derived from stochastic chance constraints. Since it is impossible to obtain a transportation pattern that optimizes all objective functions, our proposed models are numerically solved by introducing an aggregation function for the multiobjective problem. An exact algorithm that performs deterministic equivalent transformations and introduces auxiliary problems is also developed.

J	Zhu, GY; Lu, GN; Yang, CG; Zhang, P				Zhu, Guang-yu; Lu, Gao-na; Yang, Chen-Guang; Zhang, Peng			Research on the comprehensive traffic state evaluation model linked with drivers' perception under the vehicle networking	PERSONAL AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING			English	Article						Traffic state evaluation; Driver's perception; Vehicle networking; T-S model; ANFIS		Unified judgment standards and methods are often adopted to identify traffic state in certain road network based on traffic flow parameters. However, drivers often have different perceptions about the traffic state on different road sections, since their expectations on traffic state vary more or less from each other on different road sections. In particular, under the vehicle networking, out of considerations for safety and other relevant factors, requirements for the correlation and coordination of running vehicles have also raised significantly. Therefore, it is necessary to take driver's perception about the driving conditions of certain road sections into consideration to adjust the release of traffic state. This paper has provided a comprehensive traffic state evaluation model linked with driver's perception under the vehicle networking. The authors first establish an ANFIS model based on the T-S model and then conduct statistical analysis on drivers' perceptions about certain traffic state. At last, the authors use the results of statistical analysis as regulatory factors to amend the parameters input through ANFIS. Through simulation, this paper has demonstrated that the model established has a high rate of convergence, a high identification precision and the generalization ability to conduct researches on the identification of traffic state.

Scalar conservation laws with moving constraints arising in traffic flow modeling: An existence result	JOURNAL OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS			English	Article						Scalar conservation laws with constraints; Traffic flow modeling; PDE-ODE coupling; Wave-front tracking approximations	DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATIONS; ODE; SYSTEMS; BOTTLENECKS	We consider a strongly coupled PDE-ODE system that describes the influence of a slow and large vehicle on road traffic. The model consists of a scalar conservation law accounting for the main traffic evolution, while the trajectory of the slower vehicle is given by an ODE depending on the downstream traffic density. The moving constraint is expressed by an inequality on the flux, which models the bottleneck created in the road by the presence of the slower vehicle. We prove the existence of solutions to the Cauchy problem for initial data of bounded variation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Delle Monache, M.

In congested mainline traffic flow, we assume that a merging vehicle will trigger a jam queue formulation. If this jam queue cannot dissipate before the next vehicle merges into the main road, it could grow into a wide jam and eventually result in traffic breakdown. Different from many existing models that focused on the propagation of jam waves, the proposed model emphasizes the size evolution of a jam queue (local congested vehicle cluster) instead of its spatial evolutions. This new approach reduces analysis difficulties and allows us to directly link microscopic driving behaviors with macroscopic breakdown phenomena. Test results show that the simulated breakdown probability curve (parameter tuning using Next Generation Simulation vehicular trajectories) fits with the empirical breakdown probability curve that is estimated by Performance Measurement System (PeMS) data. This indicates that this new model can account for the probability of breakdown phenomena and help us set an appropriate inflow rate so as to void breakdown and meanwhile maintain a high road capacity.

While many countries have implemented great policy efforts to promote EVs, how to build charging infrastructure to maximize overall travel electrification given how people travel has not been well studied. Mismatch of demand and infrastructure can lead to under-utilized charging stations, wasting public resources. Estimating charging demand has been challenging due to lack of realistic vehicle travel data. Public charging is different from refueling from two aspects: required time and home-charging possibility. As a result, traditional approaches for refueling demand estimation (e.g. traffic flow and vehicle ownership density) do not necessarily represent public charging demand. This research uses large-scale trajectory data of 11,880 taxis in Beijing as a case study to evaluate how travel patterns mined from big-data can inform public charging infrastructure development. Although this study assumes charging stations to be dedicated to a fleet of PHEV taxis which may not fully represent the real-world situation, the methodological framework can be used to analyze private vehicle trajectory data as well to improve our understanding of charging demand for electrified private fleet. Our results show that (1) collective vehicle parking "hotspots" are good indicators for charging demand; (2) charging stations sited using travel patterns can improve electrification rate and reduce gasoline consumption; (3) with current grid mix, emissions of CO2, PM, SO2, and NOx will increase with taxi electrification; and (4) power demand for public taxi charging has peak load around noon, overlapping with Beijing's summer peak power.

We present the two-lane dynamic collaboration model with lateral friction and the expressions of feedback control signals. What is more, utilizing the delayed feedback control theory to the two-lane dynamic collaboration model with control signals, we investigate the stability of traffic flow theoretically and the stability conditions for both lanes are derived with finding that the forward and lateral feedback signals can improve the stability of traffic flow while the backward feedback signals cannot achieve it.

On the basis of cellular automata model and traffic flow model with look-ahead potential, in this paper, a novel traffic flow model with weighted look-ahead potential is presented. By introducing the weighting coefficient into the look-ahead potential and endowing the potential of vehicle closer to itself with a greater weight, the modeling process is more suitable for the driver's random decision-making process which is based on the vehicle and enviroment situation in front of him in actual traffic. Complex high-density traffic behavior is reproduced by numerical simulations. The simulation results show that the weighting coefficient has an obvious effect on high-density traffic flux, and the weighted model is more conducive to keeping high traffic flux and road capacity while maintaining a high traffic density.

It is demonstrated that a marginal cost traffic flow assignment following Wardrop's second principle, although it minimizes the total cost of a transport network, may reduce social welfare compared to the market equilibrium assignment based on Wardrop's first principle. A welfare-maximizing assignment model is presented and used to show that if the travellers' utility functions are linear, the assignment that maximizes social welfare will be the same as the assignment that minimizes total network cost, but if users' utility functions are non-linear (reflecting the traditional non-satiation and diminishing marginal utility axioms), the two assignments will be different. It is further shown that the effects of this non-linearity are such that a welfare-maximizing assignment will meet with less user resistance than a minimum total network cost assignment.

Wind energy harvesting from transport systems: A resource estimation assessment	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Traffic aerodynamic losses; Wind energy; Truck flow; VAWT; Sustainable energy policies		Many recent patents worldwide address the concept of harvesting wind energy from aerodynamic losses in motorways, however the mechanics of a specific device dedicated to the task has never been described. The lack of a characterization of the energy resource likely explains why the international market is still to acknowledge any technology related to the concept. Here, an experimental activity is presented to investigate the flow field generated by traffic in motorways and eventually develop an innovative technology that complies with emerging energy policies. In the case of traffic source, the energetic rationale seems to have a double motivation: there will always be an optimal energy supply associated with an increment in transport demand and, contrary to other renewables, the transport aerodynamic losses belong to a source of costs, making them a remarkably sustainable energy source. After a thorough analysis of the correlation between truck flow and wind speed classes, the characterization of a resource indicator for time of wind above a cut-in speed is given, with an account for the effects of traffic clusters and traffic related wind-drops. We demonstrate how during weekdays daytime hours the traffic-generated resource can allow an energy conversion beyond a threshold possibly permitting a positive energetic balance of the system. A study on the effect of traffic related wind-drops is also carried out to investigate how the issue could be relevant in the transient behavior and ultimately in the performance of a mini wind turbine in the kW-range. While many findings relate to the motorway site where the campaign was sited, fitting of the experimental data to the generic motorway case permits to explore a complete range of traffic flows.

In our model system, two classes of driver-agents coexist: C agents (cooperative strategy) always keep to traffic regulations with respect to lane-changing and speed, while D agents (defective strategy) disregard them to move ahead. In relatively high-density flows, such as the metastable and high-density phases, we found structures that correspond to either n-person Prisoner's Dilemma (n-PD) games or to quasi-PD games. In these situations, existing ill-mannered drivers create heavy traffic jams that reduce social efficiency.

J	Hsu, YT; Peeta, S				Hsu, Yu-Ting; Peeta, Srinivas			Behavior-consistent information-based network traffic control for evacuation operations	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Evacuation operations; Behavior-consistent information-based control; Demand-supply interactions; Linguistic route guidance; Social equity	OPTIMIZATION; MODEL	The evacuation operations problem aims to avoid or mitigate the potential loss of life in a region threatened or affected by a disaster. It is shaped to a large extent by the evolution of evacuation traffic resulting from the demand supply interactions of the associated transportation network. Information-based control is a strategic tool for evacuation traffic operations as it can enable greater access to the affected population and more effective response. However, comparatively few studies have focused on the implementation of information-based control in evacuation operations. This study develops a control module for evacuation operations centered on addressing the demand supply interactions by using behavior-consistent information strategies. These strategies incorporate the likely responses of evacuees to the information provided in the determination of route guidance information. The control module works as an iterative computational process involving an evacuee route choice model and a control model of information strategies to determine the route guidance information to direct evacuation traffic so as to approach a desired network traffic flow pattern. The problem is formulated as a fuzzy logic based optimization framework to explicitly incorporate practical concerns related to information dissemination characteristics and social equity in evacuation operations. Numerical experiments highlight the importance of accounting for the demand supply interactions, as the use of behavior-consistent information strategies can lead evacuee route choices to approach the operator-desired proportions corresponding to the desired traffic pattern. The results also indicate that while a behavior-consistent information strategy can be effective, gaps with the desired route proportions can exist due to the discrete nature of the linguistic messages and the real-world difficulty in accurately modeling evacuees' actual route choice behavior.

J	Daganzo, CF				Daganzo, Carlos F.			Singularities in kinematic wave theory: Solution properties, extended methods and duality revisited	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Traffic flow theory; Kinematic wave theory; Duality	TRAFFIC FLOW; HIGHWAY	According to Euler-Lagrange duality principle of kinematic wave (KW) theory any well-posed initial value traffic flow problem can be solved with the same methods either on the time-space (Euler) plane or the time vs vehicle number (Lagrange) plane. To achieve this symmetry the model parameters and the boundary data need to be expressed in a form appropriate for each plane. It turns out, however, that when boundary data that are bounded in one plane are transformed for the other, singular points with infinite density sometimes arise. Duality theory indicates that solutions to these problems must exist and be unique. Therefore, these solutions should be characterized. The paper shows that the only added feature of these solutions is a new type of shock that can contain mass and we call a supershock. Nothing else is different. The evolution laws of these shocks are described. Solution methods based on these laws for problems with singularities are also presented. The methods apply to problems with monotone speed-density relations and not necessarily concave fundamental diagrams. In accordance with duality theory they can be used with both, the Euler and Lagrange versions of a problem. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Diverse types of sensors and devices to count and classify vehicles have been tested and installed on European roads in recent years, contributing to the growing availability of several databases. Moreover, methodologies to assess energy consumption for transport and the consequent emissions require several data sets, which are not always available. Consequently, it is an interesting endeavour to investigate an approach that can model energy dissipation, beginning from simple mechanical rules and traffic monitoring data and related parameters. The presence of ITS can have a positive influence on traffic flows. Beginning with this assumption, this study presents different scenarios based on actual and simulated data to estimate energy used in vehicular flow and how the energy consumed can change when the vehicular flow changes due to the influence of an ITS application. The approach presented in this study accounts to use both a mechanical model, providing a simple evaluation of energy consumption, and a traffic micro-simulation approach; both cases begin from the measurement of classical traffic flow parameters.

J	Sun, L				Sun, Lu			Spectral and time-frequency analyses of freeway traffic flow	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						traffic flow; spectral analysis; time-frequency analysis; stochastic process; power spectral density; cross-correlation	PHASE-TRANSITIONS; PREDICTION; FLUCTUATION; DENSITY; MODELS	This paper uses spectral and time-frequency analyses to treat three macroscopic traffic characteristics, namely, time mean speed, volume and occupancy as stochastic processes. Spectral and time-frequency analyses are performed to characterize power spectral density (PSD), cross-PSD, autocorrelation and cross-correlation of these characteristics using TransGuide traffic data collected from four different freeways. It is found that low-frequency components dominate the PSDs of speed, volume and occupancy at all times. The magnitude of PSDs decreases dramatically as frequency increases and remains almost at a constant level in high-frequency regimes. A power law is found to exist, which describes the relationship between the frequency and the PSD of traffic characteristics. It is also found that speed can be properly modeled by a narrowband low-pass stochastic process in a low-frequency regime and by a nonzero mean white noise in a high-frequency regime. Strong periodicities and synchronization are both shown in traffic flow. A variety of frequencies can be excited by congestion, and there is no dominant frequency found in stop-and-go traffic.

J	Sun, L; Pan, YY; Gu, WJ				Sun, Lu; Pan, Yiyong; Gu, Wenjun			Data mining using regularized adaptive B-splines regression with penalization for multi-regime traffic stream models	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						traffic flow; bi-level programming; regularization; spline regression; optimization	SPEED-DENSITY RELATIONSHIP; CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; FUNDAMENTAL DIAGRAM; FUNCTIONAL FORM; FLOW; PARAMETERS; BEHAVIOR; HIGHWAY; WAVES	This paper presents a new data mining method that integrates adaptive B-spline regression and traffic flow theory to develop multi-regime traffic stream models (TSMs). Parameter estimation is implemented adaptively and optimally through a constrained bi-level programming method. The slave programming determines positions of knots and coefficients of the B-spline by minimizing the error of B-spline regression. The master programming model determines the number of knots through a regularized function, which balances model accuracy and model complexity. This bi-level programming method produces the best fitting to speed-density observations under specific order of splines and possesses great flexibility to accommodate the exhibited nonlinearity in speed-density relationships. Jam density can be estimated naturally using spline TSM, which is sometimes hardly obtainable in many other TSM. Derivative continuity up to one order lower than the highest spline degree can be preserved, a desirable property in some application. A five-regime B-spline model is found to exist for generalized speed-density relationships to accommodate five traffic operating conditions: free flow, transition, synchronized flow, stop and go traffic, and jam condition. A typical two-regime B-spline form is also explicitly given, depending only on free-flow speed, optimal speed, optimal density, and jam density. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Marzuoli, A; Gariel, M; Vela, A; Feron, E				Marzuoli, Aude; Gariel, Maxime; Vela, Adan; Feron, Eric			Data-Based Modeling and Optimization of En Route Traffic	JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS			English	Article							COMPLEXITY	Air traffic management aims at ensuring safe and efficient movement of aircraft in the airspace. With the predicted growth of air transportation, providing traffic flow managers with the tools to support decision-making is essential. These tools should aid in accommodating the air traffic throughput increase while limiting controller workload and ensuring high safety levels. The objective of this paper is to present a methodology to model and simulate traffic in a given portion of the airspace from data under nominal and perturbed conditions. A new framework for en route traffic flow management and airspace health monitoring is developed. It is based on a data-driven approach for air traffic flow modeling using historical data. This large-scale three-dimensional flow network provides valuable insight on airspace complexity. A linear programming formulation for optimizing en route air traffic is proposed. It takes into account a controller task load model based on flow geometry, in order to estimate airspace capacity. To analyze airspace degradation, weather blockage maps based on vertically integrated liquid are incorporated in the model, representing weather perturbations on the same dataset used to compute the flows. Comparing the weather blockages and the network model of the airspace provides means of quantifying airspace degradation. The impact of the perturbations is then examined. The results of the simulations are compared with the data from these specific days, to identify the advantages and drawbacks of the present model. The methodology presented is scalable and adaptable to various types of airspaces, traffic loads, and uncertainty levels. This work is contributing to a better data-based understanding of traffic congestion, rerouting options depending on origin and destination pairs, how traffic patterns influence the controller task load, and how the size and location of weather cells impact air traffic operations.

J	Pecchini, D; Mauro, R; Giuliani, F				Pecchini, Dario; Mauro, Raffaele; Giuliani, Felice			Model of Potential Crash Rates of Rural Roundabouts with Geometrical Features	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Roundabouts; Potential crash rate models; Conflict opportunities; Deflection angle.		In recent years, there has been a widespread diffusion of roundabout intersections in the Italian road network; their undoubted popularity is attributable not only to their proven performance in terms of safety but also to their guarantee of smooth traffic flow. However, safety-related requirements of geometric designs are occasionally placed in a subordinate position; therefore, the success achieved by some foreign experiences has not been reached in every area. A model of potential crash rates may indicate how to modify the geometry of intersections to ensure safety. With regard to this, an example model based on the conflict opportunity technique has been developed for estimating crash rates at rural roundabouts. The model appears to respond well to traffic conditions and the geometry of roundabouts. Development of the model and results are described and analyzed in this paper.

Weaving maneuvers (i.e., intensive lane changes) are a major cause of bottlenecks during high-demand periods. To relieve bottleneck severity, ramp metering (RM) is implemented as an active traffic control method. Ample research has been devoted to developing RM control algorithms and to exploring weaving impacts; however, RM control that is considerate of dynamic weaving impact and its evaluation has received little attention in the published literature. This paper aims to bridge that gap by proposing a proactive control algorithm that uses as inputs dynamic weaving capacity (as opposed to traditional fixed capacity values) for RM control at weaving segments. The control goals are to reduce networkwide travel time and improve traffic flow. Capacity and capacity drop were estimated through fundamental diagrams (FDs). Then, capacity drop sensitivities to on-ramp and mainline demand were analyzed within a field-data-based microsimulation model. The findings were applied to dynamically estimate weaving capacity within a macroscopic traffic flow model. The proposed traffic flow model conducted estimation in a model predictive control (MPC) framework. The RM rates were optimized by sequential quadratic programming (SQP). The proposed RM algorithm was evaluated in macro-simulation and compared with a no-control scenario as well as with a control scenario that used static (as opposed to dynamic) weaving capacity. This analysis contributes to efficient and effective field applications and freeway operational improvements. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Zhou, J; Shi, ZK; Cao, JL				Zhou, Jie; Shi, Zhong-Ke; Cao, Jin-Liang			An extended traffic flow model on a gradient highway with the consideration of the relative velocity	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS			English	Article						Slope; Relative velocity; Nonlinear analysis; Gradient highway; Density wave	CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; DENSITY WAVES; STABILITY ANALYSIS; SOLITON; DELAY; CONGESTION; DYNAMICS; FORCE; JAMS	In this paper, an extended traffic flow model on a single-lane gradient highway is proposed with the consideration of the relative velocity. The stability condition is obtained by the use of linear stability analysis. It is shown that the stability of traffic flow on the gradient varies with the slope and the coefficient of the relative velocity: when the slope is constant, the stable regions increase with the increase of the coefficient of the relative velocity; when the coefficient of the relative velocity is constant, the stable regions increase with the decrease of the slope in downhill and increase with the increase of the slope in uphill. The Burgers, Korteweg-de Vries, and modified Korteweg-de Vries equations are derived to describe the triangular shock waves, soliton waves, and kink-antikink waves in the stable, metastable, and unstable region, respectively. The numerical simulation shows a good agreement with the analytical result, which shows that the traffic congestion can be suppressed by introducing the relative velocity.

The local fundamental diagram and cross-correlation near the entry of the partial reduced lane have been analyzed in the periodic boundary condition. The typical two-dimensional scatter diagram in the local fundamental diagram and the noncorrelation of the cross-correlation between the local density and flow reveal characteristics of synchronization flow near the entry of the reduced lane. By the DFA, the synchronized flow at a traffic bottleneck exhibits the characteristics of long-range correlation. The results of investigation indicate that the injection rate, removal rate, and the location of the partial reduced lane have an obvious influence on the change of the scale exponent in the open boundary condition. Moreover, the length of the partial reduced lane has impact on the change of the scale exponent in the periodic boundary condition.

J	Weng, JX; Meng, Q; Yan, XD				Weng, Jinxian; Meng, Qiang; Yan, Xuedong			Analysis of work zone rear-end crash risk for different vehicle-following patterns	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Vehicle-following pattern; Rear-end crash; Work intensity; Work zone	SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS; REGRESSION; LOCATIONS; SELECTION; BEHAVIOR	This study evaluates rear-end crash risk associated with work zone operations for four different vehicle-following patterns: car-car, car-truck, truck-car and truck-truck. The deceleration rate to avoid the crash (DRAC) is adopted to measure work zone rear-end crash risk. Results show that the car-truck following pattern has the largest rear-end crash risk, followed by truck-truck, truck-car and car-car patterns. This implies that it is more likely for a car which is following a truck to be involved in a rear-end crash accident. The statistical test results further confirm that rear-end crash risk is statistically different between any two of the four patterns. We therefore develop a rear-end crash risk model for each vehicle-following pattern in order to examine the relationship between rear-end crash risk and its influencing factors, including lane position, the heavy vehicle percentage, lane traffic flow and work intensity which can be characterized by the number of lane reductions, the number of workers and the amount of equipment at the work zone site. The model results show that, for each pattern, there will be a greater rear-end crash risk in the following situations: (i) heavy work intensity; (ii) the lane adjacent to work zone; (iii) a higher proportion of heavy vehicles and (iv) greater traffic flow. However, the effects of these factors on rear-end crash risk are found to vary according to the vehicle-following patterns. Compared with the car-car pattern, lane position has less effect on rear-end crash risk in the car-truck pattern. The effect of work intensity on rear-end crash risk is also reduced in the truck-car pattern. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Degradation in urban air quality from construction activity and increased traffic arising from a road widening scheme	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Induced traffic; Road widening schemes; Air quality impacts; Source apportionment; Construction PM10 emission factor; Oxidative potential	EMISSIONS; PM10	Road widening schemes in urban areas are often proposed as a solution to traffic congestion and as a means of stimulating economic growth. There is however clear evidence that new or expanded roads rapidly fill with either displaced or induced traffic, offsetting any short-term gains in eased traffic flows. What has not been addressed in any great detail is the impact of such schemes on air quality, with modelled impact predictions seldom validated by measurements after the expansion of road capacity. In this study we made use of a road widening project in London to investigate the impact on ambient air quality (particulate matter, NOx, NO2) during and after the completion of the road works. PM10 increased during the construction period up to 15 mu g m(-3) during working hours compared to concentrations before the road works. A box modelling approach was used to determine a median emission factor of 0.0022 kg PM10 m(-2) month(-1), three times larger than that used in the UK emission inventory (0.0007 kg PM10 m(-2) month(-1)). Peaks of activity released 0.0130 kg PM10 m(-2) month(-1), three and eight times smaller than the peak values used in the European and US inventories. After the completion of the widening there was an increase in all pollutants from the road during rush hour: 2-4 mu g m(-3) for PM10; 1 mu g m(-3) for PM2.5; 40 and 8 mu g m(-3) for NOx and NO2, respectively. NO2 EU Limit Value was breached after the road development illustrating a notable deterioration in residential air quality. Additionally, PM10, but not PM2.5, glutathione dependent oxidative potential increased after the road was widened consistent with an increase in pro-oxidant components in the coarse particle mode, related to vehicle abrasion processes. These increased air pollution indices were associated with an increase in the number of cars, taxis and LGVs. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Measurements of pollution, meteorology and traffic are used to investigate the complexity of the physical and chemical processes governing the levels of traffic-related pollution in urban areas. Following a brief introduction on health impacts associated with air quality, description of the mote technology is given. Cluster analysis statistics to investigate the relationship between different pollutant types and traffic data demonstrated that traffic flow regimes alone cannot be used to estimate diurnal kerbside pollutant concentrations. Also, the absolute levels, whilst dependent on meteorological conditions and static parameters are only partially governed by the pollutant dispersion. The research clearly illustrates the benefits and added value of pervasive concentration measurement in urban micro environments with potential to effectively evaluate human exposure to transport-related emissions.

J	Zhao, XJ; Xu, JX; Srinivasan, D				Zhao, Xinjie; Xu, Jianxin; Srinivasan, Dipti			Novel and efficient local coordinated freeway ramp metering strategy with simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation-based parameter learning	IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article							REAL-TIME CONTROL; TRAFFIC FLOW; BOULEVARD-PERIPHERIQUE; SOUTHERN PART	In this study, a novel and efficient fuzzy logic control (FLC) -based local coordinated ramp metering strategy is studied for networked freeway traffic control. Local traffic measurements are exchanged among neighbouring controllers. Based on both local and exchanged traffic measurement, the FLC based coordinated decision-making algorithms determine the reference mainstream densities, which are consequently tracked by local controllers using feedback control-based strategy. The parameters of the FLC algorithm are adjusted by a simple and efficient simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation based parameter learning algorithm, which finds the optimal coordinated decision-making policies without interruption to normal freeway operations. Due to the limited communication among neighbouring controllers, communication cost is reduced compared with existing centralised control-based strategies. Furthermore, the structure of the proposed strategy is simple without involvement of complex model-based calculation. Case studies show the potential of the proposed strategy for coordinated freeway ramp metering problems with significantly improved system efficiency. In particular, using the proposed local coordinated ramp metering strategy, the system cost function is reduced by over 48% compared with no control case, and by over 18% compared with uncoordinated feedback control-based ramp metering case.

J	Xu, CC; Liu, P; Wang, W; Li, ZB				Xu, Chengcheng; Liu, Pan; Wang, Wei; Li, Zhibin			Identification of freeway crash-prone traffic conditions for traffic flow at different levels of service	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Crash risk; Level of service; Bayesian inference; Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC); Random forest	SAFETY; MODEL; IMPACTS; WEATHER; RISKS; SPEED	The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the risks of crashes associated with the freeway traffic flow operating at various levels of service (LOS) and to identify crash-prone traffic conditions for each LOS. The results showed that the traffic flow operating at LOS E had the highest crash potential, followed by LOS F and D. The traffic flow operating at LOS B and A had the lowest crash potential. For LOS A and B, the vehicle platoon and abrupt change in vehicle speeds were major contributing factors to crash occurrences. For LOS C, crash risks were correlated with lane-change maneuvers, speed variation, and small headways in traffic. For LOS D, crash risks increased with an increase in the temporal change in traffic flow variables and the frequency of lane-change maneuvers. For LOS E, crash risks were mainly affected by high traffic volumes and oscillating traffic conditions. For LOS F, crash risks increased with an increase in the standard deviation of flow rate and the frequency of lane-change maneuvers. The findings suggested that the mechanism of crashes were quite different across various LOS. A Bayesian random-parameters logistic regression model was developed to identify crash-prone traffic conditions for various LOS. The proposed model significantly improved the prediction performance as compared to the conventional logistic regression model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, ZR; Xia, JH; Irawan, B; Caulfied, C				Chen, Zhirong; Cecilia, Jianhong Xia; Irawan, Buntoro; Caulfied, Craig			Development of location-based services for recommending departure stations to park and ride users	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Parking; Location-based services; Park and ride; Fuzzy logic; Application	ROUTE CHOICE; FUZZY-LOGIC; SYSTEMS; FACILITIES; DEMAND; MODELS	More and more commuters are beginning to favour public transportation. Fast and convenient park and ride (PnR) services provided by public transportation authorities are the result of changes of household demographics and household, increasing fuel prices and a focus on environmental sustainability. However, lack of parking spaces in PnR facilities creates a major bottleneck to this service. The aim of this research is to develop a location-based service (LBS) application to help PnR users choose the best train station to use to reach their destination using a multicriteria decision making model. A fuzzy logic method is used to estimate parking availability when a user is estimated to arrive at a PnR facility. Two surveys are conducted to collect traffic flow, travel behaviour and service quality data at four selected Perth Western Australia train stations. With the proposed approach and survey data, a prototype of LBS application, Station Finder, was developed using the Android SDK 4.0 and Google API 16. This application is a useful and practical tool to save travel cost and time of PnR users'. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Milanes, V; Shladover, SE				Milanes, Vicente; Shladover, Steven E.			Modeling cooperative and autonomous adaptive cruise control dynamic responses using experimental data	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC); Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC); Car-following models; Vehicle platooning; Intelligent transportation systems (ITS)	TRAFFIC-FLOW; DESIGN; SYSTEM; IMPACT	Vehicle longitudinal control systems such as (commercially available) autonomous Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and its more sophisticated variant Cooperative ACC (CACC) could potentially have significant impacts on traffic flow. Accurate models of the dynamic responses of both of these systems are needed to produce realistic predictions of their effects on highway capacity and traffic flow dynamics. This paper describes the development of models of both ACC and CACC control systems that are based on real experimental data. To this end, four production vehicles were equipped with a commercial ACC system and a newly developed CACC controller. The Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) that has been widely used for ACC car-following modeling was also implemented on the production vehicles. These controllers were tested in different traffic situations in order to measure the actual responses of the vehicles. Test results indicate that: (1) the IDM controller when implemented in our experimental test vehicles does not perceptibly follow the speed changes of the preceding vehicle; (2) strings of consecutive ACC vehicles are unstable, amplifying the speed variations of preceding vehicles; and (3) strings of consecutive CACC vehicles overcome these limitations, providing smooth and stable car following responses. Simple but accurate models of the ACC and CACC vehicle following dynamics were derived from the actual measured responses of the vehicles and applied to simulations of some simple multi-vehicle car following scenarios.

J	Ambarwati, L; Pel, AJ; Verhaeghe, R; van Arem, B				Ambarwati, Lasmini; Pel, Adam J.; Verhaeghe, Robert; van Arem, Bart			Empirical analysis of heterogeneous traffic flow and calibration of porous flow model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Heterogeneous traffic flow; Porous flow model; Critical pore size; Non-lane based traffic; Pore size-density distributions		Heterogeneous traffic flow, characterized by a free inter-lane exchange, has become an important issue in addressing congestion in urban areas. It is of particular interest in many developing countries, that experience a strong increase in motorcycle use. New approaches to the heterogeneous non-lane-based flow have been proposed. However insufficient empirical verification has been made to estimate vehicle interaction, that is necessary for an accurate representation of mixed-flow conditions. In this paper, we focus on the porous flow approach to capture the complex interactions. The parameters from this approach are estimated from empirical observations. Video data was recorded and processed to capture vehicle interactions at a number of road sections in Surabaya City, Indonesia. The specific behavior of each vehicle in the traffic flow was captured by developing the pore size-density distributions, analyzing the class-specific critical pore sizes, and producing the class specific speed-density and flow-density diagrams. The results reveal how critical pore sizes are based on pore size-density distributions, the flow diagram for each vehicle class, and how traffic flow relationships for motorcyclists and the other vehicles exhibit significant differences. It is concluded that the proposed approach can represent the specific behavior of the motorcyclist in heterogeneous traffic flow, in both the situations of with- and without an exclusive lane for motorcycles, can clarify motorcyclist's behavior in terms of passenger car unit of motorcycle, and can therefore support policy making on the improvement of urban transport.

Current trends for traffic control are based on the use of smart traffic lights and signals as a part of smart cities' projects. Different cities are currently involved in the design and implementation of smart traffic control. Since the cost of physically installing these systems is very high, in terms of both money and resources, accelerated-time simulations of traffic flow using smart traffic lights and signals significantly reduce these costs. In this work we present a new model for accelerated-time simulations for traffic flow within. The philosophy of this model is based on previous works of the authors, where accelerated-time simulations for car traffic in a motorway or a roundabout and baggage traffic in an airport were developed. The philosophy of this model combines ideas from cellular automata and neural network theories, obtaining a mixed model. This system was developed using a Computer Algebra System (CAS) called MAXIMA for mathematical computations and a JAVA based interface for graphical display. MAXIMA allows the system to support the use of ad hoc distribution functions for the different events dealt with in the simulations. The interface provides a friendly framework for entering input data and visualizing the simulations, providing also some statistical data. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We used Price of Anarchy (POA) to quantify the loss of transport efficiency and found that both volume and distribution of human mobility demand determine the POA. In order to reduce POA, a small number of highways require considerable decreases in traffic, and their neighboring arterial roads need to attract more traffic. The magnitude of the adjustment in traffic flow can be estimated using the fundamental measure traffic flow only, which is widely available and easy to collect. Surprisingly, the most congested roads or the roads with largest traffic flow were not those requiring the most reduction of traffic. This study can offer guidance for the optimal control of urban traffic and facilitate improvements in the efficiency of transport networks.

Moderate congestion	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL			English	Article						Lighthill-Whitham-Richards-Payne model; exact solutions; nonlinear PDEs; parametric representation	KINEMATIC WAVES; MODELS; DYNAMICS	We find a further class of exact solutions to the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards-Payne (LWRP) traffic flow equations. As before, using two consecutive Lagrangian transformations, a linearization is achieved. Next, depending on the initial density, we either obtain exact formulae for the dependence of the car density and velocity on x, t, or else, failing that, the same result in a parametric representation. The calculation always involves two possible factorizations of a consistency condition. Both must be considered. In physical terms, the lineup usually separates into two offshoots at different velocities. Each velocity soon becomes uniform. This outcome in many ways resembles not only that of Rowlands et al (2013 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 46 365202 (part I)) but also the two-soliton solution to the Korte-weg-de Vries equation. This paper can be read independently of part I. This explains unavoidable repetitions. Possible uses of both papers in checking numerical codes are indicated. Since LWRP, numerous more elaborate models, including multiple lanes, traffic jams, tollgates, etc, abound in the literature. However, we present an exact solution. These are few and far between, other than found by inverse scattering. The literature for various models, including ours, is given. The methods used here and in part I may be useful in solving other problems, such as shallow water flow.	[Infeld, E.; Skorupski, A.

Modeling the Car-Truck Interaction in a System-Optimal Dynamic Traffic Assignment Model	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Car-Truck Interaction; System Optimal; Cell Transmission Model; Linear Programming; Dynamic Traffic Assignment	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; HETEROGENEOUS DRIVERS; CONGESTION; NETWORK; FLOW; USER; EQUILIBRIA; HIGHWAY; COSTS; ROADS	Several transportation problems, such as implementation of truck-only lanes, require understanding the interaction of heterogeneous dynamic traffic flows in order to provide accurate solutions. System-optimal dynamic traffic assignment can be modeled using a network loading procedure based on the cell transmission model, that is, the hydrodynamic wave model, and solved by linear programming. However, this framework cannot handle the asymmetric integration between the flow of trucks and cars. This article presents a novel formulation for network loading in system-optimal dynamic traffic assignment considering car-truck interactions. By using an embedded cell transmission model, this formulation incorporates a set of assumptions related to the kinematic characteristics of the flow of cars, trucks, and their interactions that can be solved using linear programming. We present numerical results supporting our modeling assumptions. Likewise, the observed emergent behavior captures the car-truck interactions accurately and indicates that minimum system-optimal travel time is obtained by encouraging cars to use highways with shorter distances.

J	Anand, A; Ramadurai, G; Vanajakshi, L				Anand, Asha; Ramadurai, Gitakrishnan; Vanajakshi, Lelitha			Data Fusion-Based Traffic Density Estimation and Prediction	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Traffic Density Estimation and Prediction; Kalman Filter; Heterogeneous Traffic Flow; Data Fusion; Time-Series Analysis	TRAVEL-TIME PREDICTION; MODELS	Traffic congestion has become a major challenge in recent years in many countries of the world. One way to alleviate congestion is to manage the traffic efficiently by applying intelligent transportation systems (ITS). One set of ITS technologies helps in diverting vehicles from congested parts of the network to alternate routes having less congestion. Congestion is often measured by traffic density, which is the number of vehicles per unit stretch of the roadway. Density, being a spatial characteristic, is difficult to measure in the field. Also, the general approach of estimating density from location-based measures may not capture the spatial variation in density. To capture the spatial variation better, density can be estimated using both location-based and spatial data sources using a data fusion approach. The present study uses a Kalman filter to fuse spatial and location-based data for the estimation of traffic density. Subsequently, the estimated data are utilized for predicting density to future time intervals using a time-series regression model. The models were estimated and validated using both field and simulated data. Both estimation and prediction models performed well, despite the challenges arising from heterogeneous traffic flow conditions prevalent in India.

J	Chiou, YC; Lan, LW; Tseng, CM				Chiou, Yu-Chiun; Lan, Lawrence W.; Tseng, Chun-Ming			A Novel Method to Predict Traffic Features Based on Rolling Self-Structured Traffic Patterns	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Rolling Self-Structured Traffic Patterns; Traffic Prediction; Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map; Genetic Programming	NEURAL-NETWORK APPROACH; TIME-SERIES; INFORMATION-SYSTEM; FLOW; DYNAMICS; MODELS; FORECASTS	In this study, a novel method is proposed to predict the traffic features in a long freeway corridor with a number of time steps ahead. The proposed method, on the basis of rolling self-structured traffic patterns, utilizes the growing hierarchical self-organizing map model to partition the unlabeled traffic patterns into an appropriate number of clusters and then develops the genetic programming model for each cluster to predict its corresponding traffic features. For demonstration, the proposed method is tested against a 110-km freeway stretch, on which 48 time steps of 5-min traffic flows are predicted (i.e., a 4-h prediction). The prediction accuracy of the proposed method is compared with other models (ARIMA, SARIMA, and naive models) and the results support the superiority of the proposed method. Further analyses indicate that applications of the proposed method to larger scale freeway networks require sufficient lengths of observation to acquire enough traffic patterns for training and validation in order to achieve higher prediction accuracy.

J	Duran-Fernandez, R; Santos, G				Duran-Fernandez, Roberto; Santos, Georgina			Gravity, distance, and traffic flows in Mexico	RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS			English	Article						Gravity model; Distance measures; Time-based distance; Length-based distance; Travel costs; Mexico		This paper presents an econometric analysis that compares the performance of different measures of distance in a gravity model using state data for Mexico. The estimation shows that at this geographic scale, the definition of distance does not affect the explanatory power of the model significantly. However, time-based definitions of distance have a marginal improvement on the model fit in comparison to length-based measures. When geographic specific fixed effects are unknown, the model shows that distance measured as road network distance is a better predictor. The paper concludes that time-based definitions of distance present several advantages in comparison to traditional length-based definitions. However, at large geographic scales, where relative distances between every geographic unit are long, the use of length-based distance instead of time-based distance to approximate travel costs generates similar results.

In this work we have performed a comparison between the road transport pollutant emissions of Province of Turin calculated with a bottom-up approach and the corresponding emissions of the official Piedmont Inventory, based mainly on a top-down approach. The bottom-up inventory was obtained using the output of a traffic model referred only to private vehicles and integrating it with traffic survey data and mobility report studies. We were able to highlight the key factors liable for influencing the results. The traffic surveys can change the contribution of the vehicular categories while statistically-based annual mileages are crucial for determining the apportionment among Copert categories and the proxy variable used to estimate urban diffuse emissions (traffic models do not fully reproduce the amount of traffic flows) exerts a great influence on the total amount of emissions and on the spatial distribution. In bottom-up inventory we have obtained a different apportionment of emissions among vehicular categories: in example, for urban roads the CO2 of passenger cars has risen from 52.7% in top-down inventory to 79.5% in bottom-up. Total emissions of road transport have significantly reduced in bottom-up inventory compared to top-down (NOX-16%, CO-41%, NMVOC-66%) and the emissions of Turin have reduced more than in the other municipalities (CO2-24%, NOX-41%, CO-53%, NMVOC-71%). We have found that, if not unfeasible for lack of data, the bottom-up methodology should be preferred since it allows a more straightforward and transparent choice of input parameters.

Based on theoretical analysis and computer simulations, we have presented the phase diagrams which consist of five regions and the topological structure of which is independent of the maximum velocity of vehicles m. The analytical formulas of the flows on the two roads have been obtained in all regions of the phase diagram, which depends on whether m is even or odd or m = 1. The analytical formulas are in good agreement with simulation results.

Examination of factors affecting freeway incident clearance times: a comparison of the generalized F model and several alternative nested models	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						freeway; incident clearance time; parametric hazard duration model; generalized F	ACCIDENT OCCURRENCE; DISAGGREGATE MODEL; DURATION MODEL; FREQUENCY	Traffic incidents are a principal cause of congestion on urban freeways, reducing capacity and creating risks for both involved motorists and incident response personnel. As incident durations increase, the risk of secondary incidents or crashes also becomes problematic. In response to these issues, many road agencies in metropolitan areas have initiated incident management programs aimed at detecting, responding to, and clearing incidents to restore freeways to full capacity as quickly and safely as possible. This study examined those factors that impact the time required by the Michigan Department of Transportation Freeway Courtesy Patrol to clear incidents that occurred on the southeastern Michigan freeway network. These models were developed using traffic flow data, roadway geometry information, and an extensive incident inventory database. A series of parametric hazard duration models were developed, each assuming a different underlying probability distribution for the hazard function. Although each modeling framework provided results that were similar in terms of the direction of factor effects, there was significant variability in terms of the estimated magnitude of these impacts. The generalized F distribution was shown to provide the best fit to the incident clearance time data, and the use of poorer fitting distributions was shown to result in severe over-estimation or under-estimation of factor effects. Those factors that were found to impact incident clearance times included the time of day and month when the incident occurred, the geometric and traffic characteristics of the freeway segment, and the characteristics of each incident.

To disseminate accurate traveler information and reduce congestion impact, it is desirable to develop an adaptive model to predict travel time. The proposed model is practically implementable to capture dynamic traffic patterns under various conditions, which integrates the features of exponential smoothing and the Kalman filter by utilizing both real-time and historic data. The model is simple in formulation while robust in performance in terms of accuracy and stability. With a constraint or nonconstraint smoothing factor, the proposed model is tested with both real world and simulated data and demonstrated itself a sound model that outperforms others (e. g., Kalman filter and simple exponential smoothing) specifically under recurring and nonrecurring congestion.

J	Pascale, A; Nicoli, M; Spagnolini, U				Pascale, Alessandra; Nicoli, Monica; Spagnolini, Umberto			Cooperative Bayesian Estimation of Vehicular Traffic in Large-Scale Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Bayesian filters; belief propagation (BP); cell transmission model (CTM); cooperative estimation; distributed processing; intelligent transportation systems (ITS); vehicular traffic monitoring	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; PARTICLE FILTERS; SENSOR NETWORKS; MANAGEMENT; FUSION	Intelligent transportation systems have enormous potential for improving the quality of our lives. They rely on traffic monitoring and control infrastructures to enable an efficient management of mobility. A crucial task is the estimation or prediction of traffic flows by large-scale sensor networks, which is a topic that has been attracting increasing attention in recent years because of its relevance in traffic control over urban areas or freeways. In this paper, we propose an innovative stochastic method for vehicular traffic estimation based on a distributed reconstruction of the density field through the cooperation of smaller monitoring subnetworks. The method guarantees high accuracy (because of information sharing) and, at the same time, moderate computational cost (due to distributed processing). Moreover, subnetworks do not need to exchange sensitive information (e.g., raw data) but simply traffic beliefs. We evaluate the performance of the method on simulated single-lane road scenarios, highlighting the potential benefits of the cooperative approach. As an example of application, we consider a fragmented monitoring scenario characterized by several sensor failures and we show how the proposed approach can overcome the problem related to the sensor malfunctions leveraging on information shared with neighboring subnetworks.

J	Huang, WH; Song, GJ; Hong, HK; Xie, KQ				Huang, Wenhao; Song, Guojie; Hong, Haikun; Xie, Kunqing			Deep Architecture for Traffic Flow Prediction: Deep Belief Networks With Multitask Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Deep learning; multitask learning (MTL); task grouping; traffic flow prediction	INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS	Traffic flow prediction is a fundamental problem in transportation modeling and management. Many existing approaches fail to provide favorable results due to being: 1) shallow in architecture; 2) hand engineered in features; and 3) separate in learning. In this paper we propose a deep architecture that consists of two parts, i.e., a deep belief network (DBN) at the bottom and a multitask regression layer at the top. A DBN is employed here for unsupervised feature learning. It can learn effective features for traffic flow prediction in an unsupervised fashion, which has been examined and found to be effective for many areas such as image and audio classification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that applies the deep learning approach to transportation research. To incorporate multitask learning (MTL) in our deep architecture, a multitask regression layer is used above the DBN for supervised prediction. We further investigate homogeneous MTL and heterogeneous MTL for traffic flow prediction. To take full advantage of weight sharing in our deep architecture, we propose a grouping method based on the weights in the top layer to make MTL more effective. Experiments on transportation data sets show good performance of our deep architecture. Abundant experiments show that our approach achieved close to 5% improvements over the state of the art. It is also presented that MTL can improve the generalization performance of shared tasks. These positive results demonstrate that deep learning and MTL are promising in transportation research.

J	Abboud, K; Zhuang, WH				Abboud, Khadige; Zhuang, Weihua			Stochastic Analysis of a Single-Hop Communication Link in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Communication link; mesoscopic mobility; microscopic mobility; vehicle mobility; vehicle traffic flow	MODEL	A vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) is a promising addition to our future intelligent transportation systems, which supports various safety and infotainment applications. The high node mobility and frequent topology changes in VANETs impose new challenges in maintaining a long-lasting connection between network nodes. As a result, the lifetime of communication links is a crucial issue in VANET development and operation. This paper presents a probabilistic analysis of the communication link in VANETs for three vehicle density ranges. First, we present the stationary distribution of the communication link length using mesoscopic mobility models. Second, we propose a stochastic microscopic mobility model that captures time variations of intervehicle distances (distance headways). A discrete time finite-state Markov chain with state dependent transition probabilities is proposed to model the distance headway. Third, the proposed stochastic microscopic model and first passage time analysis are used to derive the probability distribution of the communication link lifetime. Numerical results are presented to evaluate the proposed model, which demonstrate a close agreement between analytical and simulation results.

The stability condition of the model is obtained by the control theory. The delayed feedback control signal is added to the two-lane model, and the corresponding stability condition is derived again. The numerical simulations show that as the stability conditions are satisfied, the small disturbance will not amplify with and without control signal. In the meantime, the stability is strengthened as the control signal is considered. So the control signal would suppress the traffic disturbance successfully.

A probabilistic stationary speed-density relation based on Newell's simplified car-following model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Newell's car-following; Microscopic traffic variables; Macroscopic traffic variables; Driver heterogeneity; Stationary traffic; Probabilistic macroscopic traffic relations	STOCHASTIC-MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW; FUNDAMENTAL DIAGRAM; GAMMA; SIMULATION; WAVES; ROAD	Probabilistic models describing macroscopic traffic flow have proven useful both in practice and in theory. In theoretical investigations of wide-scatter in flow-density data, the statistical features of flow density relations have played a central role. In real-time estimation and traffic forecasting applications, probabilistic extensions of macroscopic relations are widely used. However, how to obtain such relations, in a manner that results in physically reasonable behavior has not been addressed. This paper presents the derivation of probabilistic macroscopic traffic flow relations from Newell's simplified car-following model. The probabilistic nature of the model allows for investigating the impact of driver heterogeneity on macroscopic relations of traffic flow. The physical features of the model are verified analytically and shown to produce behavior which is consistent with well-established traffic flow principles. An empirical investigation is carried out using trajectory data from the New Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) program and the model's ability to reproduce real-world traffic data is validated.

Quasi-dynamic traffic assignment with residual point queues incorporating a first order node model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Quasi-dynamic traffic assignment; Stochastic user equilibrium; Capacity constrained; Residual point queues; First order node model	EQUILIBRIUM ASSIGNMENT; ALGORITHM; FLOWS; SIMULATION; NETWORKS; SCHEMES; DELAYS	Static traffic assignment models are still widely applied for strategic transport planning purposes in spite of the fact that such models produce implausible traffic flows that exceed link capacities and predict incorrect congestion locations. There have been numerous attempts to constrain link flows to capacity. Capacity constrained models with residual queues are often referred to as quasi-dynamic traffic assignment models. After reviewing the literature, we come to the conclusion that an important piece of the puzzle has been missing so far, namely the inclusion of a first order node model. In this paper we propose a novel path-based static traffic assignment model for finding a stochastic user equilibrium in general transportation networks. This model includes a first order (steady-state) node model that yields more realistic turn capacities, which are then used to determine consistent capacity constrained traffic flows, residual point (vertical) queues (upstream bottleneck links), and path travel times consistent with queuing theory. The route choice part of the model is specified as a variational inequality problem, while the network loading part is formulated as a fixed point problem. Both problems are solved using existing techniques to find a solution. We illustrate the model using hypothetical examples, and also demonstrate feasibility on large-scale networks.

The aim of this study is to analyze a 2.5 km section of O1 Freeway in Istanbul and to model it analytically with a macroscopic analytical traffic flow model METANET. The section under consideration has two merges. Traffic congestion, shock waves and queues occur on the section in rush hours. The fundamental parameters of METANET were estimated by using MATLAB. Data needed (speed and density) to estimate METANET parameters were collected from CORSIM simulation software calibrated for this section. The calibrated METANET model was able to represent traffic flow on the section successfully. It is expected that the calibrated METANET model can be used for performing studies on traffic control for a forecasting model.

The criterion for linear stability analysis and traveling wave solution of the homogeneous case is studied. The consideration of the lateral separation not only stabilizes the flow but also shrinks the critical region. For heterogeneous case, the fundamental diagram is examined for two different equilibrium speed-density functions and the erect of lane width is investigated for different compositions of heterogeneous traffic. The theoretical findings agree well with the results of numerical simulation which justifies the applicability of the model to a nonlane-based system.

J	Chung, CL; Recker, WW				Chung, Chih-Lin; Recker, Will W.			Characteristics of speed dispersion and its relationship to fundamental traffic flow parameters	TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						speed dispersion; coefficient of variation of speed; standard deviation of speed; macroscopic traffic flow model		Speed dispersion is essential for transportation research but inaccessible to certain sensors that simply record density, mean speed, and/or flow. An alternative is to relate speed dispersion with these available parameters. This paper is compiled from nearly a quarter million observations on an urban freeway and a resulting data-set with two speed dispersion measures and the three fundamental parameters. Data are examined individually by lane and aggregately by direction. The first dispersion measure, coefficient of variation of speed, is found to be exponential with density, negative exponential with mean speed, and two-phase linear to flow. These empirical relationships are proven to be general for a variety of coefficient ranges under the above function forms. The second measure, standard deviation of speed, does not present any simple relationships to the fundamental parameters, and its maximum occurs at around a half to two-thirds of the free flow speed. Speed dispersion may be significantly different by lane.

Data regarding travel time, average speed, maximum percent braking force and location of lane changes were collected by using a full size driving simulator. The NASA-TLX was used to measure self-reported workload ratings during the driving task. Conventional lane merge (CLM) and joint lane merge (JLM) were modeled in a driving simulator, and thirty participants (seven female and 23 male), navigated through the two configurations with two levels of traffic density. The mean maximum braking forces was 34% lower in the JLM configuration, and drivers going through the JLM configuration remained in the closed lane longer. However, no significant differences in speed were found between the two merge configurations. The analysis of self-reported workload ratings show that participants reported 15.3% lower total workload when driving through the JLM. In conclusion, the implemented changes in the JLM make it a more favorable merge configuration in both high and low traffic densities in terms of optimizing traffic flow by increasing the time and distance cars use both lanes, and in terms of improving safety due to lower braking forces and lower reported workload.

J	Strauss, J; Miranda-Moreno, LF; Morency, P				Strauss, Jillian; Miranda-Moreno, Luis F.; Morency, Patrick			Multimodal injury risk analysis of road users at signalized and non-signalized intersections	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Cyclist; Pedestrian; Motor-vehicle; Injury; Risk; Signalized and non-signalized intersections; Bayesian framework	VEHICLE; SAFETY; MODELS; PEDESTRIANS; EXPOSURE; RANKING; CRASHES; SERVICE; LEVEL	This paper proposes a multimodal approach to study safety at intersections by simultaneously analysing the safety and flow outcomes for both motorized and non-motorized traffic. This study uses an extensive inventory of signalized and non-signalized intersections on the island of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, containing disaggregate motor-vehicle, cyclist and pedestrian flows, injury data, geometric design, traffic control and built environment characteristics in the vicinity of each intersection. Bayesian multivariate Poisson models are used to analyze the injury and traffic flow outcomes and to develop safety performance functions for each mode at both facilities. After model calibration, contributing injury frequency factors are identified. Injury frequency and injury risk measures are then generated to carry out a comparative study to identify which mode is at greatest risk at intersections in Montreal. Among other results, this study identified the significant effect that motor-vehicle traffic imposes on cyclist and pedestrian injury occurrence. Motor-vehicle traffic is the main risk determinant for all injury and intersection types. This highlights the need for safety improvements for cyclists and pedestrians who are, on average, at 14 and 12 times greater risk than motorists, respectively, at signalized intersections.

The model's linear stability condition is obtained by applying the linear stability theory. And through nonlinear analysis, a modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation is derived to describe the propagating behavior of traffic density wave near the critical point. Numerical simulation shows that the new model can improve the stability of traffic flow by adjusting the driver's prevision intensity parameter, which is consistent with the theoretical analysis.

In this paper, an extended car-following model is presented by considering drivers' timid or aggressive characteristics. The impact of drivers' timid or aggressive characteristics on the stability of traffic flow has been analyzed through linear stability theory and nonlinear reductive perturbation method. Numerical simulation shows that the propagating behavior of traffic density waves near the critical point can be described by the kink-antikink soliton of the mKdV equation. The good agreement between the numerical simulation and the analytical results shows that drivers' characteristics play an important role in traffic jamming transition.

This paper presents a new traffic flow model based on the two-lane cellular automaton model. In a model where a finite number of particles (e.g. vehicles) or sites (e.g. traffic incident sites) have different properties from the rest these are usually called defects. The defective site's impact is introduced, bringing the changes of acceleration, deceleration, random deceleration and headway. At the defect site, the vehicles decelerate spontaneously. The greater the impact is, the larger deceleration probability will be. Simulations of the proposed model and the classic NaSch model are given. The results suggest the remaining capacity of the proposed model is approximately 54.6% of that of NaSch model. Compared to empirical data, the model can describe the traffic flow at defect site better than NaSch model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Traffic flow behavior at a single lane roundabout as compared to traffic circle	PHYSICS LETTERS A			English	Article						Cellular Automata; Roundabout; Traffic circle; Phase diagram; Stochastic noise	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; UNSIGNALISED INTERSECTION; PHASE-DIAGRAM	In this paper, we propose a stochastic Cellular Automata (CA) model to study traffic flow at a single-lane urban roundabout (resp. traffic circle) of N entry points (resp. exit points), the entry points are controlled by rates alpha(1) and alpha(2) while the removal rates from the exit points are denoted by beta. The traffic is controlled by a self-organized scheme. Based on computer simulation, density profiles, global density and current are calculated in terms of rates. Furthermore, the phase diagrams for roundabout as well as traffic circle are constructed. It has turned out that the phase diagrams consist essentially of two phases namely free flow and jamming. It is noted that the typology of the phase diagrams of the roundabout is not similar to it in the traffic circle. Furthermore, we have compared the performance of the two systems in terms of the geometrical properties and the number of entry points. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effect of slope on uphill/downhill highway is examined through linear stability analysis and shown that the slope significantly affects the stability region on the phase diagram. Using nonlinear stability analysis, the Burgers, Korteweg-deVries (KdV) and modified Korteweg-deVries (mKdV) equations are derived in stable, metastable and unstable region, respectively. The effect of reaction coefficient is examined and concluded that it plays an important role in suppressing the traffic jams on a gradient highway. The theoretical findings have been verified through numerical simulation which confirm that the slope on a gradient highway significantly influence the traffic dynamics and traffic jam can be suppressed efficiently by considering the optimal current difference effect in the new lattice model.

J	Jeerangsuwan, T; Said, H; Kandil, A; Ukkusuri, S				Jeerangsuwan, Tanaphat; Said, Hisham; Kandil, Amr; Ukkusuri, Satish			Financial Evaluation for Toll Road Projects Considering Traffic Volume and Serviceability Interactions	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Highway financing; Public private partnerships; Toll roads; Network equilibrium; Pavement serviceability; Traffic volume	OPERATE-TRANSFER SCHEME; INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; DEMAND UNCERTAINTY; REAL OPTIONS; MODEL; DECISION; EQUILIBRIUM	The rapid increase in both financial demands and the need for large and comprehensive highway infrastructure systems necessitates public authorities to muster support from the private sector. Public-private partnerships (PPP) have been increasingly adopted and cited as one of the most effective project delivery systems, which bring balance to risks and rewards between involved project participants. However, a number of PPP infrastructure projects around the world have been reported to have operating deficits and difficulties in debt-servicing. One of the major reasons for these difficulties is the unrealistic and inaccurate prediction of project investment performance during the initial stages of project viability and profitability analysis. Therefore, the research reported in this paper presents a formulation of a comprehensive framework that evaluates financial viability of PPP toll road projects. The framework utilizes a modified user-equilibrium traffic-assignment algorithm to estimate toll road traffic volume considering critical demand-influencing factors, which include travel time, pavement serviceability, and out-of-pocket user trip expenses. The proposed framework also considers the effects of the rehabilitation maintenance activities on the equilibrium flow pattern and project financial viability. This makes possible an estimation of the maintenance costs and frequency as well as an evaluation of the effects of rehabilitation programs on the traffic volume. The research reported in this paper also demonstrates the difference in traffic-flow patterns with and without interactive changes in pavement performance and traffic volume to demonstrate the need for incorporation of pavement performance and network levels of service into PPP highway project evaluation.

J	Zhang, L; Ma, Y				Zhang, L.; Ma, Y.			Pattern-based short-term traffic forecasting for urban heterogeneous conditions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Traffic forecasting; Multi-phase traffic flow theory; Auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)	FLOW PREDICTION; MODELS	Short-term traffic flow forecasting plays a significant role in the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), especially for traffic signal control and transportation planning research. Two mainly problems restrict the forecasting of urban freeway traffic parameters. One is the freeway traffic changes non-regularly under the heterogeneous traffic conditions, and the other is the successful predictability decreases sharply in multiple-steps-ahead prediction. In this paper, we present a novel pattern-based short-term traffic forecasting approach based on the integration of multi-phase traffic flow theory and time series analysis methods. For the purpose of prediction, the historical traffic data are classified by the dynamic flow-density relation into three traffic patterns (free flow, synchronized and congested pattern), and then different predict models are built respectively according to the classified traffic patterns. With the current traffic data, the future traffic state can be online predicted by means of pattern matching to identify traffic patterns. Finally, a comparative study in a section of the Third-Loop Freeway, LIULIQIAO, Beijing city, shows that the proposed approach represents more accurately the anticipated traffic flow when compared to the classical time series models that without integration with the traffic flow theory.

Autonomous vehicles are able to share information about the local traffic state in real time, which could result in a better reaction to the mechanism of traffic jam formation. An upstream single-hop radio broadcast network can improve the perception of each cooperative driver within a specific radio range and hence the traffic stability. The impact of vehicle to vehicle cooperation on the onset of traffic congestion is investigated analytically and through simulation. A next generation simulation field dataset is used to calibrate the full velocity difference car-following model, and the MOBIL lane-changing model is implemented. The robustness of the calibration as well as the heterogeneity of the drivers is discussed. Assuming that congestion can be triggered either by the heterogeneity of drivers' behaviours or abnormal lane-changing behaviours, the calibrated car-following model is used to assess the impact of a microscopic cooperative law on egoistic lane-changing behaviours. The cooperative law can help reduce and delay traffic congestion and can have a positive effect on safety indicators.

J	Wan, YW; Yang, TI; Keathly, D; Buckles, B				Wan, Yiwen; Yang, Tze-I; Keathly, David; Buckles, Bill			Dynamic scene modelling and anomaly detection based on trajectory analysis	IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article								A real-time scene modelling approach is presented that recognises temporary and permanent road structure change resulting from construction, accident or lane expansion and other obstructions. The system defined utilises a two-phase approach to modelling the scene. In the transitional phase, a dominant set-based graphical clustering approach is applied to understand the current scene structure from trajectory groupings, whereas the operational phase analyses the trajectories in real-time to detect anomalies such as u-turns, wrong-way or erratic drivers based on the acquired model of the scene structure and normal traffic patterns. In addition, the concept of dynamic traffic flow analysis is utilised to identify and remember temporary additions and removals of paths due to construction and accidents, as well as permanent road structure changes. An intuitive equal-arc-length sampling is applied to extract only the spatial information from the trajectory comparisons, since the spatial characteristics alone are sufficient for road structure understanding. A distance metric is developed to measure spatial difference and directional change of the path with entrance and exit awareness. Results for a publicly available dataset are provided, demonstrating that the method can efficiently model the scene, detect anomalies and capture both temporary and permanent scene reconstructions.

Values of passing sight distance recommended by road design rulebooks and recommendations are often not consistent with the length of passing distance which occurs in the real traffic flow. In the research conducted for this study, it was found that the passing distance in real traffic flow are significantly shorter than the values obtained by mathematical models.

Each equation describes the density evolution of vehicles having a common path along the network. In this formulation the junctions disappear since each path is considered as a single uninterrupted road. We consider a Godunov-based approximation scheme for the system which is very easy to implement. Besides basic properties like the conservation of cars and positive bounded solutions, the scheme exhibits other nice properties, being able to select automatically a solution at network's nodes without requiring external procedures (e.g., maximization of the flux via a linear programming method). Moreover, the scheme can be interpreted as a discretization of the traffic models with buffer, although no buffer is introduced here. Finally, we show how the scheme can be recast in the framework of the classical theory of traffic flow on networks, where a conservation law has to be solved on each arc of the network. This is achieved by solving the Riemann problem for a modified equation, and showing that its solution corresponds to the one computed by the numerical scheme.

In such a case, the amount of data collected depends on two variables: the penetration rate of devices in traffic flow (P) and their data sampling frequency (z). Referring to data composition as the way certain number of observations is collected, in terms of P and z, we need to understand the relation between the amount and composition of data collected, and the accuracy achieved in traffic state estimation. This was accomplished through an in-depth analysis of two datasets of vehicle trajectories on freeways. The first dataset consists of trajectories over a real freeway, while the second dataset is obtained through microsimulation. Hypothetical scenarios of data sent by equipped vehicles were created, based on the composition of data collected. Different values of P and z were used, and each unique combination defined a specific scenario. Traffic states were estimated through two simple methods, and a more advanced one that incorporates traffic flow theory. A measure to quantify data to be collected was proposed, based on travel time, number of vehicles, penetration rate and sampling frequency. The error was below 6% for every scenario in each dataset. Also, increasing data reduced variability in data count estimation. The performance of the different estimation methods varied through each dataset and scenario. Since the same number of observations can be gathered with different combinations of P and z, the effect of data composition was analyzed (a trade-off between penetration rate and sampling frequency). Different situations were found. In some, an increase in penetration rate is more effective to reduce estimation error than an increase in sampling frequency, considering an equal increase in observations. In other areas, the opposite relationship was found. Between these areas, an indifference curve was found. In fact, this curve is the solution to the optimization problem of minimizing the error given any fixed number of observations. As a general result, increasing sampling frequency (penetration rate) is more beneficial when the current sampling frequency (penetration rate) is low, independent of the penetration rate (sampling frequency).

However, because of the usually short length of the on-ramps, RM is typically deactivated to avoid interference of the created ramp queue with adjacent street traffic. By the integration of local RM with mainstream traffic flow control (MTFC) enabled via variable speed limits (VSL), control operation upstream of active bottlenecks could be continued even if the on-ramp is full or if the RM lower bound has been reached. Such integration is proposed via the extension of an existing local cascade feedback controller for MTFC-VSL by use of a split-range-like scheme that allows different control periods for RM and MTFC-VSL. The new integrated controller remains simple yet efficient and suitable for field implementation. The controller is evaluated in simulation for a real motorway infrastructure (a ring-road) fed with real (measured) demands and compared to stand-alone RM or MTFC-VSL, both with feedback and optimal control results. The controller's performance is shown to meet the specifications and to approach the optimal control results for the investigated scenario. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Yu, RJ; Abdel-Aty, M				Yu, Rongjie; Abdel-Aty, Mohamed			An optimal variable speed limits system to ameliorate traffic safety risk	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Variable speed limit; Traffic safety; Driver compliance; Crash risk; Micro-simulation	CRASHES; FREEWAYS; WEATHER; MODELS	Active Traffic Management (ATM) systems have been emerging in recent years in the US and Europe. They provide control strategies to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion on freeways. This study investigates the feasibility of utilizing a Variable Speed Limits (VSL) system, one key part of ATM, to improve traffic safety on freeways. A proactive traffic safety improvement VSL control algorithm is proposed. First, an extension of the METANET (METANET: A macroscopic simulation program for motorway networks) traffic flow model is employed to analyze VSL's impact on traffic flow. Then, a real-time crash risk evaluation model is estimated for the purpose of quantifying crash risk. Finally, optimal VSL control strategies are achieved by employing an optimization technique to minimize the total crash risk along the VSL implementation corridor. Constraints are setup to limit the increase of average travel time and the differences of the posted speed limits temporarily and spatially. This novel VSL control algorithm can proactively reduce crash risk and therefore improve traffic safety. The proposed VSL control algorithm is implemented and tested for a mountainous freeway bottleneck area through the micro-simulation software VISSIM. Safety impacts of the VSL system are quantified as crash risk improvements and speed homogeneity improvements. Moreover, three different driver compliance levels are modeled in VISSIM to monitor the sensitivity of VSL effects on driver compliance. Conclusions demonstrated that the proposed VSL system could improve traffic safety by decreasing crash risk and enhancing speed homogeneity under both the high and moderate compliance levels; while the VSL system fails to significantly enhance traffic safety under the low compliance scenario. Finally, future implementation suggestions of the VSL control strategies and related research topics are also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our methodology gravitates around a powerful decision-making method: ensemble-based systems. This technique is used to accurately classify the near future traffic conditions and to make efficient decisions for adapting the traffic lights sequences within an urban area to optimize the traffic flows. The proposed approach requires only measurements provided by traffic sensors located along the principal roads entering the zone. This reduced number of sensors are considered to be enough relevant for classifying the near future state of the traffic and moreover, their measurements can be validated through analytical/hardware redundancy. Our methodology is meant to be implemented within the framework of a wireless sensor and actuator network and is confirmed by computer simulation, including normal or abnormal traffic conditions, for the central part of the city of Timisoara-Romania.

J	Zhang, JL; Zong, Q				Zhang, Jinglong; Zong, Qun			Energy-saving-oriented group-elevator dispatching strategy for multi-traffic patterns	BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Building transport system; elevator group control system; scheduling	ROBUST OPTIMIZATION MODEL; CONTROL-SYSTEM; DESIGN	Energy-saving elevator dispatching has been recognized as a challenging issue in building transportation, and we develop a novel energy-saving dispatching strategy for regenerative group-elevator system. Group-elevator dispatching is a typical combinatorial optimization problem, and three keys of the dispatching optimization are optimization method, objective, and model. The three keys of energy-saving-oriented elevator dispatching are studied in this paper. First, robust optimization method is introduced to handle dispatching optimization under uncertain elevator traffic flows; uncertain flows influence energy-saving dispatching seriously. Second, dispatching energy-objective function for regenerative group-elevator system is derived both schedule energy for four traffic patterns (up-peak, down-peak, up/down-mixed, and night) and return energy for two peak patterns (up-peak and down-peak) are considered. Third, four robust optimization-dispatching models for four traffic patterns are built, and optimization objectives of four models are minimizing the energy-objective function. Moreover, because we cannot solve robust optimization models with uncertain parameters directly, model counterpart transformation is studied. Finally, we solve the four transformed models by Linear Interactive and General Optimizer software and obtain robust optimization-dispatching solutions. In practice, four energy-saving-dispatching robust optimization models are switched according to real-time traffic patterns, and elevators are dispatched based on the dispatching solutions. We reduce elevator system-energy consumption effectively and keep average waiting time of the passengers acceptable under multi-traffic patterns. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of our strategy. Practical application: Group-elevator system spends much unnecessary energy because of the uncertainty of elevator passenger-traffic flows. This paper develops an energy-saving elevator-dispatching optimization strategy, which is immune to the uncertainty of four typical traffic flows. In practice, we update the group-elevator controller by our algorithm to realize energy-saving dispatching of regenerative group-elevator system under multi-traffic patterns.

A geography of moral hazard: Sources and sinks of motor-vehicle commuting externalities	HEALTH & PLACE			English	Article						Motor-vehicle commuting; Environmental externalities; Health inequality; Spatial justice	ROAD TRAFFIC NOISE; AIR-POLLUTION; RESPIRATORY HEALTH; ETHNIC-DIFFERENCES; OUTDOOR AIR; URBAN; EXPOSURE; DISTANCE; RISK; CAR	Motor-vehicles are responsible for harms to health that are not directly experienced by individual drivers - such as air pollution and risk of injury to pedestrians. In addition to their direct effects on health, these harms also represent a moral hazard since drivers are not required to consider their effects as part of their decision to drive. We describe an approach for estimating sources of motor-vehicle commuter externalities as a means of understanding the geography of moral hazard, and in particular, the spatial displacement of negative health externalities associated with motor-vehicle commuting. This approach models motor-vehicle commuter traffic flow by trip origin for small geographic areas within the City of Toronto, Ontario. We find that most health-related externalities associated with motor-vehicle commuters are not locally generated, with a large share coming from outside Toronto. Low income is associated with externalities originating outside the municipal boundary, but not with locally sourced externalities. We discuss the impact of geographical moral hazard on the agency of citizens as well as policy options aimed at addressing motor-vehicle externalities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Without this formula, highway engineers are unable to assess the travel time savings of the underground tunnel road projects, and this troubling situation deters a reasonable progress of this massive plan. To deal with this problem, the research carried out a field survey study in an existing mountain tunnel to capture the characteristics of tunnel traffic flow and conducted a follow-up study to calibrate operational parameters of this tunnel traffic flow. The Golden Section search method was adopted in this purpose and major findings revealed that a reliable VDF could be successfully developed based on the analysis of existing mountain tunnel flows. It was also found that traffic volume levels estimated with existing VDF's and the ones estimated with developed VDF's were much different: a more reasonable volume level was observed across all highway links. We thus concluded that the developed VDF's should be applied to assess travel time savings of the underground tunnel road projects in Seoul. The study results can be applied successfully to six lane tunnels, but more validation efforts are required for other types of tunnels.

Subjects must choose between two routes-Road and Metro. The travel cost on the road is increasing in the number of commuters who choose this route, while the travel cost on the metro is decreasing in the number of its users. We examine how changes to the road capacity, the number of commuters, and the metro pricing scheme influence the commuters' route-choice behavior. According to the Downs-Thomson paradox, improved road capacity increases travel times along both routes because it attracts more users to the road and away from the metro, thereby worsening both services. A change in route design generates two Nash equilibria; and the resulting coordination problem is amplified even further when the number of commuters is large. We find that, similar to other binary choice experiments with congestion effects, aggregate traffic flows are close to the equilibrium levels, but systematic individual differences persist over time.

The simulation results show that the multi-slowdown sections can lead to multiphase coexistences (i.e. free flow phase, congestion phase and saturation phase) in traffic system. The fundamental diagram shows that the number of slowdown section does not influence the mean velocity and the mean flow under the periodic boundary condition, but the existence of slowdown sections can effectively reduce the occurrence of traffic accident. In particular, it is found that the probability of car accidents to occur is the largest at the joint of the normal-speed section and slowdown section, and the underlying mechanism is analyzed. In addition, to design the appropriate limited speed and reduce the differences between the normal speed and limited speed will alleviate traffic congestion and reduce the occurrence of traffic accidents obviously.

J	Li, ZP; Chen, LZ				Li Zhipeng; Chen Lizhu			Effect of intelligent control strategy on safety-collision region of lane changing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Lane changing; intelligent control strategy; pre-warning mechanism	CAR-FOLLOWING THEORY; TRAFFIC FLOW; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; DIFFERENCE MODEL; VELOCITY; JAMS	In this paper, we study the vehicular behavior in which a vehicle changes from the first lane to the second lane on a two-lane highway. The incoming vehicle may collide with the adjacent vehicles from the incoming position due to the inappropriate vehicular velocity and headway. An intelligent control strategy with consideration of the information of the incoming vehicle is proposed to reduce the collision of lane changing, and the effectiveness of the new design is verified by drawing the dynamic safety-collision region maps of the simulations. The effects of the strategy's coverage on lane changing collision are also studied with the finding that the expanding of the safety region of lane changing is limited by extending the coverage of the proposed strategy. Furthermore, the strategy is extended to add pre-warning mechanism, and the effects of the pre-warning mechanism on lane changing collision are obtained by drawing the safety-collision region maps. It is concluded that the collision region of the lane changing shrinks with the adding of the pre-warning mechanism. The coverage of the extended strategy is also spread from one vehicle to more vehicles and we get the same result as the strategy without adding the pre-warning mechanism.

In this paper, a new car-following model considering the driver's forecast effect is investigated to describe the traffic jam. The nature of the model is studied using linear and nonlinear analysis method. A thermodynamic theory is formulated to describe the phase transition and critical phenomenon in traffic flow and the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation is derived to describe the traffic flow near the critical point. It is also shown that the modified Korteweg-de Veris (mKdV) equation is derived to describe the traffic jam. The connection between the TDGL and the mKdV equations is given.

J	Giang, NTH; Oanh, NTK				Nguyen Tran Huong Giang; Nguyen Thi Kim Oanh			Roadside levels and traffic emission rates of PM2.5 and BTEX in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Roadside PM2.5; BTEX; Inverse modeling; Fleet emission rate; Emission factor; Ho Chi Minh City	PARTICULATE MATTER; AIR; POLLUTION; POLLUTANTS; VEHICLES	A monitoring program was designed and implemented to characterize roadside levels of PM2.5 and BTEX in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and to generate input data for CALINE (California LINE Source Dispersion Model) inverse modeling. Monitoring was done during Dec 2007-Jan 2008, on both weekdays and weekends, and yielded 284 hourly BTEX samples (adsorption tubes), 24 samples of 8 h-PM2.5 and 42 samples of 24 h-PM2.5 (by MiniVol samplers). The air sampling was done at 8 points on both sides of one street that had an average traffic flow, simultaneously meteorology data and vehicle flows were recorded. Roadside 24 h-PM2.5 levels were 97 +/- 31(53-151) mu g m(-3), higher on weekdays than weekends. Diurnal BTEX variation patterns were consistent with the diurnal flows of 6 vehicle categories moving on the street. BTEX levels were reduced with the increase in downwind distance from traffic lanes (approximately by 15% for each 5 m increment). Principal component analysis also confirmed the association between roadside pollution levels and traffic. A calculation algorithm was developed to remove the urban background, contributed by other sources than traffic in the selected street, from the roadside measured pollution levels. Urban background contributed a majority of PM2.5 (90-98%) and hourly BTEX (67-97%) with higher contributions at upwind side of the street and at late evening hours when less traffic was observed. CALINE inverse modeling produced explainable fleet hourly emission rates (g km(-1) h(-1)) and vehicle emission factors (EF, mg veh(-1) km(-1)). The obtained EF for gasoline and diesel vehicles were comparable with recent measurements made in Asian cities, as well as with calculated EFs for European and US urban fleets about 10-15 years ago. To minimize the collinearity problem encountered in inverse traffic modeling it is essential that the monitoring is done at different times to capture significant variations in the street traffic compositions.

J	Risto, M; Martens, MH				Risto, Malte; Martens, Marieke H.			Assessing driver's ability to estimate compliance rates to in-car, advisory driver support	EUROPEAN TRANSPORT RESEARCH REVIEW			English	Article						Advisory driver support; Traffic flow improvement; Social dilemma; Conditional cooperation; Compliance rate; Estimation		Purpose In-car support systems focus increasingly on improving traffic flow and throughput. Advisory systems allow for fast market penetration, advising drivers how to drive in order to improve general flow. By following the advice, drivers cannot create a beneficial effect by themselves but rely on other road users to comply as well. Drivers who sense a low compliance among other road users may be discouraged to use the system themselves. The present experiment investigated whether drivers are able to distinguish between various compliance rates to Connected Cruise Control (CCC), an advisory driver support system that gives headway, speed and lane advice to improve throughput on motorways. Method Forty-two participants estimated the compliance of other road users to CCC in a driving simulator. Actual system compliance was varied between 10, 50 and 90 %. Half of the participants received detailed information about the advice and the manifestation of compliant behaviour in traffic. Results Compliance estimates showed no effect of actual compliance rates. Overall compliance ratings were higher for participants who had not received additional information about the system. Difference scores between compliance estimate and actual compliance indicate that additional information did not improve estimation accuracy, neither did it increase participants' confidence with their estimate. Conclusions When actual compliance is low, drivers still show high compliance estimates which can have beneficial effect on system acceptance. Additional information does not improve compliance estimates.

J	Qi, H; Wang, D; Chen, P; Bie, Y				Qi, H.; Wang, D.; Chen, P.; Bie, Y.			A structural raffic flow model for urban arterial roads	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Arterial road; Traffic signal; Spillover; Performance indexes	TRAFFIC FLOW; OPTIMIZATION	A structural model for urban arterial roads traffic flow is proposed. It describes the road traffic dynamics in a disaggregated way. The structural model's main components are as follows: (I) A link traffic model that tracks the traffic waves cyclically: Traffic waves within each cycle are captured by three characteristic points. These points are formed when different traffic waves meet. (2) A proportional line model that is used to split the overall outflow into different turning flows: The model is derived directly from the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle. (3) A spillover component that deals with channelized section queue overflow. (4) A traffic flow performance index component that outputs macroscopic and microscopic-level indexes. These indexes include delays, stops, queue lengths, vehicle trajectories, and travel times. The first three can be used in traffic flow optimization and the last two are valuable in vehicle emissions evaluation. Simulation results show that, with increasing numerical resolution, the traditional CTM (cell transmission model) gradually converges to our model.

J	Wang, YZ; Hu, JM; Li, L; Zhang, Y				Wang, Yizhi; Hu, Jianming; Li, Li; Zhang, Yi			Optimal coordination of variable speed limit to eliminate freeway wide moving jams	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Variable speed limit; WMJ elimination; three-phase traffic theory; cellular automata	TRAFFIC-FLOW; MODEL	Variable speed limit (VSL) is well-known for the ability to eliminate freeway wide moving jam (WMJ). Different VSL maneuvers have been proposed and proved to be useful theoretically or empirically. However, the coordination of VSL still needs to be analyzed in order to cater for different traffic conditions encountered on the roadway. In this paper, we execute a study on freeway VSL method based on the three-phase traffic theory and Cellular Automata (CA) based simulations. Results indicate that VSL is a promising method in solving freeway WMJs, but in some cases, it induces new congestions due to improper configurations and the stochastic feature of traffic flow. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an optimal coordination model of VSL including five main principles. The purpose of our model lies on two aspects, to ensure the elimination of WMJ and to avoid the emergence of new traffic jams. By analyzing the traffic dynamics, we first present several theoretical principles of VSL configuration with respect to the WMJ elimination.

Ilgin; Menendez, Monica; Meier, Linus			Using connected vehicle technology to improve the efficiency of intersections	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Connected vehicle; Traffic control; Intersections; Traffic flow		Information from connected vehicles, such as the position and speed of individual vehicles, can be used to optimize traffic operations at an intersection. This paper proposes such an algorithm for two one-way-streets assuming that only a certain percentage of cars are equipped with this technology. The algorithm enumerates different sequences of cars discharging from the intersection to minimize the objective function. Benefits of platooning (multiple cars consecutively discharging from a queue) and signal flexibility (adaptability to demand) are also considered. The goal is to gain insights about the value (in terms of delay savings) of using connected vehicle technology for intersection control. Simulations are conducted for different total demand values and demand ratios to understand the effects of changing the minimum green time at the signal and the penetration rate of connected cars. Using autonomous vehicle control systems, the signal could rapidly change the direction of priority without relying on the reaction of drivers. However, without this technology a minimum green time is necessary. The results of the simulations show that a minimum green time increases the delay only for the low and balanced demand scenarios. Therefore, the value of using cars with autonomous vehicle control can only be seen at intersections with this kind of demand patterns, and could result in up to 7% decrease in delay. On the other hand, using information from connected vehicles to better adapt the traffic signal has proven to be indeed very valuable. Increases in the penetration rate from 0% up to 60% can significantly reduce the average delay (in low demand scenarios a decrease in delay of up to 60% can be observed). That being said, after a penetration rate of 60%, while the delays continue to decrease, the rate of reduction decreases and the marginal value of information from communication technologies diminishes. Overall, it is observed that connected vehicle technology could significantly improve the operation of traffic at signalized intersections, at least under the proposed algorithm.

J	Haworth, J; Shawe-Taylor, J; Cheng, T; Wang, JQ				Haworth, James; Shawe-Taylor, John; Cheng, Tao; Wang, Jiaqiu			Local online kernel ridge regression for forecasting of urban travel times	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Forecasting; Travel time; Prediction; Time series; Kernel method; Machine learning	TRAFFIC FLOW PREDICTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; OPTIMIZATION; MODELS; VOLUME; SVR; ALGORITHMS; PARAMETERS; AVERAGE	Accurate and reliable forecasting of traffic variables is one of the primary functions of Intelligent Transportation Systems. Reliable systems that are able to forecast traffic conditions accurately, multiple time steps into the future, are required for advanced traveller information systems. However, traffic forecasting is a difficult task because of the nonlinear and nonstationary properties of traffic series. Traditional linear models are incapable of modelling such properties, and typically perform poorly, particularly when conditions differ from the norm. Machine learning approaches such as artificial neural networks, nonparametric regression and kernel methods (KMs) have often been shown to outperform linear models in the literature. A bottleneck of the latter approach is that the information pertaining to all previous traffic states must be contained within the kernel, but the computational complexity of KMs usually scales cubically with the number of data points in the kernel. In this paper, a novel kernel-based machine learning (ML) algorithm is developed, namely the local online kernel ridge regression (LOKRR) model. Exploiting the observation that traffic data exhibits strong cyclic patterns characterised by rush hour traffic, LOKRR makes use of local kernels with varying parameters that are defined around each time point. This approach has 3 advantages over the standard single kernel approach: (1) It allows parameters to vary by time of day, capturing the time varying distribution of traffic data; (2) It allows smaller kernels to be defined that contain only the relevant traffic patterns, and; (3) It is online, allowing new traffic data to be incorporated as it arrives. The model is applied to the forecasting of travel times on London's road network, and is found to outperform three benchmark models in forecasting lip to 1 h ahead. (C) 2014 The Authors.

By using the control method, the stability condition is derived. The feedback signals, which include vehicular information from both lanes, acting on the two-lane traffic system have been introduced into the Full Velocity Difference car-following model. In the end, simulations are conducted to examine the validity and reasonability of the control method. It is proven that lane changing behaviors can aggravate the traffic perturbation. The traffic flow congestion could be suppressed by using the control method and the simulation results are in good agreement with the theoretical analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

The two-regime transmission model for network loading in dynamic traffic assignment problems	TRANSPORTMETRICA A-TRANSPORT SCIENCE			English	Article						cell transmission model; LWR model; dynamic network loading; two-regime transmission model; dynamic traffic assignment	VARIATIONAL INEQUALITY FORMULATION; DESIRABLE PROPERTIES; KINEMATIC WAVES; HIGHWAY; FLOW; SPILLBACK	Dynamic network loading (DNL) model is concerned with moving traffic in space and time along road network links in dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models. DNL models strive to build in traffic realism such as modelling transient queues and spillback to upstream links, yet they need to remain computable. Most models in the literature are skewed towards either realism or computability and thus leave a wide scope for further research in arriving at a balanced model. This research proposes a new DNL model called the Two-regime transmission model (TTM) based on widely accepted first-order traffic flow theory. The TTM aims to be quick and accurate enough for planning purposes, when embedded into the framework of a DTA. The TTM considers the time-dependent density states of network links over two regimes namely, free-flowing and congested regimes, and dynamically models the time-dependent queue length, but without the need to break the link into cells. This article sets out the theoretical background necessary for developing the TTM and it also illustrates the principles with the help of a simple network serving a single OD pair. Although the numerical tests are only preliminary indicators, the TTM has been found to produce promising results, for example producing results that are apparently closer than the cell transmission model (CTM) to predicting the dissipation and formation of a queue in a homogeneous link for the same level of time discretisation. We believe that our work establishes TTM as a candidate worthy of future exploration, especially for representing plausible, first-order traffic dynamics within a dynamic user equilibrium model with a lower number of variables/side-constraints than the CTM.

J	Mai, T; Ghosh, B; Wilson, S				Mai, Tiep; Ghosh, Bidisha; Wilson, Simon			Short-term traffic-flow forecasting with auto-regressive moving average models	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-TRANSPORT			English	Article						mathematical modelling; statistical analysis; transport management	PREDICTION	Short-term traffic-flow forecasting, the process of predicting future traffic conditions based on historical and real-time observations, is an essential aspect of intelligent transportation systems. The existing well-known algorithms used for short-term traffic flow include time-series analysis-based techniques, of which the seasonal auto-regressive moving average model is one of the most precise methods used in this field. The effectiveness of short-term traffic flow in an urban transport network can be fully realised only in its multivariate form where traffic flow is predicted at multiple sites simultaneously. In this paper, this concept in explored utilising an additive seasonal vector auto-regressive moving average model to predict traffic flow in the short-term future considering the spatial dependency among multiple sites. The dynamic linear model representation of the auto-regressive moving average model is used to reduce the number of latent variables. The parameters of the model are estimated in a Bayesian inference framework employing a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method. The efficiency of the proposed prediction algorithm is evaluated by modelling real-time traffic-flow observations available from a certain junction in the city centre of Dublin, Ireland.

J	Thankappan, A; Vanajakshi, L				Thankappan, Ajitha; Vanajakshi, Lelitha			A traffic stream model for heterogeneous traffic conditions	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-TRANSPORT			English	Article						mathematical modelling; roads & highways; traffic engineering		A comprehensive understanding of speed-flow-density relations is an essential requirement in planning, design and operation of transportation systems. Many researchers have investigated the nature of speed-flow-density relationships, commonly known as stream models, under homogeneous traffic conditions. However, those models may not be the best under Indian traffic conditions. Indian traffic differs significantly from homogeneous traffic and may need a different treatment for analysis. Not much research has been reported on this important aspect so far from India. The present study is an attempt to develop an optimal traffic stream model suitable for the heterogeneous traffic flow condition existing in India, taking Chennai as a case study. A two-regime speed-density relationship was developed using a conventional optimisation algorithm. Using this, the speed-flow and flow-density relationships were theoretically derived. The results indicate that the proposed model is able to represent the steady-state macroscopic behaviour of the heterogeneous and less lane-disciplined traffic stream under study with reasonable accuracy.

J	Mitran, G; Ilie, S				Mitran, Gabriela; Ilie, Sorin			METHOD FOR INVENTORYING CO EMISSIONS FROM ROAD TRAFFIC IN URBAN AREAS THROUGH TRANSPORT MODELING	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						air pollution; carbon monoxide; road traffic; traffic model; urban area	AIR-QUALITY	Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas obtained both from natural sources (bush fires, volcanic emissions and electric discharges) and by anthropogenic processes (incomplete combustion of fossil fuels). Together with particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons, it is part of the air pollutants associated with the transport sector, which have a negative impact on human health, animals and vegetation. In this paper the authors propose a methodology for assessing CO emissions from road traffic in urban areas, created by harmonization between a traffic estimation model, which takes into account the land use functions and the user behavior, and a CO emissions estimation model, which takes into consideration the average travel speed and the engine type of each motor vehicle from the traffic flow. Within the case study in which this methodology is applied we have estimated a reduction in the CO emissions produced by road traffic in the city of Pitesti, as a result of the fact that the existing road network was completed with a bypass road. It is highlighted that for the internal network of the city, in the peak traffic interval in the morning, the level of emissions in the atmosphere is 30% lower than in the case in which the transit traffic would use the urban network instead of the bypass road. The presented methodology is a very useful tool in quantifying the environmental impact produced by road traffic, specific to different situations of land use and transport networks.

J	Ge, HX; Cheng, RJ; Lo, SM				Ge Hong-Xia; Cheng Rong-Jun; Lo Siu-Ming			A Lattice Model for Bidirectional Pedestrian Flow on Gradient Road	COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						pedestrian flow; lattice hydrodynamic model; gradient road	JAMMING TRANSITION; TRAFFIC FLOW; MACRO MODEL; BICYCLE	Ramps and sloping roads appear everywhere in the built environment. It is obvious that the movement pattern of people in the sloping path may be different as compared with the pattern on level roads. Previously, most of the studies, especially the mathematical and simulation models, on pedestrian movement consider the flow at level routes. This study proposes a new lattice model for bidirectional pedestrian flow on gradient road. The stability condition is obtained by using linear stability theory. The nonlinear analysis method is employed to derive the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation, and the space of pedestrian flow is divided into three regions: the stable region, the metastable region, and the unstable region respectively. Furthermore, the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landan (TDGL) equation is deduced and solved through the reductive perturbation method. Finally, we present detailed results obtained from the model, and it is found that the stability of the model is enhanced in uphill situation while reduced in downhill situation with increasing slope.

COMPUTER GRAPHICS FORUM			English	Article								Urban data ranging from images and laser scans to traffic flows are regularly analyzed and modeled leading to better scene understanding. Commonly used computational approaches focus on geometric descriptors, both for images and for laser scans. In contrast, in urban planning, a large body of work has qualitatively evaluated street networks to understand their effects on the functionality of cities, both for pedestrians and for cars. In this work, we analyze street networks, both their topology (i.e., connectivity) and their geometry (i.e., layout), in an attempt to understand which factors play dominant roles in determining the characteristic of cities. We propose a set of street network descriptors to capture the essence of city layouts and use them, in a supervised setting, to classify and categorize various cities across the world. We evaluate our method on a range of cities, of various styles, and demonstrate that while standard image-level descriptors perform poorly, the proposed network-level descriptors can distinguish between different cities reliably and with high accuracy.

J	Yang, H; Ozbay, K; Bartin, B; Ozturk, O				Yang, Hong; Ozbay, Kaan; Bartin, Bekir; Ozturk, Ozgur			Assessing the Safety Effects of Removing Highway Mainline Barrier Toll Plazas	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Toll roads; Safety; Toll plazas; Traffic crashes; Empirical Bayesian; Crash costs	ROAD SAFETY	Toll plazas create a number of bottlenecks on highways. They can induce motor vehicle crashes and also put workers such as toll collectors at risk. Enhancing safety at toll plazas is crucial to improving safety on tolled roadways. This study aims to evaluate the safety effects of removing mainline barrier toll plazas on highways using empirical Bayesian (EB) methodology. Recent removals of barrier toll plazas on the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey were used as a case study. Multiple-year traffic and crash data before and after the removals of the barrier toll plazas were used for evaluation. Toll plaza crash frequency models as a function of traffic flow and other relevant factors were developed, with the modeling results suggesting that there is a nonlinear relationship between toll plaza crash occurrences and both traffic flow as well as tollbooth configurations. The EB approach is also used to predict crash frequency assuming that the barrier tollbooths were not removed. These EB-based estimates were compared with the observed number of crashes after the removals of the toll plazas. Individual comparisons show reductions in crash occurrence at almost all of the toll plazas and an estimated reduction of 42.1% overall at all toll plazas due to the removal of the barrier tollbooths. The estimated crash cost was reduced by 40.1%. These estimated reductions demonstrate that the removal of barrier toll plazas is a very beneficial countermeasure towards improving safety of toll roads.

This work proposes a congestion rate estimation approach that relies on real-time video scenes of road traffic, and was implemented and evaluated on eight different hotspots covering 33 different urban roads. The approach relies on road scene morphology for estimation of vehicles average speed along with measuring the overall video scenes randomness acting as a frame texture analysis indicator. Experimental results shows the feasibility of the proposed approach in reliably estimating traffic density and in providing an early warning to drivers on road conditions, thereby mitigating the negative effect of slow traffic flow on their daily lives.

The soliton solution is obtained from the KdV equation. Under periodical boundary, the KdV soliton of traffic flow is demonstrated by numerical simulation. The numerical simulation result is consistent with the nonlinear analytical result. Under open system, the density fluctuation of the downstream last one lattice is designed to explore the empirical congested traffic states. A phase diagram is presented which includes free traffic, moving localized cluster, triggered stop-and-go traffic, oscillating congested traffic, and homogeneous congested traffic. Finally, the spatiotemporal evolution of all the traffic states described in phase diagram are reproduced. Results suggest that the two-lane density difference hydrodynamic traffic model is suitable to describe the actual traffic.

By means of the linear stability analysis, the effect of drivers' delay time on the stability of two-lane traffic flow is examined and shown that with the drivers' delay time increasing, the unstable areas expand accordingly on the phase diagram, which is also confirmed by direct computer simulations. Through nonlinear analysis method, the modified Korteweg-deVries equation near the critical point is obtained and solved to describe the traffic- jamming transitions in a two-lane system.

According to traffic flow theory, such variability should induce a similar variability in travel times, but this "internal consistency" is generally not captured by existing network equilibrium models. We present an internally-consistent network equilibrium approach, which considers two potential sources of flow variability: (i) daily variation in route choice and (ii) daily variation in origin-destination demand. We particularly aspire to a flexible formulation that permits alternative statistical assumptions, which allows the best fit to be made to observed variability data in particular applications. Joint probability distributions of route-and therefore link-flows are derived under several assumptions concerning stochastic driver behavior. A stochastic network equilibrium model with stochastic demands and route choices is formulated as a fixed point problem. We explore limiting cases which allow an equivalent convex optimization problem to be defined, and finally apply this method to a real-life network of Kanazawa City, Japan. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A finite-dimensional variational inequality model is formulated to describe the cross-state equilibrium conditions among heterogeneous travelers with different inertial degrees and knowledge structures. Our model allows for traveler's partial understanding and inertial effect in perceiving varying network conditions and provides a different perspective (from existing stochastic and Markovian network equilibrium approaches) to describe traffic flow variations across multiple network scenarios. A disaggregate simplicial decomposition algorithm is suggested to solve the variational inequality problem. Numerical results from a few stochastic network examples demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of our methodology in modeling the inertia phenomenon within route choice behavior and the efficacy of using traveler information systems to eliminate the inertia effect.

J	Ntalampiras, S				Ntalampiras, Stavros			Universal background modeling for acoustic surveillance of urban traffic	DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						Acoustic signal processing; Generalized sound recognition; Universal background modeling; Hidden Markov model; Wavelet packets; Intelligent transportation systems	CLASSIFICATION; RECOGNITION; FEATURES; NOISE	Traffic congestion in modern cities is an increasing problem having significant consequences in our daily lives. This work proposes a non-intrusive, passive monitoring framework based on the acoustic modality which can be used either autonomously or as a part of a multimodal system and provide valuable information to an intelligent transportation system. We consider a large number of audio classes which are typically encountered in urban areas. We introduce a combination of a powerful audio representation mechanism based on time, frequency and wavelet domain features with universal background modeling which leads to higher recognition accuracies and detection rates (in terms of false alarm and miss probability rates) with respect to commonly employed methodologies. The basic advantage of a classspecific model derived using the universal background modeling logic is its tolerance to data which belong to other sound classes. Another important feature of the proposed system is its ability to detect crash incidents, which apart from their catastrophic impact on human life and property, have negative consequences on the traffic flow. Our experiments are based on the concurrent usage of professional sound effect collections which include audio recordings of high quality. We thoroughly examine the performance of the proposed system on isolated sound events as well as continuous audio streams using confusion matrices and detection error trade-off curves.

J	Schakel, WJ; van Arem, B				Schakel, Wouter J.; van Arem, Bart			Improving Traffic Flow Efficiency by In-Car Advice on Lane, Speed, and Headway	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Capacity drop; in-car advice; lane distribution; traffic flow improvement	IMPACT	This paper presents a new in-car advisory system that gives advices on lane, speed, and headway. The advices are determined at a traffic management center based on a new lane level traffic state prediction model, in order to prevent or solve suboptimal traffic flow conditions. The system aims for an optimal lane distribution in high flow conditions, decreasing the chance of spillback by advising drivers away from the right lane, and a reduction in the capacity drop by advising drivers to maintain a short (but safe) headway at the end of congestion. The system is implemented in microscopic simulation to evaluate the potential benefits for different penetration and compliance rates. Benefits at both low and high rates are found as only a small redistribution of traffic over the lanes may be required to stabilize flow. The capacity drop is mainly reduced at high rates as it is required that many vehicles accelerate more. The maximum benefit found is a reduction of 49% in travel time delay. Effects are smaller at lower rates. Negative side effects are also found, including oversaturation of lanes partially by advised lane changes and increased probability of spillback taking effect.

It forecasts the traffic flow rates, queue propagation at the junctions and travel delays through the network. NTFM uses sub-models associated with all road and junction types that comprise the highway. The flow at any one part of the network is obviously very dependent on the flows at all other parts of the network. To predict the two-way traffic flow in NTFM, an iterative simulation method is executed to generate the evolution of dependent traffic flows and queues. To demonstrate the capability of the model, it is applied to a small case study network and a local Loughborough Nottingham highway network. The results indicate that NTFM is capable of identifying the relationship between traffic flows and capturing traffic phenomena such as queue dynamics. By introducing a reduced flow rate on links of the network, the effects of strategies used to carry out roadworks can be mimicked.

J	Chiou, JM; Zhang, YC; Chen, WH; Chang, CW				Chiou, Jeng-Min; Zhang, Yi-Chen; Chen, Wan-Hui; Chang, Chiung-Wen			A functional data approach to missing value imputation and outlier detection for traffic flow data	TRANSPORTMETRICA B-TRANSPORT DYNAMICS			English	Article						functional data; functional principal component analysis; intelligent transportation system; traffic flow rate; vehicle detector	RATES; CLASSIFICATION; MORTALITY	Missing values and outliers are frequently encountered in traffic monitoring data. We approach these problems by sampling the daily traffic flow rate trajectories from random functions and taking advantage of the data features using functional data analysis. We propose to impute missing values by using the conditional expectation approach to functional principal component analysis (FPCA). Our simulation study shows that the FPCA approach performs better than two commonly discussed methods in the literature, the probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA) and the Bayesian PCA, which have been shown to perform better than many conventional approaches. Based on the FPCA approach, the functional principal component scores can be applied to the functional bagplot and functional highest density region boxplot, which makes outlier detection possible for incomplete functional data. Our numerical results indicate that these two outlier detection approaches coupled with the proposed missing value imputation method can perform reasonably well. Although motivated by traffic flow data application, the proposed functional data methods for missing value imputation and outlier detection can be used in many applications with longitudinally recorded functional data.

A traffic flow-oriented routing protocol for VANETs	EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						Traffic flow; Traffic organization; Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET); Position-based routing	AD HOC NETWORKS	This paper presents a novel position-based routing protocol for vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) to enhance traffic safety and traffic organization and facilitate driving through a smart transportation system. The protocol is referred to as the traffic flow-oriented routing (TFOR) protocol for VANETs. It considers a real-time urban scenario with multi-lane and bi-directional roads. It chooses junction optimally considering vehicular traffic flows to accomplish robust routing paths and thereby forwarding the data packets. The new junction selection mechanism and routing between the junctions is based on two-hop neighbor information, which increases packet-delivery ratio and decreases end-to-end delay. We designed, implemented, and compared TFOR against existing routing protocols of VANETs (greedy-perimeter stateless routing (GPSR), geographic source routing (GSR), and enhanced greedy traffic-aware routing (E-GyTAR)). Simulation outcomes in urban scenarios show that TFOR minimizes average end-to-end delay and routing overhead by on average 15.3% and 19.5%, respectively, compared to GPSR. It reduces routing overhead up to 17% compared to GSR. TFOR maximizes packet-delivery ratio on an average of 17.5%, 10.7%, and 7.2% compared to GPSR, GSR, and E-GyTAR, respectively.

J	Li, ZP; Yi, Y				Li, Zhipeng; Yi, Yi			Study on traffic states and jamming transitions for two-lane highway including a bus by using a model with calibrated optimal velocity function	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow; Lane-changing; Traffic states	CAR-FOLLOWING THEORY; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; DIFFERENCE MODEL; DYNAMICAL MODEL; FLOW; PHYSICS; FORCE; JAMS	In this paper, traffic states and jamming transitions on two-lane highway including a bus are studied by using a car following model with a calibrated optimal velocity function. We derive a new flow-density diagram with four distinctly separated traffic states, which is different from that of the earlier study obtained by applying the OVM with theoretical optimal velocity function. The spatio-temporal diagrams are presented to illustrate phase characteristics of each traffic state. It is found that the phase characteristic features of two of four states are different from any state of the earlier result, and traffic flow of state 2 and state 3 can reproduce some characteristics observed from empirical investigations such as centralized lane-changing, hanging tail of cluster, and synchronized flow. In addition, we have clarified the lane-changing behaviors and their effects on two-lane traffic flow including a bus. It is shown that the velocity oscillations behind the bus can help the lane-changing in state 2 and the behaviors of lane-changing are the important reason of forming of the synchronized flow in state 3. It is also concluded that lane-changing can only improve the current in the region of middle density. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The essential feature of urban space, however, is its three-dimensionality (3D), and few studies have been conducted from a 3D perspective, overly limiting the accuracy of studies on the relationships between urban morphology and transportation. The aim of this paper is to simulate the impacts of 3D urban morphologies on urban transportation under the Digital Earth framework. On the basis of the principle that population distribution and movement are largely confined by 3D urban morphologies, which affect transportation, high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery and a thematic vector data-set were used to extract urban morphology and transportation-related variables. With a combination of three research methods - factor analysis, spatial regression analysis and Euclidean allocation - we provide an effective method to construct a simulation model. The paper indicates three general results. First, building capacity in the urban space has the most significant impact on traffic condition. Second, obvious urban space otherness, reflecting both use density characteristics and functional characteristics of urban space, mostly results in heavier traffic flow pressure. Third, no single morphology density indicator or single urban structure indicator can reflect its contribution to the pressure of traffic flow directly, but a combination of these different indicators has the ability to do so.

In our model system, two classes of driver-agents coexist: C-agents (cooperative strategy) always remain in the lane they are initially assigned, whereas D-agents (defective strategy) try to change lanes to move ahead. In relatively high-density flows, such as the metastable and high-density phases, we found structures that correspond to either n-person prisoner dilemma (n-PD) games or quasi-PD games. In these situations, lane changes by D-agents create heavy traffic jams that reduce social efficiency.

This paper presents a new method of forecasting the traffic state of unban expressway based on competence region. This method can predict the traffic state grade of road based on the distance between the sample data and the traffic state cluster center by creating a competence region of neural network classifier. And this method can effectively integrate the temporal and spatial features together without considering the correlation between the different features, and thus it has a strong adaptability. The experimental results show that this traffic state prediction method can reduce the prediction error and improve the equality coefficients compared with the classical algorithms.

The model forecasts the traffic flows induced by SM at the regional level on the whole road network of Canton Ticino (Switzerland), and has been used by the public administration as a support to decide master plan rules. The system has been modeled as an interaction space, a new type of modeling framework that includes both multi-agent systems and cellular automata as a particular case. We define a grammar to specify different agents' trips, and we associate a fuzzy logic based indicator to each one of these specifications. Similarly, we define attractiveness indicators for zones containing economical activities related to agents' trips. The use of these indicators permits to obtain agents' location choices of secondary activities with a great computational efficiency. Simulations include several environmental indicators, like concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, counting changes in a given small part of a road or an estimation of roads' level of service.

J	Tian, J				Tian, Jin			The physics and simulation of occupant traffic flow in the case of evacuating public building area	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Evacuation; Traffic stream; Fluid dynamics model; System Dynamics; Public building	TRANSPORTATION; MODELS; WAVES; CROWD	In cases where public building areas need to be evacuated, a large number of occupants are expected to be routed through exit(s) effectively. This paper combines two aspects of this problem. On the one hand, the traffic flows must be routed through the exit(s) according to some requirements, e.g., the time required to get everyone out is as short as possible. Hence, it is necessary to derive the embedded physics principles of occupant traffic, e.g., based on fluid dynamics laws, especially applicable to occupant traffic in normal (i.e., non-panic) conditions. The principles are helpful solving optimization problems such as finding out how many exits are needed, how wide the aisles should be set, or how to determine the area deployment according to the distribution of people in the building design. On the other hand, occupant traffic flows are dynamic in nature and phenomena related to the evacuation efficiency are examined by the simulation of System Dynamics, which is a way to illustrate and understand complex system behavior changing with time. In a simplified example, considering the typical occupants' behavior modes, we simulate and compute the evacuation efficiency in terms of various building design strategies, to demonstrate the applicability and practical sense of the principles to real-world problems.

Given the scenario that sensor nodes are sparsely installed along the segment between signalized intersections, an analytical model is built based on continuum traffic equations, and an adaptive interpolation method is proposed to estimate traffic parameters with scattered sensor data. Based on the principle of traffic congestion formation, a congestion factor is introduced which can be used to evaluate the real-time status of traffic congestion along the segment, and to predict the subcritical state of traffic jams. The result is expected to support the signal timing optimization of traffic light control for the purpose to avoid traffic jams before its formation. We simulated the traffic monitoring based on Mobile Century dataset, and analyzed the performance of signal control on VISSIM platform when congestion factor is introduced into the phase optimization model. The simulation result shows that this method can improve the spatial-temporal resolution of traffic data monitoring, and it's helpful to alleviate urban traffic congestion that remarkably decreases the average delays and maximum queue length.

Real-time merging traffic control for throughput maximization at motorway work zones	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Work zone management; Feedback control; Merging traffic control; Adaptive fine-tuning (AFT); Regulator fine-tuning		Work zones on motorways necessitate the drop of one or more lanes which may lead to significant reduction of traffic flow capacity and efficiency, traffic flow disruptions, congestion creation, and increased accident risk. Real-time traffic control by use of green-red traffic signals at the motorway mainstream is proposed in order to achieve safer merging of vehicles entering the work zone and, at the same time, maximize throughput and reduce travel delays. A significant issue that had been neglected in previous research is the investigation of the impact of distance between the merge area and the traffic lights so as to achieve, in combination with the employed real-time traffic control strategy, the most efficient merging of vehicles. The control strategy applied for real-time signal operation is based on an ALINEA-like proportional-integral (PI-type) feedback regulator. In order to achieve maximum performance of the control strategy, some calibration of the regulator's parameters may be necessary. The calibration is first conducted manually, via a typical trial-and-error procedure. In an additional investigation, the recently proposed learning/adaptive fine-tuning (AFT) algorithm is employed in order to automatically fine-tune the regulator parameters. Experiments conducted with a microscopic simulator for a hypothetical work zone infrastructure, demonstrate the potential high benefits of the control scheme. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately, it cannot be simulated by many traffic flow models. In order to clarify its mechanism, the new brake light cellular automaton model has been proposed. Comparing with previous brake light models, three different aspects have been considered: (i) drivers tend to take large decelerations if the time gap is smaller than the safe time gap and the leading vehicle's brake light is on; (ii) the brake light rule is set according to the reality; (iii) the randomization rule is put forward before the acceleration rule to weaken the impact of brake light on driving behaviors. Analyses show that the new model can explain the mechanism of traffic breakdown and the failures of other brake light models. Simulations confirm that all empirical features of traffic breakdown are successfully reproduced. At last, brake light models are calibrated and validated by the 1-80 empirical data provided by NGSIM. Results show that the performance of the new model is the best and models in the three-phase theory are not necessarily better than models in the fundamental diagram approach and vice versa, at least for the brake light models.

CASPER: Intelligent capacity-aware evacuation routing	COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS			English	Article						Road network; Routing; Evacuation; Emergency; Shortest path; Capacity	TRAFFIC FLOW; ALGORITHM	We propose a new method to perform urban routing efficiently under capacity constraints. This new method helps with evacuation routing as well as other urban transportation challenges. Traditionally, simulation software or shortest path routing combined with zonal scheduling have been used to solve routing problems. Our method utilizes a state-of-the-art algorithm to connect each source node to its nearest destination. It also intelligently takes into account transportation network capacity and traffic flow to minimize congestion and system-wide transportation times. We have compared our method with previous routing algorithms and a common simulation method. We show that our algorithm generates reliable and realistic routes and decreases global transportation time by at least an order of magnitude, without any loss of performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

System optimal dynamic traffic assignment: Properties and solution procedures in the case of a many-to-one network	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						System optimal dynamic traffic assignment; Many-to-one network; Traffic-holding; Traffic flow models	DEPARTURE TIME; MODEL	Thanks to its high dimensionality and a usually non-convex constraint set, system optimal dynamic traffic assignment remains one of the most challenging problems in transportation research. This paper identifies two fundamental properties of the problem and uses them to design an efficient solution procedure. We first show that the non-convexity of the problem can be circumvented by first solving a relaxed problem and then applying a traffic holding elimination procedure to obtain the solution(s) of the original problem. To efficiently solve the relaxed problem, we explore the relationship between the relaxed problems based on different traffic flow models (PQ, SQ, CTM) and a minimal cost flow (MCF) problem for a special space-expansion network. It is shown that all the four problem formulations produce the same minimal system cost and share one common solution which does not involve inside queues in the network. Efficient solution algorithms such as the network simplex method can be applied to solve the MCF problem and identify such an optimal traffic pattern. Numerical examples are also presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solution procedure. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hooper, E; Chapman, L; Quinn, A				Hooper, Elizabeth; Chapman, Lee; Quinn, Andrew			The impact of precipitation on speed-flow relationships along a UK motorway corridor	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							CLIMATE-CHANGE; TRAFFIC FLOW; WEATHER CONDITIONS; TRANSPORT	Although the fundamental traffic diagram provides the characteristics of a typical road traffic speed-flow relationship, little consideration has been given to the impact of adverse weather conditions on the relationship and the subsequent impact on local speed-flow. For the first time, this study uses precipitation radar along with a state-of-the art traffic information system to ascertain the relationship between speed-flow and precipitation on a UK transport corridor at the local (junction to junction) scale. It is evident that precipitation causes a significant reduction in speed and maximum flow on many links of the corridor as well as a downward reduction in the overall speed-flow relationship. With increased instances of heavy precipitation predicted in the UK as a result of climate change, these findings highlight the subsequent impact on journey travel times and associated economic costs.

Urban signalised intersections: Impact of vehicle heterogeneity and driver type on cross-traffic manoeuvres	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Heterogeneous; Homogeneous; Intersections; Cellular automaton; Traffic mix; Driver types	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA MODELS; FLOW; SIMULATION	This paper presents a model for heterogeneous traffic at simplex and T-intersections of a single lane and two lane urban roads. Traffic at the intersections is controlled by a set of lights, operated to one of several fixed-time schemes. The heterogeneous traffic consists of both short (e.g. cars) and long (buses/trucks or equivalent) vehicles and is modelled, using a one-dimensional two-component cellular automaton. For intersections, we consider the implications for both homogeneous and heterogeneous traffic flows, based on a minimum space rule. For longer vehicles, this implies occupation of multiple road cells. The distributions of traffic mix and driver type are shown to have significant effect on intersection performance and patterns of flow. Example findings are presented and simple validation of the model basis is given, using available, but limited, local Dublin field data. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Complexity and periodicity are definitely two fundamental properties in traffic dynamics. In this study, we first measure the complexity of traffic flow data by Lempel-Ziv algorithm at different temporal scales, and the data are collected from loop detectors on freeway. Second, to obtain more insight into the complexity and periodicity in traffic time series, we then construct complex networks from traffic time series by considering each day as a cycle and each cycle as a single node. The optimal threshold value of complex networks is estimated by the distribution of density and its derivative. In addition, the complex networks are subsequently analyzed in terms of some statistical properties, such as average path length, clustering coefficient, density, average degree and betweenness. Finally, take 2 min aggregation data as example, we use the correlation coefficient matrix, adjacent matrix and closeness to exploit the periodicity of weekdays and weekends in traffic flow data. The findings in this paper indicate that complex network is a practical tool for exploring dynamics in traffic time series. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The framework (a) allows modeling flexibility by incorporating different objective functions, alternative sets of resources and fairness controls; (b) is widely applicable in a variety of problems in transportation, services and engineering; and (c) is tractable, i.e., provides near optimal solutions fast for large-scale instances. To justify these assertions, we model and report encouraging computational results on three widely studied problems - the Air Traffic Flow Management, the Aircraft Maintenance Problems and Job Shop Scheduling. Finally, we provide several polyhedral results that offer insights on its effectiveness. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this context, a multi-objective collaborative planning strategy is presented to deal with the optimal planning issue in integrated power distribution and EV charging systems. In the developed model, the overall annual cost of investment and energy losses is minimized simultaneously with the maximization of the annual traffic flow captured by fast charging stations (FCSs). Additionally, the user equilibrium based traffic assignment model (UETAM) is integrated to address the maximal traffic flow capturing problem. Subsequently, a decomposition based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA/D) is employed to seek the non-dominated solutions, i.e., the Pareto frontier. Finally, collaborative planning results of two coupled distribution and transportation systems are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed model and solution method.

J	Yoon, B; Chang, H				Yoon, Byoungjo; Chang, Hyunho			Potentialities of Data-Driven Nonparametric Regression in Urban Signalized Traffic Flow Forecasting	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Short-term forecasting; Urban signalized traffic flow; k nearest neighbors; Nonparametric regression; Advanced data management system	STATE-SPACE APPROACH; TIME-SERIES; PREDICTION	Single-interval forecasting of traffic variables plays a key role in modern intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). Despite the achievements of advanced ITS forecasting in literature, forecast modeling of urban signalized traffic flow, which shows rapid-intensive fluctuations associated with the nonlinear and nonstationary behavior of temporal evolution, is still one of its big challenges. From the perspective of field experts, the mathematical complexity of an advanced model is also a renewal obstacle in practice. On the other hand, the accessibility of large volumes of historical data and the concurrent advanced data management systems used to access them provide data-driven nonparametric regression with a renewal opportunity in practice. In order to address these problems effectively, this paper proposes a k nearest neighbor nonparametric regression (KNN-NPR) forecasting methodology to be tested against vast quantities of real traffic volume data collected from urban signalized arterials. The results show that the KNN-NPR model is clearly superior to two parametric models, Kalman filtering and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), in terms of both prediction accuracy and the construction of the directionality of temporal state evolution without a time-delayed response. Consequently, it appears that KNN-NPR, even though it is very simplified, is able to efficaciously capture the complex behavior of urban signalized traffic flow.

J	Guardiola, IG; Leon, T; Mallor, F				Guardiola, I. G.; Leon, T.; Mallor, F.			A functional approach to monitor and recognize patterns of daily traffic profiles	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Clustering; Functional data analysis; Temporal traffic flow; Multivariate control charts	TRAVEL-TIME DISTRIBUTION; FLOW; MODEL; PREDICTION; FEATURES	Functional Data Analysis (FDA) is a collection of statistical techniques for the analysis of information on curves or functions. This paper presents a new methodology for analyzing the daily traffic flow profiles based on the employment of FDA. A daily traffic profile corresponds to a single datum rather than a large set of traffic counts. This insight provides ideal information for strategic decision-making regarding road expansion, control, and other long-term decisions. Using Functional Principal Component Analysis the data are projected into a low dimensional space: the space of the first functional principal components. Each curve is represented by their vector of scores on this basis. The principal component scores are used for clustering and also to identify outliers (meaning that there was a bad performance in the recording of data or special circumstances affected the traffic) and to monitor the traffic profile by multivariate control charts. This paper introduces this new methodology and illustrates good results by using 1-min traffic data from the I-94 Freeway in the Twin Cities, Minnesota (U.S.) metroplex ranging from 2004 to 2011.

J	Zhu, WX; Zhang, LD				Zhu, Wen-Xing; Zhang, Li-Dong			An original traffic flow model with signal effect for energy dissipation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Energy dissipation; signal effect; car-following model	NONLINEAR-ANALYSIS; DENSITY WAVES; CONSUMPTION; STABILITY; PHYSICS	We proposed an original traffic flow model with a consideration of signal effect based on Bando's optimal velocity model. The optimal velocity function was improved more realistically in describing the motion process of vehicles moving on a road with signals. Based on the improved model, we derived the mathematical expression for energy dissipation. Simulations are conducted to verify the energy dissipation laws in traffic flow with signals. Numerical results show that energy dissipation (rate) can be affected not only by traffic density, but also traffic signal control parameters: split and cycle.

Here we show that chaotic travel times are actually a natural consequence of individual bus function, and hence of public transport systems more generally, i.e., chaotic dynamics emerge even when the route is empty and straight, stops and lights are equidistant and regular, and loading times are negligible. More generally, our findings provide a novel example of chaotic dynamics emerging from a single object following Newton's laws of motion in a regularized one-dimensional system.

If a vehicle with high (low) speed on the first lane enters into the second lane, it may crash into the forward (rear) vehicle on the second lane and the crash may induce more collisions. We investigate whether or not the incoming vehicle induces the multiple-vehicle collision. The number of collisions depends on the initial velocity, the initial density, the incoming velocity, the incoming headway, the sensitivity, and the relative velocity. We derive the region map for the multiple-vehicle collision induced by lane changing. (c) 2014 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

J	Welch, TF; Mishra, S				Welch, Timothy F.; Mishra, Sabyasachee			A framework for determining road pricing revenue use and its welfare effects	RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS			English	Article						Pricing; VMT tax; Traveler welfare; Travel time savings; Travel demand model	DISTRIBUTIONAL IMPACTS; GASOLINE TAX; EQUITY; PAY; OREGON; SYSTEM	In the last five decades, much of the focus on travel cost has been on what form pricing should take, whether it should be a direct road toll, in the form a Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) tax, encapsulated in the gas tax, or by some other mechanism. An area that has received much less attention, but is nonetheless important when considering any pricing change, is the impact of such mechanisms on traveler welfare and travel time savings. While an increase in the cost of travel may achieve traffic flow efficiencies, it may also unduly burden low-income travelers or unjustly benefit higher-income drivers. An important aspect of the road pricing debate is not just whether pricing will produce an efficient market, but also if such pricing is implemented, how the generated revenue will be managed. We propose a model to analyze transport equity by measuring change in traveler welfare and travel time savings as a result of a mix of road pricing, revenue recycling (tax cuts) and transit subsidies. In this paper we introduce a multimodal travel demand model to incorporate road pricing mechanisms with various subsidy options. A base case and five scenarios are developed to address various hypothetical pricing scenarios. We find the structure of the road pricing mechanism on average has a small impact on annual per capita traveler welfare. Replacing the state gas tax with a VMT tax can have a positive impact on traveler welfare, particularly for lower-income groups and rural residents. A VMT tax increase would be the least detrimental to welfare, especially for low-income groups. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Traditionally, the data available for traffic simulations come from a population census and dedicated road surveys that only partly cover shopping, leisure, or recreational trips. To account for the latter, the presented traffic modeling framework exploits the digital footprints of city inhabitants on services such as Twitter and Foursquare. We enriched the model with findings from our previous studies on geographical layout of communities in a country-wide mobile phone network to account for socially related journeys. These datasets were used to calibrate a variant of a radiation model of spatial choice, which we introduced in order to drive individuals' decisions on trip destinations within an assigned daily activity plan. We observed that given the distribution of population, the workplace locations, a comprehensive set of urban facilities, and a list of typical activity sequences of city dwellers collected within a national travel survey, the developed microsimulation reproduces not only the journey statistics such as peak travel periods but also the traffic volumes at main road segments with surprising accuracy.

Cellular automata traffic flow behavior at the intersection of two roads	PHYSICA SCRIPTA			English	Article						traffic flow; cellular automata; road intersection; parallel dynamic; NaSch model	MODEL	The control of vehicles in urban traffic is a requirement to maximize the flow and to ensure the safety of traffic. Using the cellular automata Nagel-Schreckenberg (NaSch) model within a parallel dynamic update, we studied the effect of the intersection of two symmetrical roads, with typical periodic boundary conditions. It is found that the fundamental diagram depends strongly on the probability P of priority and the probability P-1 of changing the road at the intersection. Beside the free flow, the platoon and the jamming phases, the fundamental diagram exhibits a fourth new phase occurring for any value of P not equal 0.5, which disappears gradually as one increases the probability P, and disappears completely for P not equal 0.5. The effects of the braking probability P-b on the fundamental diagram and space time structures are also computed for different values of maximal velocities.

A weakness of this approach is that different drivers possess vastly different densities at which traffic flow stagnates. This drawback can be overcome by modifying the pressure relation in the ARZ model, leading to the generalized Aw-Rascle-Zhang (GARZ) model. We present an approach to determine the parameter functions of the GARZ model from fundamental diagram measurement data. The predictive accuracy of the resulting data-fitted GARZ model is compared to other traffic models by means of a three-detector test setup, employing two types of data: vehicle trajectory data, and sensor data. This work also considers the extension of the ARZ and the GARZ models to models with a relaxation term, and conducts an investigation of the optimal relaxation time.

SIGNIFICANCE OF INCORPORATING HETEROGENEITY IN A NON-CONTINUUM MACROSCOPIC MODEL FOR DENSITY ESTIMATION	TRANSPORT			English	Article						macroscopic modeling; non-continuum models; heterogeneous traffic; density estimation; extended Kalman filter	TRAFFIC VOLUME	The heterogeneity of traffic and the lack of lane discipline on the roads in India and other developing countries add complexity to the analysis and modeling of traffic. It is generally believed that it is important to take heterogeneity into account in traffic modeling. The aim of the present study is to check the validity of this assumption by analyzing the effect of incorporating heterogeneity in a macroscopic level traffic flow analysis. The application considered is real-time congestion analysis on Indian roads. Traffic density is considered as the congestion indicator. The measurement of density is difficult since it is a spatial parameter. It is usually estimated from other traffic parameters that can be readily measured using available sensors. A model-based estimation scheme using Kalman filtering has been employed to estimate traffic density. A non-continuum macroscopic model was attempted based on the lumped parameter approach. All the traffic variables were quantified without considering traffic lanes in order to take into account the lack of lane discipline. The effect of heterogeneity has been studied by incorporating static values of Passenger Car Units (PCU), dynamic values of Two Wheeler Units (TWU) and considering different classes of vehicles explicitly in the modeling process. The proposed estimation schemes without and with heterogeneity have been compared. The results have been corroborated using data collected from a road stretch in Chennai, India. The study shows that the significance of incorporating heterogeneity into the modeling of mixed traffic at the macroscopic level was not very significant.

Presence of these smaller vehicles invalidates the concept of lane discipline commonly observed in the homogeneous traffic streams. In this paper an attempt has been made to understand the Motorized Two-Wheeler (MTW) lane-sharing behavior and its effects on traffic flow modeling. The objectives of this attempt are to analyze the lane-sharing behavior of MTWs at microscopic and macroscopic level, and to propose a methodology to incorporate this behavior in the macroscopic modeling concepts. Effect of the MTW lane-sharing behavior on the microscopic and macroscopic traffic characteristics and the corresponding models is discussed. A plausible way to incorporate this behavior, specifically in macroscopic modeling, is discussed. From a specific analysis based on VIS-SIM (version 5.20) it has been observed that the MTW lane-sharing behavior significantly influence the equilibrium speed-density relationships which are the key inputs to the macroscopic traffic flow models. Density diminishing factor is found to be significantly influenced by the proportion of MTWs present in the traffic stream. It has been observed that the lane-sharing behavior starts taking place when the average stream speed is less than 65 km/hr, for the proportions of MTWs in between 25 to 60%. For further higher MTW proportions lane-sharing has been observed even in free flow conditions.

J	Jagniatinskis, A; Fiks, B; Dimitriu, D				Jagniatinskis, Aleksandras; Fiks, Boris; Dimitriu, Delia			ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF HIGHWAY TRAFFIC NOISE USING TWO CHANNEL SHORT-TERM MEASUREMENTS	TRANSPORT			English	Article						road transport; noise; measurements; sound exposure; statistical assessment; annual descriptors	ENVIRONMENTAL NOISE	Research has shown that for residential area nearby (up to 50 m) exurbia roads, there are cases where the evaluation of noise impact needs more than using the calculation methods alone. Thus, in order to confirm (or not) the implementation of designed measures for noise abatement procedures in these areas, some direct acoustical measurements of traffic flow are required. The present paper deals with the development of new approach to the methodology that allows truly estimate the annual L-den value using the one short-term (till 1 h) time interval measurement. The method is based on the original extrapolation procedure that allows to adapt results obtained in representative short-term time interval to the annual average rating time periods of day (12 h), evening (4 h) and night (8 h), for which the L-den value is assessed. The procedure is based on the statistical processing of Sound Exposure Levels (SEL) distribution histogram of all vehicles passing by and registered on the reference microphone. The sound propagation correction is evaluated by applying simultaneous measured sound levels registration on two microphones, placed in reference point and in receiver point, considering living environment. This method allows to extend results of extrapolation obtained in the reference point into desired environment point, where such extrapolation to the annual noise levels can not be done.

Induced by the primary crashes, the occurrence of secondary crashes does not only increase traffic delays but also the risk of inducing additional incidents. Many highway agencies are highly interested in the implementation of safety countermeasures to reduce this type of crashes. However, due to the limited understanding of the key contributing factors, they face a great challenge for determining the most appropriate countermeasures.Method: To bridge this gap, this study makes important contributions to the existing literature of secondary incidents by developing a novel methodology to assess the risk of having secondary crashes on highways. The proposed methodology consists of two major components, namely: (a) accurate identification of secondary crashes and (b) statistically robust assessment of causal effects of contributing factors. The first component is concerned with the development of an improved identification approach for secondary accidents that relies on the rich traffic information obtained from traffic sensors. The second component of the proposed methodology is aimed at understanding the key mechanisms that are hypothesized to cause secondary crashes through the use of a modified logistic regression model that can efficiently deal with relatively rare events such as secondary incidents. The feasibility and improved performance of using the proposed methodology are tested using real-world crash and traffic flow data. Results: The risk of inducing secondary crashes after the occurrence of individual primary crashes under different circumstances is studied by employing the estimated regression model. Marginal effect of each factor on the risk of secondary crashes is also quantified and important contributing factors are highlighted and discussed. Practical applications: Massive sensor data can be used to support the identification of secondary crashes. The occurrence mechanism of these secondary crashes can be investigate by the proposed model. Understanding the mechanism helps deploy appropriate countermeasures to mitigate or prevent the secondary crashes. (C) 2014 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Flow rate and time mean speed predictions for the urban freeway network using state space models	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Traffic flow; Short-term prediction; Congested and non-congested traffic; State-space model; Spatial-temporal pattern	TRAFFIC FLOW; NEURAL-NETWORKS; VOLUME; REGRESSION; INPUT; WAVES	Short-term predictions of traffic parameters such as flow rate and time mean speed is a crucial element of current ITS structures, yet complicated to formulate mathematically. Classifying states of traffic condition as congestion and non-congestion, the present paper is focused on developing flexible and explicitly multivariate state space models for network flow rate and time mean speed predictions. Based on the spatial-temporal patterns of the congested and non-congested traffic, the NSS model and CSS model are developed by solving the macroscopic traffic flow models, conservation equation and Payne-Whitham model for flow rate and time mean speed prediction, respectively. The feeding data of the proposed models are from historical time series and neighboring detector measurements to improve the prediction accuracy and robustness. Using 2-min measurements from urban freeway network in Beijing, we provide some practical guidance on selecting the most appropriate models for congested and non-congested conditions. The result demonstrates that the proposed models are superior to ARIMA models, which ignores the spatial component of the spatial temporal patterns. Compared to the ARIMA models, the benefit from spatial contribution is much more evident in the proposed models for all cases, and the accuracy can be improved by 5.62% on average. Apart from accuracy improvement, the proposed models are more robust and the predictions can retain a smoother pattern. Our findings suggest that the NSS model is a better alternative for flow rate prediction under non-congestion conditions, and the CSS model is a better alternative for time mean speed prediction under congestion conditions.

J	Zou, YJ; Zhu, XX; Zhang, YL; Zeng, XS				Zou, Yajie; Zhu, Xinxin; Zhang, Yunlong; Zeng, Xiaosi			A space-time diurnal method for short-term freeway travel time prediction	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Spatial and temporal correlation; Space-time; Diurnal; Freeway link; Probabilistic; Travel time prediction	TRAFFIC FLOW; REAL-TIME; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MULTIVARIATE; FRAMEWORK; DYNAMICS; SERIES	A number of short-term travel time prediction approaches have been developed in the past decade. However, few studies take into account spatial and temporal travel time information simultaneously in the prediction approach. In this study, we proposed a space-time diurnal (ST-D) method, which merges the spatial and temporal travel time information to obtain accurate short-term travel time prediction for freeway corridors under different traffic conditions. The proposed approach can take into account important characteristics of travel times: spatial and temporal correlation, diurnal pattern, and the nonnegativity of the travel time. We use two distributions to model the 5-min average travel time: a truncated normal distribution and a lognormal distribution. Contrary to the most existing methods that yield a point prediction of short-term travel time, this probabilistic modeling approach can overcome the drawbacks of the point prediction by fitting a probability distribution to describe the uncertainty of the future travel times, and from which prediction intervals can be calculated. We use minimum continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) estimation to numerically estimate the parameters in the prediction models. The ST-D method is examined using the travel time data collected on a segment along the US-290 in Houston, Texas. The proposed method provides prediction of travel time over 5-min intervals for up to 1 h in advance. It was found that travel time data from neighboring links along the freeway corridors can be efficiently used to obtain reliable short-term prediction of travel time.

J	Zhang, YR; Zhang, YL; Haghani, A				Zhang, Yanru; Zhang, Yunlong; Haghani, Ali			A hybrid short-term traffic flow forecasting method based on spectral analysis and statistical volatility model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Short-term forecasting; Traffic flow; Model decomposition; Spectral analysis; Volatility analysis; GARCH; GJR-GARCH	NEURAL-NETWORKS; TIME-SERIES; PREDICTION; DYNAMICS	Short-term traffic flow prediction is a critical aspect of Intelligent Transportation System. Timely and accurate traffic forecasting results are necessary inputs for advanced traffic management systems (ATMS) and advanced traveler information systems (ATIS). Despite the proliferation of advanced methodologies, modeling the uncertainty of traffic conditions is still a challenge, especially during congested situations. This paper presents a hybrid model for multi-step ahead traffic flow forecasting in a freeway system with real-time traffic flow data. This proposed methodology forecasts traffic flow by decomposing the data into three modeling components: an intra-day or periodic trend by introducing the spectral analysis technique, a deterministic part modeled by the ARIMA model, and the volatility estimated by the GJR-GARCH model. The aim of this study is to provide deeper insights into underlining traffic patterns and to improve the prediction accuracy and reliability by modeling these patterns separately. The forecasting performance of the proposed hybrid model is investigated with real time freeway traffic flow data from Houston, Texas. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to unearth the underlying periodic characteristics and volatility nature of traffic flow data and show promising abilities in improving the accuracy and reliability of freeway traffic flow forecasting in multistep ahead forecasting.

The key idea of this new method is that when the queues extend to the detector position, there will be unusable green time to a certain degree, and the occupancy will be greater than a particular threshold. Firstly, this paper introduces traffic wave models modified by a kinematic equation, and provides a calculation method for the occupancy per cycle under different traffic conditions, based on the relationship between the three basic traffic flow parameters, speed, traffic flow, and density. Secondly, the threshold of occupancy, which characterizes the appearance of spillovers, is determined by the premise that the stopping and starting waves have the same speed, and then the accuracy of the new method are verified by VISSIM simulation, using the ratio of misjudgment as the evaluation index. Finally, the precision stability of the method is analyzed, and the results show that the precision of this method is affected by the the detector location and bus ratio insignificantly.

J	Li, ZB; Liu, P; Wang, W; Xu, CC				Li Zhi-bin; Liu Pan; Wang Wei; Xu Cheng-cheng			Development of control strategy of variable speed limits for improving traffic operations at freeway bottlenecks	JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY			English	Article						variable speed limit; traffic operation; freeway bottleneck; capacity drop; efficiency	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; CAPACITY; RAMP; MECHANISM; DIVERGE	A control strategy of variable speed limits (VSL) was developed to reduce the travel time at freeway recurrent bottleneck areas. The proposed control strategy particularly focused on preventing the capacity drop and increasing the discharge flow. A cell transmission model (CTM) was developed to evaluate the effects of the proposed VSL control strategy on the traffic operations. The results show that the total travel time is reduced by 25.5% and the delay is reduced by 56.1%. The average travel speed is increased by 34.3% and the queue length is reduced by 31.0%. The traffic operation is improved by the proposed VSL control strategy. The way to use the proposed VSL control strategy in different types of freeway bottlenecks was also discussed by considering different traffic flow characteristics. It is concluded that the VSL control strategy is effective for merge bottlenecks but is less effective for diverge bottlenecks.

J	Zhou, YP; Zhuang, HB				Zhou, Yaping; Zhuang, Hongbin			The optimization of lane assignment and signal timing at the tandem intersection with pre-signal	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						tandem intersection; lane assignment; signal timing; delay estimation	AUTOMATED HIGHWAY; JUNCTION; CAPACITY; SYSTEM; DESIGN	This paper presents an integrated model for optimizing lane assignment and signal timing at tandem intersection, which is introduced recently. The pre-signal is utilized in the tandem intersection to reorganize the traffic flow; hence, the vehicles, regardless of whether left-turns or through vehicles, can be discharged in all the lanes. However, the previous work does not consider the extra traffic disruption and the associated delay caused by the additional pre-signal. In the paper, the extra delay aroused by the coordination is incorporated in a lane assignment and signal timing optimization model, and the problem is converted into a mixed-integer non-linear programming. A feasible directions method is hence introduced to solve the mixed-integer non-linear programming. The result of the optimization shows that the performance of the tandem intersection is improved and the average delay is minimized. The comparison between the tandem and the conventional configuration is presented, and the results verify that the former shows better performance than the latter. In addition, the optimal sequence corresponding to the turning proportion and the optimal lane assignment at the upstream approach of the pre-signal are presented. Furthermore, if the number of lanes is equal in all arms, the paper proves that the average delay will be reduced if lane assignment is proportional to the turning proportion and the vehicles with low proportion are discharged in advance.

Intelligent Trip Modeling for the Prediction of an Origin-Destination Traveling Speed Profile	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Neural networks (NNs); speed profile prediction; traffic data; trip modeling	OPTIMAL POWER MANAGEMENT; TRAFFIC FLOW; NETWORK APPROACH; TIME; WAVES	Accurate prediction of the traffic information in real time such as flow, density, speed, and travel time has important applications in many areas, including intelligent traffic control systems, optimizing vehicle operations, and the routing selection for individual drivers on the road. This is also a challenging problem due to dynamic changes of traffic states by many uncertain factors along a traveling route. In this paper, we present an Intelligent Trip Modeling System (ITMS) that was developed using machine learning to predict the traveling speed profile for a selected route based on the traffic information available at the trip starting time. The ITMS contains neural networks to predict short-term traffic speed based on the traveling day of the week, the traffic congestion levels at the sensor locations along the route, and the traveling time and distances to reach individual sensor locations. The ITMS was trained and evaluated by using ten months of traffic data provided by the California Freeway Performance Measurement System along a California Interstate I-405 route that is 26 mi long and contains 52 traffic sensors. The ITMS was also evaluated by the traffic data acquired from a 32-mi-long freeway section in the state of Michigan. Experimental results show that the proposed system, i.e., ITMS, has the capability of providing accurate predictions of dynamic traffic changes and traveling speed at the beginning of a trip and can generalize well to prediction of speed profiles on the freeway routes other than the routes the system was trained on.

These models are increasingly used by transportation experts to utilise for appropriate intelligent transportation systems. Unlike previous works, where the reaction delay is considered to be fixed, an improved adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model is proposed to simulate and predict the car-following behaviour based on the reaction delay of the driver-vehicle unit. An idea is proposed to calculate the reaction delay. In this model, the reaction delay is used as an input and other inputs-outputs of the model are chosen with respect to this parameter. Using the real-world data, the performance of the model is evaluated and compared with the responses of other existing ANFIS car-following models. The simulation results show that the proposed model has a very close compatibility with the real-world data and reflects the situation of the traffic flow in a more realistic way. Also, the comparison shows that the error of the proposed model is smaller than that in the other models.

Upon these optimization frameworks, a suite of optimization subproblems:a program partitioning and network resource allocation problem, we propose a distributed vehicular sensing platform, called VeSense where mobile users in vehicles publish/access sensor data via a cloud computing-based distributed P2P overlay network. The key objective is to satisfy the vehicular sensing application's quality of service requirements by modeling each subsystem: mobile clients, wireless network medium, and distributed cloud services. By simulations based on experimental data, we present the proposed system can achieve up to 37 times more energy-efficient and 73 times faster compared to a standalone mobile application, in various vehicular sensing scenarios applying a realistic mobility model.

J	Wu, KF; Donnell, ET; Aguero-Valverde, J				Wu, Kun-Feng; Donnell, Eric T.; Aguero-Valverde, Jonathan			Relating crash frequency and severity: Evaluating the effectiveness of shoulder rumble strips on reducing fatal and major injury crashes	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Crash severity; Shoulder rumble strips; Fixed-effects model; Heavy trucks; Motorcycles; Pedestrians	MODEL; REGRESSION	To approach the goal of "Toward Zero Deaths," there is a need to develop an analysis paradigm to better understand the effects of a countermeasure on reducing the number of severe crashes. One of the goals in traffic safety research is to search for an effective treatment to reduce fatal and major injury crashes, referred to as severe crashes. To achieve this goal, the selection of promising countermeasures is of utmost importance, and relies on the effectiveness of candidate countermeasures in reducing severe crashes. Although it is important to precisely evaluate the effectiveness of candidate countermeasures in reducing the number of severe crashes at a site, the current state-of-the-practice often leads to biased estimates. While there have been a few advanced statistical models developed to mitigate the problem in practice, these models are computationally difficult to estimate because severe crashes are dispersed spatially and temporally, and cannot be integrated into the Highway Safety Manual framework, which develops a series of safety performance functions and crash modification factors to predict the number of crashes. Crash severity outcomes are generally integrated into the Highway Safety Manual using deterministic distributions rather than statistical models. Accounting for the variability in crash severity as a function geometric design, traffic flow, and other roadway and roadside features is afforded by estimating statistical models. Therefore, there is a need to develop a new analysis paradigm to resolve the limitations in the current Highway Safety Manual methods. We propose an approach which decomposes the severe crash frequency into a function of the change in the total number of crashes and the probability of a crash becoming a severe crash before and after a countermeasure is implemented. We tested this approach by evaluating the effectiveness of shoulder rumble strips on reducing the number of severe crashes. A total of 310 segments that have had shoulder rumble strips installed during 2002-2009 are included in the analysis. It was found that shoulder rumble strips reduce the total number of crashes, but have no statistically significant effect on reducing the probability of a severe crash outcome. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Systematic Approach to Hazardous-Intersection Identification and Countermeasure Development	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Intersections; Traffic signals; Traffic accidents; Traffic safety; Signalized intersection; Approach level; Crash type model; Bayesian method; Hotspot identification; Countermeasure development	SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS; CRASH OCCURRENCE; ACCIDENT	Safety performance functions (SPFs) are commonly used to correlate geometric, traffic, and environmental characteristics with total crashes, and to identify hotspots that have excessive overall crash frequencies. However, different crash types are associated with different vehicle maneuvers and therefore different risk factors. At signalized intersections, geometric design, signal control, traffic flow, and traffic crash occurrences vary across different approaches of a single intersection. This study developed approach-level SPFs using a full Bayesian method to assess the safety effects of specific risk factors for rear-end, left-turn, right-angle, and sideswipe crash types, and for total crashes. Based on these approach-level SPFs, a systematic method that efficiently integrated the procedures of hotspot identification and countermeasure development was proposed. The method can be used to identify high-risk intersection approaches with specific safety problems and can serve as a useful complement to general hotspot analyses that use expected crash totals. It was found that some variables, including the number of through lanes, median presence, and left-turn protection, could have contrary effects on the occurrence of certain crash types. The proposed method can provide insights to aid in the development of countermeasures aimed at reducing certain crash types and an improved ability to identify deficiencies related to geometric and traffic characteristics for each intersection approach.

This study investigated the impact of access management techniques on crash counts at signalized intersections. The analysis was performed using crash data from 275 signalized intersections in southern Nevada. The panel data random-effect model was used to account for the unobserved factors for each unique arterial. It was found that the negative binomial (NB) regression models were the best in reflecting the dispersion in the crash data. Therefore, the random-effects negative binomial model (RENB) was applied to investigate the relationship between crash occurrence and access-management techniques. The results of the panel data RENB models were compared with those from the pooled NB models, which did not account for the panel data structure. Evaluation of the goodness-of-fit of the models developed indicated that the random-effect negative binomial model was the best-fit for the data at hand. The results from the panel data RENB showed that nine variables significantly affecting the safety at signalized intersections were the average length of corner clearance, traffic flow, land-use types, number of left-turn lanes for main streets, number of through lanes for main and minor streets, posted speed limit on main and minor streets, and grades of legs.

J	Li, L; Chen, XQ; Zhang, L				Li, Li; Chen, Xiqun; Zhang, Lei			Multimodel Ensemble for Freeway Traffic State Estimations	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Lasso; multimodel ensemble; ridge regression; traffic state estimation; uncertainty	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; EXTENDED KALMAN FILTER; ONLINE CALIBRATION; STOCHASTIC-MODEL; FLOW; PREDICTION; REGRESSION; FORECASTS	Freeway traffic state estimation is a vital component of traffic management and information systems. Macroscopic-model-based traffic state estimation methods are widely used in this field and have gained significant achievements. However, tests show that the inherent randomness of traffic flow and uncertainties in the initial conditions of models, model parameters, and model structures all influence traffic state estimations. To improve the estimation accuracy, this paper presents an ensemble learning framework to appropriately combine estimation results from multiple macroscopic traffic flow models. This framework first assumes that any models existing are imperfect and have their own strengths/weaknesses. It then estimates the online traffic states in a rolling horizon scheme. This framework automatically ensembles the information from each individual estimation model based on their performance during the selected regression horizon. In particular, we discuss three weighting algorithms, namely, least square regression, ridge regression, and lasso, which represent different presumptions of model capabilities. A field test based on real freeway measurements indicates that lasso ensemble best handles various uncertainties and improves estimation accuracy significantly. It should be also pointed out that the proposed framework is a flexible tool to assemble nonmodel-based traffic estimation algorithms. This framework can be also extended for many other applications, including traffic flow prediction and travel-time prediction.

Our analytical and numerical results illustrate that good road condition can enhance the speed and flow of uniform traffic flow whereas bad road condition will reduce the speed and flow. The numerical results also show that good road condition can smooth shock wave and improve the stability of traffic flow whereas bad road condition will lead to steeper shock wave and reduce the stability of traffic flow. Our results are also qualitatively accordant with empirical results, which implies that the proposed model can qualitatively describe the effects of road conditions on traffic flow. These results can guide traffic engineers to improve the road quality in traffic engineering. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Toll road; Traffic analysis; Toll fares; Case studies; Brazil; Highways and roads; Concession; Infrastructure	PARTNERSHIP INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS; PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS; RISK ALLOCATION; CONTRACTS; SPAIN	This paper assesses the toll road concession program started by the federal government of Brazil, from its beginning in 1996 until 2012. Brazil has one of the longest road networks, under private concessions, in the entire world. The authors use the case study approach, based on the available information, to analyze the evolution of the program over the course of its history. Specifically, a detailed analysis is conducted from three perspectives: those of the competitiveness of the tender, the impact of toll modifications caused by the rebalancing of the economics of the contract, and the actual evolution of the traffic flows as compared to their estimates, respectively. It is found that the most recent auctions have been very competitive. Moreover, with the original toll roads, bidders relied on early traffic forecasts that turned out to be overly optimistic, and over the years, contract rebalancing has led to large increases in toll rates. Overall, and even though Brazil's program can be considered successful in many ways, there is still considerable room for improvement. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Guler, SI; Menendez, M				Guler, S. Ilgin; Menendez, Monica			Analytical formulation and empirical evaluation of pre-signals for bus priority	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Pre-signals; Bus lanes; Transit priority; Traffic flow	LANES	One of the major causes of bus delays in urban environments are signalized intersections. A commonly used solution to give priority to buses at signalized intersections is to dedicate a lane for bus-use only. However this strategy can waste valuable green time at signals and impose additional delays to cars, especially when bus flows are low. Overall, the total person hours of delays in the system (i.e., buses and cars) can increase due to excessive delays experienced by car users. To this end, an additional signal upstream of the main signal, called a pre-signal, can be used to better utilize the capacity of the main signal while still providing bus priority to reduce the system-wide person hours of delays. The aim of this research is to analytically quantify and empirically evaluate the delays encountered by cars and buses with the use of pre-signals. The ultimate goal is to provide domains of applications for the proposed strategy. The paper presents analytical formulations to compute bus and car delays using queuing theory. The analytical models show that for a wide range of cases pre-signals can minimize the system-wide person hours of delays, as compared to dedicating a lane for bus-use only or operating buses and cars completely mixed. The analytical model is validated with empirical data collected at an existing pre-signal, which shows that the delay predictions of the model closely follow reality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Adaptive Kalman filter approach for stochastic short-term traffic flow rate prediction and uncertainty quantification	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Congestion; Intelligent transportation system; Short term traffic flow forecasting; SARIMA; GARCH; Adaptive Kalman filter	NETWORK; MODEL; MULTIVARIATE; ALGORITHM	Short term traffic flow forecasting has received sustained attention for its ability to provide the anticipatory traffic condition required for proactive traffic control and management. Recently, a stochastic seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average plus generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (SARIMA + GARCH) process has gained increasing notice for its ability to jointly generate traffic flow level prediction and associated prediction interval. Considering the need for real time processing, Kalman filters have been utilized to implement this SARIMA + GARCH structure. Since conventional Kalman filters assume constant process variances, adaptive Kalman filters that can update the process variances are investigated in this paper. Empirical comparisons using real world traffic flow data aggregated at 15-min interval showed that the adaptive Kalman filter approach can generate workable level forecasts and prediction intervals; in particular, the adaptive Kalman filter approach demonstrates improved adaptability when traffic is highly volatile. Sensitivity analyses show that the performance of the adaptive Kalman filter stabilizes with the increase of its memory size. Remarks are provided on improving the performance of short term traffic flow forecasting. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By exploiting the relations between the semi-discrete and continuum models, a steady-state solution is uniquely determined for a given total number of vehicles on a ring road. The solution is exact and always stable with respect to the first-order continuum model, whereas it is a good approximation with respect to the semi-discrete model provided that the involved equilibrium constant states are linearly stable. In other cases, the instability of one or more equilibria could trigger stop-and-go waves propagating in certain sections of road or throughout the ring road. The indicated results are reasonable and thus physically significant for better understanding of real-world traffic flow on inhomogeneous roads, such as those with junctions or bottlenecks.

First we review the coupling of the Lighthill-Whitham model for road traffic and the Hughes pedestrian model as presented in [5]. In different numerical examples we investigate the mutual interaction of both dynamics. A special focus is given on the possible placement of crosswalks to facilitate the passage for the pedestrians over a crowded street.

The main mathematical properties of the scheme are first recalled and then we give a traffic flow interpretation of the key elements. The scheme formulation is also adapted to compute the vehicles densities on a junction. The equivalent scheme for densities recovers the well-known Godunov scheme outside the junction point. We give two numerical illustrations for a merge and a diverge which are the two main types of traffic junctions. Some extensions to the junction model are finally discussed.

The mathematical model taken into consideration is a strongly coupled PDE-ODE system: the PDE is a scalar hyperbolic conservation law describing the traffic flow while the ODE, that describes the bus trajectory, needs to be intended in a Caratheodory sense. The moving constraint is given by an inequality on the flux which accounts for the bottleneck created by the bus on the road. The finite volume algorithm uses a locally non-uniform moving mesh which tracks the bus position. Some numerical tests are shown to describe the behavior of the solution.
