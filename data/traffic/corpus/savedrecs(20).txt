Recently, the support vector regression model (SVR) has been successfully applied in some nonlinear time series forecasting problems. This study develops a support vector regression model with tabu search algorithms (SVRTS) to predict monthly highway traffics in Taiwan. The tabu search (TS) algorithm is employed to search the SVR parameters. Moreover, various tabu list sizes and neighbor solutions are used to examine the forecasting performance of SVRTS models. The experimental results revel that the SARTS model provides better forecasting results than the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model. Thus, the developed SVRTS model is an appropriate alternative for forecasting highway traffic.

A critical part of the CNS/ATM concept is the ability to monitor, analyze, and distribute aeronautical information pertaining to system performance. The ability to relay real-time system performance to the user community is required in order to develop and distribute Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), manage traffic flow, and predict service level availability. Brazil's Department of Air Space Control (DECEA) in cooperation with the US Volpe Transportation Center and Innovative Solutions International (ISI), Inc., has embarked on a program to develop and deploy the first real-time GNSS performance monitoring capability for operational use. The system will be able to monitor the operational status of a GNSS system in real time, as well as predict its future performance as well as possible. This paper describes the functions of the GNSS Performance Monitoring System (GPMS).									0	0	0	0	2	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	2153-358X		0-7803-9453-4	IEEE POSITION LOCAT			2006							1137	1144		10.1109/PLANS.2006.1650721			8	Engineering, Aerospace; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications	Engineering; Telecommunications	BFG11	WOS:000241665600140					2021-01-11

Traffic signal control and route guidance, two key subsystems of ITS, jointly influence traffic flow in time and space. Over the last three decades, combined traffic signal control and route guidance (CTSCRG) has been research emphasis. There are two kinds of model for describing CTSCRG: Multiple User Class Traffic Assignment Model and Discrete Choice Model. The intent of the paper is to compare the traffic equilibrium results of these two models. For.describing route guidance system which is composed of guided driver and non-guided driver, the concept of multiple user class (MUC) is introduced. In MUC traffic assignment. model, guided drivers are modeled as complete information user equilibrium traffic assignment, and non-guided drivers are modeled as stochastic user equilibrium traffic assignment. In discrete choice model, guided drivers and non-guided drivers are modeled as stochastic dynamic user optimum and route choice model is logit model. The perception error of non-guided drivers is larger than the perception error of guided drivers. In this paper, perception error is the function of current travel time and sampled from uniform distribution. Because simulation-based method can allow more complex interactions and win in reality value than travel time formula, we combine Hybrid Genetic Algorithm with cellular automata simulation to calculate travel time and optimize signal setting plan. Iterative simulation and assignment procedure is built: Road is discretized by Cellular Automata. Traffic flow dynamics is represented by Cell Transmission Model; Signal setting is optimized by Hybrid Genetic Algorithm; Vehicle agent can receive route guidance information and select suggested route. Comparison results show that MUC traffic assignment model converge, discrete choice model does not converge. Average delay of MUC traffic assignment model is lower than that, of discrete choice model. Perception error has important influence on the resulting performance which is expressed as total delay.

While several traffic simulators have been developed under the Intelligent Transport System initiative, their primary motivation has been to model and forecast vehicle traffic flow and congestion from a queuing perspective. GrooveNet is a hybrid simulator which enables communication between simulated vehicles, real vehicles and between real and simulated vehicles. By modeling inter-vehicular communication within a real street map-based topography it facilitates protocol design and also in-vehicle deployment. GrooveNet's modular architecture incorporates mobility, trip and message broadcast models over a variety of link and physical layer communication models. It is easy to run simulations of thousands of vehicles in any US city and to add new models for networking, security, applications and vehicle interaction. GrooveNet supports multiple network interfaces, GPS and events triggered from the vehicle's on-board computer. Through simulation, we are able to study the message latency, and coverage under various traffic conditions. On-road tests over 400 miles lend insight to required market penetration.

The heterogeneous traffic do not follow traffic lanes and hence, the available models of traffic flow, which are based on lane based homogeneous traffic, can not be applied to study the characteristics of heterogeneous traffic flow. Recently, a simulation model named, HETEROSIM has been developed to replicate the field conditions of heterogeneous traffic flow. This paper is concerned with application of the model to estimate the saturation flow rate of heterogeneous traffic with the specific purpose of studying the effect of road width on saturation flow measured in passenger car units (PCU) per unit width of road.

Classical approaches are off-line, top-down planned and centralized. Moreover, they are inflexible since they cannot cope with dynamic changes in the traffic flow or depend too much on communication. This paper describes a bottom-up simulation approach where each traffic light is an agent and behaves like a social insect. Our approach is simulated using a microscopic model, with a scenario adapted from a city in Brazil. The volume of vehicles in an arterial and its vicinity was simulated under different situations: without any coordination between traffic lights, with fixed coordination, and with the approach proposed here, which is more flexible: traffic lights adapt to the current volume of vehicles by selecting the appropriate signal plan. Besides, it considers not only the traffic in the arterial, but also in secondary streets.	[de Oliveira, Denise; Bazzan, Ana L.

The method distinguishes the size of each vehicle according to the distance between both ends of front- and rear-tires, and discriminates the lanes on which vehicles exist. The method has functions to create and update automatically a background image, and to estimate and update automatically a threshold value to binarize background subtraction images in order to enhance the vehicle detection accuracy. The proposed algorithm can realize a high-speed processing without complicated calculations, and real-time vehicle detection by using a general-purpose personal computer.

An applied research to forecast the trend of air pollution in particular geometries of streets: the real case of urban canyon	AIR POLLUTION XIV	WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment		English	Proceedings Paper	14th International Conference on Modelling, Monitoring and Management of Air Pollution	2005	Wessex Inst Technol, New Forest, ENGLAND	WIT Transact Ecol & Environm	Wessex Inst Technol	urban canyons; air pollution; urban traffic		High pollution levels have often been observed in urban street canyons due to the increased traffic emissions and reduced natural ventilation. To investigate this phenomenon suitable microscale dispersion models must be used in order to give the right support to decision makers for air pollution control. Within these streets, pedestrians, cyclists, drivers and residents are likely to be exposed to pollutant concentrations exceeding current air quality standards. In this way people carried out an applied research choosing the "V. Giuffrida" street of Catania as a test canyon because this street shows both geometric features typical of an urban canyon and a lot of car traffic flowing during all the day. In the first step the authors carried out preliminary and suitable studies about street and surrounding buildings geometries, meteoclimatic local data, intensity of traffic flow in different hours of day and so on. In the second step a computational model of the street canyon has been developed taking into account all blocks of buildings on each side of the street according to the actual urban situation. The computational model has been done using K-epsilon turbulence model and under three wind directions and velocity values characteristic of the area. Finally, people carried out a campaign of concentrations measurements of tracer gas on suitable sections of the investigated street. This paper intends to show: - the methodologies and techniques to draw the investigation with the backing of a 3D computer code suitable for this use (Airpak - Fluent in our case). - the particular flow-dynamic situations with formation of pollutant store zones. - the influence of both buildings geometry and the presence of internal courtyard on pollution profiles. - The distribution of gas concentrations along the facades of buildings flanking the street with reference to those zones which, overcoming the alarm limits of law, can cause detrimental effects on the health of the inhabitants.

It is important to understand these small-scale effects not only for assessing personal exposure to pollutants in the vicinity of roads, but also because air quality in a city as a whole is assessed on the basis of data from a few urban monitoring sites. This paper reports some outcomes of a study aimed at exploring the transfer and diffusion characteristics of vehicular exhaust emissions and the constraints associated with significant monitoring locations such as street canyons, courtyards and enclosed spaces, and the conditions propitious to pollutant diffusion and air dispersion in urban areas. The wind field around a street-canyon in the city of Suzhou (China) has been modelled by using the Computational Fluid Dynamic technique. The results have been analysed to better understand the values of gaseous pollutants, meteorological parameters and traffic flows measured by means of automatic analyzers along the same street-canyon at two different heights. It has been found that the model correctly describes the vortex recirculation pattern around the building geometry studied and it is very useful in assessing the micro-scale pollution trends.

This paper focuses on the current key problems engineers in this field are facing and highlights some major recent accomplishments. The driving forces behind the increasing use of control are the rising need for transportation services and the demand for a higher safety level. While each domain takes specific approach to deal with these demands, a general trend towards automatic co-pilots or even autopilots is visible. In the automotive domain, this is aided by the design of drive by wire systems. In other fields like marine or aerospace systems, the focus of research is on the swarming behavior of multiple vessels. New sensors and networking will also enable more efficient traffic flow control which will allow for a better use of the resource network capacity. Another trend in the vehicle systems sector is the modeling of nonlinear system behavior which is starting to replace look-up tables in real time systems. A forecast on future trends is given at the end of the paper. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The models are based on data of a one-year measurement programme including geographic data on traffic and population densities. This investigation is part of a cohort study on the impact of traffic-related air pollution on respiratory health, conducted at the westerly end of the Ruhr-area in North-Rhine Westphalia, Germany. Concentrations of NO2, fine particle mass (PM2.5) and filter absorbance Of PM2.5 as a marker for soot were measured at 40 sites spread throughout the study region. Fourteen-day samples were taken between March 2002 and March 2003 for each season and site. Annual average concentrations for the sites were determined after adjustment for temporal variation. Information on traffic counts in major roads, building densities and community population figures were collected in a geographical information system (GIs). This information was used to calculate different potential traffic-based predictors: (a) daily traffic flow and maximum traffic intensity of buffers with radii from 50 to 10000m and (b) distances to main roads and highways. NO2 concentration and PM2.5 absorbance were strongly correlated with the traffic-based variables. Linear regression prediction models, which involved predictors with radii of 50 to 1000 m, were developed for the Wesel region where most of the cohort members lived. They reached a model fit (R-2) of 0.81 and 0.65 for NO2 and PM2.5 absorbance, respectively. Regression models for the whole area required larger spatial scales and reached R-2 = 0.90 and 0.82. Comparison of predicted values with NO2 measurements at independent public monitoring stations showed a satisfactory association (r = 0.66). PM2.5 concentration, however, was only slightly correlated and thus poorly predictable by traffic-based variables (r < 0.3). We concluded that NO2 and soot can be considered truly traffic-related pollutants, and that GIS-based regression models offer a promising approach to assess individual levels of exposure to these pollutants.

Simulation of heterogeneous motorised traffic at a signalised intersection	CELLULAR AUTOMATA, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Cellular Automata for Research and Industry	SEP 20-23, 2006	Perpignan, FRANCE	Univ Perpignan, Math & Phys Syst		heterogeneous; motorised traffic; two-component cellular automata	MODEL	The characteristics of heterogeneous traffic (with variation in vehicle length) are significantly different from those for homogeneous traffic. The present study describes an overview of the development and validation of a stochastic heterogeneous traffic-flow simulation model for an urban single-lane two-way road, with controlled intersection. In this paper, the interaction between vehicle types during manoeuvres at the intersection are analysed in detail. Two different motorised vehicle types are considered, namely cars and buses, (or similar length vehicles). A two-component cellular automata (CA) based model is used. Traffic flow data, captured manually by Dublin City Council at a local intersection, are analysed to give a baseline on how the distribution of short and long vehicles affect throughput. It is anticipated that such detailed studies will aid traffic management and optimisation strategies for traffic flow.

The first study (a) deals with the spatial and temporal distribution of the radioactive levels of Cs-134, Cs-137, 103 Ru in the unpolluted area of the Vesuvius National Park after the nuclear accident of Chernobyl in 1986. The effectiveness of S. vesuvianus as biomonitor and the effective half time of Ru and Cs at each height and time were also determined. Results indicated that Stereocaulon vesuvianum is a valid biological indicator of environmental contamination by radionuclides, capable to detect the radioactive contamination even though there are no more effects on other vegetal community. The estimated removal half-life of Cs in lichen indicated the strong retention by lichen. The second study (b) assessed the total content of Cu, Cr, Pb and Zn in surface and subsurface soils of the city of Naples and described metals spatial distribution. It also defined the chemical and mineralogical forms of metals in soil and compared current data with those of a 1974 sampling. Many surface soils from Naples urban area contain Cu, Pb and Zn levels largely above the limits set by the Italian Ministry of Environment. Cu apparently accurnulates in soil contiguous to railway lines and tramways; Pb in soil on the border of motorway and high traffic flow streets; Zn in soil influenced by inclustrial activities. Cu and Cr exist in soil mainly in organic forms, Pb essentially as residual mineral phases, Zn is present in more readily available pools Cu, Pb and Zn levels have greatly increased since 1974, especially in soil from roadside fields.

Furthermore, when the algorithm calibrated with the simulated data from one detection zone was used to another detection zone, one could also get good performance.

The evaluation of the eigenvalues and the right characteristic matrix of the mixed traffic system was reported in detail. To some extent, this is the key step in the application of the second-order symmetrical total variation diminishing (TVD) numerical method to traffic modelling. Examples for four-class mixed traffic flows were given to illustrate the solution feasibility. It was found that, when the global density wave keeps the same form, the variation of vehicular composition in the initial density wave has no effect on the mean speed of propagation of traffic wave on freeways, but can affect the decay rate of the density wave in different way. Traffic mixing and the impedance of the slow moving vehicles are reasons of the small amplitude density oscillations downstream the main global density wave.

This consists of a hyperbolic system of two equations proposed in Aw and Rascle (2000). A method to solve Riemann problems at junctions is given assigning rules on traffic distributions and maximizations of fluxes and other quantities. Then we discuss stability in L-infinity norm of such solutions. Finally, we prove existence of entropic solutions to the Cauchy problem when the road network has only one junction.

Until now, some routing algorithms of the car navigation do not consider the real-time traffic information and use the static shortest path algorithm. In this paper, we proposed the method to predict the traffic flow in the future. This prediction combines two methods. The former is an accumulated speed pattern, which means the analysis results for all past speeds of each road by classifying the same day and the same time interval. The latter is the Kalman filter. We predicted the traffic flows of each segment by combining the two methods. By experiment, we showed our algorithm gave a better precise prediction than only an accumulated speed pattern that is used commonly. The result can be applied to the car navigation to support a dynamic shortest path. In addition, it can give users the travel information to avoid the traffic congestion areas.

This system consists of the hierarchical 3 layers. The lower layer is the physical layer where the traffic information is acquired on an actual road. The middle layer, which is the core of this system, lays the Traffic Flow Control Framework designed by extending the distributed object group framework that we developed before. This layer supports the grouping of intersection, the collection of real-time traffic flow information, and the remote monitoring and control by using the traffic information of the lower layer. In upper layer, the intersection simulator applications controlling the traffic flow by grouping the intersections exist. The key idea of our study is the grouping concept that can manage the physical world in the defined logical space. The intersection simulation system considers each intersection on road as an application group, and can apply the control models of traffic flow by the current traffic status, dynamically. For constructing this system, we defined the system architecture and the interaction of components on the traffic flow control framework, and designed the application simulator and the user interface for monitoring and controlling of traffic flow.

This solution state is, by definition, efficient to all entities with respect to their own individual goals and to the system as a whole. In these dynamic environments, this solution state can be achieved by utilizing software techniques from the field of game theory in order to make optimal decisions. We present an application built upon a generalized optimization framework that can be applied to a number of domains, such as cargo or network traffic algorithms. In this research, we used a market-based approach to air traffic flow management through a modeling and simulation environment. The aim is to allow individual aircraft a certain degree of local autonomy, much like cars on a highway. Our system is able to cope in real time with failures such as node loss and adjust system parameters accordingly to optimize results based on the goals of the involved agents. We describe tradeoffs between different agent interaction frameworks with respect to their performance in market mechanism auctions. We also discuss lessons learned while implementing this application. This research has built upon our previously reported work [20, 21] on route optimizations and airspace sector design in an air traffic control network, by adding in the goals of interested entities, e.g. airlines, aircraft, and airports, maximizing the "payoff"to each player (agent). It is intended that the results of our work will be directly used in this domain. In addition, we envision our work being leveraged for other optimization tasks such as data traffic on a network, first responder / disaster relief efforts, and other tasks where rapid solving of large-scale optimization problems is essential.

The environmental impact of road investments: an economical analysis with an emphasis on by pass investments	Environmental Economics and Investment Assessment	WIT TRANSACTIONS ON ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT		English	Proceedings Paper	1st International Conference on Environmental Economics and Investment Assessment	2006	Mykonos, GREECE	Wessex Inst Technol, Natl Tech Univ Athens, Dept Mech Engn, WIT Transact Ecol & Environm		infrastructure investments; encroachment costs; Cost Benefit Analysis; Contingent Valuation Method; questionnaires; case study; referendums		When motoring was in its infancy in Sweden the main roads were located straight through towns-the first generation meeting between road and town. When traffic flows were growing, traffic problems along these roads were growing as well. The second generation meeting is when a by pass is built. Winners are heavy traffic, long distance travellers and inner city residents, getting less noise, exhaust fumes and vibrations. But by passes often cause encroachment on recreation areas for nearby residents. The third generation meeting occurs at substantial distances between built-up areas and continuous, broad roads passing towns. In southern Sweden, main roads often are built as such roads, but not in northern Sweden. There traffic flows are too low. "Environmental encroachment" is not yet valued monetarily in the Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA). The missing value includes physical encroachments in areas important for nature, recreation and/or culture, the barrier the road constitutes (towards an attractive area, river, lake etc.), and the impact on urban or rural landscape. Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) can be a suitable valuing encroachment, especially when winners and losers are different groups. Losers can state their willingness to pay (WTP) for getting environmental improvement (for example a road tunnel). Ex post studies are preferable. A road investment resulting in encroachment is,usually controversial and respondents in ex ante studies tend to exaggerate their willingness to pay. In an ex post study they have no incentive for acting strategically. The development of a calculation model, from ex post studies with CVM, has been started. It shows that mean annual willingness to pay in a nearby area for getting a motorway that is a barrier between the dwelling and a lake in tunnel is about 4000 SEK (> 400 Euro).

Improving Minnesota's stratified ramp control strategy	FREEWAY OPERATIONS AND HIGH OCCUPANCY VEHICLE SYSTEMS 2006	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD-SERIES		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	85th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board	JAN 22-26, 2006	Washington, DC	Transportat Res Board				Minnesota's most recent stratified zone ramp metering (SZM) strategy, the successor of the ZONE metering algorithm, has been deployed in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area since late 2002. The SZM strategy is intended to maximize freeway throughput while keeping ramp waiting times below a predetermined threshold. Preliminary evaluation results confirmed the overall effectiveness of the SZM strategy but also revealed that the freeway performance was compromised by the restrictive maximum ramp waiting constraint. Consequently, improvements were sought These focus on a better determination of the minimum release rate for each ramp and its integration with the overall SZM strategy. Both the current and the enhanced SZM strategies are tested in two freeway sites under various demand scenarios through a state-of-the-art microscopic simulator. The simulation results indicate that the enhanced SZM strategy, is effective for delaying and decreasing the freeway congestion and results in smoother freeway traffic flow compared with the original SZM strategy without violating the maximum ramp delay requirement.

Development of an artificial neural network to predict benzene concentrations in a street canyon	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN			English	Article						benzene; artificial neural networks; traffic flow patterns	AIR-QUALITY; TIME-SERIES; MODELS; AREA	Nowadays, the prediction of atmospheric pollutant concentrations in street canyons' environment is of great importance. To achieve this, many kinds of modeling techniques were proposed. One of the most promising techniques is Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). In this study, an ANN was developed to predict benzene concentrations in a heavily trafficted street canyon. It also evaluates the importance of the variables determining these concentrations. The training procedure was developed based on data collected by an annual measurement's campaign, performed in a specific street canyon. The data include benzene concentration, traffic flow and speed, vehicle's type distribution, wind speed and direction. The results from the simulations indicate that ANN is a promising technique for predicting benzene in an urban environment, and can be used for environmental management purposes.

At a given point of the street network, data are collected by a peripheral unit equipped with infrared sensors. Row data are sent by the GSM/GPRS network to a centralized data processing server, where a simple set of fuzzy rules is employed to classify the row data samples into three flow states corresponding to flowing, intense and congested conditions. The core of the system is constituted by a neuro-fuzzy system, which is used to predict the time series constituted by the fuzzy membership of traffic measures to the three predefined flow states. We report the results concerning the comparison tests we carried out using an ANFIS network synthesized by a hyperplane clustering procedure and some well-known prediction techniques used as benchmarks.

Hierarchical fuzzy inference system to evaluate expert opinions on median safety	GEOMETRIC DESIGN AND THE EFFECTS ON TRAFFIC OPERATIONS 2006	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD-SERIES		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	85th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board	JAN 22-26, 2006	Washington, DC	Transportat Res Board				Transportation experts may be asked to provide an opinion about a topic for various reasons. Most studies use simple statistical methods to aggregate these opinions. However, because experts use linguistic information and their own subjective decision criteria to formulate and express their opinions, this aggregation can ignore the unique characteristics of individual experts and the decision criteria they used. To overcome these limitations, a hierarchical fuzzy inference system was developed to evaluate the subjective opinions from transportation experts on median safety. Variables were selected from the results of a survey of transportation experts conducted as part of a previous study. The fuzzy membership functions for six selected variables were constructed through a review of the experts' opinions and transportation safety references. The proposed fuzzy inference system was decomposed into two systems with a hierarchical structure to reduce the complexity of the multivariable fuzzy system. In the decomposed system, the degree of median safety, distilled from geometric and traffic flow conditions, was represented by a fuzzy median safety index (FMSI). Through comparison with observed median crashes, it was found that the mean cross-median collision (CMC) frequency and mean CMC crash rate increased exponentially with an increase of FMSI, typically for roadway segments with an FMSI equal to or greater than 0.7. The fuzzy inference system can then be used to estimate the likelihood of a median crash occurring within an individual segment of highway.

Erosion control for sustainable highway and urban constructions in Southeast Asia	GEOSYNTHETICS, VOLS 1-4			English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Geosynthetics (8ICG)	SEP 18-22, 2006	Yokohama, JAPAN	IGS Japan Chapter, Int Geosynthet Soc		best management practices; erosion & sediment control; sustainable slope rehabilitation; bioengineering and geosynthetics reinforced techniques		Southeast Asia is a region with tropical natural beauty. Its unique climate, eco-diversity and the rapidly developing economy have been attracting steady development and investment in industries, agriculture and property development. The direct consequences of these rapid developments are the population growth, rapid urban development and increased traffic flow. To cater for these increases in urbanization and traffic flow, the federal government & privatize concessionaires in Malaysia have undertaken to build new roadways and widen existing roads. In Singapore, the construction of modem highways into new regional centres, as well as increased density of urban construction within the developed housing estates forced the engineers to build nearer to the existing slopes and green areas. Erosion control of such urban construction has become an important design and construction consideration in this part of the world. Soil erosion is difficult to control in the tropics due to complexity in climatic and geologic conditions. The problem is exacerbated with high rainfall and hilly terrain. Malaysian and Singaporean top soils typically consist of very erodible residual soils, laterite soils or highly-weathered rocks. Construction practices often results in steep "cuts & fill" embankments, striping of localize vegetation-shrubs and heavy earth movements with total disregards to environmental considerations. This paper presents modem erosion control products coupled with geosynthetics reinforced bioengineering technique to "heal scarped" slopes or roadside cuts for sustainable development in tropical urban environment. Three case histories on slope rehabilitation & vegetation at various locations in Malaysia and Singapore were presented, and exemplifying sustainable construction best management practices can be achieved via these geosynthetics reinforced bioengineering techniques. This paper also presents a large scale physical model study on the efficiency of erosion control measures. The results seem to imply that the relationship between the "soil lost" over rainfall duration (T) is not linear, and suitable Erosion Control Mattress ECM may be used to effectively limit the "soil lost".

Although density may provide general estimates of current traffic conditions, it generally fails to communicate the variability in the quality of traffic flow experienced by individual drivers. This variability may be caused by factors that are not effectively captured by density, such as travel lane, vehicle position within a platoon, and characteristics of roadway geometry. This paper investigates the variability of traffic flow quality as indicated by measurements of speed and acceleration noise (standard deviation of acceleration) on the basis of field data obtained from instrumented vehicles equipped with Global Positioning System devices. The microscopic measures observed from individual vehicles are compared with density-based LOS, which are calculated with data from the Atlanta, Georgia, traffic-monitoring system. The comparison indicates that under the same LOS condition, drivers may experience significant differences in the quality of traffic flow. In addition, the comparison indicates that drivers under different density-based LOS conditions may experience a similar level of traffic How quality. The variability generally becomes larger as traffic conditions worsen.

S	Lieberman, E; Chang, J			TRB	Lieberman, Edward; Chang, Jinil			New formulation to analyze signalized approaches	HIGHWAY CAPACITY AND QUALITY OF SERVICE 2006	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD-SERIES		English	Proceedings Paper	85th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board	JAN 22-26, 2006	Washington, DC	Transportat Res Board				The procedures generally used in calculating capacity, level of service, saturation flow rate, delay, queue lengths, and signal timing for approaches to signalized intersections are based on disaggregating traffic flow into lane groups. These procedures can be complex if the approaches exhibit geometries with lanes that are both exclusive (i.e., dedicated to servicing a single traffic movement) and shared (i.e., servicing at least two traffic movements). The complexity is exacerbated if the signal timing contains multiple phases servicing the approach, particularly if both permitted and protected signal phases are involved. Finally, the averaging of the differing flow characteristics on each lane making up a lane group could yield results that are unrealistic. The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) devotes many pages in Chapter 16 and its appendices to delineating these procedures. To a large extent, the HCM uses queue accumulation polygons as part of these procedures and is now considering an extension called the incremental queue accumulation method. This paper presents a new formulation, that yields estimates of the traffic demand in each lane, by turn movement, for virtually all geometric configurations of signalized approaches and for all signal phasing plans. The formulation also yields the saturation flow rates by lane and the required signal phase durations for any stated phasing plan. The basis for this method is a variation of Wardrop's laws. The formulations are presented for common approach configurations, and illustrative numerical examples are presented to demonstrate their applicability.

As an initial step, traffic flow on several sections of rural two-lane highways was observed. The observations led to a set of empirical speed-flow relationships for highways of different characteristics. On the basis of these results, a microscopic simulation model was calibrated. The model was able to produce a comprehensive set of speed-flow diagrams for all kinds of rural two-lane highways. The diagrams revealed several unexpected properties: a concave shape and nonlinear influences of the external geometric parameters such as curvature or gradients. The simulated results were then approximated by a simple quadratic equation with the parameters depending on geometric conditions and the percentage of heavy vehicles. Thus, the speed-flow diagrams were obtained for the German Highway Capacity Manual. In this case density was used as a measure of effectiveness for the definition of levels of service. This guideline has been used successfully for 3 years.

After designing the system architecture model and the data flow chart of road tunnel environment, we finished the computer simulation system with SIMATIC configuration software WinCC V6.0 based on component technology. Based on the mechanism of pollutant movement in road tunnel and the characteristic of its ventilation system, the CO concentration and the smog concentration fuzzy controllers were established. Simulation test results show fuzzy control provides more electric energy saving and better control effect than indirect control, and can solve partly the control difficult problem brought by the delays of traffic flow sampling and pollutant moving.

The fuzzy data mining method is adopted to process the past traffic flow data at the same period of time to obtain their clustering modes. Based on these, the predicted data sample is inferred to be close to or belong to which modes. The new traffic flow is predicted with the past data of the same mode whose data samples have high similarity. The analysis and computing results show the method is easy to be implemented, and has higher prediction precision than the other methods without clustering analysis to the raw data.

With the shortening of the forecasting term, the uncertainty of traffic flow becomes more and more seriously, so that the forecasting effect of general approaches is decreasing. For an example, the algorithm based on non-parametric regression - is a real-time nonparametric forecasting algorithm with the characteristic of high transplantation and accuracy, which plays an important role in traffic flow forecasting, yet there is the problem of "dimension curse" as the dimensions of the sample data increase. For the purpose of solving the question of short-time traffic flow forecasting, a short-time traffic flow forecasting model based on projection pursuit auto-regression technique is established in this paper The problem of "dimension curse" and non-normality among high-dimensions data are solved This algorithm satisfies the need of real-time traffic flow forecasting completely through the field data test.

Also the growing demand in Asia as well as in Russia creates increasing need for cost efficient and lead time wise supply chain solutions. It depends on the used manufacturing and supply chain strategy, whether manufacturing units in a company's network use market focused (factory in particular region serves that market needs) or product group based (one manufacturing unit takes global delivery responsibility) control. In either case, manufacturers at the moment use "local sourcing" strategy to enhance supply chain control and responsiveness. However, this approach is incapable to use global sourcing opportunities, and utilize cheap raw materials and semi-finished items from Asia and Russia to be used in European manufacturing units. The constraints in this process are the transportation costs and delays; sea container transportation from Asia is cheap, but takes long time to be shipped to Europe (nearly two months), and correspondingly air transportation is expensive, and sets restrictions for the package size and weight. At the moment a third alternative also exist, where items are transported between Europe, Russia and Asia through Trans-Asian Railway network. This route provides moderate cost efficiency (as compared to air transportation) and lead time advantage (as compared to sea containers). In this paper we analyze the survey research results, which was targeted on the largest manufacturers and retailers in Finland and Sweden. Based on the survey analysis, we estimate how transportation modal split (between road, sea, railway and air) will evolve in the future, and how traffic flows develop between Europe, Russia, South-Korea, India, China, and Japan. We also present estimation from the future transportation costs development. In the analysis phase we also consider, how large volumes could be shifted to railway connection, and how wise customer picking could smoothen the transportation amounts from and to Russia/Asia. Also avenues for further research are being proposed based on our quantitative analysis.

In this paper, discretionary lane changing behaviors are extended into three kinds: ideal lane change, decelerated lane change, and squeezed lane change. These lane changing behaviors are compared, and the influence of every behavior on traffic flow is analyzed, respectively. It points out that decelerated lane change may reduce road capacity, and squeezed lane change may lead to more jumbled and congested traffic flow. Then, the respective lane changing models including desire model and gap-acceptance model are established, their proposed lane-changing models are validated. The simulated results show that the proposed models are superior to the conventional models. This study may have an important role in microscopic traffic simulation. It can heighten the precision and profundity of lane changing behavior research.

Based on a stochastic macroscopic freeway network traffic flow model and the extended Kalman filter, RENAISSANCE is fed with a limited amount of real-time traffic measurements to enable a number of freeway network traffic surveillance tasks, including traffic state estimation and prediction, travel time estimation and prediction, queue tail/head/length estimation and prediction (queue tracking), and incident alarm. The paper first introduces the stochastic macroscopic freeway network traffic flow model and a real-time traffic measurement model, upon which a complete dynamic system model for freeway network traffic is established, with a special attention to the handling of some important model parameters. The addressed traffic surveillance tasks are described along with the functional architecture of RENAISSANCE. A simulation test was conducted for the tool with respect to a hypothetical freeway network example, while the traffic state estimator of RENAISSANCE was also tested with real traffic measurement data collected from a Bavarian freeway.

The system comprises a wide dynamic range 'silicon retina' optical sensor with asynchronous event-driven data interface and an off-the-shelf DSP for data acquisition, processing and interfacing to Ethernet. Each individual pixel of the optical sensor operates autonomously and delivers events that represent relative changes in illumination with low latency, high temporal resolution and independence from scene illumination. Robust vehicle counting is accomplished by detecting activity threshold overflows in several regions of interest in the visual field of the image sensor while consuming roughly 2.5 watts of electrical power. Traffic flow data acquired at a test-site on a four lane highway are presented and discussed.

Because delays to waterway users usually increase during periods of lock maintenance, shippers may change departure times or switch to a different transportation mode. The analysis of variations in waterway traffic due to lock maintenance is a challenging task. This paper analyzes the cost structures of waterway and rail transportation and develops three waterway demand models on the basis of different user behavior assumptions. Numerical testing is conducted to verify the models. The results of the analyses show that these models, grounded in economics, traffic flow theory, and queuing models, can capture the effects of demand changes over time.

Proposed systems rely on either onboard range sensors or vehicle-to-vehicle wireless communications to obtain pertinent information about surrounding vehicles and to determine appropriate acceleration or deceleration commands. Although numerous studies have used microscopic traffic simulation to study the effects that these systems might have on traffic flows, generally these studies did not consider all factors that may affect their operation. A particular element that has been ignored is delay in data acquisition. Using a microscopic traffic simulation model that was developed to simulate intelligent transportation system applications relying on the use of onboard vehicle sensors or wireless transmissions, this paper attempts to quantify the safety effects created by the use of delayed information in automated vehicle control systems. The study clearly indicates that information delay affects the operation of vehicle control systems, particularly when sensor or transmission delays result in the use of information older than a certain threshold, found in this case to be 0.5 s.

In order to increase the precision, this paper proposes a forecasting model in short term traffic flow based on data mining technology. The model consists of three stages: first, the rough set theory and the genetic algorithm are applied to select relevant forecasting variable to the traffic flow; second training pattern of wavelet neural network which is similar to the forecast term is carried out by using data mining technology; finally the wavelet neural network is used to carry on forecasting the traffic flow. Through forecasting traffic flow at Xinhua Street in Huhehot, the result shows that this model has a higher precision and surpasses gray GM (1, 1) and the BP artificial neural network model, which provides a new reliable and effective way of forecasting short term traffic flow of nodes in urban road network.

So traffic flow forecasting is a key problem in the real time adaptive control of urban traffic. This paper's research object is two typical adjacent intersections of city road A double RBF NN model with classifying coefficient is presented The space of high dimensional input samples is divided into two lower dimensional subspaces by the model. Then the nonlinear degree of the space samples is reduced greatly. Particle swarm optimization(PSO) algorithms is used to determine the parameters of two RBF NN respectively. The method not only simplifies the structure of RBF NN, but also enhances training speed and mapping accurate. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the model.

A variety of methods and techniques have been developed to forecast traffic flow. The traffic flow forecasting model based on neural network has been applied widely in ITS because of its high forecasting accuracy and self-learning ability. But the problems of neural network such as the difficult of designing optimal structure and weak global searching ability limit seriously its applications. The paper proposes traffic flow forecasting based on genetic neural network. The genetic algorithm, which has a powerful global exploration capability, is applied to solve the problem of tuning both network structure and parameters of a feed forward neural network. First, the authors introduce the genetic neural network algorithm in detail. Then, the presented approach is effectively applied to solve traffic flow forecasting. The simulation experiments show that the presented traffic flow forecasting based on genetic neural network can simplify the structure of neural network greatly and improve the forecasting accuracy significantly.

The network kinematic waves model: A simplified approach to network traffic	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						macroscopic model; kinematic waves; freeway networks; traffic simulation; ITS	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL	Flow of traffic on freeways and limited access highways can be represented as a series of kinemetic waves. Solutions to these systems of equations become problematic under congested traffic flow conditions, and under complicated (real-world) networks. A simplified theory of kinematics waves (KWaves) was previously proposed. Simplifying elements includes translation of the problem to moving coordinate system, adoption of triangular speed- density relationships, and adoption of restrictive constraints at the on- and off-ramps. However, these simplifying assumptions preclude application of this technique to most practical situations. By directly addressing the limitations of the original theory, this article proposes a simplified Kwaves model for network traffic (N-KWaves). Several key constraints of the original theory are relaxed. For example, the original merge model, which gives full priority to on-ramp traffic, is relaxed and replaced with a capacity-based weighted queuing (CBWFQ) merge model. The original diverge model, which blocks upstream traffic as a whole when a downstream queue exceeds the diverge, is also relaxed and replaced with a contribution- based weighted splitting (CBWS) diverge model. Based on the above, the original theory is reformulated and extended to address network traffic. Central to the N-KWaves model is a five-step computational procedure based on a generic building block. It is assumed that a freeway network can be represented by the combination of some special cases of the generic building block. An empirical field study showed satisfactory results. The N- KWaves model is best suited for modeling traffic operation in a regional freeway network and has a strong connection to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).

Estimating interstate highway capacity for short-term work zone lane closures - Development of methodology	MANAGEMENT AND DELIVERY OF MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS SERVICES	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD-SERIES		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	85th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board	JAN 22-26, 2006	Washington, DC	Transportat Res Board				Defining and understanding traffic flow parameters within short-term Interstate work zones are crucial in developing effective policies to manage construction and maintenanc work conducted on the nation's heavily traveled freeways. The South Carolina Department of Transportation (DOT) initiated a research study to develop a methodology for use in determining an updated lane closure policy for Interstate highway work zones. Phase 1 of the research was completed in May 2003, and findings identified threshold volumes for two-to-one lane closure work zone configurations. Phase 2 of the research further expanded numerically derived relationships and contained analysis of other short-term lane closure configurations including three-to-two and three-to-one lane closures. Both research phases concentrated on methods to determine the number of vehicles per lane per hour that can pass through short-term Interstate work zone lane closures with minimum or acceptable levels of delay as defined by South Carolina DOT. Phase 2 includes an expanded list of data collection sites with differing work zone characteristics. This paper presents the analysis and results of Phase 2 of the research. Headway analysis revealed that passenger car equivalents (PCEs) differed for various speed ranges and modified PCEs for various speed groups were applied in calculating capacity. A model for calculating work zone capacity that incorporates base capacity, PCEs for various speed groups, adjustment factors related to specific work zone characteristics, and number of lanes open through the work zone, is recommended.

Inclement weatheraffects traffic demand, traffic safety, and traffic flow relationships. Understanding these relationships will help highway agencies select better management strategies and create more efficient operating policies. For example, it was found that severe winter storms bring a higher risk of being involved in a crash by as much as 25 times - much higher than the increased risk brought by behaviors that state governments already have placed sanctions-against, such as speeding or drunk driving. Given the heightened risk of drivers' involvement in a-crash, highway agencies might wish to manage better and restrict use of highways during times of extreme weather, to reduce safety costs and costs associated with rescuing stranded and injured motorists in the worst weather conditions. However, the first step in managing the transportation systems to minimize the weather impact is to quantify its impact on traffic. This paper reviews the literature and recent research work conducted by the Center for Transportation Research and Education on the impact of weather on-traffic demands, traffic safety, and traffic flow relationships. Included are new estimates of capacity and speed reduction due to rain, snow, fog, cold, and wind by weather intensity levels (e.g., snowfall rate,per hour).

Variable toll pricing and heterogeneous users - Model and solution algorithm for bicriterion dynamic traffic assignment problem	NETWORK MODELING 2006	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD-SERIES		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	85th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board	JAN 22-26, 2006	Washington, DC	Transportat Res Board			NETWORK; TIME; EQUILIBRIUM; ROADS	A dynamic traffic assignment model and its solution algorithm for the bicriterion dynamic user equilibrium (BDUE) problem that allows for heterogeneous users with different value-of-time (VOT) preferences are presented. Assuming the VOT as a continuously distributed random variable across the population of trips, the BDUE problem is formulated as a system of infinite-dimensional variational inequalities (VIs). Rather than solving the VI formulation directly, this study employs a generalized Frank-Wolfe algorithm to find the BDUE flow pattern. A bicriterion time-dependent least-cost path algorithm is applied to generate the extreme efficient path set, and the corresponding breakpoints naturally define the multiple user classes and thereby generate the descent direction for a multiclass dynamic network loading. A traffic simulator is used to describe the traffic flow propagation and the spatial and temporal interactions. To circumvent the difficulty of storing the memory-intensive path set and routing policies for large-scale network applications, a vehicle-based implementation technique is proposed, with the vehicle path set as a proxy for keeping track of the path assignment results. A set of numerical experiments is conducted to explore the convergence behavior of the BDUE algorithm and investigate how VOT distributions affect the path flow pattern and toll road usage under different dynamic road pricing scenarios.

S	Figliozzi, MA			TRB	Figliozzi, Miguel Andres			Modeling impact of technological changes on urban commercial trips by commercial activity routing type	NETWORK MODELING 2006	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD-SERIES		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	85th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board	JAN 22-26, 2006	Washington, DC	Transportat Res Board			INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY; TRANSPORTATION	Several noteworthy developments in logistics practice have taken place without an equivalent and comprehensive development in urban freight transportation modeling. Part of the problem is the lack of deep understanding of the workings of distribution processes in relation to the generation of truck traffic. This study emphasizes the role and importance that distribution network size and information and communications technology have on the truck traffic flows that materialize as the supply chain flows over the public infrastructure. A concept is developed of commercial activity routing types that characterize the interplay between transportation demand requests and routing characteristics. This research contributes to the field by proposing a novel and detailed characterization of truck flows in a supply chain context. With well-known, yet simple, models and formulas from vehicle routing, operations research, and management science literature, behavioral insights are derived about distributors' and carriers' routing and order-sizing decisions, since routing constraints and second-order effects are important drivers of truck flows. The main contribution is to bring a new commercial activity-routing perspective and a deeper level of operational decision-making analysis to cope with the intricacies of freight transportation modeling.

Derivation of origin-destination distributions from traffic counts - Implications for freeway simulation	NETWORK MODELING 2006	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD-SERIES		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	85th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board	JAN 22-26, 2006	Washington, DC	Transportat Res Board				Origin-destination (O-D) traffic flows are an essential element in several freeway and network traffic models. In general, it is impossible to identify a unique O-D matrix from volume counts alone. Several methods for deriving O-D data exist, and they vary in complexity, cost, and analysis time. O-D matrices were generated with five methods that were applied to the same set of volume data. The resulting O-D matrices were used as the only variable input component in traffic simulation with INTEGRATION. Traffic simulation output was used to assess the implications of the O-D distribution. The O-D data produced by the deterministic method were clearly different from those of the other four methods. The proportionate and QueensOD (with default,seed) output were somewhat dissimilar. All other combinations were similar, and the proportionate and FREQ O-D output were statistically identical. The simulation output with the proportionate-method O-D data met the 10/75 speed criterion at all five of the cross-section locations [it was within 10 mph (16 km/h) of field speed for 75% of the time periods]. Pearson's correlation of speeds at five locations indicated that all O-D methods except the deterministic one have a strong correlation with each other. A similar outcome was obtained with t-tests of the total travel time output.

The first layer is composed of vehicle agents and the second layer is composed of signal agents. The system can naturally express actual road networks and can reproduce various traffic congestions induced by means of local interactions among vehicle agents. We show the system is useful for the road enhancing problem to guess the most suitable place when a new road is constructed. Further, we study a traffic control system which dissolves congestions at intersections by monitoring the traffic flow at the first layer.

In the deterministic NS model, numerical results show that there exists a critical value of car density below which no car accident happens. The critical density rho(c1) is not related only to the maximum speed of cars, but also to the braking probability at the defect. The braking probability at a defect can enhance, not suppress, the occurrence of car accidents when its value is small. Only the braking probability at the defect is very large, car accidents can be reduced by the bottleneck. In the nondeterministic NS model, the probability P-ac exhibits the same behaviors with that in the deterministic model except the case of v(max)=1 under which the probability P-ac is only reduced by the defect. The defect also induces the inhomogeneous distribution of car accidents over the whole road. Theoretical analyses give an agreement with numerical results in the deterministic NS model and in the nondeterministic NS model with v(max)=1 in the case of large defect braking probability.

High vehicle density and their rapid changing speeds at the junction present difficulty to background reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a new method that combines Median estimation and the SVM theory for background modeling. We introduce a mechanism for collecting sample frames and blocks for background estimation. Background reconstruction based on Median values is efficient and accurate when the traffic flow is not severely congested. The SVM based background reconstruction method, on the other hand, can overcome the shortcoming of the Median estimation method due to the traffic congestion and therefore enhance the reliability of reconstruction. The proposed method can be applied in intelligent transportation systems based on video sequences.

It is estimated that road traffic contributes 60% of air pollution in urban areas. A case by case assessment is required to predict the air quality in urban situations, so as to evolve certain traffic management measures to maintain the air quality levels with in the tolerable limits. Calicut city in the state of Kerala, India has been chosen as the study area. Carbon Monoxide (CO) concentration was monitored at 15 links in Calicut city and air quality performance was evaluated over each link. The CO pollutant concentration values were compared with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), and the CO values were predicted by using CALINE4 and IITLS and Linear regression models, The study has revealed that linear regression model performs better than the CALINE4 and IITLS models. The possible association between CO pollutant concentration and traffic parameters like traffic flow, type of vehicle, and traffic stream speed was also evaluated.	[Anjaneyulu, M. V. L.

This approach allows to validate a road project in relation to the actual traffic conditions and expected human behaviours. It is characterized by a probabilistic point of view and enables to compute the probability of a road accident occurrence and evaluate the effectiveness of any action for road safety increasing. The most promising way to investigate and calculate the probabilities of each branch of the tree of events that depend on human factors is the multidisciplinary study based on driving simulation in virtual reality. Particularly the drivers' risk threshold during passing manoeuvre is here investigated, using Virtual Reality simulations, and discussed. Traffic flow conditions and mobility motivations influence risk acceptable thresholds and driving behaviours of road users. For each case study different scenarios with increasing traffic flows have been implemented and the successfully ended passing manoeuvres, the aborted ones, the hazardous ones and the accidents have been computed. The final results and the significance of the experiments make it possible a generalization for road project once defined the roadway and traffic conditions corresponding to critical drivers' risk acceptance.

Whereas in China, research in this field is very little due to the difficulty to collect the crash data and traffic flow data, so models about how the traffic flow parameters impact on safety are vague. This study clarified the relationship between volume to capacity ratio (V/C) and crash rate using 3 years crash and traffic flow data of a freeway. This relationship can be used as a basic reference to predict and prevent traffic accidents. The hourly 'crash rate model, having an independent variable of hourly V/C, was established by regression analysis, and the relationship between V/C ratio and crash rate was represented by a U-shaped curve. The crash rate is higher in the low hourly V/C range, and decreases with an increasing V/C ratio, and then increases as the V/C ratio increases. When the V/C is 0.58, the crash rate is the lowest.

Balance equation and deceleration function and then a 3 step-based safety following distance model, derived from Mazda model, is established to describe vehicle brake procedure via a simplified 'process with the consideration of different driving states (i.e. total following state, part following state, three-kind extreme states, etc). For practicality assessment, a simulation model is adopted to evaluate the schematic guideline of proposed self-adaptive fuzzy velocity control model and the satisfied result highlights its effectiveness of manipulating smooth traffic flow and contributing to minimize the occurrence probability of rear-end collision and side-wiping accidents on expressways.

This study extends a previous experimental study of lane change by suggesting that a geometric mean of ratios of flows between adjacent lanes called the overall average flow ratio (OAFR) can be used to indicate the likelihood of sideswipe crashes given that a crash is likely to occur. OAFR was calculated for 5 to 10 min before crash occurrence at a location upstream of crash sites. Using 4-year crash and loop detector data on a 36.3-mi section of I-4 freeway in Orlando, Florida, the study found that OAFR was generally higher for sideswipe than rear-end crashes at a 95% confidence level. Analysis using logistic regression models showed that other traffic-related factors, such as the variation in flow and peak and off-peak periods, were also important factors correlated with sideswipe crashes. The findings in this study suggest that the model is potentially capable of predicting the risk of specific types of crashes, not only generic crashes, through use of real-time traffic flow data on freeways.

Taking an intermediate time and space scale, we propose a model similar to that introduced recently for car traffic; see [ G. M. Coclite, M. Garavello, and B. Piccoli, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 36 ( 2005), pp. 1862 - 1886]. For dynamics at nodes we consider two "routing algorithms" and prove existence of solutions to Cauchy problems. The main difference among the two algorithms is the possibility of redirecting packets of the second algorithm, which in turn implies stability, i.e., Lipschitz continuous dependence on initial data, not granted for solutions using the first algorithm.

The origin of this inadequacy is an old and wrongly developed street network, and improper combinations of street functions. The influence of infrastructural modifications on the characteristics of traffic flow were integrated. The model created describes the typical categories of streets, adequate complex farictions and their relations. The conclusions show the possibility to apply this model to the evaluation of sustainability of changes in the urban street network.

With a focus on the spatio-temporal evolution of traffic between freely flowing and queued conditions, it was possible to identify 15 bottleneck activations and to characterize reproducible features related to their formation, discharge, and dissipation. This was done by systematically probing the excess vehicle accumulation (spatial) and travel time (temporal) that arose between measurement locations. Bottlenecks became active in the vicinity of on- and off-ramps. The evolution of a steady shock of low flow, low velocity, and relatively short duration was traced over 16 kin (10 mi). Its cause is not known definitively, but some indications of its formation were revealed. Once a bottleneck became active, its measured outflow was reproducible across multiple activations and multiple days. The analysis tools used were transformed curves of cumulative vehicle count and cumulative time mean velocity, with loop detector data in their most raw form. These cumulative curves provided the resolution necessary to reveal the spatial and temporal aspects of dynamic freeway traffic flow phenomena. With increasing availability of reliable freeway sensor data, it is important to continue the systematic empirical analysis of freeways in different countries with different geometric configurations. The results of this kind or research program will assist with all aspects of traffic flow modeling, operations, and control.

Traffic flow is subject to abrupt disturbances because of various unexpected events (e.g., accidents, weather-induced disruption) that may change the underlying dynamics and the stability of the data generation process. Short-term prediction models that do not account for these changes produce biased and less accurate predictions. This paper proposes a new adaptive approach to short-term prediction that explicitly accounts for occasional regime changes by using statistical change-point detection algorithms. In this context, the expectation maximization and the CUSUM (cumulative sum) algorithms are implemented to detect shifts in the mean level of the process in real time. Autoregressive integrated moving average models are used for developing the forecasting models while the process mean is monitored by the two detection algorithms. The intercept of the forecasting models is updated on the basis of the detected shifts in the mean level to adapt to any potential new regimes. The proposed approach is tested on real-world loop data sets. The results show significant improvements in prediction accuracy compared with traditional autoregressive integrated moving average models with fixed parameters.

Following the basic idea of the work of Heidemann, the flow distribution in the individual lanes was rederived and extended to carriageways with more than three lanes. The model was then calibrated with field data obtained from Germany. In addition, the proposed model was extended to congested traffic conditions. The proposed model can therefore be applied for entire flow conditions in reality.

These results are used to obtain analytic solutions and computational solutions, by the method of Godunov, for the three test scenarios earlier suggested by Ross. Results show that the kinematic-wave model, with a correct computational solution (i.e., converging to the entropy solution), correctly produces the analytic (entropy) solutions of the kinematic-wave model and that analytic and computational solutions both satisfy intuitive expectations at least as well as the novel model suggested by Ross and even avoid some acknowledged deficiencies of the latter. They also emphasize the necessity of using discrete approximations that satisfy the entropy condition and of exercising care in ensuring that the discretization parameters are sufficiently small.

The paper starts with a brief introduction of some necessary notions, followed by a short presentation of the feedback routing strategy of the PI type and an ideal iterative routing strategy of the Frank-Wolfe type, as well as of the macroscopic freeway traffic flow modeling tools METANET and METANET-DTA. The Amsterdam express ring road A10 is considered for the route guidance investigation. More specifically, the introduced feedback strategy and iterative strategy were tested in simulation with regard to A10 with the use of METANET and METANET-DTA. The results indicate that real-time route guidance can help reduce heavy nonrecurrent congestion and establish dynamic user equilibrium.

Continuum traffic model for freeway with on- and off-ramp to explain different traffic-congested states	TRAFFIC FLOW THEORY 2006	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD-SERIES		English	Proceedings Paper	85th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board	JAN 22-26, 2006	Washington, DC	Transportat Res Board			SIMULATION; FLOW; DYNAMICS	This paper presents a multilane continuum traffic flow model for traffic operations at on- and off-ramps, which is based on microscopic principles. One of the main contributions of the derived model is that it takes into account explicitly the impact of ramp length on traffic flow operations, as well as the willingness of drivers to accept smaller gaps when approaching at the end of on-ramps. Different congested states were investigated with the proposed model for specific values of both the upstream main carriageway flow and the on-ramp flow. Several types of congestion states consistent with well-known traffic-congested styles in the literature, such as a moving localized cluster, two moving localized clusters, triggered stop-and-go waves, and homogeneous congested traffic, were found. The simulation results show the stability states of traffic flow for different ramp lengths.	[Ngoduy, D.; Hoogendoorn, Serge P.; Van Zuylen, H.

To study one element of general driver behavior, that of car following, an advanced-instrumented vehicle has been applied in dynamic data collection in real-traffic flow on Swedish roads. This paper briefly introduces the car-following data collection and smoothing methods. Moreover, spectrum analysis methods based on Fourier analysis of car-following data are introduced to estimate driver reaction times, a crucial parameter of driver behavior. A generalized general motor-type model was calibrated, an extension of the classic nonlinear general motor model, in a stable following regime based on estimated driver reaction times. The calibrated model was then evaluated by closed-loop simulations.

Because of its macroscopic and mesoscopic features, CTM offers calibration and computational advantages over microscopic models. This paper demonstrates specific improvements to the original form of CTM to increase its accuracy and realism of traffic flow representation. These improvements include modifications to provide flexibility in selection of cell lengths, noninteger movements of vehicles between cells, and algorithmic enhancements in the merging and diverging logics. The effect of such improvements on the performance of CTM was evaluated independently and comparatively. A sample freeway network of the I-10 corridor in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was used to evaluate and compare the performance of the improved version of CTM versus CORSIM under heavily congested traffic conditions. The results showed comparable performance of both platforms in terms of link occupancy (density) and total network travel time.

The current single-channel detection has all detectors across all lanes on a particular approach providing a single input to a signal phase. Lane-by-lane detection, however, monitors headways and gaps on a lane-by-lane basis. A simulation model was developed to analyze both detection schemes. With the simulation model, green extensions by the two detection schemes were compared over a wide range of traffic scenarios. On the basis of study results, it was found that the two detection schemes do not produce significantly different green extensions under normal traffic flow conditions. For the various factors examined, maximum allowable headway (also passage time) is found to be more sensitive compared with other factors such as arrival headway patterns and lane volume distribution. Although the difference between the two detection schemes in average green extension is generally minimal, large differences do exist among certain cycles, and the actual impact on signal operations could be more significant; this would need further evaluation with other standard traffic simulation models.

The system is a robust on-line updating platform for advanced traveler information, from which the real-time travel time estimates for Hong Kong road networks can be easily extracted. In the RTIS, the travel times are estimated by the real-time AVI data, the off-line travel time estimates and their variance-covariance relationships between road links. The real-time AVI data adopted for RTIS are Autotoll tag data in Hong Kong; whereas the off-line link travel time estimates and their variance-covariance matrices are obtained from a traffic flow simulator. On the basis of integration of these real-time and off-line traffic data, the current traffic conditions on Hong Kong major roads can be estimated at five-minute intervals. A case study is carried out in Kowloon Central urban area to collect observed data for validation of the results of the proposed RTIS.	[Tam, Mei-Lam; Lam, William H.

In previous studies, an increase in the road capacity during sunrise has been observed. This result implies that a significant change in capacity can also be observed during sunset when higher demand exists. The traffic flow data collected by using detectors installed on the Hanshin Expressway, which is an urban expressway in Japan, is examined. A capacity reduction, corresponding to the change in the sunset time, is observed. The relationship between the traffic volume and density during sunset is analysed to estimate the amount of capacity reduction. Applying Drake's formula, it is estimated to be about 5%. During the period of reduction, the speed of vehicles decreases, whereas the distance between them remains constant. This implies that the drivers maybe reducing their speed when the brightness of the surroundings decreases.

Derivation of continuum traffic model for weaving sections on freeways	TRANSPORTMETRICA			English	Article						gas-kinetic model; macroscopic model; gap-acceptance model; weavings		This paper presents a new continuum model describing the dynamics of multiclass traffic flow on multilane freeways including weaving sections. In this paper, we consider a specific freeway weaving type, which is formed when an on ramp is near to an off ramp and these two ramps are joined by an auxiliary lane. Traffic interactions in this weaving zone are very complex due to the involvement of weaving flows and non-weaving flows in the so-called mandatory lane-changing process. To handle this complexity, it is essential to have a good understanding of the (microscopic) driving behavior within the weaving zones. These behaviors are modeled based on a gap-acceptance model. The methodology to obtain a weaving continuum traffic model is thus twofold. On the one hand, we develop a (macroscopic) model to determine the mandatory lane-changing probability based on a renewal process. On the other hand, we implement the lane-changing model into a current gas-kinetic traffic flow model for heterogeneous traffic flow on multilane roadways. From this, corresponding macroscopic model is obtained based on the method of moments.

Cellular automata simulation of traffic flow through a road with a construction zone	URBAN TRANSPORT XII: URBAN TRANSPORT AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY	WIT Transactions on the Built Environment		English	Proceedings Paper	12th International Conference on Urban Transport and the Environment in the 21st Century	JUL 12-14, 2006	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Wessex Inst Technol, Tech Univ Pardubice, WIT Transact Built Environm			MODEL	In this paper, we discuss the cellular automata simulation of the traffic flow on a two-lane road with a construction zone. The simulation model is based on the cellular automata and the stochastic velocity model. In the stochastic velocity model, the vehicles are controlled with a uniform random number. A two-lane road with a construction zone is considered as the object domains and the simulation results are compared with the results of the one-lane and two-lane roads without a construction zone. Although it has been predicted from the analytical study that the traffic flow on a road with a construction zone depends only on the number of the available lanes, the simulation results shows that the traffic flow depends not only on the number of the available lanes but also the length of the construction zone.

Analysis of user behaviour at a roundabout under car-following conditions	URBAN TRANSPORT XII: URBAN TRANSPORT AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY	WIT Transactions on the Built Environment		English	Proceedings Paper	12th International Conference on Urban Transport and the Environment in the 21st Century	JUL 12-14, 2006	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC	Wessex Inst Technol, Tech Univ Pardubice, WIT Transact Built Environm		driver behaviour; roundabout; car-following; model	TRAFFIC DYNAMICS; MODELS	Roundabout intersection planning in urban areas has spread remarkably, especially in Europe. Compared with the conventional intersection layout, this system is suitable for improving road safety and the urban landscape. In the literature there are many studies regarding car-following models; the innovative characteristic of this research is the analysis of user behaviour at a roundabout. In fact, the main aim is to develop a car-following model allowing the definition of flow conditions under high vehicular densities at this type of intersection. The car-following model consists of a stimulus-response function; its calibration and validation has been made by the analysis of many parameters influencing traffic flow. These parameters have been observed with a video data acquirement technique in order to minimize the distance between the observed variables and the estimated one. Preliminary results show a strong correlation between the observed behavioural parameters and the output of the model, forecasting vehicular trajectories at a roundabout. The estimation of traffic parameters in car-following condition is useful to define the geometry of the intersection (length of weaving area, number of lanes, diameter, number of entries) and to forecast conditions that could lead to behavioural anomalies connected with a reduced safety level for users.

Then we propose a mathematical model assessing the expected level of traffic safety associated with the toll station layout, actual or planned, due to a given configuration for toll gate types and positions. The model has been conceived in order to let the planner be able to decide the proper sequence of gate types which minimises the risk of accidents. The decision variables are mainly related to the assignment of a gate type - manual gate with operator, ETC gate, semiautomatic or short stop gate to each gate position in the station. The resulting multi-toll-type assignment model, or MTTA, takes into account the probability of interaction between pairs of traffic streams originated from the different lanes of the highway and directed to specific gate types; different severity and risk indices are associated both with vehicle types and with destination gate types. The computational tests have been performed on observed data collected during several hours of video-camera images recorded in five different motorway multi-type toll plazas located in Tuscany (Italy). Our results support the evidence that gates associated to higher risk traffic flows, e.g. traffic directed to ETC gates which approaches the toll station at speeds significantly above the average, should be locate in a central position with respect to other gate types. Moreover, the experimental results disagree with the general operations practice of many Italian motorway Agencies, which usually place ETC gates on the far side of the toll plaza.

In this paper, based on literature review of several methods to estimate future short interval traffic volume, a fuzzy linear regression algorithm is presented to predict urban traffic flow dynamically, the model is put forward and the detail principle is studied. In contrast to other technologies, the fuzzy algorithm is able to integrate statistical volume and occupancy data and get the fuzzy correlation among them. The algorithm is tested with real traffic data and produces average estimates error of traffic volume with only 7%.

Intersection in the traffic network is described as the polygon feature that has many virtual lanes in it. In the end, micro traffic flow simulation software based on GIS is developed, which adopts the lane-based network data model.

Three main components, traffic flow models, network control objectives and control strategies, are critical in it. This study selects the cell transmission model (CTM) to describe traffic flow characteristics and design an optimal control model using one kind of network throughput performance indices, system dispersal time, as the control objective. Signal timing plans are calculated by gene algorithm optimization with single cycle strategy (SCS) and double cycle strategy (DCS) respectively. Results show that a proper non-maximum cycle length will disperse congested network vehicles rapidly and fixed double cycle strategy is feasible in oversaturated network traffic control especially with higher priority in artery.

This paper studies the stability of a car-following model on two lanes which incorporates the lateral effects in traffic. The stability condition of the model is obtained by using the linear stability theory. The modified Korteweg-de Vries equation is constructed and solved, and three types of traffic flows in the headway-sensitivity space-stable, metastable, and unstable-are classified. Both analytical and simulation results show that the anxiousness about lane changing from neighbor lane indeed has influence upon people's driving behavior and the consideration of lateral effects could stabilize the traffic flows on both lanes.

As to traffic flow, a reasonable real-time information feedback can improve the urban traffic condition by providing route guidance. In this paper, the influence of a feedback strategy named congestion coefficient feedback strategy is introduced, based on a two-route scenario in which dynamic information can be generated and displayed on the board to guide road users to make a choice. Simulation results adopting this optimal information feedback strategy have demonstrated high efficiency in controlling spatial distribution of traffic patterns compared with the other two information feedback strategies, i.e., travel time and mean velocity.

J	Ma, XL; Andreasson, I				Ma, XL; Andreasson, I			Predicting the effect of various ISA penetration grades on pedestrian safety by simulation	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						ISA penetration; pedestrian safety; collision model; TPMA simulation; Monte Carlo experiment		Intelligent speed adaption (ISA) is one type of vehicle-based intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which warns and regulates driving speed according to the speed limits of the roads. Early field studies showed that ISA could reduce general mean speed levels and their variances in different road environments. This paper studies the effects of various ISA penetration grades on pedestrian safety in a single lane road. A microscopic traffic simulation tool, TPMA, was further developed and used to implement different ISA penetration grades. Momentary spot speed and traffic flow data are first logged in the traffic simulation for later prediction of pedestrian safety. Then a hypothetical vehicle-pedestrian collision model is extended from early researches in order to estimate two safety indicators: probability of collision, and risk of death. Finally, Monte Carlo method is applied iteratively to compute those safety indices. The computational result shows that raising ISA penetration in traffic flow will reduce both the probability of mid-block collision between vehicle and pedestrian and the risk of death in the collision accidents. Furthermore, the decrease of the risk of death will be more prominent than that of the collision probability according to this method. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ni, DH; Leonard, JD				Ni, DH; Leonard, JD			A simplified kinematic wave model at a merge bottleneck	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING			English	Article						simulation and modeling; traffic flow; simplified kinematic wave; queuing; merge		A merge is a point of a highway where two or more streams of traffic flow into one. It is always easy to solve the demand-supply problem at a merge when the merge is operating under uncongested condition. However, when congestion backs up exceeding the merging point where multiple streams of traffic meet, one is typically faced with splitting downstream supply among the merging branches. Solutions of this situation are multiple and several merge queuing models have been proposed in the past. To address the drawbacks of the past models, this paper proposes a capacity-based weighted fair queuing (CBWFQ) model that is characterized by its fidelity (approximation to real situation), simplicity, and extensibility. Based on the CBWFQ merge queuing model, a simplified kinematic wave model is formulated to model traffic operation at a merge bottleneck. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The closure is obtained by phenomenological models suitable to relate the local mean velocity to local density profiles. Various models are described and critically analyzed in the deterministic and stochastic case. The analysis is developed in view of applications of the models to traffic flow simulations for networks of roads. Some research perspectives are derived from the above analysis and proposed in the last part of the paper. To cite this article: N. Bellonlo, V Coscia, C. R. Mecanique 333 (2005).

Measurements took place at roads with representative traffic regimes: at the kerbside of a motorway (120 km h(-1)), a highway (80100 km h-1), and in an urban area with stop-and-go traffic (0-50 km h(-1)) regulated by light signals. Mean diurnal variations showed that the highest pollutant concentrations were during the morning rush hours, especially of the number density in the nanoparticle size range (D < 50 nm). From the differences between up- and downwind concentrations (or differences between kerbside and background concentrations for the urban site), "real-life" emission factors were derived using NO, concentrations to calculate dilution factors. Particle number and volume emission factors of different size ranges (18-50 nm, 18100 nm, and 18-300 nm) were derived for the total vehicle fleet and separated into a light-duty (LDV) and a heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) contribution. The total particle number emissions per vehicle were found to be about 11.7-13.5 X 10(14) particles km(-1) for constant speed (80-120 km h(-1)) and 3.9 x 10(14) particles km-1 for urban driving conditions. LDVs showed higher emission factors at constant high speed than under urban disturbed traffic flow. In contrast, HDVs emitted more air pollutants during deceleration and acceleration processes in stop-and-go traffic than with constant speed of about 80 km h(-1). On average, one HDV emits a 10-30 times higher amount of particulate air pollutants (in terms of both number and volume) than one LDV.

J	Skagerstam, BSK; Hansen, A				Skagerstam, BSK; Hansen, A			Memory effects and scaling properties of traffic flows	EUROPHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article								Traffic flows are studied in terms of their local noise of sound, which is an easily accessible experimental quantity. The sound noise data is studied making use of scaling properties of discrete wavelet transforms and Hurst exponents are extracted. The scaling behavior is used to characterize the traffic flows in terms of scaling properties of the memory function in the framework of Mori-Lee stochastic differential equations. The results obtained provides for a new theoretical as well as experimental framework to characterize the large-time behavior of traffic flows. The present paper outlines the procedure by making use of data from one-lane computer simulations as well as sound data of a real traffic flow. The experimental real traffic flow data we have obtained, using standard sound measurement techniques, is compatible with the presence of conventional diffusion at small time scales as well as 1/f noise at large time scales.

J	Maerivoet, S; De Moor, B				Maerivoet, S; De Moor, B			Cellular automata models of road traffic	PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Review						cellular automata; traffic flow modelling; tempo-spatial behaviour; phase-space diagrams	NAGEL-SCHRECKENBERG MODEL; STATISTICAL PHYSICS; SELF-ORGANIZATION; FLOW MODELS; TRANSITION; SIMULATION; HIGHWAY; JAM; UNIVERSALITY; COMPLEXITY	In this paper, we give an elaborate and understandable review of traffic cellular automata (TCA) models, which are a class of computationally efficient microscopic traffic flow models. TCA models arise from the physics discipline of statistical mechanics, having the goal of reproducing the correct macroscopic behaviour based on a minimal description of microscopic interactions. After giving an overview of cellular automata (CA) models, their background and physical setup, we introduce the mathematical notations, show how to perform measurements on a TCA model's lattice of cells, as well as how to convert these quantities into real-world units and vice versa. The majority of this paper then relays an extensive account of the behavioural aspects of several TCA models encountered in literature. Already, several reviews of TCA models exist, but none of them consider all the models exclusively from the behavioural point of view. In this respect, our overview fills this void, as it focusses on the behaviour of the TCA models, by means of time-space and phase-space diagrams, and histograms showing the distributions of vehicles' speeds, space, and time gaps. In the report, we subsequently give a concise overview of TCA models that are employed in a multi-lane setting, and some of the TCA models used to describe city traffic as a two-dimensional and of cells, or as a road network with explicitly modelled intersections. The final part of the paper illustrates some of the more common analytical approximations to single-cell TCA models. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Li, BB				Li, BB			Bayesian inference for origin-destination matrices of transport networks using the EM algorithm	TECHNOMETRICS			English	Article						Bayesian statistical modeling; incomplete data analysis; multivariate negative binomial distribution; multivariate Poisson distribution; trip matrix	GENERALIZED LEAST-SQUARES; RECURSIVE ESTIMATION; STATISTICAL APPROACH; TRAFFIC COUNTS; TRIP MATRICES; IDENTIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION; ESTIMATOR	Information on the origin-destination (OD) matrix of a transport network is a fundamental requirement in much transportation planning. A relatively inexpensive method for updating an OD matrix is to draw inference about the OD matrix based on a single observation of traffic flows on a specific set of network links, where the Bayesian approach is a natural choice for combining the prior knowledge about the OD matrix and the current observation of traffic flows. The existing approaches of Bayesian modeling of OD matrices include using normal approximations to Poisson distributions, which leads to the posterior being intractable even under some simple special cases, and using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, which incurs extreme demand of computational efforts. In this article, through the EM algorithm, Bayesian inference is reinvestigated for a transport network for estimating the population means of traffic flows, reconstructing traffic flows, and predicting future traffic flows. It is shown that the resultant estimates have very simple forms with minimal computational costs.

Under these conditions one wishes to estimate the distribution of traffic flow. Whether one street is preferable to another depends not only on the quality of the road, but also on the density of the flow. If every driver takes the path that looks most favorable to him, the resultant running times need not be minimal. Furthermore, it is indicated by an example that an extension of the road network may cause a redistribution of the traffic that results in longer individual running times.

With different parameters, we simulated the traffic flow of the two-lane system when the vehicle densities of lanes are equal or different respectively. The fundamental diagrams of the traffic flow are given. According to the analysis, the traffic state could be divided into three regions. The nonsymmetry of car density on two lanes has important influence on the traffic flow.

Based on the Nagel-Schreckenberg model (NS for short), it includes effective gap and brake light. Morvover, a novel concept about the variable security gap is introduced. The simulation shows that the road capacity of the modified ITS cellular automaton model is higher than the measured data on certain highway, further indicating the important role of ITS, enlarged traffic flow and suppressed traffic jam. The mixed traffic flow related to two different vehicles' velocity is studied. The simulation shows even few slow vehicles will lead to drastic decrease of traffic flow, which demonstrates the necessity to implement strictly special fast lane.

J	Kuhlwein, J; Friedrich, R				Kuhlwein, J; Friedrich, R			Traffic measurements and high-performance modelling of motorway emission rates	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						traffic emissions; traffic data; emission model; uncertainties; validation	GUBRIST TUNNEL; SWITZERLAND; AUGSBURG; CITY	Within the framework of an extensive emission data validation experiment, the emission rates of the German motorway A 656 near Heidelberg have been determined using a new sophisticated emission model in combination with local traffic measurements. For this purpose, traffic parameters that are essential for the vehicles' emission behaviour have been quantified by a measuring program that has been adapted to the special needs of a microscopic emission model. Traffic flows were recorded by automatic and manual counts. Fleet compositions were analysed by registration number evaluations. Speeds and accelerations were measured at different characteristic times and different road cross-sections. The road gradient was determined from precise altitude data. All experimental traffic data were used as input of a high-performance emission model and replaced traffic data from general databases step by step. The inclusion of all traffic and road data measured resulted in hourly daytime emission rates of 6000-11000 g km(-1) h(-1) for CO, 2500-4500 g km(-1) h(-1) for NOx, 350-600 g km(-1) h(-1) for NMHC and 150-280 g km(-1) h(-1) for PM. Uncertainty analyses show that the experimentally derived traffic data significantly reduce the errors of the modelled emission rates. The detection of traffic congestion situations by suitable monitoring methods is very important to the modelling of high-quality emission data for individual road sections. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Since there are hundreds of towns in Europe with smaller population, it is important to know the levels of aromatics in these areas. This work presents the results of a benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) measurement campaign that took place in Ioannina, a medium-sized Greek city. As a result of traffic situation and the local meteorological conditions, pollution levels in Ioannina are unusually high, at least for a city of that size. BTX levels were measured using passive samplers placed at several points around the city, as well as across a selected street canyon using both passive and active samplers, combined with simultaneous measurements of traffic flow and wind speed. The measurement procedure was repeated in an exact manner for all four seasons and the results suggest that benzene levels, at all sampling points, exceed the limit set by EU Directive 2000/69. Benzene levels appear correlated to traffic density, while benzene/toluene/xylene ratios present a seasonal variation linked to meteorological conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

How these parameters, especially the lengths of the vehicles, influence the traffic behaviors and transportation capability has seldom been investigated. In this paper, we study the mixed traffic system using the cellular automata traffic flow model. The simulation results show that when the road occupancy rate is large, increasing the fraction of long vehicles can apparently, improve the transportation capability. The influence of slow vehicles fraction on the average velocity of vehicles has been discussed, and it is found that the influences are very different when the difference of vehicle length is considered or not.

J	Jiang, XM; Adeli, H				Jiang, XM; Adeli, H			Dynamic wavelet neural network model for traffic flow forecasting	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article							PREDICTION; VOLUME	Accurate and timely forecasting of traffic flow is of paramount importance for effective management of traffic congestion in intelligent transportation systems. In this paper, a novel nonparametric dynamic time-delay recurrent wavelet neural network model is presented for forecasting traffic flow. The model incorporates the self-similar, singular, and fractal properties discovered in the traffic flow. The concept of wavelet frame is introduced and exploited in the model to provide flexibility in the design of wavelets and to add extra features such as adaptable translation parameters desirable in traffic flow forecasting. The statistical autocorrelation function is used for selection of the optimum input dimension of traffic flow time series. The model incorporates both the time of the day and the day of the week of the prediction time. As such, it can be used for long-term traffic flow forecasting in addition to short-term forecasting. The model has been validated using actual freeway traffic flow data. The model can assist traffic engineers and highway agencies to create effective traffic management plans for alleviating freeway congestions.

J	Helbing, D; Jiang, R; Treiber, M				Helbing, D; Jiang, R; Treiber, M			Analytical investigation of oscillations in intersecting flows of pedestrian and vehicle traffic	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							DYNAMICS; PHYSICS	In two intersecting many-particle streams, one can often find the emergence of oscillatory patterns. Here, we investigate the interaction of pedestrians with vehicles, when they try to cross a road. A numerical study of this coupled pedestrian-vehicle delay problem has been presented in a previous paper. Here, we focus on the analytical treatment of the problem, which requires us to use a simplified car-following model. Our analytical results for the transition to oscillatory pedestrian and traffic flows and the average waiting times are well supported by numerical evaluations and give a detailed picture of the collective dynamics emerging when pedestrians try to cross a road. The mathematical expressions allow one to identify the dependence on model parameters such as the vehicle or pedestrian arrival rate, and the safety factor of pedestrian gap acceptance. We also calculate a formula for the vehicle time gap distribution, which corresponds to the departure time contribution of a M/D/1 queue characterized by Poissonian distributed Markovian arrivals, 1 service channel, and deterministic departures.

J	Jiang, R; Wu, QS				Jiang, R; Wu, QS			The traffic flow controlled by the traffic lights in the speed gradient continuum model	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						traffic flow; traffic light; speed gradient model	TRANSITION; PHYSICS; WAVES	In this paper, we have studied the traffic flow controlled by the traffic lights on a circuit road using the SG model. The single light situation, the synchronized light strategy, the green wave light strategy and the random switching light strategy are investigated. The spatio-temporal patterns are presented. Our simulations show that the plot of flow against density depends mainly on the distance between the lights and the cycle time. The capacity decreases with the increase of cycle time. For small distance between the lights, the lights do not behave as a bottleneck and the plot of flow against density looks just like a fundamental diagram. For the non-equidistant traffic lights situation, the results depend on the distribution of the distance between the lights. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kerner, BS				Kerner, BS			Control of spatiotemporal congested traffic patterns at highway bottlenecks	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article							CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES; MICROSCOPIC MODEL; ON-RAMP; FLOW; PHYSICS; SIMULATIONS; SYSTEMS; PHASE; JAMS	The physics of congested traffic pattern formation at an on-ramp bottleneck under on-ramp metering is studied. Various congested pattern nucleation effects at the bottleneck under different control rules are found. Based on the author's three-phase traffic theory, a congested pattern feedback on-ramp inflow control approach is proposed and investigated. In this congested pattern control approach (ANCONA approach for short), congestion at all on-ramp bottleneck is allowed to set in. The basis idea of the ANCONA approach is to keep congestion conditions at the minimum possible level at the bottleneck. In particular, the congested pattern should not propagate upstream, i.e., the congested pattern should be localized on the main road in a small neighborhood of the bottleneck. It is used in the ANCONA approach that in accordance with empirical congested pattern features, congested patterns are of various types some more favorable than others in terms of the discharge volume from the congested pattern and of the vehicle delay time due to congestion. Based on a microscopic traffic flow model of Kerner and Klenov in the context of three-phase traffic theory, a comparison of the ANCONA approach with a well-known free flow, control approach in which free flow is maintained at the bottleneck is made. In particular, a ramp metering ALINEA method based on the free flow control approach that is used in many real installations is studied and compared with the ANCONA approach. Benefits of the ANCONA approach are (i) higher throughputs on the main road downstream of the bottleneck, (ii) considerably lower vehicle waiting times at the light signal on the on-ramp, (ii) the upstream propagation of congestion does not occur even if large amplitude perturbations appear in traffic flow.

J	Venigalla, M; Ali, A				Venigalla, M; Ali, A			Deriving performance measures for transportation planning using ITS archived data	CIVIL ENGINEERING AND ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						intelligent transportation systems; archived data management systems; transportation planning; air quality		Various modern sensor technologies deployed under the auspices of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) for data collection and archiving have helped in accumulating a wealth of transportation data in the form of data archives. Archiving of transportation data obtained from intelligent sources is practiced in most parts of the US under the auspices of the states' departments of transportation. However, recently there is a shift in the focus of archived data management systems (ADMS) from data collection and archiving to data analysis and distribution to stakeholders. This article discusses the use of archived ITS data for the development of performance measures for transportation planning and air quality support service. This service is packaged within a larger ADMS effort called Traffic Management Centers (TMC) Applications of Archived Data, which is also known by its working title 'ADMS Virginia'. Nine sub-services for computing various performance measures at different spatial and temporal levels of aggregation are available within the transportation planning and air quality service. The nine performance measures provided are traffic speed, volume, density, vehicle miles traveled (VMT), percent VMT by time of day, travel time, volume-to-capacity ratio, peak hour factor, and average daily traffic (ADT). The service integrates a subset of a regional transportation planning network with the traffic flow data in the archived databases. The performance measures developed in this study have a broad spectrum of uses ranging from long- and short-range transportation planning, transportation system monitoring, regional air quality monitoring and air quality conformity, development of forecasting and simulation models, and establishment of growth impact policies. The concepts of operations of this system are discussed along with functional requirements, data model, and algorithms for deriving the performance measures. The methodology and procedures discussed in this article are portable and can easily be adopted by other ADMS efforts.

The model is based on a conservation law for the density of traffic and on semilinearequations for traffic-type functions, i. e. functions describing paths for cars. We propose a definition of solution at junctions, which depends on the traffic-type functions. Finally we prove, for every positive time T, existence of entropic solutions on the whole network for perturbations of constant initial data. Our method is based on the wave-front tracking approach.

J	Xia, LP; Shao, YP				Xia, LP; Shao, YP			Modelling of traffic flow and air pollution emission with application to Hong Kong Island	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						traffic; traffic flow model; road network; traffic emission; urban air pollution	HYDRODYNAMIC MODELS; KINEMATIC WAVES; INVENTORY MODEL; QUALITY; GIS	In this study, we propose a Lagrangian model for the simulation of traffic flow on a complex road network. This simple approach is quite efficient if adequate road network data are available and statistical constraints are applied to confine the model behavior. We have established a traffic information database for Hong Kong Island and applied the model for traffic flow simulation. It is shown that by specifying three types of traffic routes (random turn, preferred turn and shortest path) and providing traffic flow data at selected stations, the model is capable of simulating traffic flow on the road network. This is confirmed by comparing model simulated and observed traffic flow patterns at several monitoring stations. The simulated traffic flow is then used as the basis for the estimation of traffic induced emission of air pollutants on the island. Using empirical emission factors for a number of vehicle categories, the emission rates of major air pollutants, CO, NOx and PM10, are estimated. The predicted emission rates are compared with measurements for several air quality monitoring stations. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Panwai, S; Dia, H				Panwai, S; Dia, H			Comparative evaluation of microscopic car-following behavior	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						car-following models; microscopic traffic simulation	SIMULATION-MODEL; TRAFFIC DYNAMICS	Microscopic traffic-simulation tools are increasingly being applied to evaluate the impacts of a wide variety of intelligent transport, systems (ITS) applications and other dynamic problems that are difficult to solve using traditional analytical models. The accuracy of a traffic-simulation system depends highly on the quality of the traffic-flow model at its core, with the two main critical components being the car-following and lane-changing models. This paper presents findings from a comparative evaluation of car-following behavior in a number of traffic simulators [advanced interactive microscopic simulator for urban and nonurban networks (AIMSUN), parallel microscopic simulation (PARAMICS), and Verkehr in Statiten-simulation (VISSIM)]. The car-following algorithms used in these simulators have been developed from a variety of theoretical backgrounds and are reported to have been calibrated on a number of different data sets. Very few independent studies have attempted to evaluate the performance of the underlying algorithms based on the same data set. The results reported in this study are based on a car-following experiment that used instrumented vehicles to record the speed and relative distance between follower and leader vehicles on a one-lane road. The experiment was replicated in each tool and the simulated car-following behavior was compared to the field data using a number of error tests. The results showed lower error values for the Gipps-based models implemented in AIMSUN and similar error values for the psychophysical spacing models used in VISSIM and PARAMICS. A qualitative "drift and goal-seeking behavior" test, which essentially shows how the distance headway between leader and follower vehicles should oscillate around a stable distance, also confirmed the findings.

J	Chootinan, P; Wong, SC; Chen, A				Chootinan, P; Wong, SC; Chen, A			A reliability-based network design problem	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Application of Information and Communication Technology in Transport Systems in Development Countries	AUG 05-07, 2004	Moratuwa, SRI LANKA			reliability analysis; capacity reliability; continuous network design problem; bi-level program; stochastic user equilibrium	ROAD NETWORK; TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT; PERFORMANCE RELIABILITY; RESERVE CAPACITY; GAME-THEORY; EQUILIBRIUM; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHMS; MODELS; TIME	This paper presents a reliability-based network design problem. A network reliability concept is embedded into the continuous network design problem in which travelers' route choice behavior follows the stochastic user equilibrium assumption. A new capacity-reliability index is introduced to measure the probability that all of the network links are operated below their capacities when serving different traffic patterns deviating from the average condition. The reliability-based network design problem is formulated as a bi-level program in which the lower level sub-program is the probit-based stochastic user equilibrium problem and the upper level sub-program is the maximization of the new capacity reliability index. The lower level sub-program is solved by a variant of the method of successive averages using the exponential average to represent the learning process of network users on a daily basis that results in the daily variation of traffic-flow pattern, and Monte Carlo stochastic loading. The upper level sub-program is tackled by means of genetic algorithms. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the concept of the proposed framework.

A traffic flow simulator (TFS) is presented to forecast the short-term travel times that can be served as a predicted travel time database for the TIS in Hong Kong. In the TFS, a stochastic deviation coefficient is incorporated to simulate the minute-by-minute fluctuation of traffic flows within the peak hour period. The purposes of the case study are: 1) to show the applicability of the TFS for larger-scale road network; and 2) to illustrate the short-term forecasting of path travel times in practice. The results of the case study show that the TFS can be applied to real network effectively. The predicted travel times are compared with the observed travel times on the selected paths for an OD pair. The results show that the observed path travel times fall in the 90% confidence interval of the predicted path travel times.

For the analytical and numerical optimization of the control, the knowledge of the gradient of the objective functional is useful. The adjoint calculus introduced below determines the gradient in two ways.

J	Sadoun, B				Sadoun, B			Optimizing the operation of a toll plaza system using simulation: A methodology	SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						modeling and simulation; optimization; toll plaza; transportation engineering and planning		Many urban areas and states are facing an increase in population density and the industrial base, creating traffic congestion and jams at toll plazas on major highways during rush hours. This article provides a detailed study and analysis of the performance evaluation of a toll plaza using discrete event simulation modeling. Under a given time-dependent traffic flow and a set of specified model parameters, the required optimal number of tollbooths and the resulting mean delay can be estimated with the discrete event simulation model. The results show that a toll plaza that has a shorter delay under light load conditions is more sensitive to variations in service type and the number of toll plazas. The results show that the performance of toll plazas improves as the number of tollbooths increases because less time is spent in queue.

The jam propagates with changing the initial form. It is shown that the pulse jam at the initial stage changes to the three types of nonlinear waves, appearing respectively in the three distinct regions in (Delta x(1,0),a)-space where Delta x(1,0) is the half of pulse strength at the initial stage and a is the sensitivity. Two waves of them form the plateaus. The value of the headway at the plateau is compared with the neutral stability and coexisting points. It is shown that the formation of plateaus is due to the phase separation in the dynamical jamming transition. It is found that the transition line between two waves forming plateaus is consistent with the coexisting line in the jamming transition. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For a very low value of probability p of the velocity fluctuation of the vehicles, the 1/f(x) fluctuations are computed from the power spectrum of the traffic flow. As a result, alpha similar or equal to 1 in the free-flow and maximal current phases, and a is reduced in the jammed phase. Due to the vehicles movement through different chain boundaries, a can never reach the value zero in the jammed phase. It is to note that a can reach the value zero in periodic roads at very high densities [K. Nassab, R. Barlovic, M. Schreckenberg, S. Ouaskit, to submit]. The inflow (P-in) and outflow (P-out) of the vehicles through the connection sites to other roads lead to the formation of the region corresponding to the maximal flow phase in the phase diagram of the traffic flow. This result is found in the case of the low probabilities p of the fluctuations of the vehicles velocities in the road with open boundaries. This region grows in length if the rates of pi,, and p., increase. In the case of the chain without connection sites, the region of the maximal flow becomes large if the probability p is high, and vanishes if p = 0 and p(in) = p(out) = 0. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Without the limit of "lanes" pedestrian movement is loose and free. Furthermore, they are easily affected by other walkers as well as the environment around. In this paper, a special technique is introduced considering human behavior to make the rules more reasonable. By simulating the two-dimension pedestrian movement in corridor, the phase transition phenomena of pedestrian movement, including the walkers moving bottom-up and top-down, are presented. Studying on the effect of possibility of exchange position between face-to-face pedestrians propose that the considerable exchange possibility is about 0.20 in the scope studied in this paper.

In this model, the stochastic noise P in NS model is replaced by accelerating probability P-a and braking probability P-d. The fundamental diagrams of the mixing traffic under different conditions are given by the numerical simulations. We found that the lane-changing probability,the mixing rate and acceleration, the braking probability have a great influence on the mixing traffic flow. The slow cars have a decisive action on the mixing traffic.

J	Chitour, Y; Piccoli, B				Chitour, Y; Piccoli, B			Traffic circles and timing of traffic lights for cars flow	DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS-SERIES B			English	Article						conservation laws; traffic flow; road networks	CONSERVATION-LAWS; SYSTEMS; WAVES	In this paper we address the following traffic regulation problem: given a junction with some incoming roads and some outgoing ones, is it preferable to regulate the flux via a traffic light or via a traffic circle on which the incoming traffic enters continuously? More precisely, assuming that drivers distribute on outgoing roads according to some known coefficients, our aim is to understand which solution performs better from the point of view of total amount of cars going through the junction. To deal with this problem we consider a fluid dynamic model for traffic flow on a road network. The model is that proposed in [9] and is applied to the case of crossings with lights and with circles. For the first we consider timing of lights as control and determine the asymptotic fluxes. For the second we extend and complete the model of [9] introducing some right of way parameters. Also in this case we determine the asymptotic behavior. We then compare the performances of the two solutions. Finally, we can indicate which choice is preferable, depending on traffic level and control necessity, and give indications on how to tune traffic light timing and traffic circle right of way parameters.

J	Tsai, MY; Chen, KS; Wu, CH				Tsai, MY; Chen, KS; Wu, CH			Three-dimensional modeling dispersion in an urban street of air flow and pollutant canyon with thermal effects	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION			English	Article							WIND-TUNNEL	Effects of excess ground and building temperatures on airflow and dispersion of pollutants in an urban street canyon with an aspect ratio of 0.8 and a length-to-width ratio of 3 were investigated numerically. Three-dimensional governing equations of mass, momentum, energy, and species were modeled using the RNG k-epsilon turbulence model and Boussinesq approximation, which were solved using the finite volume method. Vehicle emissions were estimated from the measured traffic flow rates and modeled as banded line sources, with a street length and bandwidths equal to typical vehicle widths. Both measurements and simulations reveal that pollutant concentrations typically follow the traffic flow rate; they decline as the height increases and are higher on the leeward side than on the windward side. Three-dimensional simulations reveal that the vortex line, joining the centers of cross-sectional vortexes of the street canyon, meanders between street buildings and shifts toward the windward side when heating strength is increased. Thermal boundary layers are very thin. Entrainment of outside air increases, and pollutant concentration decreases with increasing heating condition. Also, traffic-produced turbulence enhances the turbulent kinetic energy and the mixing of temperature and admixtures in the canyon. Factors affecting the inaccuracy of the simulations are addressed.

J	Koshy, RZ; Arasan, VT				Koshy, RZ; Arasan, VT			Influence of bus stops on flow characteristics of mixed traffic	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article								The number and type of bus stops provided on a road significantly influence the flow characteristics of traffic on the road. The study of the influence of bus stops on traffic flow under homogeneous traffic conditions has been attempted by several researchers. However, studies on the influence of bus stops on traffic flow under heterogeneous traffic conditions, are found to be absent. This paper is concerned with the study of heterogeneous traffic flow characteristics using a simulation technique with specific reference to the influence of bus stops on the traffic flow. First, an overview of the microscopic traffic-flow simulation model used to study the flow characteristics of nonlane-based heterogeneous traffic on urban road links is given. Then, the validation of the model based on field observed data is described. Finally, the application of the model to study the impact of curbside bus stops and bus bays on the speeds of other vehicles in heterogeneous traffic streams is dealt with. The effects of variation of the basic parameters, such as bus dwell time, road width, and traffic flow level, are examined for both curbside and bus bay type of stops. The usefulness of the model in fixing the traffic flow levels for replacing curbside stops with bus bays, as example, has also been highlighted.

We include to the model the effect of spacing between the on- and the off-ramps on a same periodic road at a intersection (interchange) with another road. First, we use the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NaSch) model (J. Phys. 1 2 (1992) 2221) without modifications to extract the basic phenomena of traffic flow, and in the following step we focus our investigation on the NaSch model with velocity-dependent randomization (VDR model) (Eur. Phys. J. B 5 (1998) 793) to examine the other system behaviors. Our results provide evidence that the metastable states and the phase separation can occur in the same way like in the models with local site defects. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The class of discrete models originate from equations satisfied by the discrete traveling waves of some inviscid nonequilibrium continuum models. The self-organized oscillatory behavior and chaotic behavior in traffic are identified and formulated. The results can help to explain the appearance of a phantom traffic jam observed in real traffic flow. There is a qualitative agreement when the analytical results are compared with the empirical findings for freeway traffic and with the previous numerical simulations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Milbradt, P; Rose, M				Milbradt, P; Rose, M			Stabilized finite element method for simulation of freeway traffic	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS			English	Article						stabilized finite elements; macroscopic traffic model; Galerkin approximation; super method	EQUATIONS	The modeling of traffic flow is a key tool to simulate and predict the behavior of traffic systems. Macroscopic traffic simulation models are based on advection dominated coupled non-linear partial differential equations. The solution of such advection dominated equations with the method of finite elements is leading to the development of stabilization techniques. The choice of suitable stabilization parameters is often application-dependent. A stabilized finite element procedure on the basis of a Galerkin/least-square approximation is presented for systems of transient advection-dominated equations. A general rule for computing suitable element stabilization parameters is outlined which uses the spectral radius of the differential operators and the specific element expansion. The application of this approximation to a macroscopic traffic model shows the applicability of this approach. Simulation results of typical phenomena of jam formation in freeway traffic are presented.

J	Moussa, N				Moussa, N			Dangerous situations in two-lane traffic flow models	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						cellular automata; lane changing; dangerous situations	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; RULES; PHYSICS; ROADWAY	This paper investigates the probability of car accidents (PCA) in two-lane traffic flow models. We introduce new conditions for the occurrence of dangerous situations (DS) caused by an unexpected lane changing vehicles. Two different lane changing rules are considered, say symmetric and asymmetric. For the symmetric rules, we investigate the influence of the Nagel-Schreckenberg parameters such as the maximal speed, the randomization probability,..., on the PCA when vehicle moves forward or changes lanes. It is found that the forward PCA is as likely as that in one-lane traffic model. As regards to lane changing, the properties of the PCA are qualitatively different from those in one-lane traffic. For the asymmetric rules, we investigate the effect of the slack parameter Delta, introduced to adjust the inversion point of lane-usage, on the PCA. Contrarily to one-lane traffic, the forward PCA in the right lane exhibits two maximums for some range of Delta; the first one is located at low density and the second at high density. The lane changing PCA from right to left is found to decrease with increase of Delta. However, no DS exist when vehicles change from left to right.

J	Jain, M; Coifman, B				Jain, M; Coifman, B			Improved speed estimates from freeway traffic detectors	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article							VELOCITY; VOLUME	This paper presents an analytical methodology to increase the accuracy of speed estimates from freeway traffic detectors by integrating information across lanes. Typically these estimates are quite noisy due to unobserved variables and measurement errors. Yet most traffic-monitoring applications employed by operating agencies only require a single measurement per direction at a detector station. Earlier efforts have focused on improving speed estimates of the individual lanes and then using a simple average to arrive at a single measure of speed at the detector station. But simply averaging the data across lanes is likely to preserve a measurement error in any one of the lanes. This paper improves speed estimates on a lane-by-lane basis using conventional aggregated flow and Occupancy data obtained from single loop detectors. It then goes further by exploiting the information in the adjacent lanes to eliminate noise. In the Course of analysis, data cleaning tools have been developed to identify and exclude malfunctioning detectors and transient errors, improving the validity of traffic data before estimating speed. These data cleaning tools consist of threshold value tests and basic traffic flow theory principles. To reduce the vulnerability to common transient measurement errors in individual lanes, the median of the improved estimates across lanes is taken in each direction. The methodology is then extended to clean noisy speeds measured from dual loop detectors and other sensors that mimic single loops.

J	Huang, DW				Huang, DW			Analytical results of asymmetric exclusion processes with ramps	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							SYNCHRONIZED TRAFFIC FLOW; INDUCED PHASE-TRANSITIONS; CELLULAR-AUTOMATON; MODEL; BOUNDARY; STATES; SYSTEMS	We present the analytical results in a simple traffic model describing a single-lane highway with ramps. Both on-ramps and off-ramps are considered. Complete classification of distinct phases is achieved. Exact phase diagrams are derived. In the case of a single ramp (either on-ramp or off-ramp), the bottleneck effect is absent. The traffic conditions of congestion before the ramp and free-flowing after the ramp cannot be realized. In the case of two consecutive ramps, the bottleneck emerges when the on-ramp is placed before the off-ramp and the flow in between the ramps saturates.

J	Tolba, C; Lefebvre, D; Thomas, P; El Moudni, A				Tolba, C; Lefebvre, D; Thomas, P; El Moudni, A			Continuous and timed Petri nets for the macroscopic and microscopic traffic flow modelling	SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY			English	Article						continuous Petri nets; discrete Petri nets; macroscopic traffic modelling; microscopic traffic modelling; simulation	WAVES	Traffic flow can be considered as a hybrid system which is characterized by two major behaviours: continuous ones in motorways and discrete ones in road junctions. We propose a modelling approach based on Petri nets. For this purpose, places of Petri nets stand for the road sections and transitions describe the flow between two consecutive sections at intersections. Thanks an adaptive spatial discretization the proposed models are suitable to represent the traffic flow either from a macroscopic point of view where only global variables are observed or from a microscopic one where the individual trajectories of vehicles are discussed. The proposed models suggest a mathematical framework for the analysis and control design in urban and interurban networks. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The simulation results with this model show that there are several phase transitions in the traffic average density, velocity and flow for each lane under a periodic boundary condition. An unstable phase in the traffic average density and velocity for the upstream and downstream lanes of the bridge is shown in a range of initial traffic densities. The critical points of the phase transitions and the phenomenon of the unstable phase found in the simulation are also explained with the mean-field theory.

J	Wei, H; Lin, BL				Wei, H; Lin, BL			One-dimensional traffic cellular automaton model with considering the vehicle moving status	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						traffic flow; cellular automata; vehicle moving status; feedback rule	FLOW	Based on the single lane traffic cellular automaton(CA) model introduced by Nagel and Schreckenberg(called NS model) Xue Yu et al proposed an improved single lane traffic CA model by considering the relative motion of vehicles(called improved NS model) Several faults in the improved NS model using two examples is pointed out and also another single lane traffic CA model by introducing vehicle-moving-status variable and feedback rule is proposed. These methods help to prevent vehicle from moving backward and stopping hurry. Numerical simulations are carried out and the results indicate that the deceleration probability and traffic density have a heavy impact on the evolution process of traffic flow. Under the condition of high deceleration probability, there may happen local traffic jams even with low traffic density. And with a constant deceleration probability, the global free phases and jam phases will appear alternately as the traffic density increases to a certain level. The phenomenon is very similar to the propagation of wave. The traffic flow is higher in the new model than in the improved NS model. This proves that the stop status of the whole traffic flow has been improved.

Electrochemical sensors were used to measure CO concentrations at several locations along the two street canyons. Bi-directional traffic characteristics were measured in both streets using inductive detector loops of the Split, Cycle and Offset Optimisation Technique (SCOOT). The SCOOT data allowed comparison of free, unstable and congested traffic conditions with the spatial and temporal variability of CO concentrations in both streets. During free flow traffic conditions a significant linear relationship was found to exist between traffic flow and CO concentration in each street. The relationship fails during congested conditions, as the mean CO concentration was found to be more dependent on detector occupancy. In general, the highest mean CO concentrations occurred during high-occupancy conditions, indicating the likely influence of stop-start conditions and the accelerating driving mode that is associated with higher emission rates. By considering the measured above roof level wind direction, it was shown that during perpendicular winds, the leeward CO concentrations were a factor of at least two greater than on the windward side of the canyon. Overall, the greatest mean CO concentrations occurred during congested conditions with perpendicular above-roof level winds. The significance of the work for both emissions and dispersion modelling of traffic-related pollutants within urban areas is discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Based on this model, we propose a new cellular automata model for the railway traffic. The signaling system adopted in this work is the moving block signaling system. In our model, the distance between the following train and its leading train takes into account the velocity of the leading train. The simulation results demonstrate that our model is suitable for simulating the railway traffic. Compared our scheme to the traditional moving-space-block scheme, it is obvious that using our scheme, not only the line capacity can be increased, but also the traffic flow states are safer.

J	Peeta, S; Zhang, PC; Zhou, WM				Peeta, S; Zhang, PC; Zhou, WM			Behavior-based analysis of freeway car-truck interactions and related mitigation strategies	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						car-truck interactions; driver behavior; fuzzy logic; microscopic traffic flow modeling; agent-based simulation		Freight trucks are an important component of the nation's highway traffic. Due to their physical and operational characteristics, they can significantly impact traffic system performance, safety, and the travel experience of non-truck drivers. Methodological gaps exist in the literature on modeling car truck interactions that do not result in crashes, especially those resulting from non-truck driver behavior. This paper focuses on the modeling of the behavior of non-truck drivers in the vicinity of trucks to capture these interactions. This is done by quantifying a time-dependent "discomfort level" for every non-truck driver interacting with trucks in the ambient traffic stream. The driver socioeconomic characteristics and situational factors that affect this discomfort. are identified through a stated preference survey of non-truck drivers and a preliminary analysis of the survey data using a discrete choice model. A fuzzy logic based approach is proposed to determine the en-route time-dependent non-truck driver discomfort level. This is used in conjunction with the car-following and lane-changing logics of a traditional traffic flow model to generate a truck-following model and a modified lane-changing model in the vicinity of trucks. An agent-based freeway segment traffic flow simulator is constructed using the extended microscopic flow modeling logic. It provides a simulation-based framework to analyze alternative strategies to mitigate car-truck interactions. Experiments are conducted to analyze the sensitivity of the discomfort level to the causal variables, and evaluate the effectiveness of alternative mitigation strategies. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hegyi, A; De Schutter, B; Hellendoorn, H				Hegyi, A; De Schutter, B; Hellendoorn, H			Model predictive control for optimal coordination of ramp metering and variable speed limits	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						model predictive control; optimal control; ramp metering; variable speed limits; main-stream metering; coordinated traffic control	TRAFFIC FLOW	This paper discusses the optimal coordination of variable speed limits and ramp metering in a freeway traffic network, where the objective of the control is to minimize the total time that vehicles spend in the network. Coordinated freeway traffic control is a new development where the control problem is to find the combination of control measures that results in the best network performance. This problem is solved by model predictive control, where the macroscopic traffic flow model METANET is used as the prediction model. We extend this model with a model for dynamic speed limits and for main-stream origins. This approach results in a predictive coordinated control approach where variable speed limits can prevent a traffic breakdown and maintain a higher outflow even when ramp metering is unable to prevent congestion (e.g., because of an on-ramp queue constraint). The use of dynamic speed limits significantly reduces congestion and results in a lower total time spent. Since the primary effect of the speed limits is the limitation of the main-stream flow, a comparison is made with the case where the speed limits are replaced by main-stream metering. The resulting performances are comparable. Since the range of flows that main-stream metering and dynamic speed limits can control is different, the choice between the two should be primarily based on the traffic demands.

J	Vlahogianni, EI; Karlaftis, MG; Golias, JC				Vlahogianni, EI; Karlaftis, MG; Golias, JC			Optimized and meta-optimized neural networks for short-term traffic flow prediction: A genetic approach	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						traffic flow; multivariate time series; short-term predictions; neural networks; genetic optimization	MODELS; VOLUME	Short-term forecasting of traffic parameters such as flow and occupancy is an essential element of modern Intelligent Transportation Systems research and practice. Although many different methodologies have been used for short-term predictions, literature suggests neural networks as one of the best alternatives for modeling and predicting traffic parameters. However, because of limited knowledge regarding a network's optimal structure given a specific dataset, researchers have to rely on time consuming and questionably efficient rules-of-thumb when developing them. This paper extends past research by providing an advanced, genetic algorithm based, multilayered structural optimization strategy that can assist both in the proper representation of traffic flow data with temporal and spatial characteristics as well as in the selection of the appropriate neural network structure. Further, it evaluates the performance of the developed network by applying it to both univariate and multivariate traffic flow data from an urban signalized arterial. The results show that the capabilities of a simple static neural network, with genetically optimized step size, momentum and number of hidden units, are very satisfactory when modeling both univariate and multivariate traffic data.

We use the dynamic model which is an extended one of the optimal velocity model to take into account the lane changing. The fundamental (flow-density) diagram is presented. The fundamental diagram changes highly by introducing a bus on a two-lane roadway. It is found that there are the six distinct states for the two-lane traffic flow including a bus. The spatio-temporal patterns are presented for the distinct traffic states. The dynamical state of traffic changes with density of cars. It is shown that the dynamical transitions among the distinct traffic states occur at some values of density. The phase diagram (region map) is shown for the two-lane traffic flow including a bus.

J	Vanlaar, W				Vanlaar, W			Drink driving in Belgium: results from the third and improved roadside survey	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						drink driving; roadside survey; stratified two-stage cluster sample; multilevel modelling	MULTILEVEL MODELS	In 2003, the Belgian Road Safety Institute organised the third national roadside survey to estimate the proportion of drink drivers and their profile. The objective of this initiative is to gather data as a basis to formulate theory- and research-based recommendations to policymakers with the intention of decreasing the number of alcohol related accidents and victims on Belgian roads. Almost all Belgian police forces agreed to participate in a stratified two-stage cluster sample. First stage of the survey consisted of randomly selecting road sites (m=449) in each region using a Geographical Information System (Arcview). Second stage of the survey consisted of randomly stopping drivers of personal cars (n=12,891) during October and November 2003. All stopped drivers were asked by the police to perform an alcohol breath test. In addition, the police invited all sampled drivers to participate in a short questionnaire with individual variables (gender, age, etc.). Questionnaires with aggregated variables for road sites (traffic flow, intensity of stopping drivers, etc.) were also completed. The percentage of drivers who were found to have a blood alcohol concentration at or above the legal limit of 0.5 g/l during weekend nights (7.68%) is significantly higher than all other time spans. These percentages for the remaining time spans do not differ significantly (weekdays: 1.76%; weekday nights: 2.99%; weekend days: 2.98%). A multilevel logistic model for Belgium was successfully fitted. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, KP; Gao, ZY				Li, KP; Gao, ZY			Improvement of driving safety in road traffic system	CHINESE PHYSICS			English	Article						cellular automation model; traffic flow; driving safety	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; FLOW; FREEWAY; MODEL	A road traffic system is a complex system in which humans participate directly. In this system, human factors play a very important role. In this paper, a kind of control signal is designated at a given site (i.e., signal point) of the road. Under the effect of the control signal, the drivers will decrease their velocities when their vehicles pass the signal point. Our aim is to transit the traffic flow states from disorder to order, and then improve the traffic safety. We have tested this technique for the two-lane traffic model that is based on the deterministic Nagel-Schreckenberg (NaSch) traffic model. The simulation results indicate that the traffic flow states can be transited from disorder to order. Different order states can be observed in the system, and these states are safer.

To address this complex physical property, we develop a Riemann solver that derives the exact flux values at the interface of the Riemann problem. Based on this solver, we formulate Godunov-type numerical schemes to solve the traffic flow models. Numerical examples that simulate the traffic flow around a bottleneck that arises from a drop in traffic capacity on the highway section are given to illustrate the efficiency of these schemes.

J	Coelho, MC; Farias, TL; Rouphail, NM				Coelho, MC; Farias, TL; Rouphail, NM			A methodology for modelling and measuring traffic and emission performance of speed control traffic signals	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th International Symposium on Transport and Air Pollution	JUN 16-18, 2003	Avignon, FRANCE			modal emissions approach; numerical model; field measurements; speed violator; traffic delay; traffic calming; safety		In an attempt to control speeds and reduce crashes, traffic signals are being installed at several locations on highways to serve as speed reduction devices. One concern about this type of signals is that while they may be effective in reducing high speed crashes, they not only stop traffic that is exceeding the speed limit, but other traffic on the approach that is not. As a result, vehicle emissions are likely to increase, because of the existence of excessive delays, queue formation and speed change cycles for approaching traffic. An approach, based on experimental measurements and on modelling traffic and emission performance of speed control traffic signals, is presented here in order to explain the interaction between the signal control variables (for example minimum signal settings, speed threshold setting and minimum green call scenarios) and environmental and traffic: performance variables, in particular, carbon monoxide, nitric oxide and hydrocarbons emissions and delay. The experimental data for validation were gathered on Highway N6, connecting the cities of Lisbon and Cascais, in Portugal. The main conclusions of the present research are that, for traffic flow values corresponding to 50% of the road capacity estimate for a traffic signal approach, 85% of the speed violators are effectively stopped, while the fraction of vehicles unfairly stopped reaches 30%. Concerning emissions the presence of signals leads to an increase in CO emissions of about 15%, while NO and HC emissions increase by 10% and 40%, respectively. It was also concluded that the control of speed violators increases with traffic flow. As a trade-off, overall traffic delay will also increase as well as the number of vehicles that are unfairly stopped. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Akbas, A; Ergun, M				Akbas, A; Ergun, M			Dynamic traffic signal control using a nonlinear coupled oscillators approach	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						traffic control; control systems; nonlinear coupled oscillators; signal control	NETWORKS	Traditional signal control systems use prestored timing plans that have been developed offline using historic data. These systems are not responsive to dynamical demand changes of traffic and may deteriorate in performance over time. Dynamic traffic signal control systems can adapt to actual traffic conditions, coping with complex flow patterns and unpredictable variations. They seek continuous optimal system performance. The main goal of this paper is to design a methodology for control of arterial traffic flows. To fulfill this goal, the nonlinear coupled oscillators model is adapted to the traffic signal system of a two-way arterial road. The control methodology is based on measurements of the microscopic occupancy parameters for incoming flows at intersections that have a four-way geometrical structure with four-green splits. The desired signal parameters such as cycle times, green splits, and offsets are adjusted dynamically according to local traffic data. Thus, the desired signal patterns are self-organized through the mutual interactions among the signals. The numerical and case study simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the control methodology under the dynamical demand changes of traffic.

J	Jia, B; Jiang, R; Wu, QS; Hu, MB				Jia, B; Jiang, R; Wu, QS; Hu, MB			Honk effect in the two-lane cellular automaton model for traffic flow	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						honk effect; cellalar automata; traffic flow	TRANSITION; RULES	In real traffic, when a vehicle is hindered by its preceding vehicle and simultaneously it cannot change lane, it may honk the horn. As a result, the driver of the preceding vehicle may change lane to make way for it. However, this effect has seldom been investigated before. In this paper, we take this issue into account by proposing a new symmetric two-lane cellular automaton model. It is shown that the honk has almost no effect in the homogeneous traffic whereas it enhances the flux in the intermediate density regime for the heterogeneous traffic. We suggest that this is because the occurrence probability and the lifetime of the plug are suppressed due to the introduction of the honk. Finally, we argue that the honk behavior is not encouraged in the asymmetric two-lane model. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A kind of control signal that can be considered as a perturbation is designated at a given site (i.e., signal point) of the right lane. Under the effect of control signal, the velocity of vehicle passing the signal point will be disturbed. Our aim is to investigate the traffic dynamics that is about the dynamical transition from disorder to order. We test this technique for the two-lane traffic model that is based on the deterministic NaSch traffic model. The simulation results indicate that the traffic system can be transited from disorder to order. Different order states can be observed in system, such as fixed-point and periodic motion. and these states are safer. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Traffic flow data are in the form of spatial time series and are collected at specific locations at constant intervals of time. Important spatial characteristics of the space-time process are incorporated in the STARIMA model through the use of weighting matrices estimated on the basis of the distances among the various locations where data are collected. These matrices distinguish the space-time approach from the vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA) methodology and enable the model builders to control the number of the parameters that have to be estimated. The proposed models can be used for short-term forecasting of space-time stationary traffic-flow processes and for assessing the impact of traffic-flow changes on other parts of the network. The three-stage iterative space-time model building procedure is illustrated using 7.5 min average traffic flow data for a set of 25 loop-detectors located at roads that direct to the centre of the city of Athens, Greece. Data for two months with different traffic-flow characteristics are modelled in order to determine the stability of the parameter estimation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ioannou, PA; Stefanovic, M				Ioannou, PA; Stefanovic, M			Evaluation of ACC vehicles in mixed traffic: Lane change effects and sensitivity analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles; air pollution; fuel consumption; lane change; manually driven ("manual"); vehicles; mixed traffic; vehicle following		Almost every automobile company is producing vehicles with adaptive cruise control (ACC) system onboard that enables a vehicle to do automatic vehicle following in the longitudinal direction. The ACC system is designed for driver's comfort and safety and to operate with manually driven vehicles. These characteristics of ACC were found to have beneficial effects on the environment and traffic flow characteristics by acting as filters of a wide class of traffic disturbances. It has been argued that the smooth response of ACC vehicles to high-acceleration disturbances or large position errors creates large gaps between the ACC vehicle and the vehicle ahead inviting cut-ins and therefore generating additional disturbances that would not have been created if all vehicles had been manually driven. In this paper, we examine the effect of lane changes on the benefits suggested by Bose and Ioannou as well as the sensitivity of these benefits with respect to various variables such as the penetration of the ACC vehicles, level of traffic disturbances etc. We demonstrate, using theory, simulations, and experiments, that during lane changes, the smoothness of the ACC vehicle response attenuates the disturbances introduced by a cut-in or an exiting vehicle in a way that is beneficial to the environment when compared with similar situations where all vehicles are manually driven. We concluded that a higher number of possible cut-ins that may occur due to the larger gaps created during high-acceleration maneuvers by the vehicle in front of the ACC vehicle, will not annul the benefits obtained in the absence of such cut-ins when compared with the situation of similar maneuvers but with no cut-ins in the case of 100% manually driven vehicles.

These shock waves result in longer travel times and in sudden large variations in the speeds of the vehicles, which could lead to unsafe situations. Dynamic speed limits can be used to eliminate or at least to reduce the effects of shock waves. However, coordination of the variable speed limits is necessary in order to prevent the occurrence of new shock waves and/or a negative impact on the traffic flows in other locations. In this paper, we present a model predictive control approach to optimally coordinate variable speed limits for freeway traffic with the aim of suppressing shock waves. First, we optimize continuous valued speed limits, such that the total travel time is minimal. Next, we include a safety constraint that prevents drivers from encountering speed limit drops larger than, e.g., 10 km/h. Furthermore, to get a better correspondence between the computed and applied control signals, we also consider discrete speed limits. We illustrate our approach with a benchmark problem.

J	Bar-Gera, H				Bar-Gera, H			Continuous and discrete trajectory models for dynamic traffic assignment	NETWORKS & SPATIAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						dynamic traffic assignment; network-loading; continuous trajectory models; trajectory discretization	VARIATIONAL INEQUALITY FORMULATION; CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; USER OPTIMAL ASSIGNMENT; KINEMATIC WAVES	A continuous trajectory model is presented in which transportation networks are represented as topological constructs. The general formulation enhances existing analytic dynamic traffic assignment models by incorporating continuous single-link traffic flow model,; in a general, coherent, and relatively intuitive manner. Specific exact formulation based on a simplified kinematic wave traffic flow model with physical queues is presented as well. A discrete trajectory model is proposed as an approximation of the continuous model. The discrete model provides wide flexibility in choosing the level of aggregation with respect to time intervals, ranging from several hours, as typical in current practice of long-term travel forecasting models, to one second or less, as in microscopic simulations. An algorithm to find discrete approximate solutions is presented as well as accuracy measures to evaluate them. The effect of time resolution on model performance is examined by a numerical example.

J	Zhang, HM; Nie, XJ				Zhang, HM; Nie, XJ			Some consistency conditions for dynamic traffic assignment problems	NETWORKS & SPATIAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						dynamic traffic assignment; link traffic flow models; FIFO; consistency conditions	VARIATIONAL INEQUALITY FORMULATION; USER EQUILIBRIUM PROBLEM; CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; NETWORK LOADING PROBLEM; ROAD NETWORKS	This paper explores some critical issues in modeling network traffic How for predictive user optimal dynamic traffic assignment. They include the role of FIFO (first-in-first-out) in link, path and network traffic dynamics, minimal set representation of link traffic evolution, and consistency conditions for link models. It is found that (1) link FIFO plays a central role in modeling link, path and network traffic flow evolution, and (2) the dimension of a minimal state set that adequately describes link traffic flow under FIFO is two. Moreover, two sufficient FIFO conditions are provided. and pitfalls in using these conditions to enforce FIFO are pointed out. Finally, ramifications of these findings to DTA modeling are also discussed.

J	Mahnke, R; Kaupuzs, J; Lubashevsky, I				Mahnke, R; Kaupuzs, J; Lubashevsky, I			Probabilistic description of traffic flow	PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Review						stochastic processes; transportation; master equation; cluster formation; traffic breakdown; nucleation; phase transition	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; PARTICLE-HOPPING MODELS; ASYMMETRIC EXCLUSION PROCESS; NAGEL-SCHRECKENBERG MODEL; INDUCED PHASE-TRANSITIONS; SELF-ORGANIZATION; MASTER-EQUATION; EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES; JAMMING TRANSITION; DISTANCE-HEADWAYS	A stochastic description of traffic flow, called probabilistic traffic flow theory, is developed. The general master equation is applied to relatively simple models to describe the formation and dissolution of traffic congestions. Our approach is mainly based on spatially homogeneous systems like periodically closed circular rings without on- and off-ramps. We consider a stochastic one-step process of growth or shrinkage of a car cluster (jam). As generalization we discuss the coexistence of several car clusters of different sizes. The basic problem is to find a physically motivated ansatz for the transition rates of the attachment and detachment of individual cars to a car cluster consistent with the empirical observations in real traffic. The emphasis is put on the analogy with first-order phase transitions and nucleation phenomena in physical systems like supersaturated vapour. The results are summarized in the flux-density relation, the so-called fundamental diagram of traffic flow, and compared with empirical data. Different regimes of traffic flow are discussed: free flow, congested mode as stop-and-go regime, and heavy viscous traffic. The traffic breakdown is studied based on the master equation as well as the Fokker-Planck approximation to calculate mean first passage times or escape rates. Generalizations are developed to allow for on-ramp effects. The calculated flux-density relation and characteristic breakdown times coincide with empirical data measured on highways. Finally, a brief summary of the stochastic cellular automata approach is given. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V..

J	Potoglou, D; Kanaroglou, PS				Potoglou, D; Kanaroglou, PS			Carbon monoxide emissions from passenger vehicles: predictive mapping with an application to Hamilton, Canada	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						urban air quality; integrated urban models; universal kriging; carbon monoxide	AIR-POLLUTION; URBAN; MANAGEMENT; QUALITY; SYSTEM	Integrated urban models are designed to simulate land-use and transportation interactions and to allow predicts of traffic volume and vehicle emissions at the link level of the urban transport network. As such, these models can address the weakness of existing systems. The Integrated Model of Urban LAnd-use and Transportation for Environmental analysis is an operational urban model calibrated for the Census Metropolitan Area of Hamilton. This paper extends this model to include air pollution estimation and mapping of vehicle air pollutants, employing a dispersion model and spatial data analysis. The approach provides an integrated framework for impact assessment of land-use and transport policies on traffic flows, emissions, and pollutant concentration, enabling the evaluation of population exposure to traffic related pollution. The study illustrates how vehicle-generated carbon monoxide concentration can be estimated and mapped using the proposed approach under a base-case scenario for the 2006. Several development and transportation scenaria can be developed and 'hot-spots' of traffic-originated air pollution can be identified and visualized within a Geographic Information System framework.

The concept is first introduced into the original Nagel-Schreckenberg model, which is called the non-sensitive driving cellular automaton model. And then it is incorporated with a sensitive driving NaSch model, in which the randomization brake is arranged before the deterministic deceleration. A parameter related to the variable security gap is determined through simulation. Comparison of the simulation results indicates that the variable security gap has different influence on the two models. The fundamental diagram obtained by simulation with the modified sensitive driving NaSch model shows that the maximum How are in good agreement with the observed data, indicating that the presented model is more reasonable and realistic.

The model is composed of a GIS-based traffic microsimulation part coupled with an emission model, and a beamtrace-based 2.5D propagation part, which takes into account multiple reflections and diffractions. The model can be used to analyze the influence of real urban traffic situations (e.g., traffic flow management, road saturation) in the usual equivalent sound level maps. However. it also allows to calculate and visualize statistical noise levels and indicators derived from them.

Traditionally these effects are calculated using conservative codified deterministic loading models. While this conservatism is relatively insignificant in design, it may be critical in assessment. Advances in weigh-in-motion (WIM) technology, i.e., the process of weighing trucks travelling at full highway speeds, have increased the availability of accurate and unbiased site-specific traffic records. Assessments performed using WIM data are generally accepted as less conservative than those performed using generalized codified loading models. This paper briefly describes traffic simulation using WIM statistics. The implications of the accuracy of the recorded data and the duration of recording and of the sensitivity of the extreme to the method of prediction are investigated. Traffic evolution with time is also explored. The conclusions are of interest to engineers performing assessment of existing bridges.

The most widely known process from this class is a cellular automaton that acquired number 184 in the classification of S. Wolfram. This CA 184 is being intensively used to model vehicular traffic. However, our results are mainly derived with help of another process that offers a helpful insight into the studied dynamics, it is a so-called Ballistic Annihilation Model ( abbreviated by BA). BA is a model for chemical reaction A+ B --> inert. In BA, A and B-type particles move in opposite directions with velocities 1 and - 1, respectively, and annihilate upon collisions. Certain results concerning BA and CA 184 are also formulated in terms of another process known as a Model of Surface Growth (SG, for short); the surface shape in this process behaves as the integrated pro. le of particle distribution in CA 184. Our results are as follows. First, we characterize the invariant measures of the dynamics in interest. The bulk of our effort is devoted to the characterization of those of them that are not translation invariant; we call them phase separating invariant measures. In the case of BA, such measures are concentrated on the configurations consisting of two converging infinite blocks of ( not necessarily adjacent) particles. In the case of CA 184, a phase separating measure describes the transition from free traffic phase to jammed phase. We also analyze domains of attraction of invariant measures and rates of convergence to them. This analysis then allows us to express the long time limit of particle current in CA 184 as a function of certain characteristics of its initial distribution, when it is translation invariant. This expression has been used in a companion paper ( V. Belitsky, J. Krug, E. J. Neves and G. Schutz, A cellular automaton model for two-lane traffic, J. Stat. phys. 103(5/6): 945 - 971 (2001)) to show the enhancement of cars' current caused by the possibility of lane changes in a model of traffic on a two-lane highway that was created by putting two CA 184' s in parallel. Our other results concern hydrodynamic limits of BA and CA 184. We prove that if the integrated pro. le of initial particle configuration of BA or CA 184 converges, as n --> infinity, to some stochastic process W(x), x is an element of R, when being re-scaled by n(-1) along x-axis and by c(n)(-1) along y-axis for some sequence c(n), then the integrated pro. le of particle configuration at time n under the same re-scaling, will converge, as time --> infinity, to the local moving minimum of the process W(.), that is, to the process W-min( .) defined by W-min( x) := min{W( y) : x- 1 less than or equal to y less than or equal to x+ 1}. This hydrodynamic limit is then interpreted in terms of the limiting shape of surface in SG.

J	Ben-Edigbe, J; Ferguson, N				Ben-Edigbe, J; Ferguson, N			Extent of capacity loss resulting from pavement distress	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-TRANSPORT			English	Article						traffic engineering/transport management		The subject of this paper is the extent of pavement distress impact on traffic capacity of uninterrupted road link sections. A capacity estimation method based on extrapolation from a fundamental diagram representing the relationship between traffic flow and density was used. This method assumes that density is a result of speed and flow on sections of the road link at capacity, and hence is not directly affected by road surface distress. This implies that the capacity shifts are entirely the result of speed changes. In a 'without and with' distress study at selected sites in Nigeria, the impact of road surface distress was estimated for one direction of the road link section. Capacities of the road section were estimated for three sections ('without distress', 'transition' and 'with distress') of the road link and it was found that capacities on 'without distress' and 'with distress' sections differed significantly. The paper concludes that a significant decrease in capacity of about 30% was found, and is attributable to road pavement distress.

J	Wang, YB; Papageorgiou, M				Wang, YB; Papageorgiou, M			Real-time freeway traffic state estimation based on extended Kalman filter: a general approach	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						freeway; traffic state estimation; stochastic macroscopic traffic flow model; extended Kalman filter; model parameter estimation	IDENTIFICATION; FLOW	A general approach to the real-time estimation of the complete traffic state in freeway stretches is developed based on the extended Kalman filter. First, a general stochastic macroscopic traffic flow model of freeway stretches is presented, while some simple formulae are proposed to model real-time traffic measurements. Second, the macroscopic traffic flow model along with the measurement model is organized in a compact state-space form, based on which a traffic state estimator is designed by use of the extended-Kalman-filtering method. While constructing the traffic state estimator, special attention is paid to the handling of the boundary conditions and unknown parameters of the macroscopic traffic flow model. A number of simulations are conducted to test the designed traffic state estimator under various traffic situations in a freeway stretch with on/off-ramps and a long inter-detector distance. Some key issues are carefully investigated, including tracking capability of the traffic state estimator, comparison of various estimation schemes, evaluation of different detector configurations, significance of the on-line model parameter estimation, sensitivity of the traffic state estimator to the initial values of the estimated model parameters and to the related standard deviation values, and dynamic tracking of time-varying model parameters. The achieved simulation results are very promising for the subsequent development and testing work that is briefly outlined. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ceylan, H; Bell, MGH				Ceylan, H; Bell, MGH			Genetic algorithm solution for the stochastic equilibrium transportation networks under congestion	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						genetic algorithm; Bi-level programming; mutually consistent; stochastic user equilibrium	CONTROLLED ROAD NETWORK; TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT; SIGNAL TIMINGS; OPTIMIZATION	A bi-level and mutually consistent (MC) programming techniques have previously been proposed, in which an area traffic control problem (ATC) is dealt with as upper-level problem whilst the users' equilibrium traffic assignment is dealt with as lower-level problem. In this study, genetic algorithm (GA) approach has been proposed to solve upper-level problem for a signalized road network under congestion. Stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) traffic assignment is applied at the lower-level. At the upper-level, GA provides a feasible set of signal timings within specified lower and upper bounds on signal timing variables and feeds into lower-level problem. The SUE assignment is solved by way of Path Flow Estimator (PFE) and TRANSYT traffic model is applied at upper-level to obtain network performance index (PI) and hence fitness index. Network performance index is defined as the sum of a weighted linear combination of delay and number of stops per unit time under various levels of traffic loads. For this purpose, the genetic optimizer, referred to as GATRANSPFE, combines the TRANSYT model, used to estimate performance, with the PFE logit assignment tool, used to predict traffic reassignment, is developed. The GATRANSPFE that can solve the ATC and SUE traffic assignment problem has been applied to the signalized road networks under congestion. The effectiveness of the GATRANSPFE over the MC method has been investigated in terms of good values of network performance index and convergence. Comparisons of the performance index resulting from the GATRANSPFE and that of mutually consistent TRANSYT-optimal signal settings and SUE traffic flows are made. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In this type of models, based on methods from statistical physics, vehicles follow a reduced set of rules that can be applied in parallel. This allows simulation of large traffic networks with a reasonable computational effort. A cellular automata model is applied to a single-lane highway with a ring topology. Simulation results show the ability of this modeling paradigm to capture the most important features of the traffic flow phenomena. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However that is not the case in the hospitals with older architectural design, where clean and dirty pathways flow through a single corridor systems. The most common solution which enables separation of clean and dirty pathways in such systems is introduction of time allocation for dirty and clean items transportation. Currently such schedules are fixed and do not allow quick changes in case of specific events. We propose a solution to the problem using multi-agent based system able to quickly adapt the schedule of transports.

Fifteen bottleneck activations were identified and their reproducible features were described. Bottlenecks became active in the vicinity of on-ramps and off-ramps and once a bottleneck became active, its queue discharge flow was reproducible across multiple activations and across multiple days. The analysis tools used in this study were transformed curves of cumulative vehicle count and cumulative time-mean velocity. These cumulative curves provided the resolution necessary to reveal the spatial and temporal aspects of dynamic freeway traffic flow phenomena. With increasing availability of reliable freeway sensor data, it is important to continue the systematic empirical analysis of freeways in different countries with varying geometric configurations. The results of this research will assist with all aspects of traffic flow modeling, operations and control.

These features are (1) avoiding off-line model calibration; (2) adaptation to changing environmental conditions; (3) enabling incident alarms. The reported testing results are quite satisfactory and promising for future applications of the estimator.

This paper investigates the determination of historical traffic patterns by means of Ward's hierarchical clustering procedure. Days were clustered before and after a pre-classification into working days and non-working days, using two different definitions of a daily traffic profile. The results of the clustering after pre-classification are clearly better than before classification. Moreover, working days are easier to classify into distinctive, recurrent traffic patterns than non-working days. Finally, clustering on the basis of 15 minutes traffic flows resulted in a better classification of working days than the two-step clustering that used the total daily traffic flow, peak flows, peak times and ratios. The clustering on the basis of 15 minutes traffic flows resulted in a classification into five clusters that show distinct daily flow profiles and are representative for the days within the clusters. The day of the week and vacation periods are determinative for the cluster a working day is classified to.

However, the main problem is how to reproduce realistic patterns of traffic flow at both macroscopic and microscopic levels with restricted computational resources. In this paper, we present a multi-agent framework of single-lane traffic simulation. We focus on the driver-vehicle agents, which is the most important ones in the framework. The three-layer architecture of driver-vehicle agents is proposed, the decision tree of tactical longitudinal movement is put forward, and the simplified formulas of acceleration and deceleration rate are derived. With parallel update mode of agent states, a one-dimension traffic simulation model is developed. To validate it at the macroscopic level, we reproduced the realistic flow-density and speed-density relation of traffic flow with periodic boundary condition. To validate it at the microscopic level, a platoon of 10 vehicles was simulated. Given four kinds of typical speed profiles of the leader, each follower can follow its leader safely and stably. The result shows that this model can reproduce realistic macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of single-lane traffic flow.

This paper shows the results of user needs assessment and traffic safety modelling of VisionSense. User needs were determined by means of a web-based survey. The results show, that VisionSense is most appreciated when it uses a light signal to warn the driver in a possibly hazardous situation on a highway. The willingness to pay is estimated at 300 Euros. Another conclusion based on the survey is that frequent car users want less assistance than less frequent drivers. Besides the user needs the impact on traffic safety is modelled. The results are indicative and more research has to be done. Traffic safety effects of VisionSense on a highway were modelled by means of a microscopic car following and lane change algorithm. Twelve different traffic scenarios were modelled with and without VisionSense. With VisionSense no traffic conflicts occur due to lane changing and less lane changes are performed. VisionSense is a system that can improve traffic safety in the future.

In the upper-level microscopic car traffic flow simulator, a prototype driver model and vehicle dynamics model are developed with flexibility in the upgrading process. For realistic human factor measurement experiments, our driving simulator is equipped with a frame-structured flexible cut-body cabin, 360 degrees-field-of-view omni directional projection type visual display system, a steering wheel with an AC servo motor, 6.1ch surround audio system and 6 DOF motion system with turning table. Some measurement experiments are made on a highway with a real car, aimed at driving simulator validation. Understanding of individual driver's behavior on this platform will contribute to design of safe and comfortable driving environments.

Many models and methods have been presented in the past. But most of them regard the transportation system as the linear system and using the linear theory to predict the traffic flow. In fact, transportation system is a nonlinear system and traffic flow data exhibits chaotic properties. In this paper, we try to use the chaos theory to forecast the traffic flow in a shorterm.Usually there is noise in the collected data which will decease the forecasting precision. So we denoise the data using wavelet transform before forecasting in this paper. The experiment is performed for inductance loop data collected in five minutes interval from the viaduct of Yan'an road in Shanghai in China. And at last our study concludes that techniques based on phase space reconstruction can be used to predict the traffic flow in a short-term. Furthermore, the prediction result is accurate and reliable.

Occlusion of moving objects by stationary or other moving foreground objects always causes tracking errors. This paper presents a novel module for vehicle tracking under the condition of occlusion, which can be conveniently added to the existing video surveillance systems as a complementary part. The appearance information of the object (shape and texture) is combined with the spatial-temporal Markov Random Field (MRF) based tracking model through a kind of special structuring elements in Mathematical Morphology (MM) theory. As a result, the sites in MRF are reduced, which saves computational cost greatly, and the assumption on the vehicle shape model in prior is not needed. Experiments on various kinds of image sequences show that the proposed module can effectively track vehicles with severe occlusion.

It is a main measure to control traffic noise by installing noise barriers. Based on the investigation of characteristics of current barrier design methods and the road noise prediction model, an optimal design method of noise barrier used in reducing noise emission from traffic flow is presented in this paper. In the designs of road noise barrier and elevated urban expressway noise barrier, the availability of the new method in reducing the noise and improving the economic solution is proved through the comparison between the current methods and the optimal design method. The main reasons for the practical noise reduction less than theoretic value is illuminated, the effects of design parameters on cost for noise barrier and noise reduction characteristic is discussed, and its results are instructive to the selection of the design parameters and shape of barrier.

We construct a system to handle the measurement of assignmentability and develop a model whose variables cannot be computed precisely. Based on graph theory and traffic flow theory, the relationship of three local parameters, the degree of saturation, the number of routes between the origin-destination pairs and the connectivity with assignmentability of network is considered. Although certain factors that affect assignmentability can be quantified by experts, their functional relationship to assignmentability is not so clear. In this paper, a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation framework is proposed to assess the assignmentability of traffic networks.

Traffic managers generally use a heuristic approach for incident analysis based on their experience of similar scenarios, which reduces the overall effectiveness of the subsequent incident management and rescue operations. This paper proposes an incident impact forecasting decision support system named as 'FIAS'- Freeway Incident Analysis System. The novel idea presented in this paper is the use of historical, real time and spatial data simultaneously to forecast post-incident traffic flows on a microscopic simulation platform, Cellular Automata.

It influences the stability of traffic flow, and is the important influential factor of road capacity and security. Aiming at the uncertainty of the lane utilization ratio and the difficulty to collect the field data under different volumes, in this paper, the research is carried out with microscopic traffic simulation model of car-following and lane-changing to study the basic rules of the lane utilization ratio/lane-changing times and the lane utilization ratio/traffic volume of the road section with two carriageways or three carriageways.

For the above-mentioned aim, the further research to the traffic flow characteristics must be carried on under the traffic incident condition. Because it is difficult to collect the data of the traffic flow and repeat the incident condition, the purpose of this paper is to study the time change rule of each traffic flow parameter which is in different positions before and after the incident, by using the computer simulation and the microscopic simulation model of the traffic flow such as the car-producing model, the car-following model and the lane-changing model, under the integrated simulation environment.

Analysis of dominant types of the road transport means, identification their driving regimes and traffic flow modelling methods show the correlation of air pollution and traffic flow levels. Adapted mesoscopic traffic flow modelling method for vehicle emission prediction allows medium detail representation of the transport means' classes disaggregating main macroscopic traffic characteristics determining congestions duration (main attribute of traffic flow discontinuity), traffic regimes. Compilation of the enumerated methods and analysis of the simulation results show advantages and disadvantages of these modelling methods.

If a driver on a highway decelerates suddenly or progresses abnormally slowly (thereby posing a hazard to the vehicles behind him), then, with such a system, all the cars behind him are provided information of this, near simultaneously. This advance information gives the drivers additional time to react, in anticipation of an impending slow-down, and this helps to alleviate collisions. Furthermore, it is seen that even if only a fraction of the cars in a platoon are equipped with such a system, this can still be sufficient to alleviate crashes even in the unequipped cars. This partial equipage also has the ability to considerably weaken the shock waves that would otherwise have occurred, if all cars were unequipped.

Most of the research has focused on determining the relationship between crashes and highway traffic volumes, while little attention has been focused on the relationships of vehicle density, level of service (LOS), vehicle occupancy, V/C ratio and speed distribution. Despite overall progress, there is still no clear understanding about the effects of different traffic flow characteristics on safety. In fact, several studies reviewed in this work were found to have methodological limitations. These include using predictive models with a normal error structure, aggregated crash rates, and inadequate functional forms for the data at hand. The original research on which this paper is based is aimed to determine the statistical relationship using commonly applied predictive models (i.e., functional forms) between crashes and hourly traffic flow characteristics, such as traffic volume, vehicle density and V/C ratios, for rural and urban freeway segments respectively. To accomplish this objective, predictive models have been developed from data collected on freeway segments located in downtown and outside of Montreal, Quebec. Three different functional forms are evaluated. The results show that predictive models that use traffic volume as the only explanatory variable may not adequately characterize the accident process on freeway segments. Functional forms that incorporate density and V/C ratio offer a richer description of crashes occurring on these facilities, whether they are located in a rural or urban environment. Finally, separate predictive models for single- and multi-vehicle crashes should be developed rather than one common model for all crash types. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Due to practical limitations, traffic flow records may be partially missing or substantially contaminated by noise. In this paper, a robust traffic flow predictor, termed random subspace predictor, is developed integrating the entire spatial and temporal information in a transportation network to cope with this case. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the random subspace predictor.

Two stages are involved. First, get the freeway traffic flow model based on the RBF neural networks and use the model to obtain the output prediction. The residuals will be gotten from the comparison between the actual and prediction. Second, use a SOFM neural networks to classify the residuals to detect the incident. Because the SOFM has the character of topological ordering, the winning neuron's running trajectory on SOFM neuron array corresponds to the actual traffic state on freeway. We can observe the trajectory to detect the incident and achieve the visual traffic incident detection.

Unlike existing methods, our approach incorporates all the spatial and temporal information available in a transportation network to carry our traffic flow forecasting of the current site. The Pearson correlation coefficient is adopted to rank the input variables (traffic flows) for prediction, and the best-first strategy is employed to select a subset as the cause nodes of a Bayesian network. Given the derived cause nodes and the corresponding effect node in the spatio-temporal Bayesian network, a Gaussian Mixture Model is applied to describe the statistical relationship between the input and output. Finally, traffic flow forecasting is performed under the criterion of Minimum Mean Square Error (M.M.S.E.). Experimental results with the urban vehicular flow data of Beijing demonstrate the effectiveness of our presented spatio-temporal Bayesian network predictor.

J	Beevers, SD; Carslaw, DC				Beevers, SD; Carslaw, DC			The impact of congestion charging on vehicle emissions in London	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						environment and transport planning; road user pricing; climate change; traffic emissions; traffic congestion	TRANSPORT POLICY; PRIMARY NO2; ENVIRONMENT; SINGAPORE	The London congestion charging scheme (CCS) was successfully implemented in February 2003 and has measurably reduced traffic flows in central London. The air pollution impact of the scheme has been difficult to assess, using ambient measurements alone as the air pollution concentrations in 2003 were higher than in 2002 because of unusual meteorological conditions. However, a comprehensive analysis of the impact using detailed traffic data. combined with the Environmental Research Group's road traffic emissions model, has identified a number of important results. First. between 2002 and 2003, total NOX emissions in the charging zone have reduced by -12.0% +/- 12% (2sigma) and have increased on the inner ring road (IRR) by + 1.5%. PM10 emissions have reduced by -11.9% in the charging zone and by -1.4% on the IRR. There is a significant reduction in the emissions of NOX and PM10 associated with increases in vehicle speed and that this is as important in reducing emissions as changes in vehicle numbers. There is also evidence that the speed changes in km h(-1) are uniform across the whole range of average speed and therefore change, at the slower speeds have a disproportionate effect on vehicle emissions. Second. that changes in vehicle km. as a result of the scheme, are large (-15% +/- 4% (2sigma)) particularly in the charging zone itself. To meet the demand to travel into central London there has been increased bus use. However, the expected increase in emissions from buses have been mostly, offset by the widespread introduction of particle traps to the new and existing bus fleet as well as the introduction of newer technology bus engines. Finally, there is a reduction in emissions of CO (-19.5%) but that unlike NOX and PM10 little additional benefit is apparent through new vehicle technology. The evidence presented shows that the congestion charging schemes could assist in attaining both the UK government's targets on air pollution as well as those relating to climate change and other international obligations.

The results of comparative analysis show that estimated yellow times obtained from the model proposed in this paper are much different from actual yellow times obtained from the field. Actual yellow times are considerably shorter than the estimated yellow time. These results would be very significant for signalized intersection networks in terms of improving traffic safety and traffic signal operation. A method for improving yellow time of left-turning movement by Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is presented.

The model is built on fine grid cellular automata (CA), and is able to simulate actual traffic flow. Several important novel features are employed in our model. Firstly, the average car-following headway (=distance /velocity) 1.5 seconds has been observed in local urban networks and this 1.5-second rule is built to our model. Secondly, vehicle movement on urban streets is simulated, based on the assumption of velocity following a Gaussian (normal) distribution and is calibrated by field data. Thirdly, driver behaviour is modelled, using a truncated Gaussian distribution. Finally, the limited priority mechanism is involved in this paper. The model has been validated against real data for its several components.

The analysis focuses on the reproduction of empirically observed results and the relations between empirical results and vehicle plugs. Vehicle plug is a structured vehicle set which slows down the traffic flow and it is also a bridge from microscopic to macroscopic level. Simulation results show that encouraging lane changes have little effect on decomposing vehicle plugs. In order to decrease plugs we should keep slow vehicles out of expressway or make a flexible overtaking ban of slow vehicle according to practical situations.

The proposed model is built on fine grid Cellular Automata (CA), so it is able to simulate actual traffic flow more realistically. Several important novel features are employed in our model. Firstly, 1.5-second rule is used for the headway (=distance/speed) in car-following process. Secondly, vehicles movement on urban streets are simulated based on the assumption of speed changes following a Gaussian (normal) distribution and is calibrated with the field data. Thirdly, driver behavior is modeled by using a truncated Gaussian distribution. Numerical results show that our method is feasible and valid.

This algorithm has the potential to provide local monitoring of traffic sensors. Our approach is based on macroscopic traffic flow models, and more precisely on the flow-density relationship. Once this relation is extracted from real traffic data, an admissible region is defined in the flow-density space. Then, the classification properties of neural networks are used to design the monitoring network, which detects and isolates the incidents that disturb the traffic, when the measured data are out of the admissible region. A hierarchical scheme to deal with incidents in large-scale networks is developed as well. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Integrated operational strategies were developed on the basis of the two commonly used diamond interchange phasing schemes: the basic three-phase scheme and the Texas Transportation Institute four-phase scheme. The key elements of the integration system and its operations include a proposed enhanced detection system and an operational algorithm. Through implementation of special signal timings at the diamond interchange, the traffic flows feeding the ramp meters can be effectively controlled and thus minimize ramp queues and the resulting need to flush the queues, which would possibly lead to freeway breakdown. The operational strategies were evaluated with VISSIM microscopic simulation under three general traffic demand scenarios-low, medium, and high-as characterized by the volume-to-capacity ratios at the metered ramps. The results of the evaluation indicated that the integrated operations were most effective under a medium traffic demand scenario in preventing or delaying the onset of ramp metering queue flush, thereby reducing freeway breakdown and system delays.

Several urban and extraurban roads during the night or tunnels are characterized by low illumination, light spots, shadows, light reflections, etc. The main objectives of the proposed system are: (a) to monitor the traffic flow, (b) to estimate the vehicle's speed or determine the state of the traffic, (c) to detect anomalous situations, e.g. rising alarms in case of road accidents or stopped cars. Experimental results on real image sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.

A lane-based network overcomes the limitations by maintaining lanes as independent topological objects and thus supports data management, decision making, and network analysis at the lane level. The data model for a lane-based network uses a directed graph approach in which a set of unidirectional lanes and nodes is used to model traffic flow connectivity. The model manages the continuous lateral connectivity between parallel lanes by specifying the relative lateral position of the lanes on their parent roadways. This approach provides an efficient way to maintain lane topology and eliminates the requirement of turntables. This paper presents the model along with guidelines for lane-based inventory management and strategies for discretizing continuous lateral connectivity between parallel lanes to enable the use of existing routing algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's). Finally, the paper presents a practical implementation built on the linear location referencing system of a state department of transportation.

For windward conditions, the data verified the form C alpha U-m and for leeward situations, C alpha (aU(2) + bV(2))(-1/2) (a is a function of street geometry, b depends on the characteristics of the vehicles and traffic density, V is the average vehicle speed). We obtained empirical expressions for b, for C/C-0 (C-0 is the concentration 'without' the influence of the TPT) and for a critical wind speed (U-C) (which does aU(C)(2) = bV(2)). The ratio C/C-0 is 0.71 when U=U-C, not depending on the traffic flow.

J	Abdel-Aty, M; Pande, A				Abdel-Aty, M; Pande, A			Identifying crash propensity using specific traffic speed conditions	JOURNAL OF SAFETY RESEARCH			English	Article						freeway crashes; loop detectors; crash prediction; probabilistic neural networks; traffic speed		Introduction: In spite of recent advances in traffic surveillance technology and ever-growing concern over traffic safety, there have been very few research efforts establishing links between real-time traffic flow parameters and crash occurrence. This study aims at identifying patterns in the freeway loop detector data that potentially precede traffic crashes. Method: The proposed solution essentially involves classification of traffic speed patterns emerging from the loop detector data. Historical crash and loop detector data from the Interstate-4 corridor in the Orlando metropolitan area were used for this study. Traffic speed data from sensors embedded in the pavement (i.e., loop detector stations) to measure characteristics of the traffic flow were collected for both crash and non-crash conditions. Bayesian classifier based methodology, probabilistic neural network (PNN), was then used to classify these data as belonging to either crashes or non-crashes. PNN is a neural network implementation of well-known Bayesian-Parzen classifier. With its superb mathematical credentials, the PNN trains much faster than multilayer feed forward networks. The inputs to final classification model, selected from various candidate models, were logarithms of the coefficient of variation in speed obtained from three stations, namely, station of the crash (i.e., station nearest to the crash location) and two stations immediately preceding it in the upstream direction (measured in 5 minute time slices of 10-15 minutes prior to the crash time). Results: The results showed that at least 70% of the crashes on the evaluation dataset could be identified using the classifiers developed in this paper.

General Purpose Road Traffic Simulation System with a Cell Automaton Model	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA			Road traffic flow; Cellular automaton; System simulation		For several years, we have been developing a general purpose road-traffic simulation system to analyze road traffic jam. This paper describes the concept of the system using the running line model, and a case study for general purpose simulation with cell aotpmaton model. In order to simulate congestion of road traffic system, it is indispensable to describe vehicles having their own decision-making capabilities, and to have detailed and exact road condition data on the road system. The road system is composed of such roads as streets, avenues and highways, and their intersections. In this study, we represent it by a network in which roads are arcs and intersections are nodes. The road-network itself has two kinds of attributes; the physical attributes and the logical attributes. The former are ones of the roads themselves such as their varying widths, shapes, slopes, running lines of traffic lanes and their channels. The latter are ones which depends traffic regulations such as signals and traffic signs. The former is called road information and the latter is road traffic regulation information in the road-network. Almost all road traffic simulations using a microscopic model have been carried out through a locally fixed road-network information database system. However, these systems are not effective. A general-purpose road traffic database system is therefore desired to analyze traffic jams in all areas. Because such a general-purpose system is very voluminous, speedy input of road network attributes should be taken into consideration, and the addition of some effective error-correcting method. We propose a new concept whereby the running lines on the various shapes of the road can be represented approximately by a combination of lines, circles and clothoid curves allowing speedy calculation. We developed a general-purpose database system to describe road information except for the road traffic regulation information. It is important to draw quickly and easily any running lines on the road of the database system. On the other hand, several studies have been done to realize road traffic simulation by a microscopic model. For example, there is a flattery model of a vehicle by a fuzzy theory and various theories such as a neural network work. A model could do movement every one vehicle in detail by using these methods, and high simulation of precision was enabled. However, these models are very complicated, and simulation practice processing time becomes long. Therefore, as a method we simplify a complicated phenomenon as much as possible, and to express, simulation by a cell automaton attracts attention. A cell automaton assigns one individual to one cell basically and moves a cell in consideration of being affected by the individual which each individual is next to. Modeling for simulation is clear and becomes simple a generous thing called a cell follows a specific rule, and to move. It may be thought that an error grows big when we cut off a small error. However, you should have you just think like the middle of a micro-model and a macro-model. We can realize total movement in form to be almost reality to some extent by doing simulation of a rough model. A cell automaton is applied in a wide field by such a characteristic. By this study, we changed passing and a traffic lane of it more, and parking vehicle evasion wrestled for realization of the run model that became important by a town area run. We introduce a model general idea to call "a temporary lane" for these run models. And these modeling, we can realize simulation to be almost reality. Because we did systems construction by these theories and the inspection by this thesis, we introduce about it.

The methods encountered in the literature focus on the levels of traffic flows and assume that variance is constant through time. The approach adopted in this paper concentrates primarily on the autoregressive properties of traffic variability, with the aim to provide better confidence intervals for traffic flow forecasts. The model-building procedure is illustrated with 7.5-min average traffic How data for a set of 11 loop detectors located at major arterials that direct to the center of the city of Athens, Greece. A sensitivity analysis for coefficient estimates is undertaken with respect to both time and space.

This paper addresses the effects of uniform (constant, fixed) and time-varying (step) tolls on the travel behavior of users on the road network. The problem of determining optimal prices in a dynamic traffic network is considered by applying second-best tolling scenarios imposing tolls only to a subset of links on the network and considering elastic demand. The optimal toll design problem is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem with the road authority (on the upper level) setting the tolls and the travelers (on the lower level) who respond by changing their travel decisions (route and departure time choice). To formulate the optimal toll design problem, the so-called mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) formulation was used, considering the dynamic nature of traffic flows on the one hand and dynamic pricing on the other. Until now, the MPEC formulation has been applied in static cases only. The model structure comprises three interrelated levels: (a) dynamic network loading, (b) route choice and departure time choice, and (c) road pricing level. For solving the optimal toll design problem in dynamic networks, a simple search algorithm is used to determine the optimal toll pattern leading to optimization of the objective function of the road authority subject to dynamic traffic assignment constraints. Nevertheless, uniform and time-varying pricing is analyzed, and a small hypothetical network is considered.

Furthermore, it is characterized by large differences in driving behaviors between user classes and network types. The latter are caused by the interaction between user classes, the interplay between control measures, and the interaction between different parts of the networks. This complexity requires a model-based approach for achieving better understanding of the complicated process at hand and for the subsequent efficient control of these processes, for example, by applying model-based optimal controls. However, the contemporary macroscopic traffic flow models for urban networks are deficient in that they fail to deal adequately with heterogeneous traffic on multilane links. The aim of this paper is to devise a much more elaborate macroscopic traffic flow model, focusing on urban networks, to be able to cope with the complex control task and its application. The model proposed here is then implemented in the urban part of a computer-based network model, HELENA.

This paper begins to show that the road-pricing scheme is equivalent to a problem that determines optimal Lagrangian multipliers for a user equilibrium traffic assignment problem with link capacity constraints. It then proceeds to devise a novel trial-and-error procedure requiring observed traffic flows at the entry links only, to identify a solution for the road-pricing scheme when link travel time functions, origin-destination demand functions, and users' value of travel time are unknown. The procedure is as follows. A trial on a set of given tolls is conducted, and then the resultant link flows are observed. According to these observed traffic flows, a new set of tolls for the next trial is adjusted by executing a simple projection operation. The trial-and-error procedure is, in fact, a variation of a gradient projection method for dual formulation of the traffic assignment problem, and its convergence can be guaranteed under mild conditions. Accordingly, a conjecture for the convergence of trial-and-error implementation of the congestion pricing proposed by economists is rigorously proved. Furthermore, the iterative procedure presented in this paper in practice can facilitate the estimation of such tolls by land transport authorities.

J	Ang, KK; Quek, C				Ang, KK; Quek, C			RSPOP: Rough set-based pseudo outer-product fuzzy rule identification algorithm	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK; FEATURE-SELECTION; TAKAGI-SUGENO; INFERENCE; SYSTEMS; INTERPRETABILITY; CONTROLLERS; GENERATION; MCMAC	System modeling with neuro-fuzzy systems involves two contradictory requirements: interpretability verses accuracy. The pseudo outer-product (POP) rule identification algorithm used in the family of pseudo outer-product-based fuzzy neural networks (POPFNN) suffered from an exponential increase in the number of identified fuzzy rules and computational complexity arising from high-dimensional data. This decreases the interpretability of the POPFNN in linguistic fuzzy modeling. This article proposes a novel rough set-based pseudo outer-product (RSPOP) algorithm that integrates the sound concept of knowledge reduction from rough set theory with the POP algorithm. The proposed algorithm not only performs feature selection through the reduction of attributes but also extends the reduction to rules without redundant attributes. As many possible reducts exist in a given rule set, an objective measure is developed for POPFNN to correctly identify the reducts that improve the inferred consequence. Experimental results are presented using published data sets and real-world application involving highway traffic flow prediction to evaluate the effectiveness of using the proposed algorithm to identify fuzzy rules in the POPFNN using compositional rule of inference and singleton fuzzifier (POPFNN-CRI(S)) architecture. Results showed that the proposed rough set-based pseudo outer-product algorithm reduces computational complexity, improves the interpretability of neuro-fuzzy systems by identifying significantly fewer fuzzy rules, and improves the accuracy of the POPFNN.

Accordingly a new numerical flux and a new limiter for the Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin method are considered, which are compared with a natural but simple extension.

How the length of this section and the traffic regulations influence the traffic behaviors has seldom been investigated. In this paper, we study this issue using the cellular automata traffic flow model. We find that (i) the permission of lane changing from main road to the accelerating lane will deteriorate the capacity of the road, hence it should be forbidden; (ii) when lane changing from main road to accelerating lane is forbidden, the introduction of an accelerating lane can improve the capacity of the on-ramp system.

Through analyzing the discrete-time model of traffic flow, both the state equation and the error,vector caused by model simplification are developed. By means of transformation of time-update estimation error covariance matrix, an upper-bounded error covariance matrix inequity is obtained and the prediction estimation algorithm is build up. To get high numerical stability and computational efficiency modified weighted, Gram-Schmidt orthogonal U-D factorization method is used. Results of simulation and actual application show that the new method can be efficiently used to estimation and prediction of highway traffic flows.

In this paper, two constant differential equation models are presented separately while inflow pattern is known. Which is based on the velocity/density relation function given by Greenshields and the modified velocity/density relation function presented by Jakyakrishnan and Tsai. Considering the analytical solution of above constant differential equations cannot be acquired, its numerical solution is obtained by Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg algorithm. We also get the link travel time function basing upon the inflow and outflow patterns. The numerical simulation indicates that the outflow patterns, which are obtained respectively by the two outflow models, are almost approach the real traffic flow status according the traffic survey. However, the link travel time, which comes from the outflow model, which is based on modified velocity/density relation function, is more approach the real travel time.

Fuzzy c-means clustering model was developed for mining traffic flow-speed-occupancy relationships, then to extrapolate traffic information. The hybrid grey-based recurrent neural network (G-RNN) was developed for traffic parameter forecasting. G-RNN integrates grey modeling into recurrent neural networks that is capable of dealing with both randomness and spatial-temporal properties in trajfic data implicitly. Field data from Taiwan national freeway was used as an example for testing the proposed models. Study results were shown that the G-RNN model is capable of predicting traffic parameters with a high degree of accuracy. The application presents three clusters built from data and recognized three types of traffic conditions. Study results also showed feasibility of the method for advanced traffic information systems.

Firstly, a discrete-time model that describes the evolution of queue length will be given. Secondly, we show that, by regarding the flow entry of vehicles as the energy stored in the system, the dissipativity concept can be applied. As a result, we derive a feedback control law which renders our system dissipative, i.e. it dissipates the flow of vehicles in the intersection. Finally, an example is worked out.

Consequently, in the latest decade, a growing body of advances concerning several aspects of this transportation mode has appeared in the operation research literature. At the best of our knowledge Stochastic Petri Nets (SPN) have not been yet used for the graphical description, the analysis of flows and the dynamic control of the ground holding problem. Due to the characteristics of the air transportation systems, this paper shows that the Controlled Stochastic Petri Net (CSPN) model of such a system is very efficient. Indeed, the presented CSPN model aims at minimizing simultaneously the airborne and the ground delays, taking into consideration the probabilistic nature of the air traffic. As it is shown, this mathematical tool is very interesting for the real-time scheduling of the plane landing or flight at the airport. The CSPN model of an elementary landing system is described and defined and this paper shows that it has interesting properties. It illustrates the interest of such a tool with a numerical application in which it analyses the optimal solution.

Assessment and prediction of benzene concentrations in a street canyon using various models	Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology, Vol A - Oral Presentations, Pts A and B	Proceedings of the International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology	SEP 01-03, 2005	Rhodes Isl, GREECE	Global Network Environm Sci & Technol, Univ Aegean, Dept Environm Studies		benzene; modeling; artificial neural networks; street canyon	AIR-QUALITY	Urban air quality nowadays is one of the major environmental issues, due to its impact to various health problems, caused by the daily exposure of the population in air pollutants, especially the reactive ones. The highest levels of air pollutants are usually observed in street canyons, emitted by urban traffic. Therefore, the necessity of modeling techniques to estimate the levels of atmospheric pollution is unexceptionable. Also the accuracy of the predictions and the quickness of the calculations, are significant factors to adopt a modeling technique. In the present study, we used benzene as an indicator of traffic pollution. Two different modeling techniques, an artificial neural network (ANN) and a semi empirical deterministic model (DET) are used, to predict benzene concentrations in a street. The ANN was based on a training procedure using measurements collected in a specific street canyon (benzene concentrations, traffic density, vehicle's type distribution). The DET model was based on road traffic emission rate, wind speed and direction, and the geometrical characteristics of the road. The DET and ANN models were validated and their response to "what if" scenarios was examined. Although both models produced very good results, given the limited amount of data available, the ANN succeeded slightly better than DET in predicting benzene concentrations. On the contrary, ANN presents lower response in predicting the effect of significant changes in traffic flow patterns on benzene concentrations. The results from the simulations indicate that the ANN is a promising technique for benzene modeling in an urban environment, while DET seems to be ideal for environmental management purposes.

Modelling the urban road traffic noise of Thessaloniki	Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology, Vol A - Oral Presentations, Pts A and B	Proceedings of the International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology	SEP 01-03, 2005	Rhodes Isl, GREECE	Global Network Environm Sci & Technol, Univ Aegean, Dept Environm Studies		road traffic noise; urban noise; traffic composition; traffic volume		The noise pollution in cities is a continuously developing problem [1]. The effect of street dimensions, traffic density and composition on the noise level in urban canyons has been investigated. A series of noise measurements, were made in "canyon" streets in Thessaloniki. The main purpose of the measurements was to examine the correlation between urban road traffic noise, traffic volume, traffic composition and source - receiver distance. Urban road traffic noise monitoring has been carried out in thirty-seven different sites, representative of different urban configurations, where sound levels were measured and at the same time, the number and the type of the passing vehicles were taken. Measurements have been performed for fifteen minutes, taking into account the vacancy for the correlated hourly L-Aeq,L-h levels. Part of research constituted the relation of each category of vehicles; light, heavy and motorised two-wheeled vehicle, with the level of urban road traffic noise. We created the optimally connected mathematical expression which determines the degree of influence of each vehicle category to attribute the best cross-correlation with the measured urban road traffic noise levels. They were developed four models using linear regression analysis taking into account the most important road traffic noise factors: traffic volume, traffic composition and the source - receiver distance. The traffic composition had been classified by three categories. The survey has showed that the noise levels in urban traffic noise evaluation, e.g. the hourly equivalent noise level L-Aeq,L-h, can be estimated by knowing the traffic composition with reasonably better precision than by making use of the traffic flow. It is also given the possibility to compare the results of the regression analysis for developed models. Also it was mathematically approved that the number of motorised two - wheeled vehicles influences substantially the configuration of the final noise level, but not as much as the heavy vehicles.

The Continuous Flow Intersection has proven in facilitating left turn movement and decreasing congestion at a a major intersection. In this study, the CFI intersection application is proposed to improve traffic flow at the major signalized intersection of Gude Drive and Frederick Road (MD 335) in Maryland, United States. The main element of the CFI intersection is the removal of the main left-turn movement out of the intersection. This is accomplished by adding a signal-controlled, mid-block intersection on the approach approximately 300 feet from the actual main intersection, where a left turn can be a capacity-draining movement. At this mid-block intersection, left turn traffic enters a left turn bay and then crosses an oncoming traffic during a protected phase that coincides with the green phase of the cross-street traffic at the main intersection. VISSIM micro-simulation modeling is used to evaluate and compare traffic operational performance of the proposed CFI intersection with the existing conventional intersection. Fixed time sinal control is used to operate the proposed CFI intersection in the VISSIM models. In addition, this paper also describes the current traffic conditions, signal phasing and timing technique used to operate the proposed CFI intersection, and VISSIM modelin process including model calibrations and validations. The result from VISSIM shows that le overall delay and queue lengths of the proposed CFI intersection measured during the peak PM hour decreases from those of conventional intersection significantly by 64% and 61%, respectively. The primary objective of this study is to measure the effectiveness of the proposed CFI intersection located in Maryland to ensure that this unconventional intersection application helps reduce congestion and improve traffic flow at this intersection.

It is however difficult to obtain the actual data concerning this, and hence this study tries to analyze fundamental properties of traffic flow situation caused by road pricing, using simulation analysis based on models constructed by an experimental questionnaire survey for route choice behavior. It is found that it would be recommendable to raise the toll level with the increase in the percentage of high penalty driver for minimizing the average travel time on the entire road network.

Methodologically, we provide a better understanding of the relationship between highway capacity and its number of lanes upon the statistical analysis of the survey. We employ the variance analysis of single factor for modeling the effect of the number of lanes on capacity. The findings show that average capacity per lane decreases with increasing number of lanes on uninterrupted highway segments. The analysis is based on an extensive field survey of traffic flow in Beijing. The implication of the marginal decrease of lane capacity requires that the manuals of highway capacity should be revised for the better plan and design of road network. In addition, the factor of marginal decrease should be incorporated into the decision on adding lanes or constructing a new parallel road when travel demand exceeds road capacity.

Motorcycles share to its two main cities, i.e. Hanoi and Hochiminh, is 90% of the total traffic while bus accounted for just 6%. There is a growing concern that unless policy measures are implemented, the traffic problem would deteriorate. This study assesses the traffic situation in Hochiminh city using image processing technique and traffic simulation. Result shows that the high number of motorcycles in the network interfere other vehicles which reduces their average speed drastically. Application of measures such as increasing the share of public transport would improve the traffic speed as much as 10%. These results highlight the necessity to produce efficient public transportation that could provide alternative to motorcycles.

Each of them may have different price elasticity for toll. Therefore, observed traffic flows must be carefully dissolved into several types of traffics, and price elasticity must be captured. In order to grasp the response of urban road traffics to price change, disaggregate behavioral model have been considered as an effective analytical tool. But in case of heterogeneous intercity traffics, survey on sampled individuals is very difficult to design and consumes much time and money. Fortunately in Japan, automatically detected traffic data have been gathered at many points along expressways and highways. This research is intended to analyze the cross-sectional traffic count of Honshu-Shikoku bridges. Specifically, influence of the fare change (10% discount in July 2003) is clarified by using the methods such as factor analysis and Vector Auto-Regression.

The ATIS observers is provided with the information, such as, traffic counts of roads implemented by the sensor of traffic flow and both the location and movement of vehicle recorded by ATIS. The inputs of the estimation are the traffic counts on part of roads and the information of the vehicle movement recorded by ATIS. The output is the Origin-Destination (OD) matrix estimated by the use of GLS method. The initial sample sub-OD matrix from the vehicle with ATIS is estimated first and further the link choice proportion is obtained. Hence, the estimate of OD matrix is extracted from the partial information of the sub-OD matrix and the means of population information of traffic counts by using a statistical model. Its implementation is demonstrated by a numerical example.

Therefore, we propose a web based visualization of the current and future traffic load of the autobahn network of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. This novel traffic information system named autobahn.NRW is based on an efficient and highly realistic traffic flow model, which is fed by traffic data from 4,500 detecting devices across the road network every minute. The way entries and lane-blocks are integrated is completely new. We use the three-phases-approach which has a higher degree of realism then ordinary approaches. The results of the traffic simulation are published by a graphical user interface which can be accessed at http://www.autobahn.nrw.de.

Firstly the space of high dimensional input samples is divided into two lower dimensional subspaces by classifying coefficient module of the model. Then a fuzzy cluster algorithm is used to determine centers of Radial-Basis Function and the parameters of two RBF NN are derived from training stage with subspace samples respectively. Therefore it not only simplifies the structure of NN, but also enhances the training speed and the mapping accuracy. The simulation results showed the effectiveness of the model.

More precisely, we consider a single conservation law, deduced from the conservation of the number of cars, defined on a road network that is a collection of roads with junctions. The evolution problem is underdetermined at junctions; hence we choose to have some fixed rules for the distribution of traffic plus optimization criteria for the flux. We prove existence of solutions to the Cauchy problem and we show that the Lipschitz continuous dependence by initial data does not hold in general, but it does hold under special assumptions. Our method is based on a wave front tracking approach [A. Bressan, Hyperbolic Systems of Conservation Laws. The One-dimensional Cauchy Problem, Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK, 2000] and works also for boundary data and time-dependent coefficients of traffic distribution at junctions, including traffic lights.

Utilizing the association between the wavelet coefficients and traffic flow, the condition of traffic flow can be extracted directly from the approximate coefficients and detail coefficients of wavelet decomposition from traffic flow parameters. Using data obtained from the simulation under the condition of incident and non-incident, parameters of the algorithm are calibrated and an off-line test is made. According to results of the test compared with California algorithm, low-pass algorithm and MLF algorithm, the algorithm performs better than the other algorithms in traffic incident detection.

We simulate the such city traffic and analyze it. It should be important to research the relation between traffic signals and drivers' strategies. Then, we. prepare two CML(coupled map lattice) models to treat complex traffic system with varying their characteristics, and research the effects of traffic signals. Each model has different strategies to avoid collision between vehicles. The one is the "Mixture Model" strategy which changes vehicles' running dynamics when their gaps have gotten narrow, and the other is the "Tracking Model" strategy which decelerate vehicles' goal velocities to follow previous one when their gaps have gotten narrow. We compare these CML models on a oneway traffic lane under the aperiodic boundary condition. "The transition point, of the jam" which separates between "free flow phase" and "congestion phase" is observed. In free flow phase, major differences are not confirmed between these models. But, when it gets congested, each model takes on dissimilar complex features stem from difference of strategies. Additionally, we research effect of signal control parameters in free flow phase. We observed that whole performance is improved as cycle length is getting shorter, at that time offset can't be very effective. When cycle length is long, whole performance is not very lower if offset is proper.

Crash prediction models that use real-time traffic flow variables measured through a series of loop detectors are the most important component of such systems. A previous crash prediction model was developed with the matched case-control logistic regression technique. Although the model achieved reasonable classification accuracy, it remained open to improvement because of the limited study area, sample size, and transferability issues. Therefore, the previous work had been extended. Multivehicle freeway crashes under high- and low-speed traffic conditions were found to differ in severity and in their mechanism. The distribution of 5-min average speeds obtained immediately before the crash from the loop detector station closest to the crash shows two approximate mound-shaped distributions. This distribution is used as the basis to separate the models for crashes occurring under the two speed conditions. The results show that, as expected, variables that entered in the final models (for crashes under high and low speeds) were not the same. However, they were found to be consistent with the probable mechanisms of crashes under the respective speed conditions.

This highway presents free flow in standard days; but in the returning day of long weekends or holidays it exhibits congested flow and in rush hours jamming appears. We illustrate how our CA model for traffic flow can deal appropriately with transient situations and can be used to search new alternatives that allow to improve the traffic flow in Mexican highways.

First, vibration measurements data are analyzed to make clear the vibration transmission from viaduct to ground for a test run of a heavy truck and the normal traffic flow. The wave propagation is investigated at the site. Second, in order to develop the vibration mitigation, deriving the equivalent driving forces on the foundation, we conducted the parametric substructure analyses when the WIB measure is introduced. The validation is made from the measurement data. The significant mitigation effect by WIB is proved.

Nevertheless, it is well known that the introduction of such roundabouts to replace congested crossings often leads to quite smooth-flowing traffic. On the other hand, the impact of roundabout on traffic emissions is scarcely presumed. In this paper we propose an evaluation, by means of traffic models and vehicle emission models, of the progresses achievable by switching from traffic lightcontrolled crossings to roundabouts. The improvement, in terms of air quality, is estimated in relation to the characteristics of traffic flow, road capacity and regulation. Significant variations have been quantified with dependence on these parameters. In the first step of our study, national regulations and technical literature about roundabouts have been analyzed to point out fundamental characteristics and the limits of their application. A simple model has been developed in order to automatically compute the parameters modified by varying the input set. The model consists of two sub-models: the first one models a road network and the related traffic flows. The second model estimates traffic emissions. As a case study, the model has been applied to a sample road network consisting of four roundabouts and ten branches. By means of the model, the idling time at every single intersection has been quantified with respect to the different values of traffic flow. This calculation has been executed for both the traffic-light scenario and the roundabout scenario. For the estimation of total emissions, we selected proper traffic emission factors. We have mostly used European Copert factors while EPA instructions were useful to evaluate emissions of vehicles queuing at stops. Data for the traffic disaggregation have been provided by ACI, the Italian Automobile Club. The investigated pollutants, for this study, are Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) and Particulate Matter (PM). As expected, waiting times at crossings significantly decreased, in roundabout scenarios, leading to significant pollution abatement. Peak reductions were found for CO with abatements above 50% in rush hours.								*ANPA, 2000, AG NAZ PROT AMB EM A; BERTA C, 2000, FATTORI EMISSIONI DI; CAPOBIANCO M, 2002, VALUTAZIONE FATTORI; EMEP/CORINAIR, 2002, EM INV GUID; *EPA, 1998, EM FACTS IDL VEH EM; GIOVANNI D, 1999, PROGETTO INTERSEZION; *TRRANSP RES BOARD, 2002, HIGHW CAP MAN HCM; UMBERTO C, 2003, TEORIA DEFLUSSO INTE	8	0	0	0	3	WIT PRESS	SOUTHAMPTON	ASHURST LODGE, SOUTHAMPTON SO40 7AA, ASHURST, ENGLAND	1743-3541		1-84564-051-9	WIT TRANS ECOL ENVIR	WIT Trans.

However, the Gipps' framework separates lane-changing from car-following, and neglects driver's intentions. To overcome these weaknesses, a vehicle moving model based on finite state machine (FSM) is proposed in this paper. There are five states in the FSM, and we focus on the lane-changing, 0 behavior. We analyze the condition of intention generation of mandatory and discretionary lane changing, and derive the critical lead gap and follow gap to ensure collision avoidance. Based on the proposed model, a multi-lane traffic simulator is developed. With this simulator, we reproduce the realistic flow-density and lane changing rate-density relation with periodical boundary condition. The results show that the proposed model can regenerate the realistic characteristics of multi-lane traffic flow.

The image sensors are set for microscopic detection via the direction of vehicles, and for every lane at specified perception range. Two cases study has been carried out to analyze the method. We try to solve the problem of signal control system for the FAST system and complex intersection. Using image sensor for (i) control traffic flow in FAST system, (h) manage the control system in complicated intersection, is highly proposed.

When active, these bottlenecks cause queues that can stretch for several miles and reduce flow on other parts of the network. Bottlenecks are often thought to arise over short distances and are usually modeled as if they occur at discrete points since the resulting queues are thought to be much longer then the bottleneck region. This paper presents evidence that the delay causing phenomena may actually occur over extended distances. Some of which may occur downstream of the apparent bottleneck where drivers are accelerating away from the queue, while related phenomena are observed in the queue, over a mile upstream of the apparent bottleneck. It is shown that lane change maneuvers are responsible for some of the losses, reducing travel speed and consuming capacity when vehicles enter a given lane. These losses in one lane are not fully balanced by gains in other lanes.

Not only do we start from classical car-following rules (like the kind that are used in microscopic simulators), the model also explicitly accounts for the finite reaction times of drivers, anticipation behaviour, anisotropy in driver responses and the finite space requirement of drivers in the stream. Moreover we allow variations in driver psychology, which lets drivers adopt different 'driving styles' dependent on traffic conditions, like the presence of a merging zone. We illustrate the potential of such model by simulating a busy highway with an on-ramp. Plausible assumptions about driver psychology allow us to reproduce the so-called 'capacity funnel', i.e. the onset of congestion typically occurs some distance downstream of the merge area.

Meanwhile, the simulation is capable to deal with realistic scenarios such as large cities and is used for these purposes within the institute's projects. The idea was to support the traffic research community with a common platform to test new' ideas and models without the need to reimplement a framework that handles road data, vehicle routes, traffic light steering etc. To achieve this goal, the simulation code is available as open source. Within this publication, we would like to demonstrate how most attributes of traffic flow can be simulated. This should be mainly interesting for educational purposes.

For a simulation of the Schrodinger equation as well as for analytical computations it is useful that waves of traffic which travel along a road are not reflected at the boundaries of the simulated region. We present the nonreflecting boundary condition for a corresponding one-dimensional Schrodinger equation, and show simulation results for a wave package of traffic moving towards such a boundary.

As is well known, a source term in the equation for the vehicular density may represent entries or exits. When a second conservation laws is present, suitable source terms may describe various inhomogeneities of the road, such as ascents, descents or fog banks. In each of these cases, we provide an analytical framework. Finally, numerical experiments show specific phenomena that may not be reproduced by purely conservative models.

This allows them to build large trail systems which in many respects are similar to human-build highway networks. Using a stochastic cellular automaton model we discuss the basic properties of the traffic flow on existing trails. Surprisingly it is found that in certain regimes the average speed of the ants can vary non-monotonically with their density. This is in sharp contrast to highway traffic. The observations can be understood by the formation of loose clusters, i.e. space regions of enhanced, but not maximal, density. We also discuss the effect of counterflow on the trails.

The model proposes three different driving states: nonalert, alert, and close following. Under the different driving states, drivers apply different reaction times and accelerations. This paper presents the formulation and algorithmic implementation of the model. The theoretical analysis of the macroscopic flow-density relationships of the model is discussed. Simulation experiments were conducted, and the results are examined at both the macroscopic level (speed breakdown and traffic hysteresis) and the microscopic level (gap distribution and shock wave propagation). The results show that the model is able to capture realistically the speed drop, traffic hysteresis, and shock wave propagation as well as close-following behavior. Further studies of the sensitivities of key model parameters suggest that the drivers' reaction times have a significant effect on the modeled capacity and occupancy, while the effect of the speed threshold that distinguishes congested from noncongested traffic flow is less significant.

The difficulties of microscopic-level simulation models in the accurate reproduction of real traffic phenomena stem not only from the complexity of calibration and validation operations but also from the structural inadequacies of the submodels themselves. Both of these drawbacks originate from the scant information available on real phenomena because of the difficulty with the gathering of accurate field data. In this study, the use of kinematic differential Global Positioning System instruments allowed the trajectories of four vehicles in a platoon to be accurately monitored under real traffic conditions on both urban and extraurban roads. Some of these data were used to analyze the behaviors of four microscopic traffic flow models that differed greatly in both approach and complexity. The effect of the choice of performance measures on the model calibration results was first investigated, and intervehicle spacing was shown to be the most reliable measure. Model calibrations showed results similar to those obtained in other studies that used test track data. Instead, validations resulted in higher deviations compared with those from previous studies (with peaks in cross validations between urban and extraurban experiments). This confirms the need for real traffic data. On comparison of the models, all models showed similar performances (i.e., similar deviations in validation). Surprisingly, however, the simplest model performed on average better than the others, but the most complex one was the most robust, never reaching particularly high deviations.

For that reason it is important to have access to efficient tools for evaluation of the performance of such roads. For other road types, e.g., freeways and urban street networks, a wealth of microsimulation models is available. However, only a few models dedicated to rural roads have been developed. None of these models handles traffic flows interrupted by intersections or roundabouts, nor are the models capable of describing the traffic flow on rural roads with a cable barrier between oncoming lanes. These are major drawbacks when Swedish roads, on which cable barriers and roundabouts are becoming increasingly important, are modeled. Moreover, as new areas of application for rural road simulation arise, a flexible and detailed model is needed. Such applications include, among other things, simulation of driver assistance systems and estimation of pollutant emissions. This paper introduces a versatile traffic microsimulation model for the rural roads of today and of the future. The model system presented, the Rural Traffic Simulator (RuTSim), is capable of handling all common types of rural roads, including the effects of roundabouts and intersections on the traffic on the main road. The purpose of the paper is to describe the simulation approach and the traffic modeling used in RuTSim. A verification of the RuTSim model is also included. RuTSim is found to produce outputs representative of all common types of rural roads in Sweden.

The contribution of this paper is to compare some of these models by calibrating and validating them with data from double loop detectors on a multilane freeway. To simplify this task, the models were tested by simplifying the multilane reality to a simulation of only a single lane. The results show that by simulating the multilane road with single-lane models, calibration errors (Theil's U-value, or the root mean square error) of 14% to 16% were obtained. A validation of the models, which was done by taking the calibrated parameters of one data set to reproduce the other data sets, gives additional errors of about 0.5 to 2.5 percentage points. This is in good agreement with other calibration and validation approaches performed recently.

It predicts the vehicular flows on the transportation network by assigning travel demands given in terms of an origin-destination trip table to routes in a network according to some behavioral route choice rules. In this paper, we enhance the realism of the traffic assignment procedure by incorporating traffic restraint and random perception. Specifically, various traffic flow restrictions and traffic control policies are explicitly modeled as side constraints, and a C-logit model is adopted to account for traveler's perception error in the traffic assignment procedure. Models and algorithm for the C-logit stochastic user equilibrium problem with side constraints are presented. The validity and some properties of the models and algorithm are demonstrated with a simple network.

In our previous sequential experimental approach, the optimal link tolls are obtained, without resorting to both analytical travel cost and demand functions. In each trial, two steps are involved, prediction and correction, based on the observed link flows associated with a given link toll pattern. One key assumption made in the study is that the observed link flows are exactly in a deterministic equilibrium. This assumption is of course questionable in real applications, given the fact that travelers need sufficient time to learn and adjust their trip-making decisions in a new pricing environment. In this study, the exact prediction-correction method is modified to a partially inexact trial method, whose convergence is established theoretically. Numerical experiment shows that the partially inexact trial method is even more cost efficient in terns of the overall convergence rate. The extension thus obviates the requirement for observation of exact deterministic traffic equilibrium after each price experiment and makes the sequential experimental approach more robust in real applications.

A case study in the Dublin city centre with serious congestion is performed to test the effectiveness of the forecasting strategy. The results show that the forecasts at junctions only deviate around 10% from the original observations, and seem to indicate that the proposed forecasting strategy is one of the effective approaches to predict the real-time traffic flow level in a congested network, at the junctions where no continuous data collection takes place.

DEIVATION OF CONTINUUM TRAFFIC MODEL FOR WEAVING SECTIONS ON FREEWAYS	TRANSPORTATION AND THE ECONOMY			English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference of Hong-Kong-Society-for-Transportation-Studies	DEC 10, 2005	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	Hong Kong Soc Transportat Studies, Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Struct Engn		gas-kinetic model; macroscopic model; gap-acceptance model; weavings		This paper presents a new continuum model describing the dynamics of multiclass traffic flow on multilane freeways including weaving sections. In this paper, we consider a specific freeway weaving type, which is formed when an on ramp is near to an off ramp and these two ramps are joined by an auxiliary lane. Traffic interactions in this weaving zone are very complex due to the involvement of weaving flows and non-weaving flows in the so-called mandatory lane-changing process. To handle this complexity, it is essential to have a good understanding of the (microscopic) driving behavior within the weaving zones. These behaviors are modeled based on a gap-acceptance model. The methodology to obtain a weaving continuum traffic model is thus twofold. On the one hand, we develop a (macroscopic) model to determine the mandatory lane-changing probability based on a renewal process. On the other hand, we implement the lane-changing model into a current gas-kinetic traffic flow model for heterogeneous traffic flow on multilane roadways. From this, corresponding macroscopic model is obtained based on the method of moments.

J	Hau, TD				Hau, Timothy D.			Economic fundamentals of road pricing: A diagrammatic analysis, Part I - Fundamentals	TRANSPORTMETRICA			English	Article						transportation economics; road pricing; congestion charging; congestion tolling; highway.; investment; diagrammatic analysis	COST-BENEFIT-ANALYSIS; DISCRETE CHOICE; SOCIAL COST; CONGESTION; INVESTMENTS; TRANSPORTATION; WELFARE; CHARGES	Parts I and II together presents a conceptual framework for road pricing based on a rigorous diagrammatic - but non-mathematical - framework derived from first (economic) principles. It throws light on congestion pricing systems and issues surrounding short-run and long-run marginal cost pricing, scale economies and diseconomies, indivisibilities, road durability, the peak-load problem in urban transport and the financial viability of the public provision of road services. The paper integrates the ideas of Mohring, Strotz, Vickrey, Walters, Keeler, Small, Winston and Newbery into a single analytical framework. Analysis of the traditional road pricing arguments demonstrates why congestion pricing as practiced in the past has understandably encountered obstacles to implementation. This is partly because both types of road users, the tolled and the tolled off (those who avoid a road in order to shun the toll), are shown to be worse off - with the exception of the government - under a constant value of time. Even if differences in time valuation are taken into account, it is still essentially the case that primarily those with very high time values are made better off. Unless congestion toll revenues are earmarked and travellers perceive that the money is channeled back in the form of reduced taxes, lower user charges or improved transport services, neither the priced nor the priced off would support road pricing. It is only in the case of hypercongestion can congestion pricing be shown to make everyone better off. In the absence of scale economies or diseconomies, the level of economic profits, i.e., toll revenue collections less the fixed and non-use related costs of a road, serves as a surrogate market mechanism indicating that a road ought to be expanded or downsized. The decision to let roads deteriorate over time in and of itself is an act of disinvestment. Further, it is shown graphically that if a road authority were to efficiently charge for congestion, it is possible to make money on the road. Profitable roads arise in urban areas in the long run because land rents are high and congestion tolls reflect the high opportunity costs. Yet, efficient pricing in the presence of both indivisibilities and diseconomies of scale in urban roads may curtail the extent of profitable undertakings, whereas pursuing marginal cost pricing under the restrictive conditions of both indivisibilities and scale economies in rural roads could result in profits in the short run. Economic efficiency would be enhanced if optimal pricing were pursued in the short run and optimal investment in capacity were pursued in the long run. The rule is therefore to implement short-run marginal cost pricing while varying road capacity over the long run. Extensions by Newbery, Small and Winston have enriched the basic Mohring model that this paper develops diagrammatically by incorporating the fact that heavy vehicles are responsible for extensive road damages. Charging for both the external and variable cost of road damages on a vehicle weight per axle basis can help cover the deficit that may arise from congestion tolling. Even if a road network is broadly characterized by increasing returns to scale in road construction's use and strengthening, the deficit could be closed by diseconomies of scope. The existence of scope diseconomies in highways means that a road network that accommodates both loading and traffic volume, as found universally, costs more than the sum of an autos-only and a (smaller) trucks-only road system. Hence, the surplus associated with diseconomies of scope offsets the potential loss associated with scale-specific economies. The viability of a dedicated road or transport fund is enhanced by the fact that the road pavement is charged in two dimensions: once when traffic flow creates congestion and another when traffic loadings cause road damages.

The cities today face the problems of traffic efficiency and free flow of their streets, air pollution from exhaust gases, and also of losing their visual identity in terms of form. The aim of the research is to establish a rational traffic flow, adequate infrastructure, a continuous development of urban matrix and creation of visual identity. The methodology is based on the research of urban matrix development continuity from genesis time up to now, on logics of their transformation as well as on the research of some theoretical and practical street matrix models and the possibilities to apply them in concrete cities on the basis of predetermined historical codes. Traffic efficiency and infrastructure are the most important preconditions for sustainable development of the cities [1]. On the other hand, continuity of a street matrix development is important for several reasons. Methods of radical intervention on street matrix in terms of denying a street as a main constituent are mostly discarded as reconstruction methods [2]. Denial of historical and cultural values of a street as well as architecture framing is also very rarely applied in today's practice. A modem approach to urban restoration of the cities and postulates of sustainable development are therefore basic guidelines in creation of theoretical models and their application in concrete examples.

Several hypothetical traffic scenarios that require a large proportion of vehicles to merge and/or change lanes are constructed. These scenarios are then implemented in each model and simulated under increasing traffic flow rates. The, model outputs are compared and evaluated and conclusions are drawn on the quality of the simulators in terms of their ability to model lane changing and merging in congested conditions. This paper describes the test scenarios, briefly introduces the parameters related to lane changing available in each simulator, presents the results of the simulation runs, summarises the findings and formulates recommendations for further research and model development.

We consider a circular scenario to represent vehicular mobility on a motorway. The performance of Location-Based Routing Algorithm with Cluster-Based Flooding (LORA-CBF) and Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) are simulated and compared in OPNET, which is used to implement a microscopic traffic model to represent 3 lanes per direction of traffic flow. Finally. the two algorithms are compared in terms of end-to-End Delay (EED), Routing Load, Routing Overhead, Overhead, and Delivery Ratio.

In addition to exchanging data between vehicles, VGrid actively uses pertinent data to perform computations for solving traffic-related problems. The goal is to evolve intelligent transportation engineering from a centralized to a distributed approach, in which vehicle equipped with wireless networking and computers can cooperate and solve vehicular traffic-flow control problems autonomously. We present an example application: the merging of two lanes into one. We explore various algorithms to compute the optimal schedule for vehicle arrivals at the merge point using velocity/position information exchanged between vehicles. Our simulation results, using realistic vehicle mobility patterns, show that the proposed VGrid framework and algorithms can increase the system throughput and decrease the latency through the merge point.

B	Kiesling, T; Luthi, J			IEEE Computer Society	Kiesling, T; Luthi, J			Towards time-parallel road traffic simulation	WORKSHOP ON PRINCIPLES OF ADVANCED AND DISTRIBUTED SIMULATION, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	19th Workshop on Principles of Advanced and Distributed Simulation (PADS 2005)	JUN 01-03, 2005	Monterey, CA	ACM SIGSIM, IEEE Computer Soc, TCSIM, SCS				As an alternative to spatial parallelization of simulation models, time-parallel simulation offers the potential for massive parallelism with a high level of independence between the parallel processes. Unfortunately, due to inherent problems, the applicability of time-parallel simulation is restricted. Therefore, it has been proposed recently, to use approximation with time-parallel simulation in order to facilitate its application and to extend the class of models suitable for time-parallel simulation. As a proof-of-concept, this work shows how approximate temporal parallelization can be applied to the simulation of road traffic. Traffic simulation is used extensively in transportation research for various purposes, e.g. analysis of traffic phenomena, traffic forecast, and optimization of traffic flow. Depending on the level of fidelity, a traffic model exhibits a state space of moderate to high complexity. This paper is intended to discuss the basic properties of time-parallel traffic simulation and to examine its feasibility. Experiments with a sequential microscopic traffic simulator that emulates important aspects of a corresponding time-parallel simulator suggest this feasibility.

The original model, based on the regional atmospheric modelling system, has previously been validated against wind tunnel experiments for wind flow and turbulence. A real scale street canyon with an aspect ratio of one was studied with a neutrally stratified atmosphere and initial wind perpendicular to the street axis. After initialising and running the model to generate a stationary turbulent flow a constant discharge source of NOx was specified to imitate steady traffic flow through the street canyon. Line and area emissions sources for low and medium emissions of NOx were considered. A background concentration of ozone was specified and the gases were allowed to mix and react. Spatial variation of pollutants within the canyon was calculated to be significant. The photostationary state defect, (delta(ps) = k[NO][O-3]/J(NO2),[NO2] - 1), was found to be a sensitive indicator of reactive mixing within the canyon, the greater the defect the greater the local state of chemical instability. Low values for delta(ps) were found at the centre of the street canyon, within the primary vortex, and at the ground level corner of the windward wall, where a secondary eddy was predicted. High values were found above ground level along the windward wall, where air was entrained into the canyon along the outer edge of the primary vortex, and downstream of, and close to the NOx emission. Above the canyon a region of high delta(ps) corresponds to the edge of the escaping canyon plume. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	de Feijter, R; Evers, JJM; Lodewijks, G				de Feijter, R; Evers, JJM; Lodewijks, G			Improving travel-time reliability by the use of trip booking	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems	2004	Washington, DC	IEEE		automated highways; communication; simulation of traffic flow; traffic control; transportation		The congestion of our infrastructure, particularly (urban) motorways, continues to increase. Efficient planning, for instance in freight transport, is hindered by the resulting unreliability of travel times. Another effect of this congestion is a reduced utilization rate of the road. This paper presents trip booking, a method aimed at improvement of the reliability of travel times as well as an increase in the effective use of road capacity. Increased reliability facilitates better logistic planning. Furthermore, it allows the sharing of infrastructure between different modalities, with each modality having its own operational time window. The system aims at open dedicated infrastructure, such as bus lanes and dedicated freight lanes, and preserves the autonomy of both the provider and user of the infrastructure.

J	Olmos, LE; Munoz, JD				Olmos, LE; Munoz, JD			A cellular automaton model for the traffic flow in Bogota	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						cellular automaton models; fundamental diagrams; jams; shock waves; jamming transitions		In this work, we propose a car cellular automaton model that reproduces the experimental behavior of traffic flows in Bogota. Our model includes three elements: hysteresis between the acceleration and brake gaps, a delay time in the acceleration, and an instantaneous brake. The parameters of our model were obtained from direct measurements inside a car on motorways in Bogota. Next, we simulated this model with the flux-density fundamental diagram for a single-lane traffic road and compared it with experimental data. Our simulations are in very good agreement with the experimental measurements, not just in the shape of the fundamental diagram, but also in the numerical values for both the road capacity and the density of maximal flux. Our model reproduces, too, the qualitative behavior of shock waves. In addition, our work identifies the periodic boundary conditions as the source of false peaks in the fundamental diagram, when short roads are simulated, that have also been found in previous works. The phase transition between free and congested traffic is also investigated by computing both the relaxation time and the order parameter. Our work shows how different the traffic behavior from one city to another can be, and how important to determine the model parameters for each city.

This note presents descriptive analyses of pedestrian and bicycle traffic counts taken with infrared counters on urban multiuse greenway trails in Indiana during the fall 2000 and spring 2001. Monthly traffic, average daily, weekday, and weekend traffic, and average hourly and peak hour traffic are presented for trails in six municipalities and for five locations on one trail in Indianapolis. Trail traffic was higher in municipalities with larger populations and higher on weekend days than on weekdays. Peak hour traffic accounted for higher proportions of traffic on weekdays than on weekend days. Traffic at different locations on one trail in Indianapolis varied considerably. Planners can use these results to estimate the demand for proposed trails, describe congestion, as inputs to benefit-cost analyses and level of service studies, and help manage use.

J	Carey, M				Carey, M			Link travel times II: Properties derived from traffic-flow models	NETWORKS & SPATIAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						road traffic networks; dynamic traffic assignment; properties of travel times	VARIATIONAL INEQUALITY FORMULATION; ASSIGNMENT MODEL; WAVES	We investigate the properties of travel times when the latter are derived from traffic-flow models. In particular we consider exit-flow models, which have been used to model time-varying flows on road networks, in dynamic traffic assignment (DTA). But we here define the class more widely to include, for example, models based on finite difference approximations to the LWR (Lighthill, Whitham and Richards) model of traffic flow, and 'large step' versions of these. For the derived travel times we investigate the properties of existence, uniqueness, continuity, first-in-first-out (FIFO), causality and time-flow consistency (or intertemporal consistency). We assume a single traffic type and assume that time may be treated as continuous or as discrete, and for each case we obtain conditions under which the above properties are satisfied, and interrelations among the properties. For example, we find that FIFO is easily satisfied, but not strict causality, and find that if we redefine travel time to ensure strict causality then we lose time-flow consistency, and that neither of these conditions is strictly necessary or sufficient for FIFO. All of the models can be viewed as an approximation to a model that is continuous in time and space (the LWR model), and it seems that any loss of desirable properties is the price we pay for using such approximations. We also extend the exit-flow models and results to allow 'inhomogeneity' over time (link capacity or other parameters changing over time), and show that FIFO is still ensured if the exit-flow function is defined appropriately.

J	Ge, HX; Dai, SQ; Dong, LY; Xue, Y				Ge, HX; Dai, SQ; Dong, LY; Xue, Y			Stabilization effect of traffic flow in an extended car-following model based on an intelligent transportation system application	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							JAMMING TRANSITION; EQUATION	An extended car following model is proposed by incorporating an intelligent transportation system in traffic. The stability condition of this model is obtained by using the linear stability theory. The results show that anticipating the behavior of more vehicles ahead leads to the stabilization of traffic systems. The modified Korteweg-de Vries equation (the mKdV equation, for short) near the critical point is derived by applying the reductive perturbation method. The traffic jam could be thus described by the kink-antikink soliton solution for the mKdV equation. From the simulation of space-time evolution of the vehicle headway, it is shown that the traffic jam is suppressed efficiently with taking into account the information about the motion of more vehicles in front, and the analytical result is consonant with the simulation one.

The outcome has been the government's Vehicle Fleet Emissions Control Strategy (VFECS). This is a programme of measures designed to assist with the improvement in local air quality, and especially in the appropriate management of transport sector emissions. Key to the VFECS has been the development of tools to assess and predict the contribution of vehicle emissions to local air pollution, in a given urban situation. Determining how vehicles behave as an emissions source, and more importantly, how the combined traffic flows contribute to the total emissions within a given airshed location was an important element of the programme. The actual emissions output of a vehicle is more than that determined by a certified emission standard, at the point of manufacture. It is the engine technology's general performance capability, in conjunction with the local driving conditions, that determines its actual emissions output. As vehicles are a mobile emissions source, to understand the effect of vehicle technology, it is necessary to work with the average fleet performance, or "fleet-weighted average emissions rate". This is the unit measure of performance of the general traffic flow that could be passing through a given road corridor or network, as an average, over time. The flow composition can be representative of the national fleet population, but also may feature particular vehicle types in a given locality, thereby have a different emissions 'signature'. A summary of the range of work that has been completed as part of the VFECS programme is provided. The NZ Vehicle Fleet Emissions Model and the derived data set available in the NZ Traffic Emission Rates provide a significant step forward in the consistent analysis of practical, sustainable vehicle emissions policy and air-quality management in New Zealand.

The simulation results indicate that the traffic system can be transited from the disorder states to the order states, such as fixed-point, periodic motion etc.	Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; Nankai Univ, Dept Phys, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China	Li, KP (corresponding author), Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.

J	Hiselius, LW				Hiselius, LW			Estimating the relationship between accident frequency and homogeneous and inhomogeneous traffic flows	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						accident prediction models; road accidents; hourly traffic flow; poisson; negative binomial		This paper estimates the relationship between accident frequency and the traffic flow empirically treating the hourly traffic flow in two different ways, as consisting of homogenous vehicles and as consisting of cars and lorries. Rural roads in Sweden are studied using Poisson and Negative Binominal regression models. It is found that important information is lost if no consideration is taken to differences between vehicle types when estimating the marginal effect of the traffic flow. The accident rate decreases when the traffic flow is treated as if homogeneous. However, when cars are studied separately the result suggests that the accident rate is constant or increases. The result with respect to lorries is reversed, indicating a decreasing number of accidents as the number of lorries increases. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tsai, MY; Chen, KS				Tsai, MY; Chen, KS			Measurements and three-dimensional modeling of air pollutant dispersion in an Urban Street Canyon	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						street canyon; pollution dispersion; traffic exhaust; RNG k-epsilon turbulence model; 3D simulation	PART II; FLOW; SIMULATION; TURBULENCE; QUALITY	The concentrations of gaseous pollutants carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2), and sulfur dioxide were measured, and the vehicle type and traffic flow rates in an urban street canyon with an aspect ratio of 0.8 and a length to width ratio of 3 were recorded. Three-dimensional (313) airflow and dispersion of pollutants were modeled using the RNG k-epsilon turbulence model, which was solved numerically using the finite volume method. Vehicle emissions were estimated from the measured traffic flow rates and modeled as banded line sources along the street. Both measurements and simulations reveal that pollutant concentrations typically follow the traffic flow rate; they decline as the height increases, and are higher on the leeward side than on the windward side. 3D simulations reveal that the vortex line, joining the centers of cross-sectional vortices of the street canyon, meanders between street buildings, and the flows leave the canyon through the top. Entrainment of outside air reduces pollutant concentrations near the street outlet, where counter-rotating vortices or secondary flows are present. Numerical predictions agree reasonably well with measurements. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A class of driving strategies is used in the car-following model instead of the acceleration in the NaSch traffic model. In our model, some realistic driver behaviour and detailed vehicle characteristics have been taken into account, such as distance-headway and safe distance, etc. The simulation results show that our model can exhibit some traffic flow states that have been observed in the real traffic, and both of the maximum flux and the critical density are very close to the real measurement. Moreover, it is easy to extend our method to multi-lane traffic.

J	Gokhale, SB; Patil, RS				Gokhale, SB; Patil, RS			Modelling the size separated particulate matter (SSPM10) from vehicular exhaust at traffic intersections in Mumbai	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						cascade impactor; line source modelling; lognormal distribution; size separated particulate matter; statistical distribution modelling; vehicular pollution	PERFORMANCE; POLLUTION	The study was carried out to predict the size separated particulate matter below 10 mum size (SSPM10) from vehicular exhausts at traffic intersections using modified general finite line source model (GFLSM). Two air quality control regions (AQCRs) were selected in Mumbai City for this study. One was industrial area (AQCR(1)) containing the busy intersection, i.e. Marol link road, with the heavy inflow of two-three wheelers. And, the other was commercial busy district area (AQCR(2)) containing the busy intersection, i.e. Dadar circle, with a heavy traffic flow especially cars. The model was applied at both the traffic intersections. The data were collected for modelling study for three winter months in 1995 using cascade impactor of nine size ranges. The prediction results revealed that modified GFLSM underpredicted the SSPM10 concentrations for all the size ranges. However, showed considerable correlation between observed and predicted values for the size range below 4.7 mum at both the intersections. The relative high concentrations observed in the coarser range of 10-4.7 mum are attributed to the resuspension of the roadside particulate matter. Hence, the amount of underprediction was more for this range, which was due to the characteristics of model that does not take into account the factor for resuspension of roadside particulate matter caused by traffic movements. The model was also applied to predict the total particulate matter for downwind distances from the road intersection. The statistical evaluation of model was done, which indicated that the model's performance was good for the finer range of particles (below 4.7 mum) with r-square values of 0.49 and 0.57 found at both the intersections in AQCR(1) and AQCR(2), respectively. However, it is not unusual that the model uncertainty is likely to exist due to data input errors and stochastic fluctuations irrespective of the models accurateness. The statistical distribution model was therefore identified using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. At both the intersections, SSPM10 concentration data were found lognormally distributed.

In this approach, the traffic flow process is macroscopically modeled by use of a second-order macroscopic traffic flow model. The overall problem of coordinated ramp metering is formulated as a constrained discrete-time nonlinear optimal control problem, and a feasible-direction nonlinear optimization algorithm is employed for its numerical solution. The control strategy's efficiency is demonstrated through its application to the 32-km Amsterdam ring road. A number of adequately chosen scenarios along with a thorough analysis, interpretation, and suitable visualization of the obtained results provides a basis for the better understanding of some complex interrelationships of partially conflicting performance criteria. More precisely, the strategy's efficiency and equitey properties as well as their tradeoff are studied and their partially competitive behavior is discussed. The results of the presented approach are very promising and demonstrate the efficiency of the optimal control methodology for motorway traffic control problems.

This paper develops a behavioural model of traffic congestion, in which drivers optimize their speeds by trading off time costs, expected accident costs and fuel costs. Since the presence of other drivers affects the latter two cost components and hence the Nash equilibrium speed, a 'behavioural' speed-flow relationship results for which external congestion costs include expected accident costs and fuel costs, in addition to the time costs considered in the conventional model. It is demonstrated that the latter in fact even cancel in the calculation of optimal congestion tolls. The overall welfare optimum in our model is found to be off the speed-flow function, and off the average and marginal cost functions derived from it in the conventional approach. This full optimum requires tolls to be either accompanied by speed policies, or to be set as a function of speed. Using an empirically calibrated numerical simulation model, we illustrate these qualitative findings, and attempt to assess their potential empirical relevance. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

J	Chu, CP; Tsai, JF				Chu, CP; Tsai, JF			Road pricing models with maintenance cost	TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						elastic demands; highway maintenance cost; road congestion pricing; second-best pricing	CONGESTION; EXTERNALITIES; CHARGES; TOLLS	According to the Federal Highway Administration of the United States, maintenance expenditure takes up more than 25% of road revenue disbursement and this percentage has been increasing gradually. The reason for the increment in maintenance cost is that there lacks incentives for road users to take this cost component into their driving behavior. That is, different classes of vehicles should be levied different levels of congestion tax due to the different degrees of damage on the highway if a road pricing policy is implemented. This paper intends to incorporate this concept into road pricing literature by introducing two types of vehicles. After the analysis of the problem, we find that different types of vehicles should be charged different tolls. The toll includes not only the travel delay cost of one's own vehicle and the other types of vehicles, but also the marginal maintenance cost that is dependent on the traffic flow. A set of numerical examples is provided to demonstrate the theoretical analyses. The result shows that both the welfare and cost coverage rate will increase when the road pricing mechanism takes the maintenance cost factor into account.

The speed gradient-based momentum equation is used to develop the traffic models for each lane. Using the proposed models, some nonequilibrium phenomena such as small disturbance instability and stop-and-go waves, together with results from numerical tests are investigated. The conditions for keeping the models' linear stability are presented.

Hence, we find that these properties depend enormously on both the density rho and the fraction f of aggressive drivers. In addition, by studying the spatio-temporal organization of the vehicles, we show that at very low density, the traffic state transits from "ordinary" free traffic to "queueing" phase when we increase the fraction f. At relatively high density, the transition from congested traffic to queueing phase may also occur.

However, a diffraction wave generated at the edge of vehicle can be utilized in applying adaptive modulation method with decreased modulation level. Therefore. it can be expected to keep communication only with a diffraction wave under shadowing. Hence this paper proposes an application of adaptive modulation for RVC system. This paper first reveals its improved effect in shadowing duration by computer simulation considering practical traffic flown radio reflection and diffraction, and then shows that applying adaptive modulation can increase throughput performance largely.

The vehicular traffic is controlled by a self-organized scheme in which traffic lights are absent. This controlling method incorporates a yield-at-entry strategy for the approaching vehicles to the circulating traffic flow in the roundabout. Vehicular dynamics is simulated and the delay experienced by,the traffic at each individual street is evaluated. We discuss the impact of the geometrical properties of the roundabout on the total delay. We compare our results with, traffic-light signalization schemes,. and obtain the critical traffic volume over which the intersection is optimally, controlled through traffic-light signalization schemes.

J	Yang, XQ; Ma, YQ; Zhao, YM				Yang, XQ; Ma, YQ; Zhao, YM			Effects of quenched randomness induced by car accidents on traffic flow in a cellular automata model	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							STOPPED CARS; TRANSITION; HIGHWAY	In this paper we numerically study the impact of quenched disorder induced by car accidents on traffic flow in the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NS) model. Car accidents occur when the necessary conditions proposed by. [Boccara et al.J. Phys. A 30, 3329 (1997)] are satisfied. Two realistic situations of cars involved in car accidents have been considered. Model A is presented to consider that the accident cars become temporarily stuck. Our studies exhibit the "inverse-lambda form" or the metastable state for traffic flow in the fundamental diagram and wide-moving waves of jams in the space-time pattern. Model B is proposed to take into account that the "wrecked" cars stay, there forever and the cars behind will pass through the sites occupied by the "wrecked" cars with a transmission rate. Four-stage transitions from a maximum flow through a sharp decrease phase and a density-independent phase to a high-density jamming phase for traffic flow have been observed. The density profiles and the effects of transmission rate and probability of the occurrence of car accidents in model B are also discussed.

The models are based on a spatial-temporal traffic phase classification made in the three-phase traffic theory by Kerner. In this traffic theory, in congested traffic two different phases are distinguished: "wide moving jam" and "synchronized flow". The model FOTO is devoted to the identification of traffic phases and to the tracking of synchronized flow. The model ASDA is devoted to the tracking of the propagation of moving jams. The general approach and the different extensions of the models FOTO and ASDA are explained in detail. It is stressed that the models FOTO and ASDA perform without any validation of model parameters in different environmental and traffic conditions. Results of the online application of the models FOTO and ASDA at the TCC (Traffic Control Center) of Hessen near Frankfurt (Germany) are presented and evaluated. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

A microscopic model for heterogeneous traffic flow is developed based on three-phase traffic theory. Diverse congested pattern features at a freeway bottleneck due to an on-ramp in heterogeneous traffic flow on a two-lane freeway are found. A numerical study of these specific pattern features and their comparison with empirical results are performed. A comparison of congested patterns in heterogeneous traffic flow with congested patterns in traffic flow with identical vehicles is made.

J	Berhanu, G				Berhanu, G			Models relating traffic safety with road environment and traffic flows on arterial roads in Addis Ababa	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						road environment; traffic flow; traffic safety; accident predictive models	GEOMETRIC DESIGN; ACCIDENTS; POISSON	This paper presents the study carried out to develop accident predictive models based on the data collected on arterial roads in Addis Ababa. Poisson and negative binomial regression methods were used to relate the discrete accident data with the road and traffic flow explanatory variables. Significant accident predictive models were found with a number of significant explanatory variables. The results show that the existing inadequate road infrastructure and poor road traffic operations are the potential contributors of this ever-growing challenge of the road transport in Addis Ababa. The results also indicate that improvements in roadway width, pedestrian facilities, and access management are effective in reducing road traffic accidents. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

By considering many real factors, the effects on traffic flow and velocity of the main-road, produced by the bus stop and the time switched between the green light and the red light, have been analyzed. The result can reflect the real traffic flow of the main-road in city under the control of the traffic lights.

J	Jenkin, ME				Jenkin, ME			Analysis of sources and partitioning of oxidant in the UK - Part 2: contributions of nitrogen dioxide emissions and background ozone at a kerbside location in London	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						ozone; nitrogen dioxide; NOX; oxidant; regional pollution; local pollution; monitoring networks; air quality; policy models	NO2 EMISSIONS	Hourly mean concentration data for nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O-3) at Marylebone Rd (an urban kerbside site in London) are used to investigate the diurnal and seasonal dependence of sources of oxidant, and their origins. The observed concentrations of oxidant ([OX], defined as [NO2] + [O-3]) are interpreted in terms of a the sum of a NOX-independent 'regional' contribution, and a linearly NOX-dependent 'local' contribution. The former is believed to equate to the background O-3 concentration, whereas the latter is likely to be dominated by emissions of NO2 from road transport at the studied location. The derived regional OX concentrations display a significant seasonal variation, with a springtime maximum value of ca. 43 ppb in April, the results being broadly similar to those reported for background ozone at low altitude sites in northwest Europe. A strong diurnal variation in the local OX contribution is observed throughout the year, with the highest values (typically ca. 0.11 ppb ppb(-1) NOX) during the daytime. Diurnal profiles averaged over the periods of the year when the UK operates under GMT and BST demonstrate a clear temporal shift, consistent with the local OX contribution being due to primary NO2 emissions from road transport. In conjunction with traffic flow statistics and associated NOX emissions estimates, the results suggest that primary NO2 from diesel-fuelled vehicles accounts for 0.996 v(-0.6) of diesel Nov emissions, by volume, where v is the mean vehicle speed in km h(-1) (valid range, 30-60 km h(-1)). This corresponds to (11.8 +/- 1.2)% of NOX emissions integrated over the average diurnal cycle for the conditions at Marylebone Rd. The results also suggest that primary NO2 emissions from petrol-fuelled vehicles are far less important, with an upper limit NO2/NOX emission ratio of < 3 %. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Helbing, D; Nagel, K				Helbing, D; Nagel, K			The physics of traffic and regional development	CONTEMPORARY PHYSICS			English	Review							EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES; PHASE-DIAGRAM; SIMULATION; MODEL; STATES; TIME; CONGESTION; FLOW	This contribution summarizes and explains various principles from physics which are used for the simulation of traffic flows in large street networks, the modelling of destination, transport mode, and route choice, or the simulation of urban growth and regional development. The methods stem from many-particle physics, from kinetic gas theory, or fluid dynamics. They involve energy and entropy considerations, transfer the law of gravity, apply cellular automata and require methods from evolutionary game theory. In this way, one can determine interaction forces among driver-vehicle units, reproduce breakdowns of traffic including features of synchronized congested flow, or understand changing usage patterns of alternative roads. One can also describe daily activity patterns based on decision models, simulate migration streams and model urban growth as a particular kind of aggregation process.

J	van Ackere, A; Larsen, ER				van Ackere, A; Larsen, ER			Self-organising behaviour in the presence of negative externalities: A conceptual model of commuter choice	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						simulation; collective choice; traffic; cellular automata	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; TRAFFIC-FLOW; PEAK-PERIOD; INFORMATION; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS; DEMAND; CONGESTION	We use a model with local interaction (a one-dimensional cellular automaton) to study how commuters choose among alternative roads. Commuters have information about their neighbours' most recent experience (local interaction) and they remember their own experiences (memory). We illustrate how a simple, self-organizing system, based on local information and locally rational agents can in some cases outperform the Nash equilibrium. While the social optimum is unenforceable without a central planner, due to the variations in individual travel times (i.e. the social optimum is not individually rational), variations across commuters in the steady-state of our self-organising system are at least equivalent to, and mostly significantly larger than those required for the social equilibrium.

J	Wei, G				Wei, G			A qualitative model of cross-lane inhomogeneities in traffic flow	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						homogenous traffic flow; qualitative modeling; qualitative reasoning; traffic flow model	SIMULATION	The dilemma of traditionally quantitative methods in application to complex systems leads more and more researchers to emphasize the qualitative methods that can tackle the qualitative knowledge. Based on the concepts and ideas of qualitative reasoning, a preliminary qualitative method for modeling the traffic flow is proposed in this paper. Following new concepts, such as the homogenous measure index, which can be treated as an entropy to judge the homogeneity of traffic flow, a set of linear parameters-varying difference equations is used to describe the process of qualitative state transitions of the traffic flow. The procedures as well as the rationality of qualitative modeling for the traffic flow are illustrated by the data obtained from an actual traffic system-the Beijing Third Ring Road. Comparing the simulation results with actual data, it is proven that the results obtained by the proposed qualitative model coincide with the actual situation and the qualitative model can basically depict the nonhomogenous state transitions of traffic flow.

J	Wang, JM; Rajamani, R				Wang, JM; Rajamani, R			Should adaptive cruise-control systems be designed to maintain a constant time gap between vehicles?	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						adaptive cruise control; traffic flow; traffic flow stability; vehicle control	STABILITY	This paper addresses the stability of traffic flow on a highway when the vehicles operate under an adaptive cruise-control (ACC) system. These systems are commonly designed to maintain a constant time gap between vehicles during vehicle following. Previous researchers in the literature have produced contradictory results on whether the traffic flow is stable when the constant time-gap spacing policy is used. This paper resolves the contradiction and shows that the boundary conditions used at the inlets and exits influence traffic-flow stability in the case of the constant time-gap policy. Further, this paper shows that it is possible to design an unconditionally stable spacing policy, i.e., a spacing policy that guarantees traffic stability under all boundary conditions. The practical implications of instability are shown through traffic-simulation results. The advantages of an unconditionally stable spacing policy over the constant time-gap policy are demonstrated. The answer to the question "Should ACC systems be designed to maintain a constant time gap between vehicles?" is "No" from a traffic-flow stability perspective. It is quite easy to develop alternate spacing policies with superior stability properties.

J	Menon, PK; Sweriduk, GD; Bilimoria, KD				Menon, PK; Sweriduk, GD; Bilimoria, KD			New approach for modeling, analysis, and control of air traffic flow	JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference	AUG 05-08, 2002	MONTEREY, CA	Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut			CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; KINEMATIC WAVES; HIGHWAY	An Eulerian approach to modeling air traffic flow is advanced. This modeling technique spatially aggregates air traffic to generate models of air traffic flow in a network of interconnected, one-dimensional control volumes. The approach simplifies the problem of characterizing the air traffic flow because the order of the corresponding airspace model depends only on the number of spatial control volumes used to represent the air traffic environment and not on the number of aircraft operating in it. Under a quasi-steady-state assumption, this process results in linear models of the air traffic environment. It is shown that analysis and design methods from linear control theory can be applied to this model to yield useful approaches for characterizing and controlling the air traffic flow.

In this paper, the neural network models are proposed and developed for forecasting 37 types of freight movements and hence Hong Kong port cargo throughput from 2002 to 2011. The historical data (1983-2000) of freight movements and explanatory factors are the input data used for model development. The models developed are used to forecast I year of freight movements for validation with actual data in 2001 and comparison with those forecasted by regression analysis. Using the same models, freight movements are then forecasted for the next 10 years based on projected explanatory factors and combined to form the predicted port cargo throughputs. The Monte Carlo simulation is used to assess the reliability of the forecasts due to projection error of explanatory factors and compare the results forecasted by regression analysis for three different growth rate scenarios. Results show that forecasts made by the proposed neural network models are more conservative, more reliable, and more comparable to reality.

J	Carey, M				Carey, M			Link travel times 1: Desirable properties	NETWORKS & SPATIAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						road traffic networks; dynamic traffic assignment; first in first out		When modelling travel times and traffic flows varying over time on traffic networks it is desirable that the travel times should satisfy certain properties. This paper investigates these properties and their interrelationships, in particular, uniqueness and continuity, first-in-first-out (FIFO), causality and time-flow consistency, while assuming a single traffic type. For generality we investigate these properties independently, as far as possible, of how the travel times have been defined or derived. In a companion paper (Carey, 2003) we investigate the same properties for a particular class of travel-time model, namely travel times derived from exit-flow models.

J	Lord, D; Persaud, BN				Lord, D; Persaud, BN			Estimating the safety performance of urban road transportation networks	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						safety; crash prediction models; safety performance functions; urban network; transportation planning		Transportation planning models are typically used to estimate future traffic patterns, peak period traffic, travel time, and various environmental or other related traffic flow characteristics. Unfortunately, traffic safety is seldom, if ever, explicitly considered proactively during the transportation planning process. This omission is attributed to various factors, including the lack of available tools needed to estimate the number of crashes during this process. To help fill this void, the research on which this paper is based aimed, as a primary objective, to develop a tool that would allow the estimation of crashes on digital or coded urban transportation networks during the planning process. The secondary objective of the research was to describe how the predictive models should be applied on these networks and explain the important issues and limitations surrounding their application. To accomplish these objectives, safety performance functions specifically created for this work were applied to two sample digital networks created with the help of EMME/2, a software package widely used in transportation planning. The results showed that it is possible to predict crashes on digital transportation networks, but confirmed the reality that the accuracy of the predictions is directly related to the precision of the traffic flow estimates. The crash predictions are also sensitive to how the digital network is coded, and it is shown how appropriate adjustments can be made. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Carslaw, DC; Beevers, SD				Carslaw, DC; Beevers, SD			Investigating the potential importance of primary NO2 emissions in a street canyon	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						ozone; NOx; vehicle emissions; air quality management; emissions inventory; London	OSPM MODEL; HELSINKI	Monitoring data from a busy street canyon location in central London and a background site have been used to estimate the potential importance of primary NO2 emissions from road vehicles travelling along the street canyon. By considering the difference in the total 'oxidant', OX (NO2 + O-3) between the two sites insight has been gained into the potential magnitude of primary NO2 emissions from road vehicles. It is shown that the day of the week and hour of the day variation in OX closely matches some attributes of the variation in road traffic flows and vehicle composition. In particular, the variation in OX compares well the variation in estimated NOx emissions from diesel vehicles by hour of the day and day of the week. A multiple regression is used to estimate the fraction of NO2 in petrol and diesel exhausts that is directly emitted. These results suggest that petrol and diesel vehicles in the street canyon emit 0.6 +/- 0.2 and 12.7 +/- 0.1 vol % NO2, respectively. Primary emissions of this magnitude appear to explain much of the variation observed from the measurements. These results have implications for modelling studies in terms of source apportionment and how NO2 concentrations respond to NOx control. It is recommended that detailed primary NO2 emissions inventories are developed and used by dispersion modellers for concentration predictions and comparisons with UK national and international limits for NO2.

Two optical particle counters (PMS ASASP-X) were operated with ultrasonic anemometers as eddy covariance systems. One system was located at 3.5 m height between the road and pavement while the other was periodically cycled through heights of 5, 10, 15 and 18 m on a hydraulic lift. At street level, number concentrations in the range 0.1 < D(p) < 0.5 mum followed a diurnal cycle similar to that observed in other studies in the urban background, with a peak coinciding with the morning peak in traffic flow. Daytime concentrations were moderated by inverse relationships with wind speed within the canyon, as well as an independent inverse relationship with wind speed measured at a roof-top site 750 m from the canyon. The vertical turbulent flux also followed a diurnal cycle similar to that previously observed above an urban canopy, with the greatest flux occurring in the middle of the day. A negative vertical gradient in flux was typically found within the canyon. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Given that the total number of people is unchanging, we have studied the evolution of pedestrian flow by varying parameters of system size. Relationships between parameters of system size and the transition time are discussed in this paper. Scaling behaviour is found as follows: the transition time t(c) scales as t(c) proportional to W-0.85+/-0.04, and t(c) proportional to D, where W is the width of corridor, and D is the strength of drift. However, the other parameters are found to have little influence on the transition time.

J	Li, KP; Gao, ZY				Li, KP; Gao, ZY			Transition from disorder to order in traffic flow	CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; MODEL; JAM	We propose a new technique to investigate the dynamical transitions among the traffic phases. A type of the control signals has been designated at a given site (signal point) of the single-lane highway. Under the effect of the control signal, the velocity of the vehicle that passes the signal point will be changed periodically. Our method is tested for the deterministic NaSch traffic model. The simulation results demonstrate that the disorder states in the deterministic NaSch traffic model can be suppressed, and the different types of periodic states would occur.

J	Varia, HR; Dhingra, SL				Varia, HR; Dhingra, SL			Dynamic optimal traffic assignment and signal time optimization using genetic algorithms	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							MODEL	In this article a dynamic system-optimal traffic assignment model is formulated for a congested urban road network with a number of signalized intersections. A simulation-based approach is employed for the case of multiple-origin-multiple-destination traffic flows. The artificial intelligence technique of genetic algorithms (GAs) is used to minimize the overall travel cost in the network with fixed signal timings and optimization of signal timings. The proposed method is applied to the example network and results are discussed. It is concluded that GAs allow the relaxation of many of the assumptions that may be needed to solve the problem analytically by traditional methods.

The model aims to explain or predict the actions of a driver in a variety of driving scenarios ranging from free flow conditions on wide roads to forced flow conditions on narrow two-way roads. The salient features of the proposed theory are (1) a single model (or framework) is used to describe driver behavior in different driving scenarios and (2) the response of drivers through both steering control and speed control are modeled. Driver behavior is simulated in 19 different driving scenarios. Results from these simulations show the efficacy of the proposed model in explaining/predicting driver behavior.

J	Lo, HK; Chow, AHF				Lo, HK; Chow, AHF			Control strategies for oversaturated traffic	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						traffic control; control systems; optimization; traffic flow	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; CONTROL FORMULATION; HIGHWAY; WAVES	Recently, a dynamic traffic control system designated as dynamic intersection signal control optimization (DISCO) has been developed. DISCO considers the entire fundamental diagram of traffic flow, which is essential for controlling congested and transient traffic. As a dynamic model, DISCO works with time-variant traffic patterns and derives dynamic timing plans. In this study, we applied DISCO to a congested network in Hong Kong and studied the various control strategies enabled by DISCO. The results showed that DISCO outperformed the existing plans by 30-40% in overall delay reductions. DISCO performed best under the most flexible control scheme of variable-green no-cycle strategy, given a good initial solution for the algorithm. Nevertheless, even good fixed-time plans can produce remarkable results.

J	Li, K; Ioannou, P				Li, K; Ioannou, P			Modeling of traffic flow of automated vehicles	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						automated vehicles; intelligent cruise control; macroscopic model; mesoscopic model; microscopic model; traffic flow	DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS	With the development of near term automatic vehicles following concepts such as intelligent cruise control (ICC) and cooperative driving, vehicles will be able to automatically follow each other in the longitudinal direction. The modeling of traffic flow consisting of such vehicles is important for analyzing the effects of vehicle automation on the characteristics of traffic flow and for suggesting macroscopic control strategies to improve efficiency. Such analysis may also suggest ways for modifying the vehicle control characteristics in order to improve the macroscopic behavior of traffic. In this paper, we developed a mesoscopic and macroscopic model that describes the automated traffic-flow dynamics in a single highway lane. The mesoscopic model describes the speed and density continuously in time and space and at the same time retains the microscopic characteristics of traffic flow. The macroscopic model describes the average speed and density at each section of the lane and at each point in time. Even though the macroscopic model does not retain the microscopic characteristics of the vehicular traffic, computationally it is much simpler than the mesoscopic one. Simulations are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of these models in describing traffic-flow characteristics. The developed models indicate some similarities, but also some fundamental differences with existing traffic-flow models for manually driven vehicles.

In this article an approach to traffic forecast is presented, which uses a micro-simulator for traffic flow combined with current and historical traffic data. The micro-simulator and locally measured current traffic data are used to reconstruct the current network-wide traffic state. Then, this state is combined with historical traffic data to forecast the traffic development. This framework is applied to the freeway network of the German state North Rhine-Westphalia. The micro-simulator uses an advanced cellular-automaton model for traffic flow, and the data are supplied from more than 4,000 locally installed loop-detectors, which deliver information on the (local) traffic state online minute by minute.

To this end, two typical values of randomization probability p:p=0.5 and p=0.1 axe chosen. It is shown that for p=0.5, the full capacity of the single lane highway can be restored. However, for p=0.1, our simulations show that the full capacity of the single lane highway cannot be restored due to the existence of the merge section in the lane expansion section. Moreover, we have investigated the dependence of road capacity on the length of lane expansion section as well as the effects of the positions of the tollbooths in the lane expansion section under different values of p.

J	Davis, LC				Davis, LC			Effect of adaptive cruise control systems on traffic flow	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							PHASE-TRANSITIONS; MODEL; STATES	The flow of traffic composed of vehicles that are equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC) is studied using simulations. The ACC vehicles are modeled by a linear dynamical equation that has string stability. In platoons of all ACC vehicles, perturbations due to changes in the lead vehicle's velocity do not cause jams. Simulations of merging flows near an onramp show that if the total incoming rate does not exceed the capacity of the single outgoing lane, free flow is maintained. With larger incoming flows, a state closely related to the synchronized flow phase found in manually driven vehicular traffic has been observed. This state, however, should not be considered congested because the flow is maximal for the density. Traffic composed of random sequences of ACC vehicles and manual vehicles has also been studied. At high speeds (similar to30 m/s) jamming occurs for concentrations of ACC vehicles of 10% or less. At 20% no jams are formed. The formation of jams is sensitive to the sequence of vehicles (ACC or manual). At lower speeds (similar to15 m/s), no critical concentration for complete jam suppression is found. Rather, the average velocity in the pseudojam region increases with increasing ACC concentration. Mixing 50% ACC vehicles randomly with manually driven vehicles on the primary lane in onramp simulations shows only modestly reduced travel times and larger flow rates.

Applying this method to the Burgers CA (BCA), we have succeeded in obtaining the Lagrange representation of the BCA. In this paper, we apply this method to multi-value generalized Burgers CA (GBCA) which include the Fukui-Ishibashi model and the quick-start model associated with traffic flow. As a result, we have succeeded in clarifying the Euler-Lagrange correspondence of these models. It turns out moreover that the GBCA can naturally be considered as a simple model of a multi-lane traffic flow.

It usually leads to some traffic problems. In this paper, we propose a new technique to control such dynamical state of the traffic flow on a main road. A type of the control signal has been designated at a given site (signal point) in front of each intersection. Under the effect of the control signal, the velocities of the vehicles which pass the signal point will be changed. Our method is tested for the "unified" CA traffic model which is the marriage of the NaSch model and the BML model. The simulation results demonstrate that using this control strategy, when the traffic light is green, the disorder state of the traffic flow which is in front of each intersection can be suppressed, and the periodic state of the traffic flow will occur.

Both the system without an exit lane (case 1) and that with an exit lane (case 2) are considered. The phase diagram and its variation with L-D (the length of exit lane in case 2 and the length of a special lane-changing section in case 1) is studied. Two phase regions are found in case 1 and a new phase, i.e., the maximum flux phase, is reported in case 2. The density (velocity) distribution near the off ramp and the influence of L-D on the traffic flow are also discussed in both cases.

Regulated gaseous emissions	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								Information about in-use emissions from diesel engines remains a critical issue for inventory development and policy design. Toward that end, we have developed and verified the first mobile laboratory that measures on-road or real-world emissions from engines at the quality level specified in the U.S. Congress Code of Federal Regulations. This unique mobile laboratory provides information on integrated and modal regulated gaseous emission rates and integrated emission rates for speciated volatile and semivolatile organic compounds and particulate matter during real-world operation. Total emissions are captured and collected from the HDD vehicle that is pulling the mobile laboratory. While primarily intended to accumulate data from HDD vehicles, it may also be used to measure emission rates from stationary diesel sources such as backup generators. This paper describes the development of the mobile laboratory, its measurement capabilities, and the verification process and provides the first data on total capture gaseous on-road emission measurements following the California Air Resources Board (ARB) 4-mode driving cycle, the hot urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS), the modified 5-mode cycle, and a 53.2-mi highway chase experiment. NOx mass emission rates (g mi(-1)) for the ARB 4-mode driving cycle, the hot UDDS driving cycle, and the chase experiment were found to exceed current emission factor estimates for the engine type tested by similar to50%. It was determined that congested traffic flow as well as "off-Federal Test Procedure cycle" emissions can lead to significant increases in per mile NOx emission rates for HDD vehicles.

J	Larraga, ME; del Rio, JA; Schadschneider, A				Larraga, ME; del Rio, JA; Schadschneider, A			New kind of phase separation in a CA traffic model with anticipation	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND GENERAL			English	Article							STATISTICAL PHYSICS; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; FLOW; SYSTEMS	A cellular automaton model of traffic flow taking into account velocity anticipation is introduced. The strength of anticipation can be varied to describe different driving schemes. We find a new phase separation into a free-flow regime and a so-called upsilon-platoon in an intermediate density regime. In a upsilon-platoon all cars move with velocity upsilon and have vanishing headway. The velocity upsilon of a platoon only depends on the strength of anticipation. At high densities, a congested state characterized by the coexistence of a 0-platoon with several upsilon-platoons is reached. The results are not only relevant for automated highway systems, but also help to elucidate the effects of anticipation that play an essential role in realistic traffic models. From a physics point of view the model is interesting because it exhibits phase separation with a condensed phase in which particles move coherently with finite velocity coexisting with either a non-condensed (free-flow) phase or another condensed phase that is non-moving.

J	Xue, Y				Xue, Y			One-dimensional traffic model to consider priority of the Stochastic deceleration	COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						traffic flow; cellular automaton; fundamental diagram	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; FLOW	A one-dimensional cellular automaton model of traffic flow is proposed to introduce the different delay probabilities in the steps of rules and the stochastic deceleration prior to the deterministic one when the anticipation velocity of vehicle is larger than the headway. The fundamental diagram shows the capacity of road more approaches to the observed data compared with that by the NaSch model. Moreover, the model is able to reproduce the complicated behavior of the real traffic, such as the metastability state, the separation of different phases and the effect of hysteresis. It is concluded that the order arrangement of the stochastic deceleration and deterministic acceleration has indeed remarkable effect on traffic flow and the modification presented in this paper is reasonable and realistic.

Rev. E 64, 066128 (2001)], which considers the velocity effect of the preceding car, to two-lane traffic system. The traffic behaviors in both homogeneous system and inhomogeneous system are investigated. For homogeneous traffic, it is shown that the velocity effect enhances the maximum flux but does not change the qualitative properties of the fundamental diagram. Nevertheless, the qualitative changes of the lane changing frequency and congested pattern occur. In the inhomogeneous system, the honk effect is studied. It is found that the honk effect first strengthens then weakens with the increase of R, the ratio of slow cars to all cars.

A simulation-based approach is employed for the case of multiple-origin multiple-destination traffic flows. The modified method of successive averages (MSA) is developed to arrive at the user equilibrium condition. The proposed method is applied to an example network, and its results are compared with the results obtained by using the artificial intelligence technique of genetic algorithms (GAs). It is concluded that the formulated DUE model avoids the all-or-nothing type of assignment and gives results closer to the equilibrium condition, and the modified MSA gives better results with lesser computation time as compared to GAs.

J	Golob, TF; Recker, WW; Alvarez, VM				Golob, TF; Recker, WW; Alvarez, VM			Tool to evaluate safety effects of changes in freeway traffic flow	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						traffic flow; traffic safety; California; accident prediction; research	ACCIDENTS; CONGESTION; WEATHER; SPEED	This research involves the development of a tool that can be used to assess the changes in traffic safety tendencies that result from changes in traffic flow. The tool uses data from single inductive loop detectors, converting 30-second observations of volume and occupancy for multiple freeway lanes into traffic flow regimes. Each regime has a specific pattern of crash types, which were determined through nonlinear multivariate analyses of over 1,000 crashes on freeways in Southern California. These analyses revealed ways in which differences in variances in speeds and volumes across lanes, as well as central tendencies of speeds and volumes, combine in complex ways to explain crash taxonomy. This research may provide the foundation to forecast the crash rates, in terms of vehicle miles of travel, for vehicles that are exposed to different traffic flow conditions.

J	Kerner, BS				Kerner, BS			Three-phase traffic theory and highway capacity	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Review							CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES; JAMMING TRANSITION; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; METASTABLE STATES; DYNAMICAL MODEL; FLOW; EQUATION; PHYSICS; WAVES	Hypotheses and some results of the three-phase traffic theory by the author are compared with results of the fundamental diagram approach to traffic flow theory. A critical discussion of model results about congested pattern features which have been derived within the fundamental diagram approach to traffic flow theory and modeling is made. The empirical basis of the three-phase traffic theory is discussed and some new spatial-temporal features of the traffic phase "synchronized flow" are considered. A probabilistic theory of highway capacity is presented which is based on the three-phase traffic theory. In the frame of this theory, the probabilistic nature of highway capacity in free flow is linked to an occurrence of the first order local phase transition from the traffic phase "free flow" to the traffic phase "synchronized flow". A numerical study of congested pattern highway capacity based on simulations of a KKW cellular automata model within the three-phase traffic theory is presented. A congested pattern highway capacity which depends on features of congested spatial-temporal patterns upstream of a bottleneck is studied. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Gunay, B				Gunay, B			An investigation of lane utilisation on Turkish highways	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-TRANSPORT			English	Article						roads and highways; engineering		This paper, being the first report on 'lane utilisation on Turkish highways', explores some of the unconventional characteristics of multilane traffic flows. As in many developing countries, the discipline of lane-based driving in Turkey is fairly weak. Possible reasons for this problem are different driving attitudes, poor road surface, poorly maintained lane markings, and the nonexistence of studs on lane lines. The possible consequences of the problem, thus, could be loss of safety, difficult traffic management, inapplicability of conventional lane-based models, etc. Findings revealed that lateral positions of vehicles within the lane were more disorderly when compared with developed countries, where a normal distribution can be used. Regarding the distribution of vehicles over the lanes, the results in general were significantly different from the existing diagrams of some European highways. The proportion of traffic exhibited totally opposite trends for the median and shoulder lanes in Turkey, especially with wider shoulders. Whereas using the shoulder provided some extra capacity, along with some disadvantages, highways with no shoulders discharged less traffic than their counterparts from the developed world. Therefore, the present paper is thought to be the first step of the research into the problem of untidiness.

J	Wang, J; Rajamani, R				Wang, J; Rajamani, R			The impact of adaptive cruise control systems on highway safety and traffic flow	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART D-JOURNAL OF AUTOMOBILE ENGINEERING			English	Article						adaptive cruise control; traffic flow; traffic stability; highway safety		This paper deals with the design of new adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems that can improve traffic flow while at the same time ensuring safe operation on today's highways. ACC systems are commonly designed to maintain a constant time-gap (CTG) between vehicles during vehicle-following. In this paper, a new inter-vehicle spacing policy in which the inter-vehicle spacing is a non-linear function of vehicle speed is developed. The new spacing policy, referred to as a variable time-gap (VTG) policy, is shown analytically to lead to better traffic flow and a higher highway capacity. Practical advantages of using the new spacing policy are demonstrated through traffic simulations. However, a detailed analysis of safety shows that the traditional CTG policy is superior in several scenarios. The VTG policy is then modified by explicitly taking inter-vehicle relative velocity into account in the definition of desired spacing. The resulting new spacing policy is shown to retain the advantages of stable traffic flow and a higher capacity while providing the same level of safety as the CTG policy.

J	Guo, XP; Dunne, MC; Black, JA				Guo, XP; Dunne, MC; Black, JA			Modeling of pedestrian delays with pulsed vehicular traffic flow	TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						traffic flow modeling; platoons; pedestrian delay	INTERSECTION	The phenomenon of the bunching of urban traffic is considered together with a mathematical model for the associated problem of the delay to pedestrians crossing a traffic stream. The approach used is also applicable to estimating delay to a single vehicle at a priority intersection and to merging vehicular traffic. Many pedestrian delay models include the assumption that successive vehicular headways are independent and identically distributed random variables. Such models may not be appropriate where vehicles form bunches-as occurs, for example, near traffic signals. Modeling of pedestrian delay is considered in two parts: the delay to pedestrians arriving during a vehicular bunch, and delay to those arriving during the random flow between bunches. These two parts are considered in combination to obtain overall delay. Three field surveys were conducted in metropolitan Sydney. Useable data were obtained on 4,350 headways and 252 crossing pedestrians on major arterial roads. The field data were used to assess the validity and accuracy of the proposed model. They support the theoretical model and suggest that, under certain conditions, it provides a more accurate estimation of pedestrian delays downstream of traffic signals than do some existing models, such as Adams' (1936) model.

The vehicle's speed is assumed to be modulated by a random environment that can be modeled as a stochastic process. We first present a partial differential equation (PDE) describing the travel time distribution and obtain a solution in terms of Laplace transforms. Next, we present a numerical inversion algorithm to invert the transforms. The technique is demonstrated on two example problems. Numerical results indicate great promise for this approach to the link travel-time problem.

The vehicular traffic at the intersection is controlled by a set of traffic lights which can be operated subject to fix-time as well as traffic adaptive schemes. Vehicular dynamics is simulated within the framework of the probabilistic cellular automata and the delay experienced by the traffic at each individual street is evaluated for specified time intervals. Minimizing the total delay of both streets gives rise to the optimum signalization of traffic lights. We propose some traffic responsive signalization algorithms which are based on the concept of cut-off queue length and cut-off density.

The objective of the tool is to assist transport administrators enhance the efficiency of the transportation supply while improving environmental and energy indicators. The DDS works on three levels. The first performs the transport network analysis, the second assesses the energy consumption and pollutant emissions and the third evaluates the several policies selected. Road traffic is simulated using a deterministic, multi-modal traffic assignment model with capacity constraints. The model allows the estimation of traffic flow patterns within each link of the road network starting from the knowledge of the network characteristics and traffic demand. Energy consumption and pollutant emission calculations are based on the methodology developed by the CORINAIR working group. The evaluation of each policy scenario is based on a number of traffic, environmental and energy indicators. A multi-criteria analysis, where decision is based upon judging over appropriate weighted criteria, is adopted. Models are integrated in a GIS environment, which serves as the repository of the data as well as the user interface of the tool. The use of the tool is demonstrated through characteristic case studies on the Greater Athens Area in Greece. Two policy measures, one concerning the extension of the region where half of the private cars are prohibited from entering to the Municipality of Athens and the other the reduction of parking places in the same region by 50% are evaluated.

The four traffic models studied are movement between randomly chosen starting and destination points, back and forth movement between same two points, movement with preference of horizontal and vertical paths, and movement along shortest paths. The congestion properties of these traffic models are studied using computer simulation. It is found that the first and the third model has a sudden phase transition from free flow to jammed state at a critical system density, the second model has a gradual transition from free flow to jammed state, and the fourth model results in a simple deadlock. The phase transition properties and the critical densities are studied in detail. The emerging traffic jam patterns of the traffic models are also presented. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The solution to the estimation problem is given within the Bayesian recursive framework. A particle filter (PF) is developed based on a freeway traffic model with aggregated states and an observation model with aggregated variables. The freeway is considered as a network of components, each component representing a different section of the traffic network. The freeway traffic is modelled as a stochastic hybrid system, i.e. each traffic section possesses continuous and discrete states, interacting with states of neighbor sections. The state update step in the recursive Bayesian estimator is performed through sending and receiving functions describing propagation of perturbations from upstream to downstream, and from downstream to upstream sections. Measurements are received only on boundaries between some sections and averaged within regular or irregular time intervals. A particle filter is developed with measurement updates each time when a new measurement becomes available, and with possibly many state updates in between consecutive measurement updates. It provides an approximate but scalable solution to the difficult state estimation and prediction problem with limited, noisy observations. The filter performance is validated and evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation.

In practical situations, flow data may be incomplete, that is, partially missing or unavailable, where few methods could implement forecasting successfully. A method called Sampling Markov Chain is proposed to deal with this circumstance. In this paper, the traffic flow is modeled as a high order Markov Chain; and the transition probability from one state to the other state is approximated by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) whose parameters are estimated with Competitive Expectation Maximum (CEM) algorithm. The incomplete data in forecasting the trend of Markov Chain is represented by enough points sampled using the idea of Monte Carlo integration. Experimental results show that the Sampling Markov Chain method is applicable and effective for short-term traffic flow forecasting in case of incomplete data.

The application of such a model to assess the car drive activities focuses on three interactive organizational levels: the coordination between drivers directed by the Highway Code, the road infrastructure on which these drivers are moving and the traffic flow.

There has been an interest in the development of an automated highway system in which high traffic flow rates may be safely achieved Upon entering the automated highway system, the longitudinal control of car-following collision prevention system will drive a vehicle along the fully automated highway. This paper proposes an intelligent wavelet neural network (IWNN) control system for the car-following collision prevention system based on the wavelet neural network (WNN) approach. The WNN combines the capability of artificial neural networks for learning from processes and the capability of wavelet decomposition for control dynamic systems. In the proposed IWNN system, a WNN controller is used to mimic an ideal controller and a robust controller is designed to compensate for the difference between the ideal controller and the WNN controller. The adaptation laws of the IWNN are derived in the sense of Lyapunov stability analysis, so that the stability of the control system can be guaranteed. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed IWNN control system can achieve favorable tracking performance for a safe car-following control.

It results in the discontinuities of traffic and reduces the service level. The research of traffic flow breakdown is often narrowly confined to incident detection, and there are approximately 4 kinds of algorithms: pattern recognition algorithm, statistical inference algorithm, catastrophic theory and neural network algorithm. These methods have played important roles in their past applications, and each has shortcomings. This paper introduces a nonlinear and nonparametric statistical method to analyze traffic flow breakdown. Based on traffic flow theory and combined with mean-value change-point model, the hypothesis testing of the existence of change-points and the local-comparison algorithm to search change-points are discussed The method is calibrated with the data from the city of Southampton, UK. An example of the applications is also included to test the effectiveness of the method.

The model can be used as a heuristic tool for analyzing and observing the shape of state of street networks traffic flow in the whole city. Despite the simplicity of the construction of CAN model, it produces behavior of considerable complexity of street networks. From the similarity of elementary graph of traffic flow between the academic and the numerical simulation, it is obtained that the nonlinear simulation method can be used to study the macrocosmic behavior of street network traffic and reliable result can be achieved.

Each signal is modeled by a simple phase oscillator with a periodic motion, and a pair-wise local interaction between the adjacent neurons leads to an entrainment with a phase difference which corresponds to a signal offset. Therefore, each pair-wise interaction is designed to attain a desired offset value. A coupling strength is given by a traffic flow density. Then, all offsets over the entire area are given by the global entrainment dynamics. In this paper, the method is applied to a various traffic condition including left or right turn traffic at an intersection and any number of crossing roads at an intersection. The results of computer simulations on several traffic flow patterns and conditions show the effective control by the statistics such as an average travel time.

An approach of using individual-based vehicle models is proposed, which captures the driving characteristics of each vehicle on the road, such as vehicle's dynamics, path selection and driving behaviours or attitudes. The 3D virtual environment presented in the paper is capable of constructing various roadway network configurations and simulating the different traffic situations. A traffic flow in the system is modelled as a large flow of autonomous vehicle agents, each is simulated individually according its motion behaviour characteristics and the traffic flow is the result of collective behaviours of the vehicle agents. The system models the design layout and the conditions of roadways, traffic control signals, as well as the driving behaviours of all the individual vehicles. A number of simulation tests are also discussed in this paper.

Stationary cameras fixed at high buildings can be used which provide data 24 hours a day. The data can be used, e.g., to optimize traffic flow by controlling traffic lights dynamically. In order to minimize the number of cameras it is useful to reidentify vehicles leaving one monitored region and afterwards entering the viewing field of a further camera. From reidentified vehicles travel times can be obtained which are relevant parameters to optimize traffic control. In the present text, a method to reidentify vehicles based on extraction of 3-d-prototype vehicle models and color extraction from the top plane of vehicles is described. Shadows and light reflections on wet street are corrected, and therefore, the high recognition accuracy is achieved which is necessary to find the top plane of the vehicles. Due to the 3-d-model based analysis the cameras can be placed in a broad region of viewing angles. The algorithms are suitable for real-time applications. First results from video data of two cameras are presented which show a high reidentification rate with no false reidentification hypothesis.

The residual signals will be gotten from the comparison between the actual and prediction states. Second, a SOM neural networks is trained to classify characteristics contained in the residuals. Hence, based on the classification given by the SOM neural networks, traffic incidents can be detected. Both theory analysis and simulation research show that this algorithm is effective.

Meanwhile, a new parallel training algorithm based on training set decomposition is presented. This algorithm greatly reduces the communication cost. Experiment results show that the new algorithm converges faster than traditional one, and can meet practical requirement.

It is thus necessary to dispose of adequate and specific mathematical tools (models) which can reproduce and/or simulate different acoustic scenarios, to use for assessment and planning of the existing or future infrastructures. The experimental data measured in the city of Villa S. Giovanni, which for its particular location is always subject to heavy vehicular traffic to and from Sicily, was analysed allowing us to highlight, also in numerical form, the dependence of the equivalent level of noise L-eq from the characteristics of the vehicular traffic flows (quantity, composition and mean speed of the vehicular flow) and the typology of the roads (in particular the width of the carriageway), with the aim of comparing the behaviour of different neural networks (of the kind MLP, Multilayer Layer Perceptions, and GRNN, General Regression Neural Network), so as to supply an instrument of dynamic and flexible evaluation for the analysis of the T.N.I.

This paper concentrates mostly on results from one-an asymmetrical city centre canyon with complex building geometry, building heights up to 28 m and busy traffic. Data was recorded for a total of five working weeks in four separate periods in 2001 at one roadside location at a range of heights from 2 to 18 m. This data was supplemented by a series of mobile measurements at 2-4 m height at 18 different roadside locations within the same canyon. Although some features of a vortex-flow, as assumed in some (but by no means all) numerical models, was observed, other important flow features were found which, although canyon-specific, nevertheless indicate the ways in which flow in all real canyons may differ from the assumptions implicit in some models. Of particular importance were lateral channelled flow and sheltering in perpendicular flow. Profiles of turbulence are presented along with a simple model relating turbulence to wind speed and traffic flow rate. A strong influence of traffic on vertical turbulence production was found in a layer no deeper than 3 m. This influence was absent in measurements in a traffic-free suburban canyon.

Researchers and practitioners have employed an extensive array of approaches to calibrate these models and have selected a wide range of parameters to calibrate and a broad range of acceptance criteria. A methodical, top-down approach to model calibration is outlined; it focuses the initial effort on a few key parameters that have the greatest impact on model performance and then proceeds to less critical parameters to finalize the calibration. A three-step calibration/validation process is recommended. First, the model is calibrated for capacity at the key bottlenecks in the system (the capacity calibration step). Second, the model is calibrated for traffic flows at nonbottleneck locations in the system (the route choice calibration step). Finally, the overall model performance is calibrated against field-measured system performance measures such as travel time and delay (the system performance calibration step). This three-step process is illustrated in an example application for a freeway/arterial corridor.

A systematic validation effort was performed on an advanced microscopic traffic simulation that uses a multiregime simulation (MRS) approach for its car-following and lane-changing logic. The vigorous validation procedure includes animation comparison and quantitative/statistical analysis at both macroscopic and microscopic levels, and is illustrated through case studies. For validation at the macroscopic level, the averages and other statistics of traffic variables are compared, and fundamental relationships of traffic flow parameters are studied. For validation at the microscopic level, the speed change pattern, vehicle trajectory plots, and headway distribution from simulations are compared with those of the real-world system. The importance of the real-world data sets to model validation is emphasized, and animation comparison that provides intuitive appreciation of the model validity is frequently used. The validation and testing not only show the validity of the MRS model but also illustrate a systematic approach that can be used to validate other simulation models.

It is therefore important to monitor the traffic-flow conditions on the roads. Travel time, taken to be the time required to traverse a route between two locations, represents an effective measure of traffic flow conditions. Traditionally, travel-time study follows a cumbersome procedure, which requires tedious record keeping and involves intensive manual operations as well. The statistics commonly employed to characterize traffic flow almost entirely rely on the first-order statistics. This paper can be considered an effort to develop a fundamentally sound data-acquisition procedure that exploits the GPS technology for collecting meaningful travel-time data, accurately and efficiently, in a systematic manner. A random process based statistical model is proposed for analyzing travel-time data. In addition, analytical and software tools are developed to perform statistical analysis on the travel-time data. The objective is to formulate and obtain meaningful statistics so as to provide realistic measure of traffic flow conditions in a given roadway system.

J	Jiang, XM; Adeli, H				Jiang, XM; Adeli, H			Wavelet packet-autocorrelation function method for traffic flow pattern analysis	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							INCIDENT DETECTION; MODEL	Accurate and timely forecasting of traffic flow is of paramount importance for effective management of traffic congestion in intelligent transportation systems. A detailed understanding of the properties of traffic flow is essential for building a reliable forecasting model. The discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) provides more coefficients than the conventional discrete wavelet transform (DWT), representing additional subtle details of a signal. In wavelet multiresolution analysis, an important decision is the selection of the decomposition level. In this research, the statistical autocorrelation function (ACF) is proposed for the selection of the decomposition level in wavelet multiresolution analysis of traffic flow time series. A hybrid wavelet packet-ACF method is proposed for analysis of traffic flow time series and determining its self-similar, singular, and fractal properties. A DWPT-based approach combined with a wavelet coefficients penalization scheme and soft thresholding is presented for denoising the traffic flow. The proposed methodology provides a powerful tool in removing the noise and identifying singularities in the traffic flow. The methods created in this research are of value in developing accurate traffic-forecasting models.

It consists of more than 4,000 loop detectors, a simulator, and a microscopic and macroscopic graphical interface. These should be considered as "data input,""data processing," and "data output," respectively. First, we discuss the loop detectors: Their mode of operation, how and where they are located, and the quality of their measurements. Next, we describe the simulator, especially its high-resolution cellular automaton model of traffic flows, the abstraction of the road network into tracks and nodes, how the data from the loop detectors is integrated, and we give some details on an efficient implementation of the dynamics. Finally, we discuss the graphical interfaces, which display the simulated traffic states, and we give some concluding remarks. In particular, we present the traffic information web page www.autobahn.nrw.de, where the simulated actual traffic state on the freeway network in NRW can be sighted.

DATA AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD		English	Article; Proceedings Paper	83rd Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board	JAN 11-15, 2004	Washington, DC	Transportat Res Board, US Dept Transportat, US Bur Transportat Stat, US Fed Aviat Adm, US Fed Highway Adm, US Fed Motor Carrier Safety Adm, US Fed Railroad Adm, US FedTransit Adm, US Natl Highway Traff Safety Adm, US Res& Special Programs Adm, NASA, USA Corps Engineers, US Coast Guard, US DOE, US EPA				In practice, partial floating car runs (runs in the direction of the traffic flow of interest) plus a measured or assumed controlling bottleneck capacity could be used to estimate the total travel time delay along a freeway segment. The floating car's travel time in excess of that of user-specified free flow travel is defined as the floating car's measured travel time delay. This delay, along with the bottleneck capacity, could be used to estimate excess traffic demand. The total freeway segment delay could then be determined on the basis of the fundamental queuing diagram. To examine the quality of this estimation method, an explicit evaluation of the accuracy level of the estimated delay was conducted. Trajectory data for thousands of vehicles on six freeway facilities across the United States were analyzed, and a floating car's travel time and delay were generated (simulated) as the average travel time and delay of all its neighboring vehicles within a specified duration. This was found to be an inaccurate method. Although performance is influenced by the combination of such factors as the user-specified free flow speed (delay definition), the floating car intervals, the floating car generation method, and facility-specific traffic conditions, the assumed bottleneck capacity is observed to be the primary contributor to inaccuracy. Until a practicable method is found for determining the true How between any two consecutive floating cars to supersede the assumed capacity, the estimation should be interpreted only in its comparative sense, such as tracing the trend of delay development for a freeway facility.

Because of the substantial increase in freight truck traffic on the nation's highways, its influence on traffic flow performance, safety, and the quality of the travel experience is receiving increased attention. The behavior of non-truck drivers is modeled in terms of their interactions with trucks in the traffic stream; existing microscopic freeway traffic flow modeling logic is extended to incorporate these interactions; and alternative strategies to mitigate them are evaluated. The car-truck interactions are modeled by associating a "discomfort level" for every non-truck driver in the vicinity of trucks. This discomfort is affected by driver socioeconomic characteristics and situational factors such as time of day, weather, and ambient traffic congestion levels. Stated-preference surveys of non-truck drivers were used to elicit the factors that influence their behavior when they interact with trucks on highways. A fuzzy logic-based model was used to determine non-truck driver discomfort level. The model characterizes non-truck driver behavior near trucks by using if-then rules constructed with the survey data. The discomfort level is used in conjunction with the car-following and lane-changing logics of a traditional traffic flow model to generate a truck-following model and a corresponding lane-changing model. This redresses a key methodological gap in the literature and provides a capability to analyze alternative strategies to mitigate car-truck interactions. An agent-based freeway segment traffic flow simulator was constructed by using these extended microscopic flow models. Simulation experiments with data from the Borman Expressway (I-80 and I-94) in northwest Indiana were used to analyze the sensitivity of the model to the various parameters and evaluate the effectiveness of alternative mitigation strategies.

This paper describes a Statistical Traffic Model or STM, which is based on accepted macro-modelling concepts, such as the conservation of vehicles and the fundamental traffic diagram. In this case, the model is constructed using the well known Matlab/Simulink(TM) software package, so providing an integrated approach for data processing, graphical presentation of data, control system design and macroscopic simulation in one straightforward to use, widely available environment. To illustrate the methodology, the STM is applied to a section of the M3/M27 Ramp Metering Pilot Scheme in the UK. This Highways Agency sponsored project, based in the Southampton area, utilises traffic lights at the on-ramp entrances to regulate access to the main carriageway of the motorway, in an attempt to maintain flow close to the capacity. The paper utilises the model to help design a locally-coordinated ramp metering algorithm, based on proportional-integral-plus (PIP) control methods. In this manner, the STM proves particularly valuable for the application of multi-objective optimisation techniques in the design of new traffic management systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Many major urban areas currently have patrols, and most medium-sized urban areas are following suit. The success of FSPs has resulted in frequent requests for service expansion. However, the decision on where to put the next patrol is becoming more difficult because an assessment of greatest need typically indicates that high-priority areas already have the service, whereas the possible effects of the service are often indistinguishable on lower-priority facilities. A new approach was developed to help determine the most beneficial locations for patrol deployment by using expanded placement criteria. North Carolina was used as a case study. Analysis of three incident and crash indexes was combined with spatial analysis, incident type distributions, average hourly freeway traffic volumes, and incident delay estimations to identify, evaluate, and compare candidate facilities for FSP expansion. Results of the research were incorporated into a decision support tool that allows easy planning and operational assessment of candidate sites by comparing performance values between sites, modeling the effect of FSPs, and estimating their key potential benefits. By using the tool, decision makers can quickly assess the needs of different facilities and make an informed, cost-effective decision on where to implement the next service patrol.

Travel time information is important for advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) applications and for assessing the performance of the transportation network. Though many advances have been made in the field of traffic engineering and intelligent transportation system applications, practical travel time estimation procedures for ATIS applications under incident conditions are lacking. An algorithm for travel time estimation on urban freeways for ATIS applications under incident conditions is presented. The algorithm is based on point estimates of traffic variables obtained from detectors placed on every link of the freeway network. The output required from the detectors is flow and occupancy aggregated for a short time interval (5 min). The system for travel time estimation is based on traffic flow theory rather than on statistical methods. The travel times calculated using this system are compared with the results obtained using the FHWA microsimulation computer package CORSIM in the Traffic Software Integrated System (TSIS) Version 5.0. The algorithm results are found to be reasonable and accurate compared with CORSIM results.

The methodologies are part of an overall research effort to address the integrated operations of a diamond interchange and a ramp metering system. The methodologies were implemented in DRIVE, a computer model characterized as a mesoscopic simulation and analytical model. A mesoscopic model has the advantages of both macroscopic and microscopic models with less computing time while still considering stochastic traffic flows. DRIVE can be used to perform system analysis and evaluation of an integrated diamond interchange and ramp metering system over multiple cycles. The component concerning the diamond interchange operations is documented here, with a particular focus on the impact of potential queue spillback to the diamond interchange signals from ramp metering. The study focused on the two common diamond phasing schemes: basic three-phase and Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) four-phase. DRIVE was validated against the VISSIM microscopic traffic simulation model, and general agreement was found in the results between the two models. For oversaturated ramp conditions with queue spillback, both DRIVE and VISSIM indicated that TTI four-phase favors the frontage road approach, whereas the basic three-phase favors the arterial left-turn movement. DRIVE provides a new analysis tool for analyzing diamond interchange operations taking ramp metering into consideration, which would facilitate studies on developing operational strategies to better manage such systems.

Some non-linear features of spatial-temporal congested patterns which are linked with the individual driver behaviour are considered. The model ASDA (Automatische Staudynamikanalyse: Automatic Tracing of Moving Traffic Jams) is devoted to the tracing and prediction of the propagation of moving traffic jams. The model FOTO (Forecasting of Traffic Objects) is devoted to the identification of traffic phases "synchronized flow" and "wide moving jam" and to the tracing and prediction of the patterns of "synchronized flow". A short introduction to the three-phase traffic theory by Kemer as the basis of the models ASDA and FOTO is made. It is stressed that the models ASDA and FOTO perform without any validation of model parameters in different environmental and traffic conditions. First results of the application of ASDA and FOTO for the online automatic tracing of traffic flow patterns at the TCC (Traffic Control Center) Rodelheim near Frankfurt (Germany) are discussed.

As 13 experienced drivers drove in a high-fidelity, single-monitor driving simulator, occasionally the location of a vehicle in the road ahead or one of its properties (its color or type) would suddenly change. Sometimes, in a blocked design, the change occurred during a brief (150 ms) blanking of the screen and sometimes there was no blank. Blanking the screen eliminates local stimulus cues that normally accompany change, so detection must be based on memory. All changes were well detected in the No-blank condition. In the Blank condition, detection of location change was near zero, while detection of color and identity change remained quite good. We argue that vehicle location is coarsely represented in drivers' memory, and that this, together with vehicle features, is used to visually monitor more fine-grained location information.

Recently, a family of the Burgers cellular automata (BCA) has been proposed as multi-lane traffic flow models, which are derived from the Burgers' equation interpreted as a macroscopic traffic flow model using the ultra-discrete method. The family of BCA is suitable for digital VLSI implementation because of the discreteness and the simple update procedure. For developing efficient traffic simulators, we implemented the family of BCA as digital VLSI circuits using a scalable CMOS technology. Using computer simulator SPICE, it is shown that these circuits operate correctly, and they can be expected to be useful tools to analyze and predict the behavior of traffic flow.

However, to use this experience effectively, transportation professionals must be able to search these archives efficiently to identify cases of interest. An example of this challenge is to find past events that are similar to a current event to understand traffic flow and the impact of utilized control strategies. These similar events are referred to as nearest neighbors to the current event. To identify "near" neighbors in a data archive, a distance metric is required to measure similarity between cases. However, common distance metrics, such as Euclidean distance, are not valid when used with categorical variables, which commonly make up traffic event data. To address this challenge, this research effort developed a distance metric that can be effectively used with categorical data. The metric is based on the influence of variable values on a measurable objective meaningful to the purpose of selecting nearest neighbors. The metric was developed in a case study to identify similar past incidents in an archive to a current incident, with the objective of forecasting incident duration. When this method was incorporated in a nonparametric regression forecasting model, it was demonstrated to outperform parametric forecasting models significantly.

However, the original simplified theory deals only with freeway mainline and it would be of great interest to both theory and practice if this simple and elegant algorithm can be extended to address network traffic As part of such effort, this paper deals with simplified kinematic waves at a merge Several merge models are reviewed and a capacity-based weighted fair queuing (CBWFQ) merge model is proposed This merge model exhibits several attractive features which make it ideal for modeling merge queuing in terms of simplified theory of kinematic waves.

J	Moussa, N				Moussa, N			Cellular automata models for traffic flow with "slow-to-start" rule: Effect of randomization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						traffic flow; hysteresis; time headway; distance headway	DISTANCE-HEADWAYS; DISTRIBUTIONS; HIGHWAY; PHYSICS	In this paper, we study the effect of randomization probability p on the fundamental diagrams of the Nagel-Schreckenberg model (NS) with "slow-to-start" rule introduced by Benjamin, Johnson and Hui (BJH). It is shown that this model exhibits metastable states (which leads to the occurrence of hysteresis) only for very low values of the randomization probability (p less than or equal to 0.08). Here we propose a simple generalization of the BJH model by introducing a distance-dependent randomization. With such simple generalization, the hysteresis effect and phase separation exist for all values of randomization probability. The new fundamental diagrams are analyzed within the framework of the distributions of time and distance headways.

In this paper, a Bayesian network is originally used to model the causal relationship of time series of traffic flows among a chosen link and its adjacent links in a road network. Then, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), whose parameters are estimated through Competitive Expectation Maximization (CEM) algorithm, is applied to approximate the joint probability distribution of all nodes in the constructed Bayesian network. Finally, traffic flow forecasting of the current link is performed under the rule of Minimum Mean Square Error (M.M.S.E.). To further improve the forecasting performance, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is also adopted before carrying out the CEM algorithm. Experiments show that, by using a Bayesian network for short-term traffic flow forecasting, one can improve the forecasting accuracy significantly, and that the Bayesian network is an attractive forecasting method for such kinds of forecasting problems.

The field data were collected from a main segment of the Capital Beltway. Based on the results of exploratory analyses, this study has developed two groups of models to capture the impact of traffic conditions on the macroscopic lane-changing patterns, defined as the frequency of lane changes and the percentage of vehicles changing lanes. Both Poisson regression and logistic regression have been employed for estimation of various model specifications.

The computer simulation is carried out in view of the cause of congestion and several factors that lead to the instability of freeway traffic flow such as small time headways, large speed variance, and frequent disturbances. Many kinds of scenarios of variable speed limits system that can control the freeway traffic flow effectively are simulated. The simulation results indicate that the VSL benefits are obvious when the traffic volume is equal to or greater than 2800veh/h (double lane) while resolving demand driven congestion, which is shown as increase of the served traffic volume, saving of travel time and reduction of speed deviation. The results also indicate that it can reduce the queue time and stops, avoid happening of congestion and save travel time when the traffic volume is equal to or greater than 2000veh/h (double lane) while resolving supply driven congestion. However, the VSL acquit its limits when the traffic volume is greater than traffic capability, it only delay the occurrence of congestion and don't avoid that, so VSL needs cooperate with other measures such as RM (Ramp Metering) to control the traffic flow when the traffic are high. The simulation of variable speed limits system on freeway and the result analysis can offer the basis for implementing VSL, and can offer basic data for the social and economic impact evaluation of VSL.

Weaving sections are typical type to carry out merge and diverge in urban expressways; meanwhile it is usually a traffic congested bottleneck and incident spot and is characterized for intense lane-changing and complicated driver behavior. Four weaving sections are simulated in CORSIM platform using field data come from Traffic Information Collecting System in Shanghai China. Numerous simulation test indicted there are difference in recurring off-peak and peak time traffic flow in weaving sections. Considering china vehicle performance, road status and driver behavior this conclusion is determined: the main parameters affecting simulation precision are desired free-flow speed, warning sign position, gap acceptance, yield value and time to complete lane-change. Good results are obtained after using the calibrated CORSIM model in simulating weaving sections.

The objectives of this paper are to analyze the rate at which vehicular traffic intensity is substituted for increments of pedestrians on footpaths and to evaluate alternative measures of vehicular traffic intensity. Three segments on arterial road Ile-Ife, Nigeria, were selected for study. The length of each segment was 94 m, 78m and 90m. The number of pedestrians on footpaths (left and right sides) and vehicular traffic characteristics (Volume and Speed) were recorded for each segment during ten different time periods. Regression analysis was then used to express vehicular characteristics as a function of pedestrians on footpaths. The results of the research illustrate the importance of the control of footpath space as a means of preserving the road/road environment provided by urban arterial.

J	Hooshdar, S; Adeli, H				Hooshdar, S; Adeli, H			Toward intelligent variable message signs in freeway work zones: Neural network model	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						neural networks; traffic management; highways; transportation networks		An increasingly popular method of managing freeway traffic is to use variable message signs (VMS). A neural network model is presented for real-time control of a VMS system in freeway work zones. The neural network is trained to detect the start of a queue in a work zone and provide a message in the freeway upstream. The travelers are informed about the congestion in a work zone when a queue starts to form. The intelligent VMS system can be trained with data for different periods within a day, such as morning and evening rush hours, nonrush hours during the day, and night, for a more detailed traffic flow prediction over the period of one day. Two different neural network training rules are used: the simple backpropagation (BP) and the Levenberg-Marquardt BP algorithms. The network is trained using data adapted from the measured data.

J	Adeli, H; Ghosh-Dastidar, S				Adeli, H; Ghosh-Dastidar, S			Mesoscopic-wavelet freeway work zone flow and congestion feature extraction model	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article							TRAFFIC FLOW	A new mesoscopic-wavelet model is presented for simulating freeway traffic flow patterns and extracting congestion characteristics. A traffic speed-density relationship is introduced with a lane drop factor to take into account lane closures in freeway work zones. Patterns of multiple parameters are inputted to a congestion feature extraction algorithm. An approximate solution for this equation is found by space-time discretization. The high frequency fluctuations of the signal are not recognizable at normal resolutions. To overcome this problem, a multi-resolution wavelet filter is introduced in the proposed model to enhance traffic features and extract congestion characteristics from the traffic data. Fourth-order Coifman wavelets are used for filtering because of their good approximation for high-resolution scaling.

This has negative impacts on 'less profitable' uses, such as agriculture, outdoor recreation and nature, traditionally dominating open spaces. Land use planning is essential to weigh these developments one against another. Herewith road infrastructure needs especially attention because each single land use has its own claims on this network. On the other hand, negative impacts by noise and emissions are evident. To make these visible, the planner needs tools: an information system to judge the regional road network and to compare alternatives. We present the structure of such a system and show an application in a southern region of the Netherlands where about 65000 people are living on an acreage of about 180km(2). The region is bounded by trunk roads and a dense network of merely minor rural roads gives access to villages, hamlets and individual farms. Traffic flows are diffuse and a part of the network is overloaded. Traffic safety is a problem. To solve these problems two alternatives for the present network are developed In variant A traffic safety is the leading idea, in variant B, besides safety, accessibility is the basis for the alternative network. In both variants former diffuse flows are concentrated on the trunk roads. The model considers effects on traffic flows, accessibility and safety as well as environmental effects for human and animal. These effects are calculated and visualized per road section and aggregated for the region in a GIS. Compared with the present situation, both variants show a considerable improvement for traffic safety and a very modest decrease of rural accessibilty.

This paper deals with a systematic way to acquire knowledge about the probabilities of successful road crossing by mammals and what characteristics affect this traversability. We derive a model from traffic flow theory to estimate traffic mortality in mammals related to relevant road, traffic and species characteristics. The probability of successful road crossing is determined by the pavement width of the road, traffic volume, traversing speed of the mammals and their body length. We include the traversability model in a simple two-patch population model to explore the effects of these road, traffic and species characteristics on population dynamics. Analysis of the models show that, for our parameter ranges, traffic volume and traversing speed have the largest effect on traffic mortality. The population size is especially negatively affected when roads have to be crossed during the daily movements. These predictions could be useful to determine the expected effectiveness of mitigating measures relative to the current situation. Mitigating measures might alter the road and traffic characteristics. The effects of these changes on traffic mortality and population dynamics could be analysed by calculating the number of traffic victims before and after the mitigating measures.

Due to practical limitations, traffic flows recorded can be partially missing or unavailable. In this case few methods can deal with forecasting successfully. In this paper two methods based on the concept of Bayesian networks are originally proposed to cope with this matter. A Bayesian network model and a two-step Bayesian network model are constructed respectively to describe the causal relationship among traffic flows, and then the joint probability distribution between the cause and effect nodes with its dimension reduced by Principal Component Analysis is approximated through a Gaussian Mixture Model. The parameters of the Gaussian Mixture Model are learned through the Competitive EM algorithm. Experiments show that the proposed Bayesian network methods are applicable and effective for traffic flow forecasting with incomplete data.

The safety implications of these two layouts are not well understood. First, the safety implications of work zone left-lane closures and right-lane closures for three-lane freeway segments are assessed. Lack of safety is measured on the basis of two traffic-flow characteristics: uncomfortable deceleration and speed variance. These characteristics are obtained for specific work zone layouts by using microlevel simulation (INTEGRATION). Second, an alternative, more channelized lane closure layout is proposed and its safety benefits are compared with those associated with the current left-lane and right-lane closures. The results of the simulation suggest that the proposed channelized lane closure layout results in lower values of uncomfortable deceleration and speed variance and thus improves safety for the three-lane freeway segment.

Numerous states have policies related to traffic flow thresholds, vehicle delay, and vehicle queue lengths that provide guidance on conditions when short-term lane closures can be instituted. Generally, traffic How threshold limits are a function of traffic-stream characteristics, highway geometry, work zone location, type of construction activities, and work zone configuration. A research study was initiated in South Carolina to examine quantitatively the development and implementation of a methodology for use in determining an updated lane-closure policy based on state-specific parameters. The study focused on determining the number of vehicles per lane per hour that can pass through short-term Interstate work zone lane closures with minimal or acceptable levels of delay. Research tasks included a survey of policies of other states, field-data collection, and methodology development. A methodology was developed with field data collected from 22 work zone sites along South Carolina's Interstate system. Data were obtained during a 12-month period from September 2601 to August 2002. Data collection procedures and data analysis methods employed in model development are summarized. Results of this study may be helpful to state highway agencies interested in developing similar research-based policy guidelines for short-term Interstate lane closures in their jurisdictions.

Traffic needs and the motorization rate are increasing due to economic growth, which in turn tends to further generate rapid increase in traffic flow on the Slovenian road network. Thus an attempt to establish the influence of traffic flow on environmental degradation has been made. For this purpose road vehicle noise was analysed. After evaluating the mean speed of vehicles and the gradient of each road section, a model for computation of noise levels was applied. The Global Positioning System (GPS) device was used to determine the actual speed on chosen road sections which enabled the calculation of the influence of the slope and the number of crossroads on the average speed. The ArcView program was used for the Geographical Information System (GIS) approach to forecast noise levels, as well as to present the results of the analysis. The results confirmed a significant influence by traffic flow on noise.

We have applied an optimal velocity model including stochastic noise, where cars are treated as moving and interacting particles. The motion of N cars is described by the system of 2N stochastic differential equations with multiplicative white noise. Our system of cars behaves in qualitatively different ways depending on the values of control parameters c (dimensionless density), b (sensitivity parameter characterising the fastness of relaxation), and a (dimensionless noise intensity). In analogy to the gas-liquid phase transition in supersaturated vapour at low enough temperatures, we observe three different regimes of traffic flow at small enough values of b < b(cr). There is the free flow regime (like gaseous phase) at small densities of cars, the coexistence of a jam and free flow (like liquid and gas) at intermediate densities, and homogeneous dense traffic (like liquid phase) at large densities. The transition from free flow to congested traffic occurs when the homogeneous solution becomes unstable and evolves into the limit cycle. The opposite process takes place at a different density, so that we have a hysteresis effect and phase transition of the first order. A phase transition of second order, characterised by critical exponents, takes place at a certain critical density c = c(cr). Inclusion of the stochastic noise allows us to calculate the distribution of headway distances and time headways between the successive cars, as well as the distribution of jam (car cluster) sizes in a congested traffic.

J	Yokoya, Y				Yokoya, Y			Dynamics of traffic flow with real-time traffic information	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							ASYMMETRIC EXCLUSION MODEL; CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; NETWORK; MICROSIMULATION; ADAPTATION; SIMULATION; DIAGRAM	We studied dynamics of traffic flow with real-time information provided. Provision of the real-time traffic information based on advancements in telecommunication technology is expected to facilitate the efficient utilization of available road capacity. This system has a potentiality of not only engineering for road usage but also the science of complexity series. In the system, the information plays a role of feedback connecting microscopic and macroscopic phenomena beyond the hierarchical structure of statistical physics. In this paper, we tried to clarify how the information works in a network of traffic flow from the perspective of statistical physics. The dynamical feature of the traffic flow is abstracted by a contrastive study between the nonequilibrium statistical physics and a computer simulation based on cellular automaton. We found that the information disrupts the local equilibrium of traffic flow by a characteristic dissipation process due to interaction between the information and individual vehicles. The dissipative structure was observed in the time evolution of traffic flow driven far from equilibrium as a consequence of the breakdown of the local-equilibrium hypothesis.

The model takes into account the main property of traffic flows, namely, the property of self-organisation, and enables the conditions required to ensure maximum carrying capacity to be described correctly both qualitatively and quantitatively, as well as the occurrence and evolution of "travelling traffic jams" on roads, as well as the effect of road traffic control units.

The scheme can be used in two situations: a) When there are no traffic flow sensors appropriately located and b) When available sensors are faulty. It is assumed that some traffic flow and velocity measurements are available in the vicinity of the place where an on-ramp is located. Based on this information, a non-linear adaptive observer for vehicle density is designed that also estimates the mixing factors that define the traffic flow characteristics: free or congested. The design is based on Lyapunov techniques that take advantage of the structure of the conservation of vehicles model.

In this paper we focus on some structural properties of one particular traffic flow model: the macroscopic, second-order gas-kinetic traffic flow model of Helbing. We will show that the model has two families of characteristics for the shock wave solutions: one characteristic is slower and the other one is faster than the average vehicle speed. Corresponding to the slower characteristic there are 1-shocks and 1-rarefaction waves, corresponding to the faster characteristic there are 2-shocks and 2-rarefaction waves. We also derive the formulas for the solution of the Riemann problem associated with this model in the equilibrium case, proving that the solution of this problem with density and flow non-negative in the initial condition on either side of the discontinuity cannot give rise to negative flow or density later on.

The model relies on a modified version of the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) partial differential equation (PDE), which contains a velocity control term inside the divergence operator. We relate the PDE to aircraft count, which is a key metric in Air Traffic Control. Using the method of characteristics, we construct an analytical solution to the LWR PDE for the case in which the control depends only on space (and not time). We validate our model against real Air Traffic Data (ETMS data), by first showing that the Eulerian description enables good aircraft count predictions, provided a good choice of numerical parameters is made. Finally, we show some predictive capabilities of the model.			bayen@stanford.edu					ANSORGE R, 1990, TRANSPORT RES B-METH, V24, P133, DOI 10.1016/0191-2615(90)90024-S; Bayen AM, 2001, IEEE DECIS CONTR P, P1657, DOI 10.1109/CDC.2001.981139; BAYEN AM, 2004, P AM CONTR C BOST JU; Bilimoria K., 2001, P 3 US EUR AIR TRAFF; CHATTERJI G, 2003, P AIAA C GUID NAV CO; Chen C, 2001, IEEE CONTR SYST MAG, V21, P26, DOI 10.1109/37.969132; DAGANZO CF, 1994, TRANSPORT RES B-METH, V28, P269, DOI 10.1016/0191-2615(94)90002-7; DAGANZO CF, 1995, TRANSPORT RES B-METH, V29, P79, DOI 10.1016/0191-2615(94)00022-R; LIGHTHILL MJ, 1955, PROC R SOC LON SER-A, V229, P317, DOI 10.1098/rspa.1955.0089; MENON PK, 2002, P AIAA C GUID NAV CO; MUNOZ L, 2003, P AM CONTR C DENV CO; RICHARDS PI, 1956, OPER RES, V4, P42, DOI 10.1287/opre.4.1.42; WANG Y, 2003, P EUR CONTR C CAMBR	13	15	15	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	0743-1619		0-7803-8335-4	P AMER CONTR CONF			2004							5520	5526					7	Automation & Control Systems	Automation & Control Systems	BBC09	WOS:000224688300938					2021-01-11

Traffic congestion wastes a huge portion of the national income for fuel and traffic-related environmental and socioeconomic problems. Computer simulation is a powerful tool for analyzing complex and dynamic scenarios. It provides an appealing approach to analyze repetitive processes. Simulation helps decision makers identify different possible options by analyzing enormous amounts of data. Hence, computer simulation can be used effectively to analyze traffic flow patterns and signal light timing. This paper discusses a special-purpose simulation (SPS) tool for optimize traffic signal light timing. The simulation model is capable of optimizing signal light timing at a single junction as well as an actual road network with multiple junctions. It also provides signal light timing for certain time periods according to traffic demand. Traffic engineers at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka are testing the developed tool for actual applications.

The study mainly focuses on the alleviation of a sudden traffic flow surge following special events (e.g., concerts, conventions, hockey games, etc.) held at the city's Entertainment and Convention Center. A practical approach for signal timing control that eliminates the need of using traffic flow model is used to optimize the intersection traffic light split times. Our approach is based on neural networks (NNs) with the weight estimation via the Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) algorithm. Based on the traffic data collected and the measure-of-effectiveness (MOE) criterion used, the NN weights are adjusted by use of the SPSA algorithm that minimizes the MOE criterion. The performance evaluation using the existing signal timing plan and the one generated by the SPSA algorithm is also compared. The results show the potential to apply this method to control the signal timing over a large-scale road network.

One-way traffic network benefit analysis should be considered from two parts, expenditure and saving. Five supposing conditions, the base of one-way traffic network beneficial analysis, are given. One-way traffic expenditure and saving are compared with traditional method and various potential effects brought by one-way traffic are considered synthetically. And then three aspects of benefits are analyzed. Formula of direct benefits is put forward. One-way traffic social indirect benefits are analyzed from three aspects. Social benefit of one-way traffic network is the sum of direct and indirect benefits. The calculation formula of the general cost of individual trippers is brought forward. Finally, one-way traffic network beneficial model is established and an example of Harbin city is made, by comparing its one-way traffic planning program with present condition, in order to analyzing the network economic benefits brought by one-way traffic planning program.

The system composed of traffic-flow in crossroads can be represented with water tank hybrid dynamic system. In this model, keeping its stabilization is to limit the number of cars in a given distance. The given distance corresponds with the water tank. If this model is stable, the road is expedite, if not, traffic jam will occur. So the chief aim of this paper is to find out the conditions to keep this system stable. And in this paper, a Round Robin policy in traffic system has been studied, and the stable conditions are given. Other topics, such as performance evaluation has been discussed.

Poisson and negative binomial regression models were fit to intersection crash data from Georgia, California, and Michigan. To assess the suitability of the models, several goodness-of-fit measures were computed. The statistical models were then used to shed light on the relationships between crash occurrence and traffic and geometric features of the rural signalized intersections. The results revealed that traffic flow variables significantly affected the overall safety performance of the intersections regardless of intersection type and that the geometric features of intersections varied across intersection type and also influenced crash type.

A crash likelihood prediction model was developed by using real-time traffic flow variables (measured through a series of underground sensors) potentially associated with crash occurrence. The issues related to real-time application, including range of stations and time slice duration to be examined, were also addressed. The methodology used, matched case-control logistic regression, was adopted from epidemiological studies in which every crash is a case and corresponding noncrashes act as controls. The 5-min average occupancy observed at the upstream station during the 5 to 10 min before the crash, along with the 5-min coefficient of variation in speed at the downstream station during the same time, was found to affect crash occurrence most significantly and hence was used to calculate the corresponding log-odds ratio. A threshold value for this ratio may then be set to determine whether the location must be flagged as a potential crash location. It was shown that by using 1.0 as the threshold for the log-odds ratio, more than 69% crash identification was achieved.

The data used were for 337 daytime crashes that occurred on Interstate 4 in 1999 in Orlando, Florida (13.25 mi), where corresponding loop detector traffic data were available upstream and downstream of the location of every crash and for at least 30 min before the crash occurred. The traffic data included average speed, volume, and occupancy rate for every 30 s at 0.5-mi intervals. Traffic characteristics for noncrash cases at the same locations and at similar times of the crash cases were extracted and fed to the model. The generalized estimating equations technique with binomial probit link function was used to account for correlation between crashes that occurred at the same location. Three different correlation structures (independent, exchangeable, autoregressive) were used, discussed, and compared. The modeling results showed that the existence of an on-ramp increases the likelihood of a crash within 0.5 mi downstream of the crash location. High variability in speed for a period of 15 min in a certain location was shown to increase the likelihood of a crash 0.5 mi downstream. Unlike speed, low variability in volume over 15 min was shown to increase the likelihood of a crash at 1 mi downstream.

But theories and methods are far from application. More than 10,000 traffic accidents in Harbin were analyzed, and it is concluded that accident rates at intersections are greatly reduced after signals are set up (40 percent on average). Random vehicle flow is compressed into orderly impulse flow when signals are set up, and accident rates on road sections are influenced as well. A half-experience formula to estimate the accident rate on sections is described. On the basis of these theories, standards for setting up signals are discussed, and it is recommended that traffic safety as well as traffic capacity be seriously considered. Finally, the impacts of some traffic control measures, such as channelization, improvement of signal timing, and application of advanced intelligent transportation systems (ITS) techniques, on accident rate at intersections are analyzed.

Using the so-called Product-Limit Method, it is able to determine the distribution of capacities on freeways before a breakdown. The distribution of capacities after a breakdown can be observed directly by measuring the departure capacity behind the bottleneck. Combining the capacities before and after a breakdown, the presented paper introduces a mathematical method to obtain the distribution of the overall capacity which takes both the free traffic and sporadic breakdowns into account. Using the results of the presented approach, the mean capacity and the risk of disruption (breakdowns, duration of congestion) of the traffic flow on freeways can be estimated and analyzed.

The relation between average delay and density for different deceleration probabilities has been presented. The results show that the delays of vehicles are directly related to the dynamic characteristics of vehicles and the density of the lane.

In this model, fluxes through boundaries and junctions are computed systematically under the supply-demand framework. In addition, traffic is modeled by commodity type so that the effects of geometric characteristics of a road network on traffic dynamics can be captured. Although traffic is not ordered down to the vehicle level as in existing kinematic wave simulation models, the noncompliance with the first-in-first-out property in this model is still of the order of At, the time increment. Hence travel times in the average sense can be defined from cumulative curves. Finally, the evolution of traffic dynamics in a sample road network is shown to demonstrate the stability, numerical convergence, and soundness of the proposed network kinematic wave model.

The model is used to analyze arterial throughput and travel times for given densities, coordination schemes, and signal spacings. A fundamental three-dimensional relationship is established between flow, density, and offsets for signalized arterials. In particular, it is shown that arterial throughput is dependent on offsets and that the constituent single-intersection limiting capacity, as determined by the saturation How and the green splits, can be realized only under optimal coordination conditions for a limited range of densities on the arterial. This finding is a manifestation of the important role that signal coordination and, in fact, intelligent transportation systems in general play in the operation of urban street networks.

From these results a macroscopic traffic flow model for freeway upgrades based on a two-stage linear speed-density relation was developed. All relevant external influences such as degree of gradient and length of upgrade together with traffic flow parameters such as volume or proportion of heavy vehicles may be included through specific parameters. On the basis of this analysis, it was found that capacity depended solely on the degree of the gradient. Capacity was not influenced by gradient length. Velocity, however, was determined not only by the degree of the gradient but also by the length of the upgrade (up to L <= 4,000 m). Results were formulated to be ready for application in practice. They form, for instance, the basis of the chapter on freeways in the new German version of the U.S. Highway Capacity Manual, Handbuch fur die Beinessung von Stra ss enverkehrsanlagen.

These 18- to 22-seat vehicles, which evolved from American army service jeeps left after World War II, provide inexpensive and convenient door-to-door service but cause disruptions in traffic flow because of aggressive and problematic driving behavior, particularly when stopping to pick up or unload passengers. Other vehicles are observed to experience delays, especially in the vicinity of midblock jeepney stops with high passenger demand. An overview of work done in building and validating a traffic microsimulation program focuses on modeling the distinctive stopping behavior of jeepneys that considers both transit vehicle and passenger agents. Propensity for nonobservance of lanes and aggressive lateral movements of general traffic are considered in the model. There is also a discussion of the result of simulation experiments that used the developed simulation model called JSTOPSIM and are designed to analyze trends on average vehicle delay experienced by through vehicles as passenger demand and volume of transit and non-public transit vehicles vary. The capability to quantify objectively delays attributable to jeepney stops is important in advocating policies to improve design and operation for the improvement of the public transit system as a whole.

It is based oil a master equation for the single car probability density in space, velocity, and acceleration with an additional vehicular chaos assumption and is derived via a Markovian ansatz for car pairs. This equation is analyzed using simple driver interaction models in the spatial homogeneous Case. Velocity distributions in stochastic equilibrium, together with the car density dependence of their moments, i.e., mean velocity and scattering and the fundamental diagram are presented.

However, when factors that influence travel are changing significantly over time, such as with an approaching hurricane, dynamic demand and the resulting variation in traffic flow on the network become important. The decision to evacuate in the face of an oncoming hurricane is considered as a series of binary choices over time. A sequential binary logit model is developed to model the probability that the members of a household will evacuate at each time period before hurricane landfall as a function of the household's socioeconomic characteristics, the characteristics of the hurricane, and policy decisions made by authorities as the storm approaches. Data collected in southwest Louisiana after Hurricane Andrew were used to estimate a model that produced dynamic travel demand estimates of hurricane evacuation. On the basis of the results, a sequential logit model appears to be capable of modeling dynamic evacuation demand satisfactorily.

In the first phase of analysis the influence of various traffic parameters on lane utilization was identified. It is demonstrated from this study that non-motorized vehicles influence the lane utilization patterns of heterogeneous traffic flow. The lane utilization pattern of heterogeneous traffic flow is unique and it is differ from that of homogeneous traffic flow. In the second phase of analysis lane utilization model for heterogeneous traffic flow were developed using parameters such as total traffic flow, density, average speed and proportion of non-motorized vehicles. The results of modeling showed the underutilization of lane due to the presence of non-motorized vehicles.

The rationale for prediction reasoning is based on the "fuzzy proportion" inference from similar historical trajectories that are within a "confined space" defined by a spatial threshold in the reconstructed state space. To perform the inference, we assign to each trajectory with unequal weight that is proportional to the relative distance to the latest (present) data vector. The United States I-35 Freeway one-minute flow data are used to construct and validate the proposed model. We employ Theil inequality coefficient (U) and its decomposed proportions to evaluate the prediction performance and to analyze the sources of prediction errors. The empirical results have demonstrated extremely high predictive capability of this CSFP model. The small bias and variance proportions of U statistic further indicate that the prediction model can successfully capture the trends and conspicuous fluctuations of one-minute traffic flow variations.

A field study is carried out using the one-minute flow time series data drawn from the United States 1-35 Freeway. The distinction of chaoticity and randomness is made between the original traffic data and their surrogates. We find that the geometric plots including iterated-function system clumpiness map, correlation function plot, and power spectrum have displayed apparent difference between the original and surrogate data and that the statistics including delay time, Hurst exponent, and relative complexity have also revealed noticeable discrepancy between them. These indexes have demonstrated strong evidences of chaotic, not random, phenomena in the nature of freeway one-minute traffic time series dynamics.

How these parameters, especially the length of the vehicles, influence the traffic behaviors and transportation capability has seldom been investigated. In this paper, we study this issue using the cellular automata traffic flow model. We find that when the road occupancy rate is large, increasing the ratio of long vehicles can improve the transportation capability apparently. We also discussed the influence of slow vehicles ratio on the average velocity of vehicles, it is found that the influences are very different when the difference of vehicle length is considered or not.

The procedure is aimed at reducing disutility measures to motorists during the transition period. The transition is modeled as a linear dynamic process, and the disutility measures are modeled as the sum of squares of the deviations of the coordination parameters-that is, cycle length, phase split, and offset-from the optimal values during the transition. Optimal control techniques are used to determine the step size and optimal number of steps necessary to complete the transition with minimum disruption to traffic flow. The proposed transition procedure does not go beyond the current and the target cycle lengths thus eliminating the need for the user to specify minimum and maximum values of splits and cycle lengths to accommodate pedestrians and other local intersection needs. A simulation study showed that the proposed transition method reduced the queue delay for minor streets in one scenario by an average of 5.88 percent, compared to the immediate transition method embedded in CORSIM. However, the method slightly increased delay on the major street by approximately 1.43% compared to CORSIM's immediate method. The paper further discusses techniques that could improve the performance of the proposed algorithm under various geometric and traffic conditions.								Anderson B.

The planners of the "Plan of Urban Traffic" (PUT) actually take into account the sole possibility of increasing the average speed of the run of traffic flow but they do not consider the health hazard for city dwellers that may be caused by PUT as regards air pollution coming from exhaust pipes, especially in a supersaturated urban area. To achieve a good PUT one needs to take into account both the solution of traffic problems and the control of health hazards caused by air pollution. To this aim, this paper shows some results achieved by application and testing of MISKAM fluid dynamic code used as the key to forecasting concentrations of polluting gases in a large area of Catania city (Italy) marked by very large flows of motor vehicles throughout the day. The knowledge of forecasted air pollution, zone by zone, could guide the planners to the best choices to achieve both goals: to increase average speed and to avoid health hazards.

This traffic-noise-GIS based integrated toot is upgraded to predict noise levels in built-up areas. The integration of traffic simulation with a noise model provides dynamic access to traffic flow characteristics and hence automated and detailed predictions of traffic noise. The prediction is not only on the spatial scale but also on temporal scale. The linkage with GIS gives a visual representation to noise pollution in the form of dynamic areawide traffic noise contour maps. The application of DRONE on a real world built-up area is also presented.

Diesel particulate emissions vary by engine operating characteristics (e.g., engine load, RPM), and operational characteristics will vary by facility type and congestion levels, thus producing different particulate emission levels. Existing emission factor models capture this effect through a functional relationship where the emissions vary with respect to vehicle speed. Second by second measurements on the US federal test procedure dynamometer driving cycle show PM10 spikes at the hard acceleration points. Transportation plans attempt to reduce congestion and smooth traffic flow. This paper combines available data on variations in diesel particulate emissions with engine operations to provide guidance on how transportation plans can indirectly affect the carcinogenic risk associated with diesel particulate matter from mobile sources.

J	Hodas, NO; Jagota, A				Hodas, NO; Jagota, A			Microscopic modeling of multi-lane highway traffic flow	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article							SYSTEMS	We discuss a microscopic model for the study of multi-lane highway traffic flow dynamics. Each car experiences a force resulting from a combination of the desire of the driver to attain a certain velocity, aerodynamic drag, and change of the force due to car-car interactions. The model also includes multi-lane simulation capability and the ability to add and remove obstructions. We implement the model via a Java applet, which is used to simulate traffic jam formation, the effect of bottlenecks on traffic flow, and the existence of light, medium, and heavy traffic flow. The simulations also provide insight into how the properties of individual cars result in macroscopic behavior. Because the investigation of emergent characteristics is so common in physics, the study of traffic in this manner sheds new light on how the micro-to-macro transition works in general.

J	Lee, C; Hellinga, B; Saccomanno, F				Lee, C; Hellinga, B; Saccomanno, F			Proactive freeway crash prevention using real-time traffic control	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						crash; accident; freeway; safety; traffic flow; real-time control	SPEED; FLOW	This paper makes use of a probabilistic model that predicts the likelihood of crashes (crash potential) on freeways on the basis of traffic flow conditions, in real-time crash prevention. The model was developed using incident logs and loop detector data collected over a 13-month period on the Gardiner Expressway in Toronto. Previous work suggested that an increase in levels of traffic turbulence generally yields high crash potential. Traffic turbulence was defined in terms of a series of crash precursors that represent traffic conditions that were present prior to crash occurrence. To apply the model in crash prevention, the link needs to be established between crash potential and real-time safety intervention. The objective of this paper is to explore this link for different thresholds of crash potential. The paper discusses the guidelines for evaluating the safety benefit of one crash prevention strategy (variable speed limits) and suggests the risk-based evaluation framework for real-time traffic control.

J	Bose, A; Ioannou, PA				Bose, A; Ioannou, PA			Analysis of traffic flow with mixed manual and semiautomated vehicles	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						environmental savings; semiautomated vehicle; string stability; traffic flow		The introduction of semiautomated vehicles designed to operate with manually driven vehicles is a realistic near-term objective. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effects on traffic-flow characteristics and environment when semiautomated vehicles with automatic vehicle following capability (in the same lane) operate together with manually driven vehicles. We have shown that semiautomated vehicles do not contribute to the slinky effect phenomenon when the lead manual vehicle performs smooth acceleration maneuvers. We have demonstrated that semiautomated vehicles help smooth traffic flow by filtering the response of rapidly accelerating lead vehicles. The accurate speed tracking and the smooth response of the semiautomated vehicles designed for passenger comfort reduces fuel consumption and levels of pollutants of following vehicles. This reduction is significant when the lead manual vehicle performs rapid acceleration maneuvers. We have demonstrated using simulations that the fuel consumption and pollution levels present in manual traffic can be reduced during rapid acceleration transients by 28.5% and 1.5%-60.6%, respectively, due to the presence of 10% semiautomated vehicles. These environmental benefits are obtained without any adverse effects on the traffic-flow rates. Experiments with actual vehicles are used to validate the theoretical and simulation results.

J	Jia, B; Jiang, R; Wu, QS				Jia, B; Jiang, R; Wu, QS			The traffic bottleneck effects caused by the lane closing in the cellular automata model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						lane closing; bottleneck; cellular automata; density inversion	PHASE-TRANSITIONS; FLOW; RULES; RAMPS	As a kind of bottleneck, the lane closing has seldomly been investigated with cellular automata model. In this paper, we study this issue using the cellular automata traffic flow model. The capacity and the density distribution of this kind of bottleneck are discussed in details. We find that (i) the capacity of the bottleneck is a little smaller than the maximum flow rate of single-lane road; (ii) different regulations may lead to different density distributions of the vehicles upstream of the lane closing. Moreover, the density inversion phenomenon is reported under certain conditions. This enlightens us to propose that the phenomenon of density inversion reported in many publications may be caused by the bottlenecks on the highway.

J	Burger, R; Karlsen, KH				Burger, R; Karlsen, KH			On a diffusively corrected kinematic-wave traffic flow model with changing road surface conditions	MATHEMATICAL MODELS & METHODS IN APPLIED SCIENCES			English	Article						traffic flow model; conservation laws; convection-diffusion equations; discontinuous flux; finite difference scheme; numerical simulation	DIFFERENCE APPROXIMATIONS; HYDRODYNAMIC MODELS; DRIVERS BEHAVIOR	The well-known Lighthill-Whitham-Richards kinematic traffic flow model for unidirectional flow on a single-lane highway is extended to include both abruptly changing road surface conditions and drivers' reaction time and anticipation length. The result is a strongly degenerate convection-diffusion equation, where the diffusion term, accounting for the drivers' behavior, is effective only where the local car density exceeds a critical value, and the convective flux function depends discontinuously on the location. It is shown that the validity of the proposed traffic model is supported by a recent mathematical well-posedness (existence and uniqueness) theory for quasilinear degenerate parabolic convection-diffusion equations with discontinuous coefficients.(20,22) This theory includes a convergence proof for a monotone finite-difference scheme, which is used herein to simulate the traffic flow model for a variety of situations.

J	Nishinari, K; Treiber, M; Helbing, D				Nishinari, K; Treiber, M; Helbing, D			Interpreting the wide scattering of synchronized traffic data by time gap statistics	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; MICROSCOPIC MODEL; FLOW; STATES; PHYSICS	Based on the statistical evaluation of experimental single-vehicle data, we propose a quantitative interpretation of the erratic scattering of flow-density data in synchronized traffic flows. A correlation analysis suggests that the dynamical flow-density data are well compatible with the so-called jam line characterizing fully developed traffic jams, if one takes into account the variation of their propagation speed due to the large variation of the netto time gaps (the inhomogeneity of traffic flow). The form of the time gap distribution depends not only on the density, but also on the measurement cross section: The most probable netto time gap in congested traffic flow upstream of a bottleneck is significantly increased compared to uncongested freeway sections. Moreover, we identify different power-law scaling laws for the relative variance of netto time gaps as a function of the sampling size. While the exponent is -1 in free traffic corresponding to statistically independent time gaps, the exponent is about -2/3 in congested traffic flow because of correlations between queued vehicles.

J	Bose, A; Ioannou, P				Bose, A; Ioannou, P			Mixed manual/semi-automated traffic: a macroscopic analysis	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						intelligent cruise control (ICC) vehicles; semi-automated vehicles; mixed traffic; flow-density curve; macroscopic behavior; shock waves; space-time diagrams; queuing theory		The use of advanced technologies and intelligence in vehicles and infrastructure could make the current highway transportation system much more efficient. Semi-automated vehicles with the capability of automatically following a vehicle in front as long as it is in the same lane and in the vicinity of the forward looking ranging sensor are expected to be deployed in the near future. Their penetration into the current manual traffic will give rise to mixed manual/semi-automated traffic. In this paper, we analyze the fundamental flow-density curve for mixed traffic using flow-density curves for 100% manual and 100% semi-automated traffic. Assuming that semi-automated vehicles use a time headway smaller than today's manual traffic average due to the use of sensors and actuators, we have shown using the flow-density diagram that the traffic flow rate will increase in mixed traffic. We have also shown that the flow-density curve for mixed traffic is restricted between the flow-density curves for 100% manual and 100% semi-automated traffic. We have presented in a graphical way that the presence of semi-automated vehicles in mixed traffic propagates a shock wave faster than in manual traffic. We have demonstrated that the presence of semi-automated vehicles does not change the total travel time of vehicles in mixed traffic. Though we observed that with 50% semi-automated vehicles a vehicle travels 10.6% more distance than a vehicle in manual traffic for the same time horizon and starting at approximately the same position, this increase is marginal and is within the modeling error. Lastly, we have shown that when shock waves on the highway produce stop-and-go traffic, the average delay experienced by vehicles at standstill is lower in mixed traffic than in manual traffic, while the average number of vehicles at standstill remains unchanged.

Both single-lane main road and two-lane main road situations are studied. The variation of the phase diagram with the randomization probability p is studied. A new phase, i.e., the maximum flow phase Is reported in the two-lane main road situation. The capacity of the on-ramp system under different p and upsilon(max) is discussed.

J	Helbing, D				Helbing, D			A section-based queueingy-theoretical traffic model for congestion and travel time analysis in networks	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND GENERAL			English	Article							PHASE-TRANSITIONS; KINEMATIC WAVES; FLOW; STATES; SYSTEMS; PHYSICS; JAMS	While many classical traffic models treat the spatial extension of streets continuously or by discretization into cells of a certain length Deltax, we will subdivide roads into comparatively long homogeneous road sections of constant capacity with an inhomogeneity at the end. The related model is simple and numerically efficient. It is inspired by models of dynamic queueing networks and takes into account essential features of traffic flows. Instead of treating single vehicles or velocity profiles, it focusses on flows at specific cross sections and average travel times of vehicles.

Two important lines of research-modeling of loading of urban transportation network and modeling of traffic flow dynamics-were discussed. For modeling of loading, consideration was given to the models for calculation of correspondences and distribution of flows over the network including different variants of equilibrium distribution and the optimal strategy algorithm. The main classes of dynamic models-macroscopic (hydrodynamic), kinetic, and rnicroscopic-were examined as well.

J	Zhang, MQ; Shu, CW; Wong, GCK; Wong, SC				Zhang, MQ; Shu, CW; Wong, GCK; Wong, SC			A weighted essentially non-oscillatory numerical scheme for a multi-class Lighthill-Whitham-Richards traffic flow model	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS			English	Article						multi-class LWR model; traffic flow; weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme; Lax-Friedrichs scheme; Godunov scheme	HIGH-ORDER; EFFICIENT IMPLEMENTATION; FINITE-DIFFERENCE; BEHAVIORAL-THEORY; SPECIAL LANES; FREEWAYS; WAVES	In this paper, we present a high-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme for solving a multi-class extension of the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model. We first review the multi-class LWR model and present some of its analytical properties. We then present the WENO schemes, which were originally designed for computational fluid dynamics problems and for solving hyperbolic conservation laws in general, and demonstrate how to apply these to the present model. We found through numerical experiments that the WENO method is vastly more efficient than the low-order Lax-Friedrichs scheme, yet both methods converge to the same solution of the physical model. It is especially interesting to observe the small staircases in the solution which are completely missed out, because of the numerical viscosity, if a lower-order method is used without a sufficiently refined mesh. To demonstrate the applicability of this new, efficient numerical tool, we study the multi-class model under different parameter regimes and traffic stream models. We consider also the convergence of the multi-class LWR model when the number of classes goes to infinity. We show that the solution converges to a smooth profile without staircases when the number of classes increases. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This foundation rests on the Wold decomposition theorem and on the assertion that a one-week lagged first seasonal difference applied to discrete interval traffic condition data will yield a weakly stationary transformation. Moreover, empirical results using actual intelligent transportation system data are presented and found to be consistent with the theoretical hypothesis. Conclusions are given on the implications of these assertions and findings relative to ongoing intelligent transportation systems research, deployment, and operations.

J	Selekwa, MF; Mussa, RN; Chiteshe, A				Selekwa, MF; Mussa, RN; Chiteshe, A			Application of LQ modelling and optimization in urban traffic control	OPTIMAL CONTROL APPLICATIONS & METHODS			English	Article						urban traffic control; traffic control signal timing; linear-quadratic optimal control; optimal traffic flow transitions		The increasing congestion on urban streets demands traffic control signal timing to be well co-ordinated and optimized even during the transition between timing patterns used in different periods of time-of-day (TOD). The TOD timing plans, defined by fixed-time co-ordination parameters, need to change from one TOD period to another. The current methods used in transitioning are aimed at achieving quick transition rather than optimizing traffic flow during the transition period. As a result, they generally cause increased vehicle delays during the transition period particularly for vehicles on the minor street, which face lengthened red times. This paper proposes a quadratic optimization method that can be used to reduce disutility measures to motorists during the transition period. The transition is modeled as a linear dynamic process, and the disutility measures are modeled as the sum of squares of the deviations of the co-ordination parameters-that is, cycle length, phase split, and offset-from the optimal values during the transition. A linear quadratic (LQ) optimization technique of optimal control is used to determine the step size and the number of steps necessary to complete the transition with minimum disutility. The proposed transition period optimization method has the advantage that the user need not specify minimum and maximum cycle length to achieve optimization, as is the case with current methods. Simulation results for three co-ordinated intersections showed that the proposed method reduces total vehicle delay when compared to the 'immediate' transition method embedded in CORSIM traffic simulation software. This is due to the fact that vehicles on the minor street approaches get proportional green time without significantly affecting green times on the major street approach green phase. However, the method showed a slight increase in total delay for vehicles on the major street. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

The traffic flow on a single lane highway is simulated by the Nagel-Schreckenberg traffic model. Both the usual correlation functions as well as the wavelet-transformed functions are calculated and compared. Off-diagonal correlations are effectively suppressed by the wavelets, and correlations from different scales are nearly decoupled. The signature of traffic jams is identified in the wavelet-spectrum. Wavelet analysis provides a useful tool to explore the self-similarity in traffic fluctuations. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The model evaluation work considered the sequential hourly concentration time series of NO2 and PM10, which were measured at two stations in central Helsinki, from 1996 to 1999. The models utilised selected traffic flow and pre-processed meteorological variables as input data. An imputed concentration dataset was also created, in which the missing values were replaced, in order to obtain a harmonised database that is well suited for the inter-comparison of models. Three statistical criteria were adopted: the index of agreement (IA), the squared correlation coefficient (R-2) and the fractional bias. The results obtained with various non-linear NN models show a good agreement with the measured concentration data for NO2; for instance, the annual mean of the IA values and their standard deviations range from 0.86+/-0.02 to 0.91+/-0.01. In the case of NO2, the non-linear NN models produce a range of model performance values that are slightly better than those by the DET. NN models generally perform better than the statistical linear model, for predicting both NO2 and PM10 concentrations. In the case of PM10, the model performance statistics of the NN models were not as good as those for NO2 over the entire range of models considered. However, the currently available NN models are neither applicable for predicting spatial concentration distributions in urban areas, nor for evaluating air pollution abatement scenarios for future years.

This model is analytically interesting because of several non-standard features. For instance, it leads to non-classical shocks and enjoys an unexpected stability in spite of the presence of umbilic points. Furthermore, while satisfying all the minimal 'common sense' requirements, it also allows for a description of phenomena often neglected by other models, such as overtaking.

Four types of ACCs were evaluated to determine their effect on travel time reduction given the low percentage of ACC equipped vehicles. A small numerical example showed that travel times could be significantly reduced only when the ACC is activated for almost all speed ranges and at least 20% of the vehicles are equipped with ACCs.

J	Huang, DW				Huang, DW			Analytical results for a three-phase traffic model	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							STATES	We study analytically a cellular automaton model, which is able to present three different traffic phases on a homogeneous highway. The characteristics displayed in the fundamental diagram can be well discerned by analyzing the evolution of density configurations. Analytical expressions for the traffic flow and shock speed are obtained. The synchronized flow in the intermediate-density region is the result of aggressive driving scheme and determined mainly by the stochastic noise.

J	Zeedyk, MS; Kelly, L				Zeedyk, MS; Kelly, L			Behavioural observations of adult-child pairs at pedestrian crossings	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						pelican crossings; parental training programmes; child pedestrians; pedestrian behaviour	FIND SAFE ROUTES; ROAD SAFETY	Pedestrian accidents are a serious health risk to children in the UK and other Western countries. There remains a considerable amount to be learned about children's behaviour in real-traffic environments. The present study was intended to help fill this gap, by observing unobtrusively the behaviours of 123 adult-child pairs as they crossed the road at pedestrian light-controlled crossings. Eight behaviours were coded, including whether or not the pair stopped at the kerb, waited for the light to change, and checked to ensure traffic flow had stopped. Results showed that the adults observed provided reasonably good models of pedestrian behaviour, but that they rarely treated the crossing event as an opportunity to teach children explicitly about road safety. The only gender difference to emerge revealed that adults were more likely to hold girls' hands than boys' hands. No differences were observed in relation to (estimated) age of child. The implications of these findings for parental training programmes are explored. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, L; Yu, X; Dai, SQ				Li, L; Yu, X; Dai, SQ			One-dimensional sensitive driving cellular automaton model for traffic flow	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						traffic flow; cellular automaton model; metastable state; phase separation; traffic phase transition		Based on the NaSch cellular automaton traffic model, a new one-dimensional cellular automaton model (called SDNaSch model, for short) is proposed through preferentially considering the sensitive behaviour of drivers, in which the randomization brake is arranged before the deterministic deceleration. According to the new update rules of the evolution of vehicles, numerical simulation is conducted and leads to some new results. The fundamental diagram obtained by the simulation shows that the traffic capacity of a road is enhanced and closer to the observed data compared with that of the NaSch model. It is found from the fundamental diagram that there exist two branches in some density regions, which illustrates the existence of the metastable state near the critical point and the phase separation. According to the evolution pattern of the vehicle speed in space and time, the wide moving jams is reproduced with the phase transitions between free flow and wide moving jams. With the consideration of the actual traffic situation, i.e., some drivers being sensitive and following the new rules, while others being not and following the original NaSch rules, the corresponding simulation verifies the remarkable effect of the sensitive driving factor on the characteristics of traffic flows. The traffic capacity rises along with the increase in the fraction of sensitive drivers.

J	Chen, SC; Shyu, ML; Peeta, S; Zhang, CC				Chen, SC; Shyu, ML; Peeta, S; Zhang, CC			Learning-based spatio-temporal vehicle tracking and indexing for transportation multimedia database systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						advanced traffic management systems (ATMS); advanced traveler information systems (ATIS); background learning and background subtraction; intelligent transportation systems (ITS); multimedia database indexing; segmentation; vehicle tracking; video analysis	SEGMENTATION	One key technology of intelligent transportation systems is the use of advanced sensor systems for on-line surveillance to gather detailed information on traffic conditions. Traffic video analysis can provide a wide range of useful information to traffic planners. In this context, the object-level indexing of video data can enable vehicle classification, traffic flow analysis, incident detection and analysis at intersections, vehicle tracking for traffic operations, and update of design warrants. In this paper, a learning-based automatic framework is proposed to support the multimedia data indexing and querying of spatio-temporal relationships of vehicle objects in a traffic video sequence. The spatio-temporal relationships of vehicle objects are captured via the proposed unsupervised image/video segmentation method and object tracking algorithm, and modeled using a multimedia augmented transition network model and multimedia input strings. An efficient and effective background learning and subtraction technique is, employed to eliminate the complex background details in the traffic video frames. It substantially enhances the efficiency of the segmentation process and the accuracy of the segmentation results to enable more accurate video indexing and annotation. The paper uses four real-life traffic video sequences from several road intersections under different weather conditions in the study experiments. The results show that the proposed framework is effective in automating data collection and access for complex traffic situations.

J	Small, KA; Chu, XH				Small, KA; Chu, XH			Hypercongestion	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT ECONOMICS AND POLICY			English	Article							ROAD TRAFFIC CONGESTION; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; BOTTLENECK; ECONOMICS; TIME; FLOW; URBAN; WORK; COST; TRANSPORTATION	The standard economic model for analysing traffic congestion incorporates a relationship between speed and traffic flow. Empirical measurements indicate a region, known as hypercongestion, in which speed increases with flow. We argue that this relationship is unsuitable as a supply curve for equilibrium analysis because observed hypercongestion occurs as a response to transient demand fluctuations. We then present tractable models for handling such fluctuations, both for a straight uniform highway and for a dense street network such as in a central business district (CBD). For the CBD model, we consider both exogenous and endogenous time patterns for demand, and we make use of an empirical speed-density relationship for Dallas, Texas, to characterise hypercongested conditions. The CBD model is adaptable to any situation where accumulation of work to be processed becomes such a hindrance as to reduce outflow.

J	Karim, A; Adeli, H				Karim, A; Adeli, H			Radial basis function neural network for work zone capacity and queue estimation	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						neural networks; models; workspace; highway construction; traffic management	MODEL	An adaptive computational model is presented for estimating the work zone capacity and queue length and delay,laking into account the following factors: number of lanes, number of open lanes, work zone layout, length, lane width, percentage trucks, grade, speed, work intensity, darkness factor, and proximity of ramps. The model integrates judiciously the mathematical rigor of traffic flow theory with the adaptability of neural network analysis. A radial-basis function neural network model is developed to learn the mapping from quantifiable and nonquantifiable factors describing the work zone traffic control problem to the associated work zone capacity. This model exhibits good generalization properties from a small set of training data, a specially attractive feature for estimating the work zone capacity where only limited data is available. Queue delays and lengths are computed using a deterministic traffic flow model based on the estimated work zone capacity. The result of this research is being used to develop an intelligent decision support system to help work zone engineers perform scenario analysis and create traffic management plans consistently, reliably, and efficiently.

J	Sheu, JB; Chou, YH; Weng, MC				Sheu, JB; Chou, YH; Weng, MC			Stochastic system modeling and optimal control of incident-induced traffic congestion	MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING			English	Article						incident-induced traffic congestion; incident-responsive; incident management; Kalman filtering techniques	SIGNAL CONTROL	Incident-induced traffic congestion is a critical issue in formulating urban traffic congestion problems, and also a major cause that contributes to the invalidity of traffic signal control. This paper presents a prototype of real-time local signal control method, and explores its applicability in alleviating incident-induced traffic congestion on the roadway between two adjacent intersections for incident management. The architecture includes two major parts: (1) formulating time-varying lane traffic state variables and control variables under conditions of lane-blocking incidents with a discrete-time non-linear stochastic model, and (2) developing a real-time control algorithm for predicting dynamically control variables. To generate efficiently traffic data used in model tests, we employed the Paramics microscopic traffic simulator, which is developed to model and analyze ITS traffic flow conditions. According to the measures of two proposed space-based incident-impact indexes, the preliminary test results indicate the superiority of the proposed real-time signal control method in comparison with fixed-time signal control modes which are currently used at the study site. We do expect that this study can stimulate research on incident management, and extend to network-wide incident-responsive traffic control for the development of advanced traffic management systems (ATMS).

J	Moussa, N				Moussa, N			Car accidents in cellular automata models for one-lane traffic flow	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							JAMMING TRANSITION; STOPPED CARS; HIGHWAY; PHYSICS	Conditions for the occurrence of car accidents are introduced in the Nagel-Schreckenberg model. These conditions are based on the thought that a real accident depends on several parameters: an unexpected action of the car ahead (sudden stop or abrupt deceleration), the gap between the two cars, the velocity of the successor car and its delayed reaction time. We discuss then the effect of this delayed reaction time on the probability of traffic accidents.

J	Bunker, J; Troutbeck, R				Bunker, J; Troutbeck, R			Prediction of minor stream delays at a limited priority freeway merge	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article								This paper presents the development and application of a limited priority gap acceptance model to freeway merging. In the limited priority model, drivers in the major stream at a merge area may incur delay in restoring small headways to a larger, sustainable minimum headway between them and the vehicle in front. This allows minor stream drivers to accept smaller gaps. The headway distributions are assumed to be distributed according to Cowan's M3 model, whose terms were calibrated for this system. Minor stream minimum follow-on time was calibrated, and a realistic range of the critical gap identified. An equation was developed for minimum average minor stream delay. A function was identified to model the relationship between minor stream average delay and degree of saturation. The shape parameter of this function was calibrated using simulated traffic flow data, under three different minor stream arrival pattern regimes. The model provides a useful means of comparing performance, through average minor stream delay, for varying minor and major stream flow rates and minor stream critical gap, under arrival patterns that differ due to traffic control upstream of the on-ramp. Minor stream delay is a particularly useful measure of effectiveness for uncongested freeway merging as it relates directly to the distance required to merge. Observations from the model developed provide physical evidence that minor stream drivers incur lesser delay, or have a better chance of merging quickly, when they arrive at constant intervals as is the case under constant departure ramp metering, than when they arrive in bunches downstream of a signalised intersection, or even a semi-bunched state downstream of an unsignalised intersection.

Without the limit of "lanes" pedestrian movement is loose and free. Furthermore, they are easily affected by other walkers as well as the environment around. In this paper some special technique is introduced considering human behavior to make the rules more reasonable. By simulating the two-dimension pedestrian movement, the phase transition phenomena of pedestrian movement, including the up walkers moving from the bottom to the upper boundary and the right walkers moving from the left to the right boundary, are presented. Studying on the effect of the system size on the critical density shows that the critical density is independent of the system size in the scope studied in this paper.

The model is different from the slow-to-start (STS) model in that the upper branch of the fundamental diagram in the periodic boundary conditions (PBC) is not monotonous but has an extremum. The phase diagram and the fundamental diagram of the model in the OBC are investigated. The results are compared with those of the STS model and those in the PBC. The current in the OBC as well as the density profiles in the different phases is also investigated.

J	Jin, WL; Zhang, HM				Jin, WL; Zhang, HM			The inhomogeneous kinematic wave traffic flow model as a resonant nonlinear system	TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE			English	Article							CONSERVATION-LAWS	The kinematic wave traffic flow model for an inhomogeneous road is studied as a resonant nonlinear system, where an additional conservation law is introduced to model time-invariant road inhomogeneities such as changes in grades or number of lanes. This resonant system has two families of waves, one of which is a standing wave originated at the inhomogeneity. The nature of these waves are examined and their time-space structures are studied under Riemann initial conditions and proper entropy conditions. Moreover, the system is solved numerically with Godunov's method, and the solutions are found to be consistent with those of Daganzo (1995) and Lebacque (1996) for the same initial conditions. Finally, the numerical approximation is applied to model traffic flow on a ring road with a bottleneck and the results conform to expectations.

J	Munoz, JC; Daganzo, CF				Munoz, JC; Daganzo, CF			Structure of the transition zone behind freeway queues	TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE			English	Article							MULTILANE TRAFFIC FLOW; BEHAVIORAL-THEORY; KINEMATIC WAVES; DYNAMICS	Observations of freeway traffic flow are usually quite scattered about an underlying curve when plotted versus density or occupancy. Although increasing the sampling intervals can reduce the scatter, whenever an experiment encompasses a rush hour with transitions in and out of congestion, some outlying data stubbornly remain beneath the "equilibrium" curve. The existence of these nonequilibrium points is a poorly understood phenomenon that appears to contradict the simple kinematic wave (KW) model of traffic flow. This paper provides a tentative explanation of the phenomenon, based on experimental evidence. The evidence was a FIFO queue that grew and receded over two detector stations, generating typical flow-density scatter plots at both locations. The locations were far from other interacting traffic streams. The data revealed that a transition zone where vehicles decelerated gradually existed immediately behind the queue. The transition zone was quite wide (about 1 km at both locations), moved slowly (approximately with the "shock" velocity of KW theory), and as a result spent many minutes over each detector station. Disequilibrium flow-density points arose only when the transition zone was over the detectors, suggesting that the transition zone explains their occurrence. The disequilibrium points drifted gradually from one branch of the curve to the other, as KW theory would have predicted if "shocks" had a characteristic width equal to the dimension of the transition zone. Nothing was found in the data to contradict this view. This paper also shows that in our case, if one neglects the shocks' physical dimension, the position of every vehicle can be predicted with KW theory to within approximately five vehicle spacings. Thus, it appears that KW theory can predict rather accurately traffic behavior at the back of FIFO queues, i.e., when the lanes are equally attractive to all drivers.

J	Sasaki, M; Nagatani, T				Sasaki, M; Nagatani, T			Transition and saturation of traffic flow controlled by traffic lights	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						traffic flow; dynamical transition; density wave; traffic light	JAMMING TRANSITION; 2-LANE ROADWAY; PHYSICS; SYSTEMS; STATES; MODEL; JAMS; CAR	We study the traffic flow controlled by traffic lights on a single-lane roadway by using the optimal velocity model. The characteristic of traffic flow is clarified for the three different strategies of traffic light control: the simple synchronized, green wave, and random switching strategies. The current-density diagrams are calculated for the three different strategies. It is found that the saturation of current occurs at the critical density. The critical density of the dynamical transition depends on the cycle time of the traffic light and strategy. The value of the saturated current does not depend on the cycle time and the strategies. The density wave propagating backward appears when the current saturates. It is shown that the density wave is consistent with the spontaneous jam. A theoretical analysis is also presented for the dynamical transition. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Mussa, R; Selekwa, M				Mussa, R; Selekwa, M			Proposed methodology of optimizing transitioning between time-of-day timing plans	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						optimization; simulation; timing; traffic signals		Timing plans for coordinated signals are developed online using real-time traffic data collected by detectors or offline using traffic data previously collected but is representative of the period in which the timing plan is to be implemented. The timing plans developed using offline techniques are generally known as time-of-day (TOD) timing plans as they are generally implemented during a specific time of the day. One of the downsides of the TOD timing technique is the handling of coordination parameters-defined by cycle length, phase split, and offset-when one plan is transitioning to the next plan. This paper presents a methodology to optimize traffic flow during the transition period. The methodology, based on dynamic quadratic optimization, achieves synchronization of coordination parameters through an optimum number of cycles and an optimum number of increments (or decrements) of the coordination parameters. The proposed transition period optimization method has the advantage that the user does not need to specify minimum and maximum cycle lengths in the optimization process, as is the case with current methods. Preliminary simulation results that compared the proposed methodology to transition methods embedded in CORSIM showed that it has the potential of reducing queue delay, particularly on minor street approaches. The delays on major street approaches were comparable and similar in both scenarios in which traffic volumes were increasing or decreasing between the succeeding plans. Additional simulation runs involving various scenarios of geometric, traffic, and signalization conditions as well as field evaluation are needed before the efficacy of this method over current methods used in practice can be ascertained.

J	Smith, BL; Qin, L; Venkatanarayana, R				Smith, BL; Qin, L; Venkatanarayana, R			Characterization of freeway capacity reduction resulting from traffic accidents	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article						traffic accidents; interstate highways; traffic capacity		Incidents, defined as unplanned events that temporarily reduce roadway capacity, contribute significantly to urban freeway congestion. Transportation agencies have developed incident management programs in order to support the effective identification and response to incidents. An important element of an effective incident management program is the ability to accurately estimate the freeway capacity remaining. following an incident. The objective of this research was to characterize urban freeway capacity reduction resulting from traffic accidents using a large set of traffic flow and accident data. Traffic accidents, a subcategory of incidents, were investigated since they, in particular, result in significant urban freeway congestion due to their frequency and generally substantial reduction of capacity. The results of this effort lead to the following conclusions: (1) Accidents significantly reduce remaining capacity on freeway segments, well beyond the physical blockage of lanes. This research found that an accident blocking one of three freeway lanes resulted in a mean capacity reduction of 63%, while an accident blocking two of three freeway lanes resulted in a mean capacity reduction of 77%; and (2) There is evidence to suggest that accident capacity reduction is best modeled as a random variable, not a deterministic value. The results of this research indicate that the beta distribution provides a good representation of accident capacity reduction for one or two lanes of three lanes blocked.

J	Zhang, HM				Zhang, HM			Anisotropic property revisited - does it hold in multi-lane traffic?	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article							FLOW	The anisotropic property of traffic flow has brought much discussion about some existing traffic flow models and diverging views on the further development of traffic flow theories. This paper shows that the anisotropic property cannot be expected to hold in multi-lane traffic. Moreover, it develops a mathematical criterion to judge the anisotropic property of a traffic flow model, shows how non-anisotropic behavior arises from multi-lane traffic, and why some higher-order models do not always behave anisotropically.

In this paper, a theoretical framework to estimate mechanical turbulence induced by traffic in street canyons at low wind speed conditions is established. The standard deviation of the velocity fluctuations is adopted as a measure of traffic-produced turbulence (TPT). Based on the balance between turbulent kinetic energy production and dissipation, three different parameterisations for TPT suitable for different traffic flow conditions are derived and discussed. These formulae rely on the calculations of constants that need to be estimated on the basis of experimental data. One such estimate has been made with the help of a wind tunnel data set corresponding to intermediate traffic densities, which is the most common regime, with interacting vehicle wakes.

The urban traffic is simulated in the cellular automata framework. Both the deterministic and probabilistic models are discussed. The effects of speed limit and stochastic noise are analyzed. The operation of a traffic light is characterized by two parameters: signal period and phase allocation. With two traffic lights on road, one more parameter is prescribed: synchronization shift.

J	Huang, DW; Huang, WN				Huang, DW; Huang, WN			Comment on "Cellular automata model simulating traffic interactions between on-ramp and main road"	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Editorial Material								In a recent study of traffic flow around on-ramp [R. Jiang, Q. S. Wu, and B. H. Wang, Phys. Rev. E 66, 036104 (2002)], two different types of phase diagrams are reported: four distinct regions are observed in the cases of v(max)>1, while only two regions are present in the case of v(max)=1. We point out that the characteristics of the phase diagram are totally dictated by the prescribed asymmetric rule of the on-ramp. In the congested phase (region IV), the configurations evolve as stable limit cycles, and are independent of v(max). The saturated currents can be obtained analytically.

The predictions are based on measurements of the traffic flows as well as on covariates which describe important features of the junctions. Various approximate and estimative methods, which use Gibbs sampling, posterior normality and Laplace approximations, are considered and compared. Procedures to assess the importance of the different covariates through the use of the Kullback-Leibler measure of divergence are also developed.

J	Coifman, B; Dhoorjaty, S; Lee, ZH				Coifman, B; Dhoorjaty, S; Lee, ZH			Estimating median velocity instead of mean velocity at single loop detectors	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						traffic surveillance; loop detectors; velocity estimation; traffic congestion; traffic flow; traffic estimation	SPEED	Loop detectors are the preeminent vehicle detector for freeway traffic surveillance. Although single loops have been used for decades, debate continues on how to interpret the measurements. Many researchers have sought better estimates of velocity from single loops. The preceding work has emphasized techniques that use many samples of aggregate flow and occupancy to reduce the estimation error. Although rarely noted, these techniques effectively seek to reduce the bias due to long vehicles in measured occupancy. This paper presents a different approach, using a new aggregation methodology to estimate velocity and reduce the impact of long vehicles in the original traffic measurements. In contrast to conventional practice, the new estimate significantly reduces velocity estimation errors when it is not possible to control for a wide range of vehicle lengths. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Teng, HL; Qi, Y				Teng, HL; Qi, Y			Application of wavelet technique to freeway incident detection	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						freeway incident management; incident detection algorithm; wavelet application; algorithm evaluation; neural network models		This paper presents an application of the wavelet technique to freeway incident detection because wavelet techniques have demonstrated superior performance in detecting changes in signals in electrical engineering. Unlike the existing wavelet incident detection algorithm, where the wavelet technique is utilized to denoise data before the data is input into an algorithm, this paper presents a different approach in the application of the wavelet technique to incident detection. In this approach, the features that are extracted from traffic measurements by using wavelet transformation are directly utilized in detecting changes in traffic flow. It is shown in the paper that the extracted features from traffic measurements in incident conditions are significantly different from those in normal conditions. This characteristic of the wavelet technique was used in developing the wavelet incident detection algorithm in this study. The algorithm was evaluated in comparison with the multi-layer feed-forward neural network, probabilistic neural network, radial basis function neural network, California and low-pass filtering algorithms. The test results indicate that the wavelet incident detection algorithm performs better than other algorithms, demonstrating its potential for practical application. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

A panel data-set of Minneapolis-Saint Paul highway network for the years 1980-98 is constructed. A model that predicts the traffic flow on the link in terms of vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT) based on the flow and capacity conditions existing on the link in the previous years is specified and estimated. The flow and capacity conditions existing on the identified neighbouring parallel links are also taken into account. Socio-demographic characteristics like population of the Minor Civil Division (MCD) to which the link belongs and the surrounding MCDs; are also considered. The results indicate that capacity enhancements in the previous years, given by lane additions, have a positive and significant effect on the VKT of the link, confirming the induced demand hypothesis. The elasticities are lower than reported in previous research, indicating the importance of separating new construction from the expansion of existing links.

The conditions of the DS are modified. It is shown that when nu(max) = 1, there will be no DS in both deterministic and non-deterministic cases. The situation is different for nu(max) > 1. We show that in the deterministic case, the probability of DS covers a two-dimensional region, which depends on both the density and the initial configuration. As for the non-deterministic case, out results are qualitatively the same as previous ones, but are quantitatively different.

We have investigated how the traffic shock wave forms and how it spreads. It is found that the traffic flows have several peak values. When the distances between the intersections are equal, for a fixed value of cycle times of the traffic lights, the current does not depend on the density of vehicles for a range of density. For a high density, when the distance between the intersections is greater than a certain value,the traffic flow maintains constant.

The model results were compared to measured data of particle number concentrations, traffic intensity and tunnel ventilation rate. Coagulation and depositional losses to the tunnel walls were shown to be important processes during traffic peak hours, together contributing to losses of 77% of the particles smaller than 10nm and 41% of the particles of size 10-29nm. Particle growth due to water uptake or the presence of a micron-sized, resuspended particle fraction did not have any significant effect on the number of particles lost due to coagulation. Model simulation of particle number concentration response to temporal variations in traffic flow showed that constant emission factors could be used to reproduce the concentration variations of the particles larger than 29nm, while vehicle-speed-dependent factors are suggested to reproduce the variation of the smallest fractions. The emission factors for particle number concentrations estimated from the model simulation are in general higher and show a larger contribution from light-duty vehicles than what has been reported from a tunnel in California.

J	Smith, BL; Oswald, RK				Smith, BL; Oswald, RK			Meeting real-time traffic flow forecasting requirements with imprecise computations	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION	This article explores the ability of imprecise computations to address real-time computational requirements in infrastructure control and management systems. The research in this area focuses on the development of nonparametric regression as a means to forecast traffic flow rates for transportation management systems. Nonparametric regression is a forecasting technique based on nearest neighbor searching, in which forecasts are derived from past observations that are similar to current conditions. A key, concern regarding nonparametric regression is the significant time required to search for nearest neighbors in large databases. The results presented in this article indicate that approximate nearest neighbors, which are imprecise computations as applied to nonparametric regression, may be used to adequately speed the execution time of nonparametric regression, with acceptable degradations in forecast accuracy. The article concludes with a demonstration of the use of genetic algorithms as a design aid for real-time algorithms employing imprecise computations.

J	Blank, M				Blank, M			Ergodic properties of a simple deterministic traffic flow model	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						dynamical system; traffic flow; substitution dynamics; attractor; rate of convergence; large deviations	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; SURFACE GROWTH; JAMS	We study statistical properties of a family of maps acting in the space of integer valued sequences, which model dynamics of simple deterministic traffic flows. We obtain asymptotic (as time goes to infinity) properties of trajectories of those maps corresponding to arbitrary initial configurations in terms of statistics of densities of various patterns and describe weak attractors of these systems and the rate of convergence to them. Previously only the so called regular initial configurations (having a density with only finite fluctuations of partial sums around it) in the case of a slow particles model (with the maximal velocity 1) have been studied rigorously. Applying ideas borrowed from substitution dynamics we are able to reduce the analysis of the traffic flow models corresponding to the multi-lane traffic and to the flow with fast particles (with velocities greater than 1) to the simplest case of the flow with the one-lane traffic and slow particles, where the crucial technical step is the derivation of the exact life-time for a given cluster of particles. Applications to the optimal redirection of the multi-lane traffic flow and a model of a pedestrian going in a slowly moving crowd are discussed as well.

This study analyzes the. regulation alternatives on private. highway investment under a BOT scheme. and their impacts on traffic flows, travel costs, toll, capacity, and social welfare. (total user-benefit in the. traffic system including congestion). For comparison, five. cases are. analyzed: (1) No BOT with maximizing welfare., (2) No BOT with breaking even on finance., (3) BOT without regulation, (4) BOT with a minimum flow constraint (the. total users will not be. less than those. in Case. 1), and (5) BOT with a maximum travel cost constraint (the. travel cost for users on a non-tolled road will not exceed the. maximum tolerance.). After each case. is modeled and simulated on some. functional forms, we. find that the. case. of BOT with regulations performs between the. cases of maximizing welfare. and that of maximizing profit. From the. perspective. of the. government, regulation has less power in a project with low elastic demand. Furthermore., even when the. regulation is strict, a high cost-efficient firm with BOT could result in a higher level of social welfare. than that without a BOT scheme..

This study found that road side concentrations of particles produced by freeway traffic in Brisbane, Australia, is primarily dependent upon traffic flow differentiated into fuel type, and wind speed. The analysis differentiates between diesel and petrol vehicles, and finds that particle concentration is very sensitive to the proportion of diesel-fuelled vehicles. A 20% increase in diesel vehicles can produce an 18% increase in particle concentrations compared with a 2% particle increase for the same number of additional petrol vehicles.

J	Fang, WF; Yang, LZ; Fan, WC				Fang, WF; Yang, LZ; Fan, WC			Simulation of bi-direction pedestrian movement using a cellular automata model	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						pedestrian movement; Bi-direction; cellular automata; phase transition	TRAFFIC-FLOW; JAMMING TRANSITION; FEATURES	A cellular automata model is presented to simulate the bi-direction pedestrian movement. The pedestrian movement is more complex than vehicular flow for the reason that people are more flexible than cars. Some special technique is introduced considering simple human judgment to make the rules more reasonable. Also the custom in the countries where the pedestrian prefer to walk on the right-hand side of the road are highlighted. By using the model to simulate the bi-direction pedestrian movement, the phase transition phenomena in pedestrian counter flow is presented. Furthermore, the introduction of back stepping breaks the deadlock at the relatively low pedestrian density. By studying the critical density of changing from freely moving state to jammed state with different system sizes and different probabilities of back stepping, we find the critical density increases as the probability of back stepping increases at the same system size. And with the increasing system size, the critical density decreases at the same probability of back stepping according to the scope of system size studied in this paper.

One such location is the urban street canyon where dispersion is poorly understood or described by regulatory models because of the complexity of the airflow, turbulence and local influences. Similarly, simple metrics such as PM10 fail to describe the range of sizes, composition, sources and behaviours encompassed by the term 'particle'. A 2-week experimental case study to measure size-segregated aerosol in the size range 4.6nm-10mum at a fine time scale (10 min resolution) was undertaken in a typical street canyon in Manchester. The wind direction incident to the canyon, and hence the vortex flow within the canyon, was found to have a large influence on the number concentrations, with values typically 2-10 times greater in perpendicular flow than the estimated inner-urban background. Concentrations were also inversely related to wind speed and directly related to traffic flow. Coarse mode mass concentrations were generally found to follow urban background PM10 concentrations except with a 0-5 mug m(-3) enhancement related to traffic-induced re-suspension within the canyon. A small pollution episode consisting of coarse material re-suspended by high winds was extended in time within the canyon. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Stathopoulos, A; Karlaftis, MG				Stathopoulos, A; Karlaftis, MG			A multivariate state space approach for urban traffic flow modeling and prediction	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						traffic flow; multivariate time series; short-term predictions	TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS; VOLUME	Urban traffic congestion is one of the most severe problems of everyday life in Metropolitan areas. In an effort to deal with this problem, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) technologies have concentrated in recent years on dealing with urban congestion. One of the most critical aspects of ITS success is the provision of accurate real-time information and short-term predictions of traffic parameters such as traffic volumes, travel speeds and occupancies. The present paper concentrates on developing flexible and explicitly multivariate time-series state space models using core urban area loop detector data. Using 3-min volume measurements from urban arterial streets near downtown Athens, models were developed that feed on data from upstream detectors to improve on the predictions of downstream locations. The results clearly suggest that different model specifications are appropriate for different time periods of the day. Further, it also appears that the use of multivariate state space models improves on the prediction accuracy over univariate time series ones. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

This paper initiates a theoretical study of conditions under which this process is stable. A model is presented that describes within-one-day development of queues when drivers affected by real-time traffic information choose their paths en route. The model is reduced to a system of differential equations with delay. Equilibrium points of the system correspond to constant queue lengths. Stability of the system is investigated using characteristic values of the linearised minimal face flow. A traffic network example illustrating the method is provided. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Greibe, P				Greibe, P			Accident prediction models for urban roads	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						accident prediction models; generalised linear modelling; road accidents; junction; road links	JUNCTIONS	This paper describes some of the main findings from two separate studies on accident prediction models for urban junctions and urban road links described in [Uheldsmodel for bygader-Del1: Modeller for 3-og 4-benede kryds. Notat 22, The Danish Road Directorate, 1995; Uheldsmodel for bygader- Del2: Modeller for strwkninger. Notat 59, The Danish Road Directorate, 1998] (Greibe and Hemdorff, 1995, 1998). The main objective for the studies was to establish simple, practicable accident models that can predict the expected number of accidents at urban junctions and road links as accurately as possible. The models can be used to identify factors affecting road safety and in relation to 'black spot' identification and network safety analysis undertaken by local road authorities. The accident prediction models are based on data from 1036 junctions and 142 km road links in urban areas. Generalised linear modelling techniques were used to relate accident frequencies to explanatory variables. The estimated accident prediction models for road links were capable of describing more than 60% of the systematic variation ('percentage-explained' value)while the models for junctions had lower values. This indicates that modelling accidents for road links is less complicated than for junctions, probably due to a more uniform accident pattern and a simpler traffic flow exposure or due to lack of adequate explanatory variables for junctions. Explanatory variables describing road design and road geometry proved to be significant for road link models but less important in junction models. The most powerful variable for all models was motor vehicle traffic flow. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lin, WH; Lo, HK				Lin, WH; Lo, HK			A theoretical probe of a German experiment on stationary moving traffic jams	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article							CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; WAVES	Kerner and Rehborn (Phys. Rev. E 53 (2) (1996)) reported on the observation of two stationary moving jams that lasted for about an hour on a 13 km long German highway section. They attributed the phenomenon to intrinsic characteristics of traffic flow, something that would arise spontaneously within the traffic stream due to drivers' driving behavior. We show in this paper that these moving jams are not particularly peculiar but can be explained with the hydrodynamic theory of traffic flow, or the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model, and the merge and diverge models in the cell transmission model. In fact, we demonstrate that this stationary jam phenomenon can be replicated with a simple two-wave velocity (or triangular) flow-density relationship in conjunction with the hydrodynamic theory. This finding provides some evidence to support that a triangular flow-density relationship is a good approximation of field observations and that a simple first-order hydrodynamic theory is capable of explaining complex traffic phenomenon.

The model is an extension one of the optimal velocity model taking into account lane changing in the open flow. We study the jammed states and the fine structures of jams. It is shown that there are two kinds of jams: one is the localized jam just behind the car involved in the accident and the other is the extended jam. The jamming transition from the localized jam to the extended jam occurs with increasing inflow density. The extended jam exhibits the fine spatio-temporal structure. The local density fluctuates highly at the edge of jam. The number distribution of lane-changing cars is derived for both jams. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Parsons, B; Salter, LF				Parsons, B; Salter, LF			Air quality effects of traffic in a canyon-like street (Falmouth, U.K.)	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						AQMA; health; NO2; PAH; PM10	PARTICULATE MATTER; EXPOSURE; HEALTH	It has been suggested that in relation to air quality impacts, roads with low (<20 000 vpd) traffic flow need not be considered as significant. This study examines this suggestion more closely by comparing real-time monitoring of traffic related pollutants (NO2, PM10 and PAH) at two sites (including a 'canyon-street') in Falmouth, Cornwall in relation to traffic flow. For comparison, real-time monitoring data for NO2 and PM10 is also taken from a well ventilated site in Camelford, Cornwall. The data obtained suggest that roads with traffic flow considerably lower than 20 000 vpd can give rise to pollutant levels which have implications for human health. The application of simple linear regression techniques to the data suggests that under certain conditions simple estimates can be made in relation to likely traffic-related air quality effects in canyon-like streets.

We consider two classes of two-lane traffic cellular automaton models, namely the well known Nagel-Schreckenberg model and an extension of the Fukui-Ishibashi model. These two models, which differ in their acceleration limits, show an important differences in their fundamental diagrams, lane-changing and ping-pong behaviors. Moreover, we investigate the importance of braking noise and the proportion of trucks on the traffic flow of a two-lane roadway.

J	Nagy, I; Karny, M; Nedoma, P; Voracova, S				Nagy, I; Karny, M; Nedoma, P; Voracova, S			Bayesian estimation of traffic lane state	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADAPTIVE CONTROL AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article						mixture models; estimation; Bayesian approach; transportation systems		Modelling of large transportation systems requires a reliable description of its elements that can be easily adapted to the specific situation. This paper offers mixture model as a flexible candidate for modelling of such element. The mixture model describes particular and possibly very different states of a specific system by its individual components. A hierarchical model built on such elements can describe complexes of big city communications as well as railway or highway networks. Bayesian paradigm is adopted for estimation of parameters and the actual component label of the mixture model as it serves well for the subsequent decision making. As a straight forward application of Bayesian method to mixture models leads to infeasible computations. an approximation is applied. For normal stochastic variations. the resulting estimation algorithm reduces to a simple recursive weighted least squares. The elementary modelling is demonstrated on a model of traffic flow state in a single point of a roadway. The examples for simulated as well as real data show excellent properties of the suggested model. They represent much wider set of extensive tests made. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

A link layer controller for a hierarchical AHS architecture is presented. The controller proposed in this paper stabilizes the vehicular density and flow around predetermined profiles in a stretch of highway using speed and lane changes as control signals. Multiple lane highways in which vehicles have different destinations and types are considered.

Traffic pattern on roadways is emergent from a complex interaction between driving behavior and control systems. The uniqueness of MITSIMLab lies in a realistic representation of this interaction. Various components of MITSIMLab are presented. Evaluation is performed for the Central Artery/Tunnel network in Boston. Four kinds of traffic control are evaluated: access, route, lane and integrated control. Performance of various traffic control strategies is investigated under a range of traffic conditions and parametric values governing their operations. Results from this study substantiate findings from previous field and simulation evaluations of ramp control and provide new insights with regard to the elect of queue override strategy, downstream traffic condition and their interactions on the performance of ramp metering. Lane control evaluation suggests the need for a case-by-case study, whereas route control study demonstrates the deficiency of a reactive route guidance system. Finally, it is shown that a systematic design for integrated traffic control needs to be developed in order to exploit the potential benefit. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

We develop and evaluate the results of a new model with a quantitative study of the behaviour of the army ant Eciton burchelli. Colonies of this species have up to 200 000 foragers and transport more than 3000 prey items per hour over raiding columns that exceed 100 m. It is an ideal species in which to test the predictions of our model because it forms pheromone trails that are densely populated with very swift ants. The model explores the influences of turning rates and local perception on traffic flow. The behaviour of real army ants is such that they occupy the specific region of parameter space in which lanes form and traffic flow is maximized.

J	Jiang, R; Wu, QS				Jiang, R; Wu, QS			Cellular automata models for synchronized traffic flow	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND GENERAL			English	Article							EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES; PHASE-DIAGRAM; STATES; HIGHWAY; SIMULATION	This paper presents a new cellular automata model for describing synchronized traffic flow. The fundamental diagrams, the spacetime plots and the 1 min average data have been analysed in detail. It is shown that the model can describe the outflow from the jams, the light synchronized flow as well as heavy synchronized flow with average speed greater than approximately 24 km h(-1). As for the synchronized flow with speed lower than 24 km h-1, it is unstable and will evolve into the coexistence of jams, free flow and light synchronized flow. This is consistent with the empirical findings (Kerner B S 1998 Phys. Rev: Lett. 81 3797).

The fuzzy c-mean clustering algorithm was used to determine the position of centers of the hidden layer. A gradient descent method was used to obtain. the weights from the hidden layer to the output layer. A freeway with four segments of same length, an on-ramp at the first segment, and an off-ramp at the third segment is discussed. The training data for traffic flow modeling were generated using a well-known macroscopic traffic flow model at different densities and average velocities. The simulation result proves the practicability of this algorithm.

So far many algorithms have been proposed for traffic network flow forecasting, but problems in accuracy and timeliness still remain to be the major obstacle for their successful applications. For example, presumed human travel habit and vehicle turning probabilities at intersections have greatly limited the use of dynamic assignment algorithm. In order to improve the forecasting and real-time responsiveness, a new algorithm based on data mining which can do association rules mining and association analysis is proposed here for predicting traffic network flow. Simulation results using Corsim 5.0 have demonstrated effectiveness of the new algorithm in both accuracy and timeliness.

Efficient planning, for instance in freight transport, is hindered by the resulting unreliability of travel times. Another effect of this congestion is a reduced utilization rate of the road. This paper presents Trip Booking, a method aimed at improvement of the reliability of travel times as well as an increase in the effective use of road capacity. Increased reliability facilitates better logistic planning. It furthermore allows sharing of infrastructure between different modalities, with each modality having its own operational time window. The system aims at open dedicated infrastructure such as bus lanes and dedicated freight lanes and preserves autonomy of both the provider and the user of the infrastructure. The advantage claims are supported by simulation results for basic network configurations.
