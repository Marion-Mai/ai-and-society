In particular, we consider the car-following model for a single-line traffic flow of N identical cars on a circular road. The classical differentiable model breaks down at the time instant when two cars collide. Nevertheless, the natural action of a driver would be to overtake the slower car. In our previous work, we proposed the model which simulates overtaking. We observed a large variety of oscillatory solutions (oscillatory patterns) of the model. In the present contribution, we assume N = 3 i.e., three cars on the route, and formulate our model as a particular piecewise smooth (PWS) dynamical system. We define generic oscillatory patterns as invariant objects of the flow defined by this PWS system. We use the standard software to continue the patterns with respect to a parameter (the length of the route). In this respect, we also investigate bifurcation phenomena. (c) 2011 IMACS.

In recent years, the age of most bridges in Taiwan has gotten old gradually; as a result, the bridges deteriorate and need to be fixed and maintained. Nevertheless, it is not easy to predict the timing of bridge deterioration, and such situation has become one of the important issues in introducing the concept of preventive maintenance. In fact, in order to control the condition of bridge deterioration, many countries have set up bridge management system and regulated methods and mechanism of inspection. The record of bridge maintenance and inspection history is therefore well preserved, but the number of researches utilizing value added analysis of bridge deterioration with database of history is limited. There are many factors that affect bridge deterioration. In addition to the materials and types of elements of the bridges, it is associated with external environments as well, including environmental factors as traffic flow or rainfall. The present paper adopts National Bridge Inventory (NBI) established by USA since 1992 to process data mining. Currently, the database is the most abundant and publicly accessible database of bridge history, not only collecting basic information of bridges in each state, but keeping a complete record of the inspection history every year. This research processes analysis by means of K-Means, Two -Steps, and C5.0, categorizing bridges into several different clusters and depicting the decision-making tree of clustering and rules of bridge deterioration. In the future, bridge maintenance personnel can gain a clear idea of the cluster of the bridges they are responsible for according to the results of the decision tree. They can also cope with possible deterioration in advance by introducing the concept of preventive maintenance management. Consequently, the disasters can be avoided, the safety of pedestrians can be ensured, and the bridge maintenance budget of public engineering can be economized.

A multi-lane TASEP model for crossing pedestrian traffic flows	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT			English	Article						cellular automata; stochastic particle dynamics (theory); traffic models	SIMPLE EXCLUSION PROCESS; CELLULAR-AUTOMATON; DYNAMICS; TRANSITION; SYSTEMS	A one-way street of width M is modeled as a set of M parallel one-dimensional TASEPs. The intersection of two perpendicular streets is a square lattice of size M x M. We consider hard core particles entering each street with an injection probability alpha. On the intersection square the hard core exclusion creates a many-body problem of strongly interacting TASEPs and we study the collective dynamics that arises. We construct an efficient algorithm that allows for the simulation of streets of infinite length, which have sharply defined critical jamming points. The algorithm employs the 'frozen shuffle update', in which the randomly arriving particles have fully deterministic bulk dynamics. High precision simulations for street widths up to M = 24 show that when a increases, there occur jamming transitions at a sequence of M critical values alpha(M)(M) < alpha(M)(M-1) < ... < alpha(M)(1). As M grows, the principal transition point alpha(M)(M) decreases roughly as similar to(log M)(-1) in the range of M values studied. We show that a suitable order parameter is provided by a reflection coefficient associated with the particle current in each TASEP.	[Hilhorst, H.

J	Thomas, J; Srinivasan, KK; Arasan, VT				Thomas, Jomy; Srinivasan, Karthik K.; Arasan, Venkatachalam Thamizh			VEHICLE CLASS WISE SPEED-VOLUME MODELS FOR HETEROGENEOUS TRAFFIC	TRANSPORT			English	Article						traffic flow; vehicle; speed; model; interaction; analysis	ALGORITHM; FLOW	Link performance functions commonly used for traffic assignment are often based on Volume Delay Functions (VDF) developed for homogeneous traffic. However, VDFs relating stream speed to the volume of traffic based on homogeneous lane-based traffic are not adequate for traffic assignment in developing countries due to the heterogeneous nature of traffic that is characterized by a mix of a wide range of vehicle classes with significant differences in static and dynamic characteristics and an imperfect lane discipline. Unfortunately, the use of VDFs similar to those for homogeneous traffic flow situations imposes strong restrictions considering two respects: 1) travel times at path and link levels can be obtained for an aggregated stream but not for individual vehicle types; 2) the effect of varying composition and asymmetric interactions is captured only to a limited extent by converting all vehicles into equivalent Passenger Car Unit (PCU). Hence, this paper proposes the development of VDFs specific to different classes of heterogeneous traffic, as it is more realistic in traffic assignment than the use of the same VDF for all classes of vehicles in a link. This study is aimed at developing models to determine the speed of each vehicle class as a function of flow and composition for six lane roads with heterogeneous traffic based on data obtained from Chennai city, India. Heterogeneity in this study mainly refers to differences in vehicle types (two-wheeler, car, bus, etc.) participating in mixed traffic. To develop multiple user class VDFs, the speed and flow of each vehicle class for a wide range of traffic flow conditions need to be recorded. As this is not possible using field measurements, an established micro-simulation model (HETEROSIM) is used for determining speeds for each vehicle type by systematically varying the volume and composition levels over a range of values that represent relevant and practical traffic conditions observed in six lane divided roads in Chennai city. The proposed delay functions are different from standard single user class VDFs in three key respects: first, they enable more realistic behaviour by modelling differences in class wise speeds at a given volume and composition level; second, they allow for capturing asymmetric interactions of different vehicle types on an average speed of a given vehicle class. Finally, speed-flow relationships for each class are also allowed to vary across volume levels which enable the representation of differential interactions at different levels of congestion in mixed traffic. The need for homogenizing the volumes in terms of a single class is obviated. The models significantly outperformed single class VDFs in both calibration and validation datasets. Further, the proposed models are used for analyzing heterogeneous traffic characteristics. Empirical evidence of asymmetric interactions and the impact of composition on classwise performance are also found and quantified. Finally, two applications of the proposed models are demonstrated for the level of service analysis of different classes and impact analysis of excluding some classes. The proposed models may have applications such as determining class wise road user costs and performance measures (e.g. emissions) that depend on class-specific speeds.

J	Bi, J; Guan, W; Qi, LT				Bi Jun; Guan Wei; Qi Long-Tao			A genetic resampling particle filter for freeway traffic-state estimation	CHINESE PHYSICS B			English	Article						particle filter; genetic mechanism; traffic-state estimation; traffic flow model	EXTENDED KALMAN FILTER	On-line estimation of the state of traffic based on data sampled by electronic detectors is important for intelligent traffic management and control. Because a nonlinear feature exists in the traffic state, and because particle filters have good characteristics when it comes to solving the nonlinear problem, a genetic resampling particle filter is proposed to estimate the state of freeway traffic. In this paper, a freeway section of the northern third ring road in the city of Beijing in China is considered as the experimental object. By analysing the traffic-state characteristics of the freeway, the traffic is modeled based on the second-order validated macroscopic traffic flow model. In order to solve the particle degeneration issue in the performance of the particle filter, a genetic mechanism is introduced into the resampling process.

J	Cao, NY; Sano, K				Cao, Nguyen Y.; Sano, Kazushi			Estimating Capacity and Motorcycle Equivalent Units on Urban Roads in Hanoi, Vietnam	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Traffic capacity; Mixed traffic flow; Motorcycle equivalent units		This paper presents an investigation of the accurate methodology of motorcycle equivalent units (MEUs) in mixed traffic flow by considering the characteristics of moving vehicles, such as velocity and effective space. In addition, the effective space of each kind of vehicle is computed with consideration of the influences of velocity, physical size of the subject vehicle, and the surrounding motorcycles in the proposed methodology. The field data were collected in Hanoi, Vietnam in the case study. The results indicated that the MEU values of cars, buses, minibuses, and bicycles are 3.4, 10.5, 8.3 and 1.4, respectively. On the other hand, the collection of the field data of vehicle flow and speed passing through road segments was conducted in three groups of divided roads with raised medians. The fundamental diagrams of vehicle speed-flow-density relationships, ranging from stable traffic flow to unstable conditions, were plotted in this paper. The values of capacity, maximum motorcycle flow, critical mean stream speed, and critical density of traffic flow were computed. Results indicated that the capacity values of urban roads with two, three, and four lanes per direction are 13,358, 21,725 and 24,335 (motorcycles per hour) respectively. The capacity, therefore, increases with the number of lanes of urban roads. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000382. (C) 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The system performs in real time, achieving good results, even in challenging situations, such as with moving casted shadows on sunny days, headlight reflections on the road, rainy days, and traffic jams, using only a single standard camera. We propose a robust adaptive multicue segmentation strategy that detects foreground pixels corresponding to moving and stopped vehicles, even with noisy images due to compression. First, the approach adaptively thresholds a combination of luminance and chromaticity disparity maps between the learned background and the current frame. It then adds extra features derived from gradient differences to improve the segmentation of dark vehicles with casted shadows and removes headlight reflections on the road. The segmentation is further used by a two-step tracking approach, which combines the simplicity of a linear 2-D Kalman filter and the complexity of a 3-D volume estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Experimental results show that our method can count and classify vehicles in real time with a high level of performance under different environmental situations comparable with those of inductive loop detectors.

The approach uses exponential smoothing to preprocess traffic flow data by removing the lumpiness from collected traffic flow data, before employing a variant of the LM algorithm to train the NN weights of an NN model. This approach aids NN training, as the preprocessed traffic flow data are more smooth and continuous than the original unprocessed traffic flow data. The proposed method was evaluated by forecasting short-term traffic flow conditions on the Mitchell freeway in Western Australia. With regard to the generalization capabilities for short-term traffic flow forecasting, the NN models developed using the proposed approach outperform those that are developed based on the alternative tested algorithms, which are particularly designed either for short-term traffic flow forecasting or for enhancing generalization capabilities of NNs.

Maximum-Likelihood Acceleration Estimation From Existing Roadway Vehicle Detectors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Acceleration estimation; dilemma zone; estimation; maximum-likelihood	FUEL CONSUMPTION; SPEED	Transportation agencies have invested in extensive infrastructure for vehicle detection and speed estimation. Although knowledge of vehicle speeds helps characterize traffic flow, vehicle accelerations can lead to better characterization. Vehicle accelerations are important in designing signal timings with respect to yellow intervals and green extensions for dilemma zone protection. Vehicle acceleration models are also used in studies of vehicle emissions. This paper develops an algorithm that uses existing inductive loops and magnetometers in speed trap configurations to measure acceleration. The algorithm chosen is the maximum-likelihood estimator, given an additive white Gaussian noise model for noise. The algorithm is found to have an error of about 0.02 g.

A Cooperative Approach to Traffic Congestion Detection With Complex Event Processing and VANET	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Complex event processing (CEP); event-driven architecture (EDA); traffic information systems (TISs); vehicular ad hoc network (VANET)		Currently, distributed traffic information systems have come up as one of the most important approaches for detecting traffic flow problems on a road. For that purpose, they usually make use of the location information that vehicles share among them through periodical messages that are transmitted across a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). This paper puts forward an event-driven architecture (EDA) as a novel mechanism to get insight into VANET messages to detect different levels of traffic jams; furthermore, it also takes into account environmental data that come from external data sources, such as weather conditions. The proposed EDA has been developed through the complex-event-processing technology. Simulation tests show that the proposed mechanism can detect traffic congestions, which involve different numbers of lanes and lengths with short delay.

Distributed maximum likelihood estimation for flow and speed density prediction in distributed traffic detectors with Gaussian mixture model assumption	IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article							EM ALGORITHM; SENSOR	In this study a distributed maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) has been presented to estimate ML function of traffic flow and mean traffic speed in a freeway. This algorithm uses traffic measurements including volume, occupancy and mean speed which gathered by some inductive loop detectors. These traffic detectors (traffic sensors) located in certain distances in the freeway network such that they establish a distributed sensor network (DSN). The presented distributed estimator has employed a distributed expectation maximisation algorithm to calculate MLE. In the E-step of this algorithm, each sensor node independently calculates local sufficient statistics by using local observations. A consensus filter is used to diffuse local sufficient statistics to neighbours and estimate global sufficient statistics in each node. In the M-step of this algorithm, each sensor node uses the estimated global sufficient statistics to update model parameters of the Gaussian mixtures, which can maximise the log-likelihood in the same way as in the standard EM algorithm. As the consensus filter only requires each node to communicate with its neighbours, the distributed algorithm is scalable and robust. A set of field traffic data from Minnesota freeway network has been used to simulate and verify the proposed distributed estimator performance.	[Ramezani, A.; Moshiri, B.; Kian, A.

However, few studies focus on exploring the effect. In this paper, the turn signal effect was taken into account by proposing a new symmetric two-lane cellular automaton (T-STCA) model, and the new model was set to compare with the STCA, H-STCA and A-STCA models. Numerical results show that using the T-STCA model to describe lane-changing or overtaking, the process appeared in several consecutive time steps; while using the other three models, the process appeared only in one time step. In addition, the T-STCA model could describe the mixed traffic flow more realistically and the turn signal effect could help the plugs to dissolve more quickly.

First, we analyze the retrieval of intra-day trend for traffic flow series and determine whether this retrieval process improves traffic prediction. We compare different highway traffic prediction models that use either the original traffic flow series or the residual time series with the intra-day trend removed. Test results indicate that the prediction performance MAY be significantly improved in the latter scenario. Second, we address two other related questions: the influence of missing data and traffic breakdown prediction. We show that the Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) method, which also utilizes the intra-day trend of traffic flow series, can be a useful tool in imputing the missing data. It can simultaneously ensure that the prediction error remains at an acceptable level, especially when the missing ratio is relatively low. We also show that almost all the known predictors have hidden assumptions of smoothness and, thus, cannot predict the burst points that deviate too far from the intra-day trend. As a result, traffic breakdown points can only be identified but not predicted. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tian, JF; Yuan, ZZ; Treiber, M; Jia, B; Zhang, WY				Tian, Jun-fang; Yuan, Zhen-zhou; Treiber, Martin; Jia, Bin; Zhang, Wen-yi			Cellular automaton model within the fundamental-diagram approach reproducing some findings of the three-phase theory	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Cellular automaton; Synchronized traffic flow; Fundamental diagram; Three-phase theory	TRAFFIC FLOW; METASTABLE STATES; DYNAMICAL MODEL; HIGHWAY; PHYSICS; WAVES	We propose a simple cellular automaton for traffic flow within the fundamental diagram, which could reproduce aspects of the three-phase theory. This so-called average space gap model (ASGM) is based on the Nagel-Schreckenberg model with additional slow-to-start and anticipation rules. The anticipation rule takes into account the average space gap of multiple leading vehicles and conveys to the model its three-phase property. Due to the anticipation rule, ASGM can show the transition from free flow to synchronized flow. Due to the slow-to-start rule, ASGM can show the spontaneous wide moving jam emerges in the synchronized flow. Simulations are carried out for periodic and open boundary conditions. Under periodic boundary condition, the fundamental diagram, and the properties of synchronized flow are studied. Under open boundary condition, different congested patterns induced by an on-ramp are analyzed. We found that the ASGM produces the same spatiotemporal dynamics as many of the more complex three-phase models.

The motion of shuttle buses depends on the inflow rate of passengers, the number of buses, and the delayed increase of buses. The bus schedule is closely related to the dynamic motion of buses. The delayed increase of buses has an important effect on the arrival of buses. We present the delayed piecewise map model for the dynamics of shuttle buses with the delayed increase. The motion of buses changes from a stable state to an unstable state and vice versa with increasing the inflow rate. The arrival of shuttle buses oscillates with various periods in the unstable state. The dynamic transitions change highly with the delayed increase of buses. We clarify the effect of the delayed increase on the bus schedule. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The material consists of survey data from 919 residents living along four major arterial streets in Malmo, Sweden, where the respondents were instructed to make estimates with their specific street in mind. The results show that respondents who stated that they often walk along their street seemed to make higher estimates of the occurrence of the tested factors. When involving people in the planning process, this implies that it might be important to control for walking frequency when asking people about phenomena in their traffic environment. The results also indicate that the respondents were quite able to relate their estimates to the specific street. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Sun, Z; Jia, B; Li, XG				Sun Ze; Jia Bin; Li Xin-Gang			The study of the interference between pedestrians and vehicles based on cellular automaton model	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						cellular automaton model; mixed traffic; pedestrian; vehicle	TRAFFIC FLOW MODEL; SIMULATION; SCHEME	Serious interference between motor vehicles and pedestrians happens at crosswalk when pedestrian flow is large. In this paper, cellular automata models are used to model the behavior of mutual interferences between pedestrians and vehicles at crosswalk by introducing conflict interference rules between pedestrians and vehicles. Numerical simulations are carried out to study the fluxes of vehicle and pedestrian, influenced by the parameters, such as the arrival rates, pedestrian waiting time and the pedestrian's sensitivity coefficient to vehicle. Simulation results show that the model can reflect the interference characteristics between pedestrians and vehicles well. With the increase of threshold that pedestrians cross the traffic lane riskily, motor vehicle flow increases but pedestrian flow decreases. With the increase of pedestrian's sensitivity coefficient, pedestrian avoiding probability decreases, motor vehicle flow decreases, pedestrian flow increases. The results have certain significance for the control and management of mixed traffic.

J	Devarasetty, PC; Zhang, YL; Fitzpatrick, K				Devarasetty, Prem Chand; Zhang, Yunlong; Fitzpatrick, Kay			Differentiating between Left-Turn Gap and Lag Acceptance at Unsignalized Intersections as a Function of the Site Characteristics	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Left-turn; Gap acceptance; Critical gap; Critical lag; Traffic flow; Logit model; Unsignalized intersections		Left-turn gap acceptance at an unsignalized intersection is dependent on many factors. The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) uses a single value of critical gap for all types of intersections; however, this may be oversimplistic and lead to inaccurate estimates of left-turn delay and capacity. Most existing studies also do not differentiate between gap and lag when evaluating gap acceptance. In this paper, binary logit models were developed to estimate the probability of accepting or rejecting a given gap or lag for a left-turning vehicle from a major road at an unsignalized intersection considering a number of potential influencing factors. Gap acceptance behavior was found to be influenced by the type of gap presented to the driver (gap or lag). Gap duration, total wait time, time to turn, distance to next signal downstream, and median type were found to be significant factors in predicting the probability of accepting or rejecting a gap. In the model for lag acceptance lag duration, time to turn, crossing width, speed limit, and distance to next signal downstream were found to be significant. Equations for estimating the critical gap and lag were developed. Critical gap and lag were found to be varying over a wide range of values depending on the type of intersection. The range was smaller for critical gaps than lags. The findings from this study can improve operational analysis of left turns at unsignalized intersections by using different critical gaps for different traffic and geometric conditions.

J	McGowen, P; Stanley, L				McGowen, Patrick; Stanley, Laura			Alternative Methodology for Determining Gap Acceptance for Two-Way Stop-Controlled Intersections	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article						Traffic models; Traffic flow; Simulation; Driver behavior; Intersections; Monte Carlo method		Vehicles approaching a two-way, stop-controlled intersection from the minor roadway will wait for a large enough gap in the traffic on the major roadway before entering the intersection. The primary method for modeling intersections for both safety and operations is to determine a critical gap size such that a vehicle waiting at the stop sign will enter the intersection if the gap on the major roadway is larger than the critical gap. The method that is currently most accepted for measuring the critical gap is a maximum likelihood estimation developed by Troutbeck. The Troutbeck method may yield biased results and cannot be used with data sets that contain only rejected gaps. This paper proposes an alternative model for estimating the critical gap that is unbiased and can be used with naturalistic data. The proposed model requires that the gap distribution of the major street be known. This proposed model is compared with the Troutbeck model through a Monte-Carlo simulation. The proposed model yields accurate estimates of the mean critical gap as long as accurate estimates of the major street traffic are used. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000358.

J	Chan, KY; Khadem, S; Dillon, TS; Palade, V; Singh, J; Chang, E				Chan, Kit Yan; Khadem, Saghar; Dillon, Tharam S.; Palade, Vasile; Singh, Jaipal; Chang, Elizabeth			Selection of Significant On-Road Sensor Data for Short-Term Traffic Flow Forecasting Using the Taguchi Method	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Input patterns; neural network configuration; neural networks; sensor data; Taguchi method; traffic flow forecasting	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; PREDICTION; DESIGN; FEEDFORWARD; SIMULATION; PARAMETERS	Over the past two decades, neural networks have been applied to develop short-term traffic flow predictors. The past traffic flow data, captured by on-road sensors, is used as input patterns of neural networks to forecast future traffic flow conditions. The amount of input patterns captured by the on-road sensors is usually huge, but not all input patterns are useful when trying to predict the future traffic flow. The inclusion of useless input patterns is not effective to developing neural network models. Therefore, the selection of appropriate input patterns, which are significant for short-term traffic flow forecasting, is essential. This can be conducted by setting an appropriate configuration of input nodes of the neural network; however, this is usually conducted by trial and error. In this paper, the Taguchi method, which is a robust and systematic optimization approach for designing reliable and high-quality models, is proposed for the purpose of determining an appropriate neural network configuration, in terms of input nodes, in order to capture useful input patterns for traffic flow forecasting. The effectiveness of the Taguchi method is demonstrated by a case study, which aims to develop a short-term traffic flow predictor based on past traffic flow data captured by on-road sensors located on a Western Australia freeway. Three advantages of using the Taguchi method were demonstrated: 1) short-term traffic flow predictors with high accuracy can be designed; 2) the development time for short-term traffic flow predictors is reasonable; and 3) the accuracy of short-term traffic flow predictors is robust with respect to the initial settings of the neural network parameters during the learning phase.

Different LGP, MLP and FL models are developed for estimating the 5- and 30-min traffic flow rates. New LGP- and MLP-based prediction equations are derived for the traffic flow rates in the 5- and 30-min time intervals. The models are established upon extensive databases of the traffic flow records obtained from Iran's Rasht-Qazvin highway. The results indicate that the proposed models are effectively capable of predicting the target values. The LGP-based models are found to be simple, straightforward and more practical for predictive purposes compared with the other derived models.

Bayesian modeling of the microscopic traffic characteristics of overtaking in two-lane highways	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						Overtaking maneuver; Two-lane highways; Microscopic traffic flow characteristics; Driving simulator; Bayesian networks	DRIVING SIMULATOR VALIDATION; PASSING SIGHT DISTANCE; NETWORKS; PERFORMANCE; VEHICLES; DRIVERS; DESIGN	Bayesian networks are employed to model the uncertainty hindering in the overtaking behavior of young drivers in two-lane highways and reveal the traffic related microscopic characteristics that may influence the decision to overtake. Results using data from an experiment conducted on driving simulator show that male drivers, on average, accept smaller gaps for overtaking than female drivers. For both male and female drivers, the spacing with the lead and the opposing vehicle is more influential to the probability to overtake compared to vehicle speed. Moreover, a thorough look at the relationships between the microscopic traffic characteristics and the probability to overtake reveals differences between male and female drivers regarding the road traffic scene appraisal mechanism on the emergence of an opportunity to overtake.

J	Ghosh, S; Banerjee, A; Ganguly, N				Ghosh, Saptarshi; Banerjee, Avishek; Ganguly, Niloy			Some insights on the recent spate of accidents in Indian Railways	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Transportation; Indian Railway network; Trunk-routes; Traffic flow; Headway; Train accidents	NETWORK; CONGESTION; CENTRALITY	Indian Railways (IR), the largest rail passenger carrier in the world, has experienced 11 major accidents due to derailment or collision between trains in the year 2010, leading to several human casualties and large-scale disruptions in traffic. Alarmingly, 8 of these 11 accidents have occurred within a specific geographical region known as the Indo-Gangetic plain. In order to identify the general causes of such frequent accidents, and the specific factors leading to repeated accidents in a particular region, we systematically collect and analyze data of IR traffic over the last two decades. We find that there has been an unbalanced growth in IR traffic in the Indo-Gangetic plain over the last two decades, and consequently most of the high-traffic rail-routes presently lie in this region. However, construction of new tracks and train-routes has been nominal compared to the increase in traffic, leading to frequent congestion and over-utilization of existing tracks. Modeling the traffic-flow using computer simulations, we also show that if all trains were to travel in accordance with the IR schedule, the present infrastructure would be insufficient to handle the resultant traffic-flow in some of the high-traffic routes. Hence this study reflects some of the inherent problems in the scheduling of trains and evolution of IR, and also identifies several regions where traffic is likely to exceed safe limits.

By employing the non-negative matrix factorization and optimization methods, we find that, people travel on workdays mainly for three purposes: commuting between home and workplace, traveling from workplace to workplace, and others such as leisure activities. Therefore, traffic flow in one area or between any pair of locations can be approximated by a linear combination of three basis flows, corresponding to the three purposes respectively. We name the coefficients in the linear combination as traffic powers, each of which indicates the strength of each basis flow. The traffic powers on different days are typically different even for the same location, due to the uncertainty of the human motion. Therefore, we provide a probability distribution function for the relative deviation of the traffic power. This distribution function is in terms of a series of functions for normalized binomial distributions. It can be well explained by statistical theories and is verified by empirical data. These findings are applicable in predicting the road traffic, tracing the traffic pattern and diagnosing the traffic related abnormal events. These results can also be used to infer land uses of urban area quite parsimoniously.

J	Dong, CF; Ma, X				Dong, Chuanfei; Ma, Xu			Dynamic weight in intelligent transportation systems: A comparison based on two exit scenarios	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Dynamic weight; Congestion cluster; Exit scenario; Intelligent traffic systems; Cellular automaton model; Velocity distribution	TRAFFIC FLOW MODEL; FEEDBACK STRATEGY; INFORMATION; TRANSITION; PHYSICS; JAMS	Proposing a good exit scenario can make great contributions to improving road conditions. The influence of two exit scenarios, which depend on the dynamic behavior of the last vehicle (that closest to the exit), on the route flux, vehicle number, and speed by using two feedback strategies with different arrival rates (V-p) was studied. We find that the weight of the route is dynamic instead of static, which depends on the real route conditions. In our case study, we find that the flux threshold value with respect to the necessity of applying information feedback strategy is 0.32 (which corresponds to V-p approximate to 0.65).

Cellular automata simulation of traffic including cars and bicycles	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow; Urban traffic; Bicycle traffic; Discrete stochastic model; Simulation; Cellular automata	FLOW; MODEL; LESSONS	As 'greening' of all aspects of human activity becomes mainstream, transportation science is also increasingly focused around sustainability. Modal co-existence between motorised and non-motorised traffic on urban networks is, in this context, of particular interest for traffic flow modelling. The main modelling problems here are posed by the heterogeneity of vehicles, including size and dynamics, and by the complex interactions at intersections. Herein we address these with a novel technique, based on one-dimensional cellular automata components, for modelling network infrastructure and its occupancy by vehicles. We use this modelling approach, together with a corresponding vehicle behaviour model, to simulate combined car and bicycle traffic for two elemental scenarios examples of components that would be used in the building of an arbitrary network. Results of simulations performed on these scenarios, (i) a stretch of road and (ii) an intersection causing conflict between cars and bicycles sharing a lane, are presented and analysed.

Traffic signals turn on during the amount of time determined. Intelligent traffic management systems emerge as a need to handle the dynamicity of traffic. These systems are first implemented on simulators in order to mimic the real life situations before realization. Yet, we have implemented a real time traffic simulator with an adaptive fuzzy inference algorithm that arranges the foreseen light signal duration. It changes the time duration of lights depending on waiting vehicles behind green and red lights at crossroad. The simulation has also been supported with real time graphical visualization. Given a scenario, it creates random traffic flows according to specified parameters. Next, obtained results have been interpreted in the simulation environment. According to inferences from adaptive environment, TSK (Takagi-Sugeno-Kang) and Mamdani models have also been implemented to give baselines for verification. Several experiments have been conducted and compared against classical techniques such as Webster (1958) Road research technical paper No 39 and HCM (2000) TRB, special report 209, statistically to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

J	Dunne, S; Ghosh, B				Dunne, Stephen; Ghosh, Bidisha			Regime-Based Short-Term Multivariate Traffic Condition Forecasting Algorithm	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Short-term traffic forecasting; Multivariate; Speed prediction; Time-series classification; Adaptive learning	SPEED PREDICTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; FLOW; VOLUME; MODELS; TIME	Predictions of fundamental traffic variables in the short-term or near-term future are vital for any successful dynamic traffic management application. Univariate short-term traffic flow prediction algorithms are popular in literature. However, to facilitate the operationalities of advanced adaptive traffic management systems, there is a necessity of developing multivariate traffic condition prediction algorithms. A new multivariate short-term traffic flow and speed prediction methodology is proposed in this paper where the traffic flow and speed observations from uncongested (or linear) and congested (or nonlinear) regimes are regime-adjusted to ensure consistent system dynamics. The prediction methodology is developed by using artificial neural networks (ANN) algorithms in conjunction with adaptive learning rules. These learning rules demonstrate significantly improved accuracy and simultaneous reduction in computation times. Additionally, the paper attempts to identify the most suitable adaptive learning rule from a chosen pool of rules. The validation of the prediction methodology is performed by using traffic data from multiple locations in the United Kingdom (U. K.). The results indicate that the proposed multivariate forecasting algorithm is effective and computationally parsimonious to simultaneously predict traffic flow and speed in freeway or highway networks.

J	Kweon, YJ				Kweon, Young-Jun			Disaggregate safety evaluation for signalized intersections and evaluation tool	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						signalized intersection; traffic safety; safety performance function	HOURLY TRAFFIC FLOW; ROAD ACCIDENTS	This study was to evaluate traffic safety of four-legged signalized intersections and to develop a spreadsheet tool for identifying high-risk intersections taking into consideration vehicle movements, left-turn signal phase types, and times of day. The study used data from Virginia and employed count data models and the empirical Bayes (EB) method for safety evaluation of such intersections. It was found that crash pattern defined by vehicle movements involved in a crash and time of day are important factors for intersection crash analysis. Especially for a safety performance function (SPF), a model specification (Poisson or NB), inclusion of left-turn signal types, type of traffic flow variables, variable functional forms, and/or magnitudes of coefficients turned out to be different across times of day and crash patterns. The spreadsheet application tool was developed incorporating the developed SPFs and the EB method. As long as Synchro files for signal plans and crash database are maintained, no additional field data collection efforts are required. Adjusting the developed SPFs and the spreadsheet for recent traffic and safety conditions can be done by applying the calibration methods employed in the SafetyAnalyst software and the Highway Safety Manual. Implementing the developed tool equipped with streamlining data entry would greatly improve accuracy and efficiency of safety evaluation of four-legged signalized intersections in localities and highway agencies that cannot operate the SafetyAnalyst.

J	Hong, WC				Hong, Wei-Chiang			Application of seasonal SVR with chaotic immune algorithm in traffic flow forecasting	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow forecasting; Seasonal adjustment; Support vector regression (SVR); Chaotic immune algorithm (CIA); SARIMA; Seasonal Holt-Winters (SHW)	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORK MODELS; OPTIMIZATION; PREDICTION; RELIABILITY; VOLUME	Accurate forecasting of inter-urban traffic flow has been one of the most important issues globally in the research on road traffic congestion. Because the information of inter-urban traffic presents a challenging situation, the traffic flow forecasting involves a rather complex nonlinear data pattern, particularly during daily peak periods, traffic flow data reveals cyclic (seasonal) trend. In the recent years, the support vector regression model (SVR) has been widely used to solve nonlinear regression and time series problems. However, the applications of SVR models to deal with cyclic (seasonal) trend time series had not been widely explored. This investigation presents a traffic flow forecasting model that combines the seasonal support vector regression model with chaotic immune algorithm (SSVRCIA), to forecast inter-urban traffic flow. Additionally, a numerical example of traffic flow values from northern Taiwan is used to elucidate the forecasting performance of the proposed SSVRCIA model. The forecasting results indicate that the proposed model yields more accurate forecasting results than the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average, back-propagation neural network, and seasonal Holt-Winters models. Therefore, the SSVRCIA model is a promising alternative for forecasting traffic flow.

J	Wei, Y; Chen, MC				Wei, Yu; Chen, Mu-Chen			Forecasting the short-term metro passenger flow with empirical mode decomposition and neural networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Forecasting; Short-term metro passenger flow; Empirical mode decomposition; Neural networks	HILBERT-HUANG TRANSFORM; TRAFFIC FLOW; TRAVEL DEMAND; PREDICTION; ARIMA; ALGORITHM	Short-term passenger flow forecasting is a vital component of transportation systems. The forecasting results can be applied to support transportation system management such as operation planning, and station passenger crowd regulation planning. In this paper, a hybrid EMD-BPN forecasting approach which combines empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and back-propagation neural networks (BPN) is developed to predict the short-term passenger flow in metro systems. There are three stages in the EMD-BPN forecasting approach. The first stage (EMD Stage) decomposes the short-term passenger flow series data into a number of intrinsic mode function (IMF) components. The second stage (Component Identification Stage) identifies the meaningful IMFs as inputs for BPN. The third stage (BPN Stage) applies BPN to perform the passenger flow forecasting. The historical passenger flow data, the extracted EMD components and temporal factors (i.e., the day of the week, the time period of the day, and weekday or weekend) are taken as inputs in the third stage. The experimental results indicate that the proposed hybrid EMD-BPN approach performs well and stably in forecasting the short-term metro passenger flow. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Treiber, M; Kesting, A				Treiber, Martin; Kesting, Arne			Validation of traffic flow models with respect to the spatiotemporal evolution of congested traffic patterns	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Spatiotemporal dynamics; Traffic instabilities; Calibration; Validation; Traffic flow models; Stop-and-go traffic	SIMULATION	We propose a quantitative approach for calibrating and validating key features of traffic instabilities based on speed time series obtained from aggregated data of a series of neighboring stationary detectors. The approach can be used to validate models that are calibrated by other criteria with respect to their collective dynamics. We apply the proposed criteria to historic traffic databases of several freeways in Germany containing about 400 occurrences of congestions thereby providing a reference for model calibration and quality assessment with respect to the spatiotemporal dynamics. First tests with microscopic and macroscopic models indicate that the criteria are both robust and discriminative, i.e., clearly distinguishes between models of higher and lower predictive power.

The asymmetric lane changing rules in the slowdown section and the lane squeezing behaviors at the bottleneck are taken into account. Under the periodic boundary condition, the numerical simulations are performed. The traffic states change with increasing density. And an interesting phenomenon of ratio inversion appears. When the current saturates, the headway and velocity discontinuously vary with the position.

J	Kerner, BS				Kerner, Boris S.			Complexity of spatiotemporal traffic phenomena in flow of identical drivers: Explanation based on fundamental hypothesis of three-phase theory	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; SYNCHRONIZED FLOW; MICROSCOPIC MODEL; EMPIRICAL-TEST; ON-RAMP; PATTERNS; PHASE; CONGESTION; PHYSICS; TIME	Based on numerical simulations of a stochastic three-phase traffic flow model, we reveal the physics of the fundamental hypothesis of three-phase theory that, in contrast with a fundamental diagram of classical traffic flow theories, postulates the existence of a two-dimensional (2D) region of steady states of synchronized flow where a driver makes an arbitrary choice of a space gap (time headway) to the preceding vehicle. We find that macroscopic and microscopic spatiotemporal effects of the entire complexity of traffic congestion observed up to now in real measured traffic data can be explained by simulations of traffic flow consisting of identical drivers and vehicles, if a microscopic model used in these simulations incorporates the fundamental hypothesis of three-phase theory. It is shown that the driver's choice of space gaps within the 2D region of synchronized flow associated with the fundamental hypothesis of three-phase theory can qualitatively change types of congested patterns that can emerge at a highway bottleneck. In particular, if drivers choose long enough spaces gaps associated with the fundamental hypothesis, then general patterns, which consist of synchronized flow and wide moving jams, do not emerge independent of the flow rates and bottleneck characteristics: Even at a heavy bottleneck leading to a very low speed within congested patterns, only synchronized flow patterns occur in which no wide moving jams emerge spontaneously.

For equipped vehicles a strategy to stabilize traffic flow and to reduce travel time is proposed. The strategy comprises rules to determine both how and when to change driving behavior. Vehicles that detect perturbations downstream try to keep a larger gap to their predecessor by which they aim to compensate traffic inhomogeneities. Improvement of traffic flow was observed even for a ratio of equipped vehicles as low as five percent. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Redistribution of Traffic Related Air Pollution Associated with a New Road Tunnel	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							AMBIENT NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS; CHILDHOOD ASTHMA; EXPOSURE; CHILDREN; QUALITY; COHORT; CONGESTION; HIGHWAY; IMPACTS	The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a new road tunnel on the concentration and distribution of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP), specifically nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM), and to determine its relationship to change in traffic flow. We used continuously recorded data from four monitoring stations at nonroadside locations within the study area and three regional monitors outside the area. The four monitors in the study area were in background locations where smaller pollutant changes were expected compared with changes near the bypassed main road. We also deployed passive samplers to assess finer spatial variability in NO2 including application of a land use regression model (LUR). The study was conducted from 2006 to 2008. Analysis of the continuously recorded data showed that the tunnel intervention did not lead to consistent reductions in NO2 or PM over the wider study area. However, there were significant decreases in NO2, NOx, and PM10 in the eastern section of the study area. Analysis of passive sampler data indicated that the greatest reductions in NO2 concentrations occurred within 100 m of the bypassed main road. The LUR model also demonstrated that changes in NO2 were most marked adjacent to the bypassed main road. These findings support the use of methods that highlight fine spatial variability in TRAP and demonstrate the utility of traffic interventions in reducing air pollution exposures for populations living close to main roads.

MINIMAL TRAFFIC MODEL WITH SAFE DRIVING CONDITIONS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Traffic flow; limited deceleration; traffic phase diagrams; traffic safety; coupled-map	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; STATISTICAL PHYSICS; FLOW; SYSTEMS	We have developed a new computational traffic model in which security aspects are fundamental. In this paper we show that this model reproduces many known empirical aspects of vehicular traffic such as the three states of traffic flow and the backward speed of the downstream front of a traffic jam ( C), without the aid of adjustable parameters. The model is studied for both open and closed single lane traffic systems. Also, we were able to analytically compute the value of C as 15: 37 km/h from a relation that only includes the human reaction time, the mean vehicle length and the effective friction coefficient during the braking process of a vehicle as its main components.

Technical Construction Regulations (STR 2.06.01:1999) of Lithuania do not provide specific recommendations for calculation of the capacity of short traffic lanes. During 2005-2010, the authors of the article performed on-site tests of transport flows in the city of Vilnius and devised the methodology for modelling and calculation of short traffic lane capacity considering the size of the traffic flows. The article presents recommendations on calculation of lost time and vehicle queue lengths considering the size of traffic flows.

Real-Time Lagrangian Traffic State Estimator for Freeways	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Data processing; Lagrangian formulation; traffic management; traffic state estimation	KINEMATIC WAVES; MODEL	Freeway traffic state estimation and prediction are central components in real-time traffic management and information applications. Model-based traffic state estimators consist of a dynamic model for the state variables (e. g., a first-or second-order macroscopic traffic flow model), a set of observation equations relating sensor observations to the system state (e. g., the fundamental diagrams), and a data-assimilation technique to combine the model predictions with the sensor observations [e. g., the extended Kalman filter (EKF)]. Commonly, both process and observation models are formulated in Eulerian (space-time) coordinates. Recent studies have shown that this model can be formulated and solved more efficiently and accurately in Lagrangian (vehicle number-time) coordinates. In this paper, we propose a new model-based state estimator based on the EKF technique, in which the discretized Lagrangian Lighthill-Whitham and Richards (LWR) model is used as the process equation, and in which observation models for both Eulerian and Lagrangian sensor data (from loop detectors and vehicle trajectories, respectively) are incorporated. This Lagrangian state estimator is validated and compared with a Eulerian state estimator based on the same LWR model using an empirical microscopic traffic data set from the U. K. The results indicate that the Lagrangian estimator is significantly more accurate and offers computational and theoretical benefits over the Eulerian approach.	[Yuan, Yufei; van Lint, J. W.

Floating Car Data Augmentation Based on Infrastructure Sensors and Neural Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Floating car data; neural networks; traffic flow	TRAVEL-TIME PREDICTION	The development of new-generation intelligent vehicle technologies will lead to a better level of road safety and CO2 emission reductions. However, the weak point of all these systems is their need for comprehensive and reliable data. For traffic data acquisition, two sources are currently available: 1) infrastructure sensors and 2) floating vehicles. The former consists of a set of fixed point detectors installed in the roads, and the latter consists of the use of mobile probe vehicles as mobile sensors. However, both systems still have some deficiencies. The infrastructure sensors retrieve information from static points of the road, which are spaced, in some cases, kilometers apart. This means that the picture of the actual traffic situation is not a real one. This deficiency is corrected by floating cars, which retrieve dynamic information on the traffic situation. Unfortunately, the number of floating data vehicles currently available is too small and insufficient to give a complete picture of the road traffic. In this paper, we present a floating car data (FCD) augmentation system that combines information from floating data vehicles and infrastructure sensors, and that, by using neural networks, is capable of incrementing the amount of FCD with virtual information. This system has been implemented and tested on actual roads, and the results show little difference between the data supplied by the floating vehicles and the virtual vehicles.

Wireless sensor networks for traffic management and road safety	IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article							VEHICLE-TO-VEHICLE; SYSTEMS; MODELS	Wireless sensor networks (WSN) employ self-powered sensing devices that are mutually interconnected through wireless ad-hoc technologies. This study illustrates the basics of WSN-based traffic monitoring and summarises the possible benefits in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) applications for the improvement of quality and safety of mobility. Compared with conventional infrastructure-based monitoring systems, this technology facilitates a denser deployment of sensors along the road, resulting in a higher spatial resolution of traffic parameter sampling. An experimental data analysis reported in this study shows how the high spatial resolution can enhance the reliability of traffic modelling as well as the accuracy of short-term traffic state prediction. The analysis uses the data published by the freeway performance measurement system of the University of California-Berkeley and the California Department of Transportation. A microscopic cellular automata model is used to estimate traffic flow and occupancy over time on a road segment in which a relevant traffic-flow anomaly is detected. The analysis shows that the estimate accuracy improves for increasing number of active sensors, as feasible in the case of WSN-based monitoring systems.

Being given the predicted motion of the traffic flow, the proposed semi-reactive planning strategy realizes all required long-term maneuver tasks (lane-changing, merging, distance-keeping, velocity-keeping, precise stopping, etc.) while providing short-term collision avoidance. The key to comfortable, human-like as well as physically feasible trajectories is the combined optimization of the lateral and longitudinal movements in street-relative coordinates with carefully chosen cost functionals and terminal state sets (manifolds). The performance of the approach is demonstrated in simulated traffic scenarios.

Since general studies on calculating CO2 emissions from transportation sources have been based on petroleum consumption data, it has been difficult to analyze spatial activities and characteristics of transportation sources. In this study, we propose a method for calculating CO2 emissions from on-road transportation sources in Seoul. We focused on CO2 emission calculation by applying real traffic flow data and analyzed base emissions from the main roads and local streets. Because the emissions were calculated using a 1 kmx1 km grid cell format, these data can be applied to other compatible transportation data sets for air pollution analysis, modal shift analysis, etc in the transportation sector.

J	Sacone, S; Siri, S				Sacone, Simona; Siri, Silvia			A control scheme for freeway traffic systems based on hybrid automata	DISCRETE EVENT DYNAMIC SYSTEMS-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Freeway systems; Hybrid automata; Model predictive control; MILP problems	MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; REAL-TIME CONTROL; BOULEVARD-PERIPHERIQUE; SOUTHERN PART; FLOW; OPTIMIZATION	In this paper a hybrid control scheme is devised in order to regulate traffic conditions in freeway systems. The considered control actions are ramp metering, i.e. using traffic lights at the on-ramps in order to regulate incoming traffic, and variable speed limits to be displayed on on-road variable message signs. The proposed scheme is composed of two levels: the lower level is characterized by different Model Predictive Control regulators, whereas at the higher level the different control actions are chosen according to a discrete-event dynamics. The overall scheme is then represented with the formalism of discrete-time discrete-event automata. More in detail, at the lower level, the prediction model used in the Model Predictive Control schemes is the first-order dynamical model of traffic flow in which we approximate the steady-state speed-density characteristic as a piecewise constant function. This approximation is motivated by the fact that we need a simpler finite-horizon problem to be solved on line, that in this case becomes a Mixed-Integer Linear programming problem. Depending on the system operating conditions, different regulators are determined by means of suitable Model Predictive Control schemes. The higher level of the control scheme has the function of identifying the present operating conditions and then switching to the suitable control action. The reported numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid control framework.

J	Wei, Z; Bo, C; Bo, Z				Wei, Zhang; Bo, Cheng; Bo, Zhang			Research on eye location algorithm robust to driver's pose and illumination	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						driving safety; drowsiness detection; machine vision; eye location	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW; ENTROPY; IMAGE	Driver's drowsiness is one of the major causes of road accidents. The monitoring of a given driver's eye state by the use of a camera is considered to be a promising way to detect driver's drowsiness due to its accuracy and non-intrusiveness. However, eye location remains a challenging vision problem because of the constantly changing of illumination and driver's pose. Active shape model (ASM) is introduced in this paper to align the face. Though the ASM is a powerful statistical tool, it can suffer from changes in illumination and posture. Three contributions are involved in this paper. First, in order to maximize the tolerance of the ASM algorithm to illumination changes, we propose a robust ASM method with a novel local texture model learned from the self-quotient image instead of the original image. Second, a double layer overall shape model is proposed to enhance the adaptability of ASM. Third, strong constraints are achieved by an on-line learning of the distribution characteristics of the model parameters. The results show that the proposed algorithm is robust to the variation of illumination and driver's pose.

J	D'Acierno, L; Gallo, M; Montella, B				D'Acierno, Luca; Gallo, Mariano; Montella, Bruno			An Ant Colony Optimisation algorithm for solving the asymmetric traffic assignment problem	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Traffic; Ant Colony Optimisation; Signal settings design; Stochastic traffic assignment	SIGNAL SETTINGS; NETWORK EQUILIBRIUM; DESIGN; SYSTEM	In this paper we propose an Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) algorithm for defining the signal settings on urban networks following a local approach. This consists in optimising the signal settings of each intersection of an urban network as a function only of traffic flows at the accesses to the same intersection, taking account of the effects of signal settings on costs and on user route choices. This problem, also known as Local Optimisation of Signal Settings (LOSS), has been widely studied in the literature and can be formulated as an asymmetric assignment problem. The proposed ACO algorithm is based on two kinds of behaviour of artificial ants which allow the LOSS problem to be solved: traditional behaviour based on the response to pheromones for simulating user route choice, and innovative behaviour based on the pressure of an ant stream for solving the signal setting definition problem. Our results on real-scale networks show that the proposed approach allows the solution to be obtained in less time but with the same accuracy as in traditional MSA (Method of Successive Averages) approaches.

The next step in reducing road accidents is to coordinate such vehicles in advance not only to avoid collisions but to improve traffic flow as well. To this end, vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications are essential to properly manage traffic situations. This paper describes the AUTOPIA approach toward an intelligent traffic management system based on V2I communications. A fuzzy-based control algorithm that takes into account each vehicle's safe and comfortable distance and speed adjustment for collision avoidance and better traffic flow has been developed. The proposed solution was validated by an IEEE-802.11p-based communications study. The entire system showed good performance in testing in real-world scenarios, first by computer simulation and then with real vehicles.

J	Zhu, WX; Yu, RL				Zhu, Wen-Xing; Yu, Rui-Ling			Nonlinear analysis of traffic flow on a gradient highway	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Slope; Stability analysis; Nonlinear analysis; Gradient highway; Density waves; Numerical simulation	OPTIMAL VELOCITY MODEL; DENSITY WAVES; SOLITON; STABILITY	We investigate the slope effects upon traffic flow on a single lane gradient (uphill/downhill) highway analytically and numerically. The stability condition, neutral stability condition and instability condition are obtained by the use of linear stability theory. It is found that stability of traffic flow on the gradient varies with the slopes. The Burgers, Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) and modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equations are derived to describe the triangular shock waves, soliton waves and kink-antikink waves in the stable, meta-stable and unstable region respectively. A series of simulations are carried out to reproduce the triangular shock waves, kink-antikink waves and soliton waves. Results show that amplitudes of the triangular shock waves and kink-antikink waves vary with the slopes, the soliton wave appears in an upward form when the average headway is less than the safety distance and a downward form when the average headway is more than the safety distance. Moreover both the kink-antikink waves and the solitary waves propagate backwards. The numerical simulation shows a good agreement with the analytical result. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The incoming vehicle decelerates or accelerates by interacting with the vehicle ahead or behind on the second lane. We apply the extended optimal velocity model to the vehicular motion to take into account the velocity difference. We investigate whether or not the incoming vehicle collides with the vehicles ahead or behind. We derive such conditions that the incoming vehicle comes into collision with the vehicles ahead or behind. The safety-collision transition occurs by changing the lane. The dynamic transition depends highly on the headway, the vehicular speed, the sensitivity, and the velocity difference. We present the phase diagram (or region map) for the safety-collision transition. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Mitigation of congestion at a traffic bottleneck with diversion and lane restrictions	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow; Congestion mitigation; Bottleneck; Three-phase theory	REAL-TIME; ON-RAMP; OPTIMAL COORDINATION; PATTERNS; INFORMATION; TRANSITION; VEHICLES; FLOWS	Mitigation of congestion on a two-lane highway with an off-ramp and an on-ramp is simulated with three-phase traffic theory. Advanced travel information - the average velocity of vehicles near the bottleneck at an on-ramp - is used to divert vehicles at an upstream off-ramp. If enough vehicles divert, previously expanding synchronous flow congestion can be stalled and isolated to the region between the ramps. The introduction of lane restrictions (forbidding lane changing on the portion of highway between the ramps) in addition to diversion substantially reduces and essentially eliminates the congestion, restoring flow to nearly free-flow conditions.

In this paper, we develop a cellular automaton model to formulate the complicated turning behaviors of vehicles at intersections. Simulation results are quite in accord with the observation on the Beijing's 4th ring road. It is found that the right-turn vehicles may produce queue near the intersection, a short lane designed for right-turn has prominent effect in improving traffic flow, but, a too long lane for right-turn cannot further decrease the stop ratio as expected. These findings deepen our understanding on the effects of right-turn vehicles and may help the design and management of intersections.

J	Lee, J; Park, BB				Lee, Jaesup; Park, Byungkyu Brian			Determining Lane Use Distributions Using Basic Freeway Segment Density Measures	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Lane use distribution; Density measure; Basic freeway segment; Regression model; Transferability	TRAFFIC-FLOW	Lane use distribution is a useful factor in understanding the lane-by-lane variations of speed and volume on freeways. The most common lane distribution measure has been traffic volume. However, because travel speed from two conditions-congested and uncongested-corresponds to one traffic volume, this measure may provide a misleading or inaccurate assessment. This study used density measures to uniquely match traffic conditions (e.g., congestion level) and investigated lane use distributions in 2-, 3-, and 4-lane basic segments of freeways. In addition to the lane use distributions under uncongested to transition conditions, which has been addressed by previous research efforts, this study investigated lane use distributions under transition to congested conditions. A series of regression models was developed to predict lane use distributions of individual lanes that could provide information for monitoring traffic conditions and possibly predict when and how traffic breakdown would occur from a given condition. Statistical tests showed that the developed regression models from one site could be applicable to other sites that have similar roadway conditions, operational characteristics, and traffic regulations (e.g., posted speed limit).

J	Moridpour, S; Mazloumi, E; Sarvi, M; Rose, G				Moridpour, Sara; Mazloumi, Ehsan; Sarvi, Majid; Rose, Geoff			Enhanced Evaluation of Heavy Vehicle Lane Restriction Strategies in Microscopic Traffic Simulation	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Heavy vehicles; Lane restriction; Traffic analysis; Safety		Heavy vehicles can considerably affect traffic flow particularly during heavy-traffic conditions. Large numbers of heavy-vehicle lane-changing maneuvers can contribute to increase the number of traffic accidents and hence to reduce the freeway safety. The increase in the number of heavy vehicles on freeways has been the motivation to establish strategies to reduce the interaction between heavy vehicles and passenger cars. Previous studies have examined different lane-restriction strategies for heavy vehicles using microscopic traffic-simulation packages. Those packages mostly use a general lane-changing model to estimate the lane-changing behavior of heavy-vehicle and passenger-car drivers. The general lane-changing models ignore the fundamental differences in the lane-changing behavior of passenger cars and heavy vehicles. However, an exclusive lane-changing model for heavy vehicles can increase the accuracy of simulation models. The application of such a model can result in a more reliable evaluation of lane restriction strategies. In this paper, different lane restriction strategies are defined for heavy vehicles. For each strategy, the macroscopic and microscopic traffic measurements of two freeway sections in California are analyzed, using the VISSIM default lane-changing model and an exclusive heavy- vehicle lane-changing model. The results show that the VISSIM default model unrealistically overestimates the observed number of heavy-vehicle lane-changing maneuvers and potentially overestimates the number of traffic accidents. Using the exclusive lane-changing model for heavy vehicles enhances the accuracy of the VISSIM traffic simulation model in microscopically estimating the lane-changing maneuvers of heavy vehicles.

Stability of the traffic flow on a gradient is analyzed and the neutral stability condition is obtained. The KdV (Korteweg-de Vries) equation is derived the use of nonlinear analysis and soliton solution is obtained in the meta-stable region. Solitary density waves are reproduced in the numerical simulations. It is found that as uniform headway is less than the safety distance solitary wave exhibits upward form, otherwise it exhibits downward form. In general the numerical results are in good agreement with the analytical results.

J	Tang, TQ; Li, CY; Huang, HJ; Shang, HY				Tang, Tieqiao; Li, Chuanyao; Huang, Haijun; Shang, Huayan			A new fundamental diagram theory with the individual difference of the driver's perception ability	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS			English	Article						Fundamental diagram theory; Driver's perceived error; Driver's speed deviation difference; Equilibrium flow	3-PHASE TRAFFIC THEORY; ON-RAMP; EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES; CONTINUUM MODEL; FLOW MODEL; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; SPECIAL LANES; DERIVATION; HIGHWAY	Based on the driver's individual difference of the driver's perception ability, we in this paper develop a new fundamental diagram with the driver's perceived error and speed deviation difference. The analytical and numerical results show that the speed-density and flow-density data are divided into three prominent regions. In the first region, the speed-density and flow-density data are scattered around the equilibrium speed-density and flow-density curves of the classical fundamental diagram theory, where the widths of these scattered data are very narrow and slightly increase with the real density (i.e., the scattered data appear as two thicker lines); the running speed is approximately equal to the free flow speed and the real flow approximately linearly increases with the real density. In the second region, the speed-density and flow-density data are scattered widely in a two-dimensional region, but the shapes of these widely scattered data are related to the properties of the driver's perceived error and speed deviation difference. In the third region, the scattered speed-density and flow-density data appear but these scattered data will quickly degenerate into the equilibrium speed-density and flow-density curves with the increase of the real density. Finally, the numerical results illustrate that the new fundamental diagram theory also produces the F-line, U-line, and L-line. The shapes of the scattered data, F-line, U-line, and L-line are relevant to the properties of the driver's perceived error and speed deviation difference. These results are qualitatively accordant with the real traffic, which shows that the new fundamental diagram theory can better describe some complex traffic phenomena in the real traffic system. In addition, the above results can help us to further explain why the widely scattered speed-density and flow-density data appear in the real traffic system and better understand the effects of the driver's individual difference on traffic flow.

A new lattice model of traffic flow with the consideration of the traffic interruption probability	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic interruption probability; Lattice model; Traffic flow	MODIFIED KDV EQUATION; JAMMING TRANSITION; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; HYDRODYNAMIC MODELS; CRASHES	In this paper, we present a new lattice model which involves the effects of traffic interruption probability to describe the traffic flow on single lane freeways. The stability condition of the new model is obtained by the linear stability analysis and the modified Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation is derived through nonlinear analysis. Thus, the space will be divided into three regions: stable, metastable and unstable. The simulation results also show that the traffic interruption probability could stabilize traffic flow.

J	Lee, J; Williams, BM				Lee, Jisun; Williams, Billy M.			Development and evaluation of a constrained optimization model for traffic signal plan transition	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	EURO Conference on Optimization in Public Transport	2009	Bonn, GERMANY			Traffic control; Signal plan transition; Control optimization; Genetic algorithms		In advanced traffic signal control systems, plan transition is the process of switching from one timing plan to another to accommodate changes in traffic demand. In traditional coordinated system operation, whether plans are set by time of day or by traffic responsive plan selection, traffic flow can be severely disrupted by the sudden changes in traffic signal timing. Although various transition methods have been developed and refined, existing transition methods are not based on optimizing operational measures of effectiveness during plan transition periods. As the first step in remedying this situation, this paper presents a non-linear mathematical model that provides constrained delay minimization through incremental and simultaneous adjustments in offset and cycle length during plan transitions. According to the simulation results, currently used transition methods tend to assign an excessive amount of green time to the main street, resulting in additional side street delay without performance improvement for the total transportation network. By contrast, the proposed transition method showed measurable improvement in delay performance under a broad range of traffic and geometric conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A new lattice model of traffic flow with the anticipation effect of potential lane changing	PHYSICS LETTERS A			English	Article						Traffic flow; Lattice model; Lane changing probability	MODIFIED KDV EQUATION; JAMMING TRANSITION; HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL; CONTINUUM MODELS; 2-LANE FREEWAYS; PROBABILITY	A new lattice model of traffic flow is presented by taking into account the anticipation of potential lane changing on front site on single lane. The stability condition of the extended model is obtained by using the linear stability theory. The modified KdV equation near the critical point is constructed and solved through nonlinear analysis. And the phase space of traffic flow in the density-sensitivity space could be divided into three regions: stable, metastable and unstable ones, respectively. Numerical simulation also shows that the consideration of lane changing probability in lattice model can stabilize traffic flow, which implies that the new consideration has an important effect on traffic flow in lattice models.

For easy recognizable reasons, this subject is very important in theoretical studies and for applications, e. g. evaluation of capacity and traffic control on motorway. In this paper the different conceptions of reliability in technical and scientific literature are compared with the following definition: reliability of traffic stream, for a time interval T, is "the conditioned probability that level of speed spot process does not decrease during T as far as the section in which limit density is reached, given that the level at instant zero is equal to the average speed corresponding to the flow rate in condition of stable flow". Then, a criterion to calculate the motorway reliability is presented. The speed spot time-series are divided into sequences of events of random and homogeneous traffic processes. For every process one can calculate two parameters: flow rate and density; then, one can obtain the relationships between the parameters of spot speed processes and vehicular density. Using these relationships and a simulation procedure of spot speed process, one can obtain a formulation of the reliability of a traffic flow running along the offside lane of a motorway carriageway. Thus, through this formulation and the measurements of flow rate and speeds, one can evaluate the probability of instability on the carriageway under investigation. On the other hand, with an inverse procedure one can calculate the capacity of one lane in this way: putting close to 1 the reliability value and considering a 15 minutes time interval, the obtained flow rate represents capacity. In the paper, the procedure explained is used to provide, in real time, the approaching of the instability on the carriageway and to calculate the carriageway capacity for the A22 Brenner Motorway (Italy).

On the other side, the number of engaged workers on the toll gates is often constant over time. In spite of the fact that electronic toll collection is trendy, many countries still have manual toll collection systems on their highways. For manual toll collection system constant number of workers results in insufficient workers utilization in conditions of small traffic flow values, and appearance of long vehicle queues in front of toll gates during peak hours. In this paper, the model for dynamic control of the number of engaged workers is developed with the objective to determine optimal number of workers over time. Fuzzy logic and queuing theory represent the backbone for development of the model. System of toll gates is observed as a queuing system in which incoming vehicles represent clients and workers represent servers. The number of servers, i.e. the number of engaged workers is variable that is determined by using fuzzy logic and taking into account the queue length. The model is developed in Simulink and tested on many real numerical data. Data collected from toll gates in Bubanj Potok are used for development and evaluation of the model. The simulation results show that number of engaged workers must be coordinated with current traffic demands. In this way considerable decrease of engaged number of workers can be obtained, comparing to existing conditions on toll gates in Bubanj Potok. Consequently, this leads to the reduction of system costs. On the other side, level of service of the system is almost the same as in the case of engaging unnecessary number of workers.

First of all, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme is proposed in which the well known nonlinear cell transmission model (CTM) is used for the prediction. The model is then reformulated as a mixed logical dynamical (MLD) system, i.e. it is described by linear dynamic equations and linear inequalities in which both continuous and binary variables are present. In this way, the finite-horizon optimal control problem in the MPC scheme is transformed into a mixed integer quadratic programming problem whose objective function quadratically penalizes the deviation of the state variables from a specific equilibrium point. It is shown that the resulting control law stabilizes the system. Moreover, in order to make it more suitable for a real-time use, the foregoing control strategy is redesigned into an event-triggered control scheme. The idea is to update the control law only when the considered error exceeds a pre-specified threshold. Simulation results demonstrate how the use of the triggering rule allows to preserve the good performance of the proposed control scheme, while reducing the overall computational load.

The starting point is a multiscale method for pedestrian modeling, recently introduced in [1], in which measure-theoretic tools are used to manage the microscopic and the macroscopic scales under a unique framework. In the resulting coupled model the two scales coexist and share information, in the sense that the same system is simultaneously described from both a discrete (microscopic) and a continuous (macroscopic) perspective. This way it is possible to perform numerical simulations in which the single trajectories and the average density of the moving agents affect each other. Such a method is here revisited in order to deal with multi-population traffic flow on networks. For illustrative purposes, we focus on the simple case of the intersection of two roads. By exploiting one of the main features of the multiscale method, namely its dimension-independence, we treat one-dimensional roads and two-dimensional junctions in a natural way, without referring to classical network theory. Furthermore, thanks to the coupling between the microscopic and the macroscopic scales, we model the continuous flow of cars without losing the right amount of granularity, which characterizes the real physical system and triggers self-organization effects, such as, for example, the oscillatory patterns visible at jammed uncontrolled crossroads.

The article expands studies on routing games which traditionally model congestion with latency functions that increase with the flow on a particular link. This type of latency function cannot capture congestion effects on horizontal queues. Latencies on horizontal queues increase as a function of density, and flow can decrease with increasing latencies. This class of latency functions arises in transportation networks. For static analysis of horizontal queues on parallel-link networks, we show that there may exist multiple Nash equilibria with different total costs, which contrasts with results for increasing latency functions. We present a novel algorithm, quadratic in the number of links, for computing the Nash equilibrium that minimizes total cost (best Nash equilibrium). The relative inefficiencies of best Nash equilibria are evaluated through analysis of the price of stability, and analytical results are presented for two-link networks. Price of stability is shown to be sensitive to changes in demand when links are near capacity, and congestion mitigation strategies are discussed, motivated by our results.

Operational features of both peak and off peak were examined on a total 176 arterial segments from 23 different corridors within specific regions. These operational data, together with road segment characteristics, (e.g., segment length, number of lanes, median type), were used to construct models to estimate crash frequencies under various operational conditions for differing road segments. To account for the spatial correlations among the segments along the same corridors, Poisson-lognormal models with a two-level hierarchy under a Bayesian framework were used. Results showed significant relationships among operational conditions, roadway characteristics, and crash occurrence on these urban arterials. Lower average speeds at the corridor segment level were found to be associated with higher crash frequencies. The implications of using FCD data to assess operational conditions, and the use of hierarchical Bayesian models for predicting crash probabilities under different operational conditions are discussed.

Firstly, a traffic flow model to describe the freeway flow process is established. Then an on-ramp proportional plus integral plus differential (PID) controller regulated by RBF neural network is designed. RBF neural network identifies the Jacobian matrix of the control plant and then adjusts the parameters of PID controller dynamically in order to minimize the performance index defined in terms of the density tracking errors. Finally, the controller is simulated in MATLAB software. The results show that the controller designed has good dynamic and steady-state performance. It can achieve a desired traffic density along the mainline of a freeway and thus avoid traffic congestion. This approach is quite effective to freeway on-ramp metering.

We first identify the main causes of the capacity drop, namely high traffic demand and inadequate driver reaction. In the past, traffic and user behavior have been accurately described by cellular automata (CA) models. In this paper we extend the CA model to deal with highway traffic fluctuations and jams. Specifically, the model incorporates the communication layer between vehicles. The model thus enables us to study the impact of inter-vehicular communications and in particular the delivery of critical and timely upstream traffic information on driver reaction. Based on the newly-available traffic metrics, we propose an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) that suggests non-intuitive speed reduction in order to avoid the formation of so-called phantom jams. The results show that using such a system considerably increases the overall traffic flow, reduces travel time and avoids unnecessary slow-downs.

With vehicle positions being the most frequently exchanged information in vehicular networks, it becomes imperative to establish a strong level of trust in the announced positions before a vehicle initiates a response. This paper proposes a position verification scheme as part of a misbehavior detection framework that encompasses analysis techniques needed for the verification of exchanged vehicular messages. The scheme involves the estimation of a vehicle's trajectory via the integration of road and map information, as opposed to only depending on the vehicle's kinematics for future trajectory prediction. The trajectory estimation procedure uses the vehicle's previously received position updates to find a best-fit area within the road topology in which the vehicle is expected to be. The vehicle's current position announcement is compared against this plausible area to decide whether the position is consistent with the expected location. Our proposed scheme is verified via extensive simulations, developed on ns2, demonstrating the importance of integrating road and map information into position verification.

In order to balance the contradiction, traffic simulation which can maximum excavate existing road potential and provide scientific management schemes for enhancing the efficiency of road network becomes the important technical support of urban transportation. However, the ability of traffic simulation is highly constrained by the static traffic flow data. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of the traffic simulation platform for better traffic flow forecasting and management. Unlike traditional traffic simulation software, the traffic simulation platform can interactively deal with the real-time traffic flow data. In the paper, we analyze and study the architecture design, data processing module and functional module of the traffic simulation platform. At last, the paper gives a practical application for proving the feasibility of the implementation of the platform.

The public transportation vehicles can be categorized to two types: ones with determinate trajectories and schedules such as bus, tramway and light rail; the others with flexible and variable running paths, such as taxis. In this paper, we firstly present a driving path prediction method based destination gathering for taxis, which can make taxis' driving paths prescient in the initial stage of carrying passengers every time. Comparing with ordinary vehicles, public transportation vehicles have such features as long time running on roads, no privacy-protection need, and thus their trajectories can been opened. Through utilizing the features above, we propose a novel Public Transportation assisted Data Delivery scheme (PTDD) used to improve the performance of data delivery of Vehicular Delay Tolerant Networks (VDTNs). Simulation results based on a real map demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

The algorithm is deployed within the framework of a suite of software tools, named TOP1, which models traffic flow via a macroscopic model, calibrates the model based on available data and runs simulations to evaluate various operational strategies such as ramp metering, demand management, incident management, etc. TOP1 has been used to model various freeways in California, such as Interstate 80, Interstate 210, Interstate 880 and Interstate 680. Two main difficulties with data collection on California freeways were found to be missing ramp flow and faulty mainline data, which decrease the accuracy of the model and increase the time and effort invested in model calibration. The former of these difficulties has been previously addressed by an iterative learning algorithm that estimates the missing ramp flows and the latter is tackled by the method presented in this work.

We use the Link-Node Cell transmission model to describe the traffic state evolution in freeways, with on ramp demand profiles and off ramp split ratios (which are derived from flows) as inputs. The model based imputation algorithm estimates the missing flow profiles that match observed freeway mainline detector data. It is carried out in two steps: (1) adaptive iterative learning of an "effective demand" parameter, which is a function of ramp demands and off ramp flows/split ratios; (2) estimation of on ramp demands/off ramp split ratios from the effective demand profile using a linear program. This paper concentrates on the design and analysis of the adaptive iterative learning algorithm. The adaptive iterative learning algorithm is based on a multi-mode (piecewise non-linear) equivalent model of the Link-Node Cell transmission model. The parameter learning update procedure is decentralized, with different update equations depending on the local a-priori state estimate and demand estimate. We present a detailed convergence analysis of our approach and finally demonstrate some examples of its application.

We want to manage space sharing conflicts at the local level, when they appear, to allow a quick (real-time) regulation, i.e., without requiring to re-plan the routes of all involved agents. Our approach relies on reactive coordination between vehicles using simple interactions between neighboring agents, using perceptions and little or no communication. We consider in particular a scenario where two queues of vehicles share a single lane, describing the model of the network as well as the agents, and proposing simple coordination rules that only involve the two vehicles at the front of each queue. We then conduct experiments that allow the analysis and the comparison of the proposed self-regulation rules.

Fuzzy logic based ramp metering algorithms are considered to be an effective control measure to handle a complex nonlinear traffic system. In this paper, a genetic fuzzy approach is proposed to design a traffic-responsive ramp control algorithm for an isolated on-ramp. The problem is formulated as the inflow optimization of the on-ramp, based on the evaluation of motorway traffic condition. The inflow of the on-ramp is considered as the decision variable, where the ramp control problem will be treated as a nonlinear optimization problem of maximizing the evaluation function. In this paper, a well-known existent fuzzy logic control (FLC) ramp metering algorithm is implemented with an on-ramp congestion model in a stochastic microscopic traffic simulator, Aimsun. Genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to improve the performance of the fuzzy control system. The GA tunes the parameterized membership function of each fuzzy input to maintain the flow density of motorway below the estimated congestion density. The performances of the genetic fuzzy logic control (GFLC) ramp metering are compared with FLC ramp metering with respect to the percentage change of TTT (Total Travel Time). The simulation results show that the GFLC ramp metering provides significant improvement of TTT and better ability to maintain system flow density than the FLC ramp metering.	[Yu, X.

The coordinated ramp metering algorithms based on the continuum traffic model has been proposed in many recent publications, the simulation results of which have shown the better performance than other existing algorithms. This paper briefly reviews the background and development of the continuum traffic model and presents an IDP (Iterative Dynamic Programming) method for the optimization of a continuum traffic model (METANET) to achieve a coordinated ramp metering strategy.

Eddie; van Lint, Hans; Hoogendoorn, Serge			Estimation of Multiclass and Multilane Counts from Aggregate Loop Detector Data	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							TRAFFIC FLOW; SIMULATION	Lane utilization on the highway is affected subtly by dynamic traffic management systems such as speed controls and lane management. To optimize the operation of dynamic traffic management, a better understanding of lane utilization is required, in particular, of how the flows of different vehicle classes (e.g., passenger cars, lorries) vary across the carriageway. Most loop detector systems do not collect this multilane, multiclass count data. This study developed a procedure for estimating multilane, multiclass counts from a variety of standard aggregate loop data formats from around the world. The estimation procedure involved the inference of multilinear regression laws that relate multilane, multiclass data to standard aggregate formats. The regression laws were then trained with small samples of individual vehicle data on a site-by-site basis. Preliminary results showed that the estimation procedure worked rather well, even when the input data were minimal the extreme case being that of (U.S.-style) single-loop data, for which only flow and occupancy were available on a by lane basis. An error analysis indicated that small amounts of individual vehicle data were sufficient to train the estimator, provided they contained a representative mix of the flow behaviors at the site in question. Further work is required for the practical development of the tool, but it appears to have a wide range of potential uses for both researchers and practitioners.

Significant research has been dedicated to model and analyze the vulnerability of transportation systems, yet notably fewer studies propose specific strategies for deploying defensive technologies to safeguard these systems. The ultimate goal of situational awareness for prevention and rapid response remains largely unaddressed. Wireless sensors and ad hoc networks are widely regarded as a promising approach to monitor systems and enhance their security. Furthermore, the growth in smart phone usage can contribute additional relay nodes to the network connecting the deployed sensors and command center. Such sensor networks offer the potential to detect a terrorist plot before it can be executed, support effective response to emergency events, and dynamically monitor traffic flows to facilitate efficient travel within a city. This paper present a scheme which turn the deployment into a optimization to maximize the weighted coverage, and we demonstrate the approach through the simulation, the result of which clear indicates its effectiveness.

Relationship Between Freeway Flow Parameters and Safety and Its Implications for Hard Shoulder Running	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Decisions to run traffic on freeway shoulders during peak periods are motivated by the need to relieve congestion. Practicing traffic engineers generally believe that the decreased congestion resulting from running traffic on hard shoulders (i.e., hard shoulder running) is associated with some unspecified degree of improved safety, yet the majority of researchers agree that accident rates increase as the number of lanes increase, even if full shoulders are provided. Despite many years of modern road building, these conflicting views have not been reconciled. This paper first examines the relationship of traffic flow parameters, such as volume, density, and speed, to safety with calibrated performance functions of corridor-specific safety. On the basis of an understanding of this relationship, a possible explanation of the effect on safety of hard shoulder running is formulated. Empirical examination of the relationship of flow, density, and speed to the crash rate on selected freeways in Colorado suggests that as flow increases, the crash rate initially remains constant until a certain critical threshold combination of speed and density is reached. Once this threshold is exceeded, the crash rate rises rapidly. This rapid rise in crash rate may be caused by an increase in density without a notable reduction in speed and the resultant small headways that make it difficult or impossible for drivers to compensate for error. This model suggests that during hard shoulder running, crash rates decline because of the lower traffic volume or density per lane and that the safety benefits of a reduced volume or density per lane outweigh the adverse effects of the lack of provision of a full shoulder.

J	Deng, H; Zhang, HM				Deng, Hui; Zhang, H. Michael			Driver Anticipation in Car Following	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							TRAFFIC-FLOW; GAP ACCEPTANCE; MODEL; STABILITY	In normal driving conditions, drivers can usually anticipate with a good degree of accuracy the movements of vehicles ahead of them. Such anticipation can reduce the gaps between vehicles and produce high flows on freeway lanes. This anticipation effect is introduced in a car-following model in continuous space and discrete time, along with a set of driving rules that capture the car-following behavior of drivers. Detailed analysis shows that the model can simulate the full range of traffic conditions-free flow, congestion, and traffic jams under fixed and moving bottlenecks- and produce realistic flow capacities and fundamental diagrams with different levels of anticipation. Moreover, analysis ofjam formation and decay reveals the underlying relationship between the parameters of the model and the triangular fundamental diagram. The platoon effect can be captured in the model by gap anticipation level (alpha) dependent on the gap.	[Deng, Hui; Zhang, H.

Characteristics of Mixed Traffic on Urban Arterials with Significant Volumes of Motorized Two-Wheelers Role of Composition, Intraclass Variability, and Lack of Lane Discipline	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							MODEL	Mixed traffic in the cities of many developing countries is characterized by a lack of lane discipline, varying compositions of constituent vehicle types, and significant intraclass variability in static and dynamic characteristics. However, the influence of these factors on traffic flow parameters is not well understood. This study addressed the influence of lane discipline, intraclass variability, and composition on traffic flow characteristics under heterogeneous traffic conditions in Chennai, India. A microscopic traffic simulation model was calibrated and validated with field data from a four-lane divided urban arterial road in Chennai. The preliminary analysis indicated that factors such as composition, intraclass variability, and lane discipline had a statistically significant effect on stream speed. Speed flow and speed density relationships were developed on the basis of simulation results. These results showed a clear influence of lack of lane discipline, variability, and composition on stream speed. The influence varied depending on volume level and type of subject vehicle. The effect of composition on capacity was quantified. When two-wheelers had a predominant share, they enjoyed better performance in the absence of lane discipline. However, when cars and heavy vehicles had a significant presence, the impact of the lack of lane discipline was much smaller. The simulation model was applied to evaluate a range of traffic control measures based on vehicle type and lane. The results showed the promise of some measures based on vehicle class, namely, the exclusion of autorickshaws or autorickshaws and heavy vehicles. The findings have interesting implications for efficiency, user experience, and equity in mixed traffic.

J	Bujanda, A; Aldrete, R; Navarro, U				Bujanda, Arturo; Aldrete, Rafael; Navarro, Ulises			Estimating Transborder Trips Integrating Binational Communities as Single Transportation System Learning from Binational Model for El Paso, Texas-Ciudad Juarez, Mexico	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								This research presents the application of the TRANUS integrated land use and travel demand modeling software to estimate transborder origin-destination (O-D) pairs by developing a travel demand model (TDM) that integrates the two border communities in a binational conurbation into a single transportation and economic system. Commercial and personal ties generate a tremendous amount of transborder traffic within binational conurbations along the U.S.-Mexican border. With so much interaction, individual transportation networks from each country become a single transportation system connected through the ports of entry. Conventionally, each side of the border is modeled separately or through the use of external zones the area is not treated as a single, interconnected system. This research presents a methodology to estimate transborder O-D pairs and traffic flows with TRANUS. The case study of a binational TDM covering the El Paso, Texas-Ciudad Juarez, Mexico conurbation is presented. Results demonstrate encouraging findings from using TRANUS to estimate transborder O-D pairs for private trips. Furthermore, the methodology developed can be replicated in any conurbation along the U.S.-Mexican border with a relatively limited data collection effort. Although traditional TDMs require extensive and expensive household surveys, which are difficult to conduct in binational settings, this research shows that it is possible to generate a reasonably reliable set of binational O-D matrices at a significantly lower cost and time investment by using TRANUS.

J	Zheng, FF; van Zuylen, HJ; Pu, Y				Zheng, Fangfang; van Zuylen, Henk J.; Pu, Yun			Model for Predicting Distribution of Link Travel Times for Urban Signalized Roads	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							TRAFFIC-FLOW PREDICTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MULTIVARIATE	Estimation and prediction of urban travel time are acknowledged as important yet challenging topics. The traffic flow theory as developed especially for freeway traffic does not give much help for modeling urban traffic processes. Urban travel times are irregular because of several disturbances on a path. The interruption of trips at signalized intersections causes a large part of the total delay that vehicles experience on a route. These delays vary with stochastic properties of traffic flow, including stochastic arrivals and departures at signalized intersections. As a result, a wide distribution of delay (travel times) can be found for a certain traffic condition and traffic control scheme. This paper proposes a procedure for predicting the distributions of urban link travel times. The core of this procedure is the proposed model of distributions of link travel times that considers stochastic arrivals and departures at intersections and the traffic control scheme explicitly. A comparison of the distributions of link travel time predicted by the model with those derived from VISSIM simulation showed that travel time distributions can be predicted well under time-varying demand and different traffic conditions. A comparison with real-life data derived from Global Positioning System information indicates that distributions of link travel times predicted by the model can represent these real-life travel time distributions, though some discrepancies can be observed for certain links.

J	Chen, XH; Han, H; Lin, B				Chen, Xiaohong; Han, Hui; Lin, Bin			Developing Bicycle Equivalents for Mopeds in Shanghai, China	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							PASSENGER CAR EQUIVALENTS; ELECTRIC 2-WHEELERS; HEAVY VEHICLES; SIMULATION	The bicycle equivalent (BE) of the moped is a key nonmotorized traffic flow parameter when bicycles and mopeds share the same lanes. However, this parameter should not be considered a constant, because it may be affected by factors such as the mixed proportion of the nonmotorized traffic flow. This study estimated the effects of traffic flow characteristics and road design parameters on the BE. Basic traffic flow parameters (i.e., flow, density, and speed) were extracted from video data collected at three observation sites in Shanghai, China. A concept method was used to calculate the BE of mopeds in terms of their time space resource occupancy on traffic facilities. The free-flow speed characteristics of bicycles and mopeds were investigated, and relationships between speeds and densities in the mixed traffic flow were analyzed. The BEs were estimated for a range of characteristics related to traffic condition or road design (i.e., moped percentage, traffic flow density, width of nonmotorized traffic lanes, and nonmotorized traffic lane grades). The effects of these characteristics on the BE and the variation trends of the BE were observed, and reasons for these trends are discussed. The study findings provide valuable support for the measurement of nonmotorized traffic mixed with mopeds and bicycles in different traffic and road design conditions and could support future studies for capacity and level of service of dedicated nonmotorized lanes.

Unified Framework for Dynamic Traffic Assignment and Signal Control with Cell Transmission Model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							REAL-TIME; FORMULATION; NETWORKS; HIGHWAY; WAVES	This research presents a unified framework for dynamic traffic assignment and signal control optimization. An objective function based on the system-optimal approach with an embedded traffic flow model (the cell transmission model) for dynamic traffic assignment was considered. The optimization model (a mixed-integer program) explicitly considered intersection delay and lost time from phase switches in addition to a traditional travel time objective. Two test networks were used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model. Results showed better performance of the models when they were compared with fixed-signal timing plans. The formulation of signal control design also accounted for the variation of cycle length, and results showed the variation of cycle lengths with different objective functions under different levels of congestion.

For this problem three lines of investigations have been pursued in the literature: the first one is based on an assumption of a fixed charging station and charging time during the off-peak hours for EV charging demand; the second scenario has limited charging stations at typical locations instead of a mathematical model; and the third one is for charging demands in one way system, such as charging stations nearby highway exists. Hence, from the perspective of a distributed urban transportation system, EV charging demand still has unidentified quantity which varies with respect to charging station location and charging time. In this paper we presents mathematical models for EV charging demand at rapid charging stations. The rapid charging station is formulated as a M/M/s queuing service system. A traffic flow based model generates the arrival rate for EVs to arrive the charging station. The computational results demonstrate that the proposed model is able to estimate the dynamic spatio-temporal charging demands in the large-scale urban traffic environment.

The geometry physical model and design principles of the CFI are illustrated and the CFI is designed from following three aspects: traffic space, traffic organization and traffic control. Experiments taking the CI and corresponding the CFI as the reseach objects are carried on, and performance of the proposed the CFI is validated via VISSIM. Extensive simulation results under five traffic conditions have demonstrated the potential of the proposed the CFI for improvement of traffic efficiency, and the applicability of the CFI in China is discussed considering the characteristics of domestic urban intersections and it indicates that the CFI could be applied to domestic suburb roads.

This research aims to develop a traffic flow feature to improve the modeling of two-way arterials so that they are capable of modeling oversaturated conditions. Two improvements of the CTM are made to adequately study two-way arterials in oversaturated conditions. This enhanced model, proposed as the Conditional Cell Transmission Model (CCTM), is compared with Highway Capacity Software 2000 (HCS) in terms of travel speed. The consistency between the HCS 2000 and the CCTM show that the CCTM is a reliable model for simulating two-way traffic flow in oversaturated conditions.

The two traffic modes intervene with each other and result in transport bottlenecks frequently. Based on the above practical situation in the urban traffic, this paper develops the model of transport bottlenecks. This essay establishes the generalized travel cost models of these two traffic modes respectively. The essay analyses the balance point between public transport and individual traffic. It deduces and compares the change of traffic flow and travel cost of individual traffic and that of public transport under static and dynamic pricing policies. This paper deepens people's understanding of the issues on division of competitive system. Based on the analysis, the paper proposes that from the perspective of sustainable development the government should guide passengers to choose the appropriate traffic mode and adopt the policy of dynamic toll to promote the sustainable development in the area.

This examination is chiefly processed on the maximization of traffic flow, and the minimization of traffic accidents, congestions and pollution. In common, network representations of transport systems are understood to be fixed, but these representations do not permit an exact recreation of seriously packed urban road networks. For this rationale, traffic engineers happened to judge some substitute models such as simple object recognition and localization of road vehicles based on the position and orientation of vehicle image data. But the drawback of the approach is that if the shape of the vehicle and its pose varies in multiple junction coordination, the model based recognition is an inefficient one. To enhance the process of traffic flow mechanism, in this paper, we are going to implement a surveillance image object recognition and localization using improved local gradient model. At first, the vehicle images are taken by camera which is taken on the junction board of the traffic coordination. Based on location, position, angle and height of the camera to be fixed on the junction board, the vehicle images are obtained clearly in an aerial view and extracted the entire road for identifying the vehicle densities and postures using ray traced templates. An experimental evaluation is carried out to estimate the performance of the proposed vehicle object observation using position based local gradient model in terms of vehicle density, acquired image clarity, pose recovery and compared with an existing model based on simple object recognition and localization.

To avoid traffic congestion on motorways, a lane-specific localization of vehicles is required to allow for the detection of short-term deviations of traffic flows due to roadwork or accidents. In this paper, we investigate the accuracy of GNSS-based positioning data with consideration of all relevant impairments of the propagation channel, like molecular scattering, ionospheric scintillation and effects caused by the direct receiver surrounding. Taking into account satellite mobility and constellations, position-specific atmospheric influences and the impacts of shadowing and multipath propagation on the determination of TOA values, the accuracy of a lane-specific positioning is investigated for both GPS and GALILEO. The results presented in this paper are based on a dedicated multiscale simulation framework which includes an exact 3D model of the environment of the GNSS receiver. Based on the investigation of a reference scenario, the results demonstrate the feasibility of lane-specific localization enabled by the compensation of both ionospheric as well as multipath fading effects.

Successive RSSI intensity determinations and the corresponding time values were used to estimate the vehicle flux in various conditions. A hierarchical network model, including a simulation module and experimental data, was implemented. In order to estimate the current traffic state, a new strategy in which a special attention was given to information collected from the converging streets near the main crossroads was elaborated. The updated information was used by a road traffic simulator in order to improve the traffic flow. The proposed solution could contribute to the improvement of the performances obtained using other existing traffic control and monitoring systems.

In the model, the motion of a vehicle is affected by the information of the preceding vehicles' movements. Moreover, the mechanism of the information effect is considered, which depends on the communication topology of vehicles. The theoretical analysis shows that our model could keep the traffic flow stable under some conditions. The corresponding numerical simulations confirm the correctness of the theoretical analysis. Compared with previous works on CM model, our model is more reasonable and effective in suppressing the formation of traffic congestion.

The first analysis consists of the discovery of possible routes in a state space generated from an IOPT Petri net model given the initial marking as the vehicle position. The second analysis receives the routes found in the first analysis and calculates the state equations at incidence matrix created from the High Level Petri net model to define the fastest route for each vehicle that arrive in the roads. It was considered the exchange of information between vehicle and infrastructure (V2I) to get the position and speed of all vehicles and support the analyses. With the results obtained we conclude that is possible optimizing the urban traffic flow if this tool is applied to all vehicles in a bounded urban traffic.

In order to correctly identify the state of traffic flow, the traffic speed must be obtained accurately. In Shanghai, most of the industrial loop detectors (ILDs) are installed in a single loop way. These ILDs can only detect the parameters of flow, saturation, etc., but the speed can not be detected. If the relationship between the traffic flow and speed can be mined accurately, we can obtain the speed using the flow data directly. The purpose of this study is to use multiple kernel support vector regression (MKL-SVR) algorithm to model the relationship between the traffic speed and flow, then estimate the speed accurately. Extensive experiments have been performed to evaluate the performances of the four algorithms: polynomial fitting algorithm, BP neural networks, SVR and MKL-SVR. The experimental results show that MKL-SVR has the best and most robust performances.

On the contrary, the route algorithms will not meet user request if they merely focus on the traffic load balance. So it is important to take user satisfaction and traffic load into consideration at the same time. Although a few works focus on this combination, they ignore the difference between the user requests. We propose a traffic dispersion routing algorithm on VANET naming BPR-US which is based on backpressure theory. It tries to satisfy the user demand and also separates the traffic flow. At last, we make simulation experiments to compare BPR-US algorithm and other route guidance algorithms, proving that BPR-US algorithm can have a better effect on both user satisfaction and traffic load.

AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT TO ACHIEVE TRAJECTORY BASED OPERATIONS	2012 IEEE/AIAA 31ST DIGITAL AVIONICS SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (DASC)	IEEE-AIAA Digital Avionics Systems Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE/AIAA 31st Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC)	OCT 14-18, 2012	Williamsburg, VA	IEEE, AIAA, Avionics, AESS, DATC, Boeing				An overarching goal of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) and the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) is to improve predictability of the air traffic system as a whole in order to increase capacity and efficiency while maintaining safety and incorporating user preferences. The achievement of these goals requires tight integration of new technologies and adjustments to operational procedures as envisioned in Trajectory Based Operations. This paper presents a concept that directly integrates the trajectory generated by the aircraft's Flight Management System with air traffic management operations. The concept is an application of the principles of self-organization (swarm theory) where safety and traffic flow management goals are achieved by broadcasting all the operational constraints on a 4D-Grid and populating the grid with the 4D-trajectories of all other flights. As new flights get added to the system the remaining capacity is in full view to prospective operators who will be able to plan flights using available capacity. The paper shows how self-organized air traffic leads to optimality, provides details of the concept, describes near term implementation strategies and explores long term implications.

This paper presents a graph-based algorithmic method for defining nominal terminal routing from historical flight tracks. First historical traffic is used to generate a directed graph. Then Djikstra's shortest path algorithm is used to identify the shortest yet most commonly used paths through the graph. There were many different nominal routes between different engine types due to the distinct differences in engine performance characteristics. A comparison of graph-based shortest path routes to two other methods (manual and k-means) showed how the method could rapidly produce similar distinct dominant terminal area flows. Finding shortest paths from all links of a sufficient weight, rather than just source nodes, identified more route options depicting standard path control techniques in addition to the dominant route. This method may be used to rapidly prototype route models to assess trajectory-based terminal area concepts.

This paper adopts a multi-objective optimization model to solve the ATFNR problem to make a tradeoff between the total delay costs and the airlines fairness. Meanwhile, a specially-designed algorithm based on multi-objective comprehensive learning particle swarm optimizer (MOCLPSO) under the cooperative co-evolution framework is presented to handle this large scale, multi-objective real-world optimization problem.

Relative to the highway outside the tunnel, tunnel inside belongs to semi-closed environment and the drive condition is relatively poor, it makes tunnel become velocity bottleneck. Because of uncirculated air in tunnel and all kinds of deleterious gas let by vehicle, it is easy to result into traffic jam and secondary disaster. Large-long tunnel system is a complicated system integrated with many-sided theory and technology, such as traffic, detection and environment, and so on. The traffic flow in tunnel has unrepeatable characteristic. By building traffic flow model, fire disaster and environment model in the paper, the fire-fighting response mechanism, the action process and the realization technology in the condition of fire disaster are researched in emphases. It provided use for reference for the engineering building of Large-Long tunnel, the layout and design of fire-fighting establishment inside tunnel and the running management mechanism of tunnel.

Firstly, the second-order traffic flow model to describe freeway flow process is established. Then the principle of CMAC-PID composition control is formulated, and the learning algorithm is given in detail. Based on the model and in conjunction with feedback control theory, CMAC-PID based traffic density controller is designed. Finally, the controller is simulated in MATLAB software. The results show that this controller designed has fast response, good dynamic and steady-state performance. It can achieve a desired traffic density along the freeway mainline.

To discriminate real-time traffic status on road sections, the concept of critical density is brought in and the risk of four ranks corresponding to the critical speed are anti-calculated in free driving state and car-following state. By comparing critical speed with the average speed on road section, separate vehicle risk is converted into real-time risk of group vehicles, and real-time risk assessment model of highway traffic in rain and fog weather is established. Simulation results show that the low-density traffic flow will bring lager risk than high-density traffic flow in rain and fog etc disastrous weather; To reduce traffic risk of road section, effective measures are speed limit in low-density flow, speed limit in combination with shunt in high-density flow.

As a result of the increasing energy consumption, the grid infrastructure has to be developed further, and moreover, it is necessary to analyze the network effects of the electric vehicle charging. In this paper, the challenge is approached by an actual case area in Finland and simulated EV traffic. The data used in the simulation are collected by measuring the traffic flow on the road leading to the case area. The objective of the paper is to demonstrate how the grid effects of large-scale electrification of transportation can be addressed, and what data are required to assess the additional charging load in a feasible manner. The data are processed by applying the Monte-Carlo method, and also a sensitivity analysis is performed.

Because the simulation used the distribution of time gap settings that drivers from the general public used in a real field experiment, this study was the first on the effects of ACC and CACC on traffic to be based on real data on driver usage of these types of controls. The results showed that the use of ACC was unlikely to change lane capacity significantly. However, CACC was able to increase capacity greatly after its market penetration reached moderate to high percentages. The capacity increase could be accelerated by equipping non-ACC vehicles with vehicle awareness devices so that they could serve as the lead vehicles for CACC vehicles.

The variable message sign (VMS) is used to realize traffic flow guidance. More attention is paid to the decision-making behaviors of the driver, i.e., choosing the target off-ramp and its influence on road capacity. The original model without VMS and the improved model with VMS are proposed respectively. Through numerical simulation, the corresponding phase diagram, the capacity, the flux of each section and typical patterns are obtained, then the effects of the injection probabilities, the fraction of leaving vehicles and the length of the exit lane on capacity are analyzed in detail. When the length of the exit lane is rather short but the entering probability and the fraction of leaving vehicles are rather large, the road capacity is increased noticeably with the help of VMS and therefore the state of traffic flow is improved. It is shown that the utilization efficiency of downstream off-ramp is enhanced and traffic jams are alleviated due to the guidance of VMS.

The effects are discussed about how the different speed limit values, the lengths of speed limit section, and the different traffic states affect the traffic flow and the traffic volume via the simulation experiment of dynamic speed control. The effectual condition of speed limit is analyzed. The results of the examples show that speed limit can be used solely under some traffic states as an assistant traffic management strategy.

J	Ossenbruggen, PJ; Laflamme, EM; Linder, E				Ossenbruggen, Paul J.; Laflamme, Eric M.; Linder, Ernst			Congestion Probability and Traffic Volatility	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							TIME-SERIES; FLOW PREDICTION; FREEWAY; MODEL; IDENTIFICATION; PATTERNS; FEATURES	The primary purpose of this study is to understand better the roadway performance and the conditions that trigger congestion. Incidents of recurrent congestion were encountered at a location on New Hampshire Interstate 93 northbound, where radar measurements of speed were continuously recorded from April through November 2010. The root cause for the onset of congestion, both recurrent and nonrecurrent, is impossible to discern and explain by using exploratory data analyses alone; the data are too noisy. A time series modeling approach suggests that the magnitude of traffic flow and volatility, measured as the second (variance) and third (skewness) moments of flow residuals, can explain the triggering of congestion events for a highly variable environment that changes time by the time and day. The approach includes two types of mathematical models: generalized additive binomial probability models for roadway congestion that use functions of traffic flow and volatility as explanatory variables and functional data models that decompose and smooth traffic data to add insight to the roles that flow and volatility play in the congestion process. Most notably, the probability of congestion is shown to be a function of the short-term history of flow and volatility. The changes in these values-the first derivatives of flow and second and third moments of flow residuals derived from functional data model-are shown as well. Model selection, parameter estimation, and checking are presented.

J	Alvarez, P; Hadi, M				Alvarez, Patricio; Hadi, Mohammed			Time-Variant Travel Time Distributions and Reliability Metrics and Their Utility in Reliability Assessments	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Several metrics of reliability have been recommended for use. These metrics may need to be calculated at relatively fine levels of aggregation of travel time data when used for advanced management strategies and transportation system modeling and analysis. This study investigates the variation of travel time distributions by time of day at fine temporal aggregation levels, the sensitivity of various reliability metrics to these variations, the effect of the aggregation level choices on the calculated metrics, and the amount of data required to estimate stable values of the reliability metrics. The investigation is made for a facility that has general purpose lanes and high-occupancy-toll lanes. The results show that the parameters of travel time distributions vary during the peak period, reflecting the effects of traffic congestion, traffic flow dynamics, and how much nonrecurrent factors, such as incidents, contribute to the unreliability of travel time on the investigated facility. Trends of variations are observed when reliability metrics are used to assess reliability as the congestion level changes during the peak period. The results also show that examining combinations of time-variant static distribution parameters and reliability metrics of the general purpose and high-occupancy-toll lanes can provide valuable information that cannot be obtained when the analysis is performed at higher aggregation levels. The study results suggest using at least one year of data to obtain stable values of reliability metrics.

The system is planned to be implemented on 700MHz band in Japan, and 5.9GHz band in Europe and America. Some applications require the communication in Non-line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions. However, the feasibility study of the communication performance in NLOS conditions is still an open issue, especially in the urban environment with the traffic flow. In this paper, we explain the differences of radio specifications among EU, USA and Japan based on the ITS standardization work carried out in each region respectively to clear the implementation method for VSC. Then we show the VSC performance results in NLOS conditions through the computer simulation, which duplicates the urban road traffic environment in Tokyo. We compare the simulation results between 5.9GHz and 700MHz bands, and conclude there are some improvements needed for 5.9GHz band to realize the NLOS VSC in the urban environment.

The capability of traffic simulation to emulate the time variability of traffic events makes it a matchless facility for capturing the complexity of traffic systems. There are many researches which implement fuzzy but to specific traffic problems and there are many traffic simulation applications but with no support for fuzzy logic. This paper presents a simulation environment, designed for testing and evaluation of any fuzzy logic based traffic management system. The user could simulate any traffic isolated intersection or intersection network with multiple lanes. He could also specify input parameters, build fuzzy rules that control the traffic flow and simulate the model to monitor the efficiency of model by noticing the output parameters. A graphical user interface allows visualization of the simulation, including animation of vehicle movements.

Because the traditional model is too complex, it is difficult to provide real-time travel time. A kind of dynamic traffic network analysis model to calculate real-time is given in this paper. The travel time for reference can be computed. Firstly, in the model LWR is used to construct the continuity equation of initial value - boundary condition, then high order Runge-Kutta method is used to calculate of flow, density and speed on the section, for the further travel time required by the vehicle's distance is computed, the total travel time can be obtained by the sum each travel time. Finally, the proposed dynamic traffic network model were simulated for a small network of freeway traffic flows. Simulation results show that the model developed in this paper can accelerate solve the travel time of dynamic network traffic flow.

The considered strategies are bus lanes with intermittent priorities (BLIPs). These strategies consist in intermittently opening the bus lane to general traffic when not in use by a bus. Even if benefits of such strategies have been pointed out in the literature, the activation process has received little attention. Chiabaut et al. (2012) has firstly proposed an analytical approach for BLIPs activation. However, the analytical (extended) kinematic wave model uses a rough description of lane-changing maneuvers. This paper tries to overcome this limitation through a refined approach using the simulation package SymuVia. The simulated results show a good agreement with analytical results. For comparable case, simulation enables more sophisticated case to be investigated. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to identify the parameters that have the most influence on BLIPs activation efficiency. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Real-time traffic control by use of green-red traffic signals at the motorway mainstream is proposed in order to achieve safer merging of vehicles entering the work zone and, at the same time, maximize throughput and reduce travel delays. A particular issue addressed in this research is the investigation of the appropriate distance between the merge area and the traffic lights so as to lead, in combination with the employed real-time traffic control strategy, to the most efficient merging of vehicles. The control strategy applied for real-time signal operation is an ALINEA-like PI-type feedback regulator. In order to achieve maximum performance of the control strategy, some calibration of the regulator's parameters may be necessary. The calibration is first conducted manually, via a typical trial-and-error procedure. In an additional investigation, the recently proposed learning/adaptive algorithm AFT is employed in order to automatically fme-tune the regulator parameters. Experiments conducted with a microscopic simulator for a hypothetical work zone infrastructure, demonstrate the potential high benefits of the control scheme. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the continuous advances in the field of traffic control under saturated conditions, novel and promising developments of simple concepts in this area remains a significant objective, because some proposed approaches that are based on various meta-heuristic optimization algorithms can hardly be used in a real-time environment. To address this problem, the recently developed notion of network fundamental diagram for urban networks is exploited to improve mobility in saturated traffic conditions via application of gating measures, based on an appropriate feedback control structure. As a case study, the proposed methodology is applied to the urban network of Chania, Greece, using microscopic simulation. The results show that the total delay in the network decreases significantly and the mean speed increases accordingly. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Indeed, large deployments of intelligent transport systems and more specifically cooperative systems would provide a dynamic and local-based information network, as equipped vehicles are able to disseminate, receive and forward information with the infrastructure and others vehicles thanks to the C2X framework. This appears to be a promising step forward towards more efficient, safe and environmentally oriented traffic management strategies. Methodological challenges arise when dealing with these new communication features. In this paper, we report a research effort dealing with the integration of these new capabilities into traffic models to design cooperative traffic management strategies and demonstrate their benefit on a simple road section. For that, we consider a distributed approach where vehicles can communicate with each other in a given radio interaction range. A linear stability analysis is performed for a given class of car following models. This shows that a distributed cooperative framework can improve traffic flow stability, which is a key to determine whether traffic is likely to enter in congestion or not. The interest of a distributed approach is highlighted and discussed by comparison with a centralized one, which brings up others ways of controlling the traffic flow.

Moreover, the models are often developed by different groups for different contexts, requirements, etc. In this paper we present a prototype of a software framework which allows the user to develop an integrated simulation of a transportation system and also to link additional models to the new simulation in a standardized way. We use an agent-based approach as the basis of such a model. Integrated transportation system models allow model users to overcome the limitations of traditional aggregated, independent transportation models, particularly with respect to sensitivity to behavioral aspects of the travelers. Another requirement, which the software is to satisfy, is the interoperability of models developed in the new framework with legacy models. By interoperability we mean, that any component of the of the model can be interchanged by a legacy software and be used for the integrated simulation. This would allow disparate research groups working on modeling different aspects of a transportation model to plugnplay their models into the framework and test those as a part of an integrated model of an entire system, providing a benefit to researchers, modelers and institutional users of such models.

Traditional approaches attempt to optimize traffic signal control for a particular vehicle density; the main disadvantage lies in the fact that traffic changes constantly. Managing traffic congestion seems to be a problem of adaptation rather than of optimization. In this work we present an agent-based traffic simulator which represents a traffic grid with two-way roads of three exclusive lanes per direction, with intersections regulated by signals. We study the repercussions on traffic flow of simple parametric behaviours when each light operates independently. A dominance analysis is applied to compare the strategies.

This model is related to the headway of cars and the velocity difference as well as the variation of the sensitivity. A small parameter is added to the original sensitivity. Based on the stability theory of Hurwiz, the allowable variation range of this parameter, especially in the case of different velocities, is obtained. It can be concluded that the model with the term of velocity difference can increase the stability of traffic flow. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The traffic impact analysis of left-turning traffic flows and the advantages of left-turning traffic forbiddance measure is analyzed in paper, then the implementation flows is summarized. The implementation condition and method are determined, and the average delay of intersections in the whole region are chosen as the evaluation index of operation efficiency of the left-turning traffic forbiddance measure. So the calculation method of efficiency between pre and post adopted the left-turning traffic forbiddance measure is proposed. The intersections of business district in City Hengyang is chosen as example for verifying the implementation method of left-turning traffic forbiddance, and the efficiency between pre and post adopted the left-turning traffic forbiddance measure is comparatively analyzed and the VISSIM simulation software is applied for verifying the effect of the left-turning traffic forbiddance measure.

Under the open boundary condition, the influences of the injection probability, disappearance probability and visibility are discussed. The simulation results show that the injection probability and disappearance probability within a certain range have an important effect on the flux, density and velocity. And traffic jams often occur in poor visibility areas, which can become a road bottleneck. Furthermore, in order to effectively decrease the occurrence of traffic jams, the injection probability and disappearance probability should be set up reasonably.

By using a real intersection's geometry and traffic flow data, this paper has also set up the phase time with the above models, studied the results and evaluated these models According to the rapid grouth of traffic in our country, there are more and more traffic problems. The intersection signal time setting are developed from rough to fine. The optimization theory of intersection signal time setting was founded in 1960s. At the very beginning, Webster F, Cobber B-[1] proposed the optimization method to set the intersection signal time. Depending on Webster's theory, Allsop R B-[2,B- 3] proposed the optimization methed signal time setting to deal with different traffic needs, which called SIGSET and SIGCAP. SIGSET is aimed at make Webster's delay calculation formula more complete, fitted road with not so much traffic. SIGCAP, aimed at capacity maxmum, is used at where the traffic flow is over saturation. The entrance road delay model of American HCM[4] is composed by 3 parts. The first part is standard delay, the second part is caused by vehicle's random arriving or over saturation, and the last part is caused by the vehicle queue at the beginning. The main influence factors of these models are traffic flow, signal cycle length, effective green time, saturation rate and intersection capacity. Jiao M D, Ma L & Fan B Q, Sheng F, Yang X G, Wang Q P, Tan X L & Zhang S X, who aimed at minimizing the intersection vehicle's average delay and average number of vehicle stopping and Constrainted by the phase effective green time, saturation rate and cycle length, have solved the models by taking the Artificial Ants algorithm, Hereditary algorithm and Simulated Annealing algorithm([5, 6]).

Then the link travel status can be estimated using these large sample dada. In this paper, an evaluation and analysis method for FCD system in Ningbo was introduced. Firstly, a mathematical statistical method is used to compute the minimum probe vehicles number on one segmental road. Then, the original GPS data was analyzed on several aspects, including PV-GPS data coverage and average probe vehicle number of covered links. Based on the minimum probe vehicles number, we can evaluate overall quality of FCD system and improve it accordingly. Finally, the obtained traffic state information was validated with test drives of independent vehicles driving on a long loop route with many intersections. A valuable conclusion is obtained, and would be a valuable basis for developing FCD system in the further work.

J	Xu, TD; Hao, Y; Peng, ZR; Sun, LJ				Xu, Tiandong; Hao, Yuan; Peng, Zhongren; Sun, Lijun			Automatic Calibration of Behavioral Parameters for Variable Message Sign-Based Route Guidance Consistent with Driver Behavior	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							DIVERSION BEHAVIOR; TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT; INFORMATION; SYSTEM; OPERATIONS; MODEL	Variable message signs (VMSs) can be used to divert traffic to less congested areas of road networks and to enhance network performance. Central to these goals are increasing the acceptability of the suggested guidance and improving the credibility of VMS information among drivers. This study develops a new model for quantifying the effect of VMS messages on drivers' en route diversion behavior for real-time VMS-based route guidance that is consistent with driver behavior. The model incorporates attributes that can be obtained online, including traffic information, traffic flow, weather, and incident duration. The parameters, observation noise, and system noise characterizing this model are calibrated dynamically according to real-time detected traffic data and adaptive Kalman filtering theory. In the calibration, the consistency between time-dependent actual and predicted traffic states is verified. The results indicate that the calibration model enhances the accuracy of traffic state prediction and thereby increases the effectiveness of the proposed route guidance. The model is also suitable for application to real-world situations because it can more accurately estimate and predict the likely route choices of drivers using aggregate-level traffic data. Such data can be used to track the evolutionary process of en route diversion behavior, as well as design meaningful route guidance control goals and strategies for traffic decision makers.

J	Hassan, Y; Sarhan, M; Salehi, M				Hassan, Yasser; Sarhan, Mohamed; Salehi, Mohsen			Probabilistic Model for Design of Freeway Acceleration Speed-Change Lanes	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR; SECTIONS	A speed-change lane (SCL) is an auxiliary lane added to the traveled way for the acceleration and deceleration of vehicles entering or leaving a roadway. When the length of an acceleration SCL is adequate, drivers are able to accelerate comfortably from the speed at entrance to a speed appropriate to the road, find a gap in the traffic flow, and merge in a safe and secure manner. The length of an SCL is currently determined in terms of the ramp design speed, the freeway design speed, and the acceleration rate. Embedded in these values are assumptions for the operating speed at the entrance and merging points. This study examined a probabilistic approach instead of such a deterministic approach. The main benefit of a probabilistic approach is that traffic flow characteristics are assumed to be stochastic; therefore, the outcome of a probabilistic methodology is a distribution of drivers' acceleration distance on the SCL. The reliability-based analysis enables designers to select a specific percentile value of this distribution as a design length that better matches a certain situation and avoids unnecessary extra construction costs. This paper presents analytical and simulation models for the application of the reliability approach, with all parameters based on recently collected field data.

They are also useful guidance for the deployment of ITS/VANET. Many macroscopic traffic flow models have been proposed in the past few decades on the basis of empirical data collected in the US, Canada, Turkey and etc. However these models may not be accurate for traffic flows in cities in China due to the differences in population, transportation infrastructure, and driving culture. In this paper, we collected a large amount of empirical traffic flow data in Shanghai overhead road during three different time periods. Statistical results showed that the lane-level traffic volumes in Shanghai followed Gaussian distribution rather than Poisson distribution which was normally assumed in literature. Regarding lane-level vehicles' velocities, they matched well with Gaussian distribution. The empirical probability mass functions (PMF) for both the traffic volumes and vehicles' velocities were presented. In addition, how these models would impact performance analysis in VANETs was discussed.

Specifically, as rural traffic volumes rise in Texas, the pressure on the state's network of two-lane highways rises accordingly. Previous research in Texas demonstrated that periodic passing lanes can improve operations on two-lane highways with average daily traffic lower than 5,000 vehicles. These highways, called Super 2 highways, can provide many of the benefits of a four-lane alignment at a lower cost. A recent project expanded on that research to develop design guidelines for passing lanes on two-lane highways with higher volumes. Researchers investigated the effects of volume, terrain, and heavy vehicles on traffic flow and safety. This paper discusses findings from field observations and crash analysis of existing Super 2 highway corridors in Texas and computer modeling of traffic conditions on a simulated Super 2 corridor. Results indicate that passing lanes provide added benefit at higher traffic volumes by reducing crashes, delay, and percent time spent following. Empirical Bayes analysis of crash data reveals a 35% reduction in expected nonintersection crashes with injuries. Simulation results indicate that most passing activity takes place within the first mile of the passing lane, so additional passing lanes can offer greater benefit than longer passing lanes. Whether new passing lanes are added or existing lanes are lengthened, the incremental benefit diminishes as additional length is provided and the highway more closely resembles a four-lane alignment.

The vehicular density determines the radio connectivity in sparse traffic, and may even contribute to radio interference in dense traffic situations. We propose modeling the vehicular density using an approach from physics and engineering known as traffic flow theory. It builds models of the interactions between vehicles and road infrastructure similar to fluid or gas flows in pipelines. We have developed analytic solutions for estimating vehicular densities based on a method for solving the traffic flow equations. With very general infrastructure conditions we can find the density evolution at any location and time for any (given) initial conditions. Using such an approach we show how the connectivity, reachability and broadcast capacities of V2V networks can be calculated as applications of this approach. Furthermore we can include the path loss between vehicles and include interference from dense traffic situations in line and non-line of sight situations. We parameterize the method using Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11a radio technologies to show the applicability of such an approach.

Optimization of neural network configurations for short-term traffic flow forecasting using orthogonal design	2012 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION (CEC)	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)	JUN 10-15, 2012	Brisbane, AUSTRALIA	IEEE		neural networks; short-term traffic flow forecasting; sensor data; orthogonal design	PREDICTION	Neural networks have been applied for short-term traffic flow forecasting with reasonable accuracy. Past traffic flow data, which has been captured by on-road sensors, is used as the inputs of neural networks. The size of this data significantly affects the performance of short-term traffic flow forecasting, as too many inputs result in over-specification of neural networks and too few inputs result in under-learning of neural networks. However, the amount of past traffic flow data input, is usually determined by the trial and error method. In this paper, an experimental design method, namely orthogonal design, is used to determine appropriate amount of past traffic flow data for neural networks for short-term traffic flow forecasting. The effectiveness of the orthogonal design is demonstrated by developing neural networks for short-term traffic flow forecasting based on past traffic flow data captured by on-road sensors located on a freeway in Western Australia.

These methods can be classified into two those are trajectory based and traffic flow model based. Considering the latter class, an approach to reconstruct travel times is to employ models commonly used in dynamic traffic assignment, where the travel time on a link is a treated as a function of the number of vehicles on the link. In the presented research, we concentrate on the reconstruction performance of two traffic flow models on freeway link/path travel times. A link performance function based macroscopic traffic flow model is employed and compared with a microscopic traffic flow model. Performances of selected methods are evaluated with the actual measurements on travel time. Actual travel times have been collected on weekdays by using a global positioning system (GPS) module equipped probe vehicle. Following reconstruction of link/path travel times employing macroscopic and microscopic models, an evaluation on the distribution of model calculations with the corresponding to GPS measurements presented.

Recent studies show that traffic flow-speed profiles and vehicular emissions are related. The increase of congestion leads to in an increase of pollutant emissions and, moreover, emissions are sensitive to different drivers behavior. In this context, it is possible to reduce vehicle pollutants emissions, decreasing congestion with traffic planning policies and on-line operations. The aim of the paper is to obtain reliable values of pollutant emissions in a wide urban network, taking into account the within-day variations of traffic conditions and parameters related to the different state of vehicles (congested and uncongested conditions such as the queue length, the average speed of vehicles in the queue, the length of the link travelled at free-flow speed and so on). The developed within-day dynamic emission model has been applied to the city of Brindisi (Italy) and the estimated emissions have been compared with the results of standard macroscopic approach in order to quantify the differences. Finally an analytical model to compute emissions at signalized intersections is presented. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It has become appropriate to develop high-level simulation tools for policy makers so that they can analyze the potential consequences of their choices. In this paper, we propose a decision-maker simulator intended to define and tune urban transportation policy (travel, parking and transportation strategies). In terms of system architecture, we adopted a "system of systems" approach, mainly structured in layers, in order to model the main elements of the system. We represent explicitly, for example, a layer of roads, lights, parking, means of transport, etc. Our system uses an agent-based simulation incorporating spatial and temporal information. It must support the regulatory scenarios to simulate the effect of regulatory strategies on transportation systems. The paradigm of multi-agent systems is well suited for simulating the behavior of the components of an urban transportation system. Existing applications address problems of individual behavior management, management of traffic flows, management of temporal and geographical aspects, multi-modality transport, etc. However, they don't address organizational aspects of transportation systems that incorporate the adaptability of users' behavior. In addition, we implemented the mechanism of "traces"; the trace files contain the result of simulation. Travel surveys, census and traffic measurements were used. Analysis of available data and traces were used to evaluate the suitability of our simulations according to different regulatory strategies. Finally, we implemented a prototype for the movement of people in the city of La Rochelle from statistical data of INSEE (the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) and the BD TOPO 2 of the IGN (the French National Geographical Institute) using the GAMA platform.

The general aim of the approach is to develop a framework using similar tools to the variational principle in traffic theory to model intersections taking in account many incoming and outgoing roads. Then a time-explicit numerical scheme is proposed. It is based on the very classical Godunov scheme. The proposed model could be characterized as a pointwise model of intersection without any internal state. Moreover, our model respects the invariance principle. This scheme is applied to the cases of diverge junctions. The goal is to know how to manage the fluxes in order to maximize the flow through the junction. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This model assumes that drivers evaluate the utility of available lanes, and that each driver chooses the lane with highest utility. The utility of a lane increases with the speed of traffic, and is stochastic with Gumbel random component. Since the speed of traffic on a lane, and hence the attractively of a lane, decreases with the number of cars using the lane, a (dynamic) equilibrium forms. This equilibrium results in the lane choice of drivers and the assignment of traffic between lanes. Formally it is a Logit model. The traffic flow is assumed multi-class, and FIFO on each lane, but not all lanes are available to all driver classes. The paper will address the homogeneous case, far from on-and off-ramps or intersections, where all lanes are accessible to all users. It will be shown that in the homogeneous case the total density follows a LWR model even though all lane speeds are different. The model can be expressed as a system of conservation laws with a smooth flux function, but analytical solutions are generally not available with very few exceptions. Thus numerical methods are required in order to use the model for applications. The paper will explore numerical methods in the case of a regular section. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Estimating traffic flow profiles according to a relative attractiveness factor	PROCEEDINGS OF EWGT 2012 - 15TH MEETING OF THE EURO WORKING GROUP ON TRANSPORTATION	Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	15th Meeting of the Euro-Working-Group-on-Transportation (EWGT)	SEP, 2012	Cite Descartes, Paris, FRANCE	Euro Working Grp Transporatat (EWGT)	Cite Descartes	Traffic flow estimates; clustering algorithms; attractiveness factor		Traffic flow estimates play a key role for strategic and operational planning of transport networks. Although the amplitude and peak times in flows change from location to location, some consistent patterns emerge across a region. Clustering solutions appear as a powerful tool to reveal hidden trends that can easily be applied on historical traffic data to estimate traffic flows. However, these historical data traditionally are collected by detectors on only a limited number of road sections. This communication presents a methodology for estimating traffic flows using road features as clustering variables, so that it can be applied to any road section. In particular, a factor related to the attractiveness of road sections, in terms of characteristics of nearby areas, will be used to cluster road sections, deriving typical flow profiles of the resulting groups. To obtain these typical profiles, data collected by permanent detectors on a broad geographic distribution of sites across the Spanish road network have been studied. Then the flow prediction procedure for a given location is based on obtaining its attractiveness factor, finding its best match, and associating the typical flow pattern of such a group (weighted by a correction factor) to the location. The results show that the methodology make good use of historical data and, in most cases, the times of the main peaks are approximately determined. Although the prediction accuracy in the amplitude of the curves varies somewhat from location to location, the accuracy is acceptable for roads classified into groups with better similarity measurements. The applicability of the procedure to any road location makes this alternative attractive for practical applications when no detector data is available, besides no previous traffic information at the desired location is required to obtain its flow profile.

Therefore, we combine the computational efficiency of cellular automata models with the accuracy of the other microscopic models by introducing continuity in space. This continuity allows us to embed a multi-agent system based on fuzzy reasoning to simulate different driver-vehicle behaviours. The experimental results show that our model is able to reproduce the typical traffic flow phenomena with a variety of effects due to the heterogeneity within traffic stream.

At the origin of this congestion, the capacity drop is a well-known phenomenon which still remains complex to model [1,2,3,4]. The capacity drop is related to the hysteresis of traffic: for a state of disturbed traffic, the return to the normal of the traffic is delayed when demand decreases [5]. This paper intends to present a macroscopic convergent model to get a better modeling for capacity drop. Considering previous investigations [8], one considers bounded acceleration for the flow. As the most common case of convergent is the merge of two road lanes, or two motorways, the convergent is modeled as a box with two entry flows and one output flow. A static storage capacity is provided to the box. Vehicles are mainly characterized by their bounded acceleration. The point is to describe the evolution of the convergent considering the number of vehicles stored inside the box. The process is to consider the convergent box as a cell of network regarding the Godunov scheme [6]. The supply function has a classical fundamental diagram shape, but the demand function is modified regarding the bounded acceleration of vehicles [7]. The partial supply functions for the node cell are calculated accordingly to the importance of the converging roads. Then the model is solved using the Godunov scheme, with an update of the number of stored vehicles for every time step. The model is to be tested on Paris ring with 40 seconds data.

This phenomenon has significantly changed traffic flow conditions and has produced a significant increase of interferences. Because of this, it is more effective using emission data calculated point by point instead of average values. In order to generalize the phenomenon of emissions, the analysis took advantage of the experiments carried out in the virtual reality laboratory. This research takes into account two different geometries and for each geometry, three different flow conditions. Data recorded using the driving simulator will be compared with data obtained from real scale tests. (C) 2012 The Elsevier Ltd.

The estimated travel time is calculated adding the travel time under normal traffic conditions, the time used settling the accident area and the time needed to dissolve the queue. To be applied the model requires the knowledge of accident characteristics, the traffic flow at the accident time and the value of the reduced capacity during the accident management. The model refers to traffic conditions and accident management procedures typical of motorways. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, roundabouts slow all vehicles to speed ranges where emissions are higher, while signals stop and delay only a portion of vehicles. Roundabouts have the potential to increase the amount of acceleration and deceleration for all vehicles. Emissions are correlated to these modal events, therefore the impacts should be considered in the evaluation of roundabouts. Vehicle activity (instantaneous speed and acceleration) are key inputs to modal emission models such as the US Environmental Protection Agency's MOVES. The objective of this paper was to compare the vehicle activity of a roundabout to 4-way stop control and signal controlled intersections. The paper presents result of a study which collected second-by-second vehicle activity on-road along a corridor in Urbandale, Iowa. Vehicle activity for the three different types of traffic control was compared.

The amount of CO2 emission from vehicles can be reduced by controlling traffic flows using traffic signals, because it is strongly affected by vehicular behavior. Although there are a number of traffic signal control systems to reduce travel time, such systems might not be effective to reduce vehicular emission because of the trade-off between stop duration and stop frequency at signals. In this paper, we propose a decentralized signal control technique for reduction of vehicle stops using vehicle arriving information collected by inter-vehicle communication. The proposing technique controls signals based on an evaluation function to predict CO2 emission amount. The function is gradually improved by an unsupervised learning technique. Through simulation based evaluation, we show that the proposing technique is efficient to reduce CO2 emissions from vehicles without increasing the average travel time not so much.

The relationship between traffic flow on the current section and the upstream stations can be used for predicting short-term traffic flow. In this paper, we reveal this relationship by the traffic flow structure pattern. The structure pattern can be drawn from real freeway toll data and a few video detective cameras on the freeway segments. Based on the stability pattern, a new traffic flow prediction algorithm has been proposed. Experimental based on real data showed that the prediction method based on structure pattern is an effective approach for traffic flow prediction, especially on the abnormal traffic state.

However, performance of forecasting models is highly influenced by traffic uncertainty and predictability. Traffic uncertainty is important for road users and governors as well. With support of adequate real data from toll stations, we reveal laws in traffic flow uncertainty by employing dispersion coefficient. For further study, Hurst exponent and Approximate Entropy reflect temporal characteristics, indicating long-term randomness and short-term complexity respectively. These measurements all suggest that traffic flow uncertainty drops with the increase of time interval. Our study provides effective measuring methods of uncertainty and theoretical evidence for 15 minutes time horizon in short-term traffic prediction. Daily periodicity exists that highway traffic flow at night is more uncertain than in day time, and off-peak hour flows are more uncertain than peak hour flows. Finally, initial investigation into traffic predictability exhibits acme at 7 a.m. in our case.

The scope of simulation is very broad. The traffic network is simulated in microscopic scale with nanoscopic components being available as well. The vehicles can be simulated down to basic physical properties including throttle and brake settings, fuel consumption and others. This allows for in-depth behavioural analysis of both individual vehicles and the whole traffic flow as a result of use of different traffic management systems. The simulator also allows investigating inter-vehicle interactions including platooning behaviour and its consequences such as the string stability problem. The simulator has been designed to be modular and easily extensible to allow for new functionality in future.

Since the traffic data collected in real time reflects the past or the current conditions on the roadway, a predictive travel time methodology should be used to obtain the information to be disseminated. However, an important part of the literature either uses instantaneous travel time assumption, and sums the travel time of roadway segments at the starting time of the trip, or uses statistical forecasting algorithms to predict the future travel time. This study benefits from the available traffic flow essentials (e.g. shockwave analysis, bottleneck identification), and makes use of both historical and real time traffic information to provide travel time prediction. The experimental results based on the loop detector data on Californian freeways indicate that the proposed method provides promising travel time predictions under varying traffic conditions.

An alternate solution has been optimizing traffic flow by fleeting traffic signals. A roadway is fleeted when its signal sequence allows a platoon of vehicles to travel its length without being stopped by a red light, which in turn reduces congestion. The advantages of fleeting could be increased by fleeting multiple intersecting roadways. Our research examines the conditions necessary to accomplish timing traffic signals in intersecting directions so that both directions can have platooned vehicles simultaneously. The traffic signals at the intersecting roadways must be synchronized to maintain the fleeting sequences for both roadways. Through our analysis, we conclude that the time to travel along the roadways between traffic signals that are timed for platooning in multiple directions must be equivalent. Since many roadway distances are already known (unless a new road is being constructed), the only variable affecting the time to travel along a roadway is the speed limit.

It is an elementary process step for many applications, such as traffic flow analysis, fleet management, and driver assistance. In many existing approaches, the distance between GPS point and roads is a main factor for the position determination. From the year of 2011, a new feature called azimuth angle, which shows the instant driving direction of a vehicle, started to be utilized in our map-matching algorithm. So in this paper, we first studied the feasibility of azimuth angle in accuracy enhancement and then proposed a method to utilize it in candidate filtering. The experiment result shows that the proposed method can improve the efficiency as well as the accuracy of map-matching.			lanli@hitachi.cn; boliu@hitachi.cn					Dijkstra E.W., 1959, NUMER MATH, V1, P269, DOI DOI 10.1007/BF01386390; Greenfeld J.

This paper presents a general macroscopic UTN model by adopting the transfer mechanism of vehicles between road links to represent the future distribution of vehicles in the whole network. Based on the model, we predict the short-term traffic flux without using any historical traffic data, which is completely different from previous approaches. Furthermore, to verify the effectivity of the UTN-based prediction model, we compare it to four classic models including two parametric and two nonparametric methods with the data produced by CORSIM, a commonly used microscopic traffic simulation software. Finally, the comparative results illustrate that the proposed method can reach the level of classic methods and predict the short-term traffic flow timely and accurately both for the steady or suddenly changed traffic states.

We first present an equivalent formulation of the problem using an Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Then, using a semi-analytic formula, we show that the model constraints resulting from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation result in linear constraints, albeit with unknown integers. We then pose the problem of estimating the density at the initial time given incomplete and inaccurate traffic data as a Mixed Integer Program. We then present a numerical implementation of the method using experimental flow and probe data obtained during Mobile Century experiment.

As a result, the levels of CO2 and other emissions have worsened the environment, and thus global-warming and air-pollution issues need to be incorporated within the planning and operation of transportation system. This research proposes two energy consumption and emission models for mixed traffic flows under a wide variety of advanced traffic management strategies. These two models are defined as the link-based and the trip-based fuel consumption and emission model. The link-based model is developed based on link characteristics, including static and dynamic attributes of the link, such as link length, number of vehicles, and average speed on links. The trip-based model calculates fuel consumption and emission based on trip characteristics, such as vehicle movement trajectory. These two models are integrated with a simulation-assignment model, DynaTAIWAN. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the proposed models. Traffic management strategies, including real-time information and advanced traffic control systems, are evaluated based on the performance of fuel consumption and emission. The experiment results show the models are robust and advanced traffic management strategies can indeed reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emission.

Unsupervised Learning Based Performance Analysis of nu-Support Vector Regression for Speed Prediction of A Large Road Network	2012 15TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITSC)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	SEP 16-19, 2012	Anchorage, AK				TRAFFIC FLOW PREDICTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; VALIDATION; MACHINES	Many intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications require accurate prediction of traffic parameters. Previous studies have shown that data driven machine learning methods like support vector regression (SVR) can effectively and accurately perform this task. However, these studies focus on highways, or a few road segments. We propose a robust and scalable method using nu-SVR to tackle the problem of speed prediction of a large heterogenous road network. The traditional performance measures such as mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) provide little insight into spatial and temporal characteristics of prediction methods for a large network. This inadequacy can be a serious hurdle in effective implementation of prediction models for route guidance, congestion avoidance, dynamic traffic assignment and other ITS applications. We propose unsupervised learning techniques by employing k-means clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), and self organizing maps (SOM) to overcome this insufficiency. We establish the effectiveness of the developed methods by evaluation of spatial and temporal characteristics of prediction performance of the proposed variable window nu-SVR method.	[Asif, M.

Based on empirical investigation on traffic data collected from Beijing urban freeway, we find that when traffic is dense, upstream flow and ramp flow are correlated significantly. Competitions between the two flows at vicinities of several on-ramps during a morning peak are studied. Based on these empirical observations, a flow competition model as an extension of CTM (cell transmission model) is developed. The proposed model focuses on reproducing correlated upstream flow and ramp flow in dense traffic. Both empirical data and simulation results point out that several traffic phenomena, such as capacity drop and spontaneous traffic breakdown, can be explained as results of such a competition.

Multi-class traffic flow models aim to capture these class-specific differences. In this paper, a multi-class model is appended with a monetary cost framework accounting for the value of time of each vehicle class, thereby enabling the computation of the total network costs. Subsequently, the framework is analytically applied to show the conditions under which it is justified to prioritize certain traffic classes in order to maximize the monetary flow (which is equivalent to minimizing the total monetary network costs). An illustrative example is given in which the framework is used to find the conditions (bottleneck capacity, traffic demand, pce, VOT) under which activating a dedicated lane for trucks is beneficial.

Simulation analysis of longitudinal ventilation system with jet fan speed control for MPC strategy in a road tunnel	2012 15TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITSC)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	SEP 16-19, 2012	Anchorage, AK					To make the longitudinal ventilation systems more efficient and energy saving in road tunnels, it is being combined with typical model predictive control (MPC) strategies. Good application of such method is based on a comprehensive understanding of the system characteristics. Using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulation, step response model is chosen to describe the dynamic behaviors of the system in a road tunnel with comprehensive health-related indexes which is difficult to obtain by field measurement. The results show that the "Fan Model", which characterizes the effect of jet speed on CO (carbon monoxide) concentration, is approximately bilinear within fan's economical working range and system settling time is longer when jet speed decreases than it increases. The "Tunnel tube model", which characterizes the effect of traffic intensity on CO concentration, links to traffic flow features, and has a similar settling time in normal operation and a traffic-speed-related delay time when maximum CO concentration is considered. This can provide guidance or index to control the tunnel ventilation system economically and useful data to implement MPC strategy in the system.	[Tan, Z.; Huang, Z. Y.; Wu, K.; Xu, L.

Traffic state estimation based on data fusion techniques	2012 15TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITSC)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	SEP 16-19, 2012	Anchorage, AK					The capability to detect and/or forecast traffic conditions is of utmost importance in road management applications. Recent advances in technology have made available numerous new monitoring systems exploiting larger fleet of probe vehicles. Together with traditional volume and time mean speed measurements relative to a local section monitored continuously in time, probe vehicles provide additional type of data, such as space mean speed and travel time, relative to road segments monitored in specific time intervals. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to study how to exploit available information detected by new monitoring devices in the estimation of traffic flow conditions. Different types of data fusion techniques have been analyzed, namely measurement data fusion and state vector fusion, in several simulations carried out on a simple test network, traveled by probe vehicles and composed of 9 cells with an on ramp and an off ramp and with two fixed traffic sensors located in two different cells. Test results are promising and indicate higher accuracy of estimates obtained with new methods, particularly in the case of measurement data fusion.

Towards a Realistic Optimization of Urban Traffic Flows	2012 15TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITSC)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	SEP 16-19, 2012	Anchorage, AK					In spite of recent advances in Intelligent Transport, vehicular traffic dynamics are still hard to represent and analyze. Most of the previous work on traffic regards highways or single lanes where vehicles interact in one dimension. Models for multi-dimensional vehicle-to-vehicle interactions and models for urban intersections are quite complicated and hardly applicable on a large scale. Nonetheless, urban traffic jams are an actual problem that requires a solution. This paper proposes a method to optimize urban traffic layout using basic heuristics and computationally efficient simulations. Instead of modeling an entire urban map with hundreds of intersections, each typology of intersection is simulated in order to understand how it responds to different traffic patterns and intensities. This knowledge is leveraged to allow the computation of minimal delay route on the complete road map. In order to validate our model, we use the solution obtained with our heuristic to derive the average travel delay through simulation on realistic Manhattan topologies with different intersection types.

The collection and processing of the data required for the development and update of GIS is a long and expensive process which is prone to errors and inaccuracies, making its automation promising. The article introduces a method which leverages the emergence of sparsely sampled probe vehicle data to update and improve existing GIS. We present an unsupervised classification algorithm which discriminates between signalized road segments (as having a signal at the downstream intersection) and non-signalized road segments. This algorithm uses a statistical model of the probability distribution of vehicle location within a link, derived from hydrodynamic traffic flow theory. The decision of whether the link has a traffic signal or not is taken according to model selection criteria. Numerical results performed with sparsely sampled probe data collected by the Mobile Millennium system in the Bay Area of San Francisco, CA underline the importance of the problem addressed by the article to improve the accuracy and update signal information of GIS. They showcase the ability of the method to detect the presence of traffic signals automatically.

Modelling traffic dynamics in motorway networks	2012 15TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITSC)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	SEP 16-19, 2012	Anchorage, AK				FLOW; DERIVATION; WAVES	Due to the rapid growth of traffic density, the necessity to increase the operational efficiency and capabilities of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) has led to the development of various traffic modelling theories. The Lighthill-Whithman and Richards (LWR) model [?, ?], uses fluid based partial differential equations to capture traffic dynamics along continuous stretches of road. In contrast to the LWR model, the artificial neural network model [?, ?] utilizes historical observations of traffic flow-rates to forecast flow-rate locally. This paper aims to introduce a new hybrid macroscopic model which combines the complementary features of the LWR and artificial neural network models, to effectively simulate traffic flow in road networks. The model developed in this paper demonstrates the ability to, within a certain degree of accuracy, forecast traffic flow in a road network that includes junctions and continuous stretches of road. Furthermore, the proposed model offers an appropriate trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity, therefore it is suitable for real time applications.

With the advancement of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technologies, more and more ITS devices are deployed for monitoring traffic. Those ITS devices provide promising data sources for inputs to the emission models for the project level analysis. Taking advantage of those data sources, this paper presents an integrated framework to facilitate the on-road transportation emission estimation under various traffic operations which are influenced by the traffic management and control measures. The implementation of the framework is demonstrated by applying the three components of the framework, i.e., traffic flow phase identification module, vehicle classification module and MOVES (Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator) analysis module, in a case study where inductive loop data are utilized. The information provided by the framework can help traffic operation agency improve or develop efficient traffic management or control measures for energy saving and environment protection.

First, the traffic flow of each intersection node is used to represent the road network traffic. The number of charging stations is estimated in accordance with the capacity of conventional-standard charging station. The initial locations are determined by using coordinate method. Then, weighted Voronoi diagram is used to partition the road network of planning area. The users' minimum loss on the way to the charging station is chosen as the objective function for locating the charging station. Through repeated adjusting the coverage of each partition and the locations of charging stations, its sites and capacities are optimized. The practical example proves that the methods and models in this paper are feasible.

Traffic flow pattern recognition is focused under the transition between the three traffic flow phases. For this purpose, traffic flow status features are described in every phase and used for traffic flow model fitting as an empirical premise. The results demonstrate that traffic flow status pattern can be correctly recognized in 87 percent of situations using the presented equation.

The public transportation vehicles can be categorized into two categories as follows: one with determinate trajectories and schedules such as bus, tramway, and light rail; the other with flexible and variable running paths, such as taxis. In this paper, we firstly present a destination-gathering-based driving path prediction method for taxis, which can make taxis' driving paths prescient in the initial stage of carrying passengers every time. Compared with ordinary vehicles, public transportation vehicles have such features as long time running on roads and no privacy-protection need, and thus their trajectories can be opened. Through utilizing the features above, we propose a novel public-transportation-assisted data delivery scheme (PTDD) used to improve the performance of data delivery of Vehicular Delay Tolerant Networks (VDTNs). Simulation results based on a real map demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

The proposed model treats each aircraft on an airway as a continuous distribution of air collision probability, which is called the danger value distribution. With the proposed flow model, collision can be easily predicted by the peak value of the overlap of the danger value distribution of each aircraft. The study further proposes a velocity adjustment method that can be used to resolve the conflict. The proposed method can be applied for aircraft separation during the landing process, in which the separation time is different for different combinations of aircraft types.

This paper offers a contribution to scenario assessment, through a computational model of heterogeneous urban traffic flows. Built on a cellular-automaton framework, it considers, in particular, the inclusion of pedal-bicycles in the specific case of a city with an incomplete dedicated bicycle lane network, where close road sharing takes place between motorised and non-motorised vehicles.

J	Bhavathrathan, BK; Mallikarjuna, C				Bhavathrathan, B. K.; Mallikarjuna, C.			Evolution of macroscopic models for modeling the heterogeneous traffic: an Indian perspective	TRANSPORTATION LETTERS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH			English	Article						macroscopic modeling; heterogeneous traffic; no-lane discipline; two wheeler traffic	KINEMATIC WAVES; FLOW; SIMULATION	The Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model and its initial extensions treated traffic as homogenous and thus could only be employed for homogeneous traffic modeling where the entities of traffic, viz. vehicles, differed not much in their vehicle-class. Improvements and extensions were made to the LWR model, thus broadening the discipline of macroscopic traffic flow modeling. Several researchers introduced models that could comprehend the heterogeneity in vehicle classes. However, the traffic streams observed in the Indian subcontinent consists of numerous vehicle classes with complex interactions. Even the recent multiclass models are inadequate to represent these complex interactions. This paper explores various recent models and observes that the tradition through which the evolution of macroscopic modeling of heterogeneous traffic has happened does not account for some of the phenomena observed in the Indian road traffic. One such phenomenon, side-by-side movement of motorized two-wheelers (TW), is explained and an idea of diminishing density is introduced, which would improve the usability of the existing heterogeneous traffic flow models in an Indian perspective.

J	Tian, ZZ; Wu, N				Tian, Zong Z.; Wu, Ning			Probability of Capacity Enhancement and Disruption for Freeway Ramp Controls Analysis by Gap-Acceptance and Queuing Models	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Models based on gap-acceptance and queuing theory are proposed to model the effect of ramp controls on freeway operations. The models were developed for three types of patterns in ramp control and traffic flow: the uniform arrival with ramp metering, the random arrival without ramp metering, and the platoon arrival without ramp metering but with an upstream signalized intersection. From the theoretical point of view, the models were applied to address freeway ramp metering thresholds and the corresponding disruption probability. Studies have shown that ramp metering has been effective in reducing vehicle delays only when the rate of freeway traffic flow has reached a certain level of flow threshold. When freeway traffic is low, there are enough gaps in the freeway flow to accommodate the ramp flow, even when ramp traffic enters the freeway in platoons. The presented models accounted for the effect of platoon size that resulted from the three ramp controls and arrival flow patterns. Study results clearly indicate that more significant disruption on freeway operations occurs as a result of large platoon arrivals caused by an upstream traffic signal, than as a result of traffic that arrives randomly or uniformly. The models were also applied to provide quantitative assessments from the perspectives of freeway capacity. The results indicate that ramp metering produces increased freeway capacity and decreased disruption probability.

Analysis of Large-Scale Incidents on Urban Freeways	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							DURATION; FREQUENCY	Traffic incidents on urban freeways are a major source of congestion and travel time uncertainty. In particular, large-scale incidents have longer durations and need more incident response resources. These incidents cause severe problems such as longer traffic queues, substantial delays, and secondary incidents. Large-scale incidents deserve more attention by practitioners and researchers. The objective of this study was to analyze large-scale incidents and explore their correlates and implications for traffic operations. An innovative analysis method based on a detailed incident data set from Hampton Roads, Virginia, was developed. This study defined large-scale incidents as having a minimum duration of 2 h, according to guidance from the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices. The study discovered how the spatial and temporal patterns of large-scale incidents varied. Forty percent of the large-scale incidents blocked all lanes of traffic during some point in their duration. Rigorous statistical models were estimated to quantify associated key factors that included incident characteristics, roadway geometry, traffic flow, and operational responses. Results indicated that given large-scale incidents, their longer durations were associated with extreme events, for example, occurring in a work zone, the presence of curvature on the segment where the incident occurred, morning peak hours, and occurrence of secondary incidents. The new findings provide insights concerning the understanding of large-scale incidents and have certain implications for effective incident management.

Managed lane (ML) systems, as an innovative strategy for managing the roadway conditions in real time, have been gaining increasing popularity in the recent decade. However, the unique characteristics of ML facilities, such as the frictional effects between general purpose lanes (GPLs) and their adjacent ML, are not well studied and modeled. This paper investigates the interaction between GPLs and MLs, as buffer-separated ML facilities are readily affected by congestion in the adjacent GPLs. The frictional effect is quantified through development of speed flow curves for the ML facility. A traffic flow model is developed on the basis of the cell transmission model incorporating this frictional effect to model the traffic evolution on the ML facility. This model is capable of replicating the traffic flow pattern, including congestion onset, propagation, and dissipation at a macroscopic level. The model also captures the effect of GPL congestion on the ML. This model can serve as the underlying ML traffic flow model in future research for evaluating the effectiveness of different tolling strategies.

However, the speed of traffic flow changes significantly with the road saturation. The coordination is often ignored in off-peak intensities, when the minimisation of the waiting times decreases the cycle length of light signaling equipment (LSE). However, this leads to changed green waves (in time), which means that the coordinated groups of vehicles pass the intersection at different times. Because of fixed constant distances between intersections, the preservation of the green wave might not be possible and even at a lower traffic intensity the number of cars stopping can increase, the waiting times prolong and therefore the traffic smoothness can be deteriorated. The model of extended coordination defines the dependence of duration of traffic lights controlled intersections cycle on the intensity of the coordinated entry, the speed of approach and the distance between the coordinated intersections.

Data from traffic detectors on the main access road to the city of Gliwice in the period of past year is the basis for statistical analysis. Four classes of time series are proposed as representative of the traffic flow. The time series map temporarily smoothed detector counts. Different smoothing periods are used to retain the dynamic characteristics of the flows. A neural network is developed to classify incoming traffic data into the proposed time series classes. The specific time series implies a traffic control or management strategy, which indicates the capability of the NN to work out decisions for use in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications.

The general purpose of the application is to generate recommendations for alternative driving routes in order to avoid traffic congestion. The Adaptive Route Change (ARC) application is implemented in an integrated cooperative ITS simulation platform. For the evaluation we chose a reference scenario defining two distinct traffic flows through an urban area that provides four crossings with traffic light controls. We were interested to evaluate the impacts of ARC on fuel and traffic efficiency. For that we introduced five performance metrics (average trip duration, average fuel consumption, average stop duration, maximum queue size and average queue size behind traffic lights) and evaluated ARC in a series of simulations with varied application penetration rates and traffic volume. The results indicate that ARC systems could reduce traffic congestion in intersections and improve fuel consumption. We observe up to one quarter reduction in average trip time and almost one third reduction in average stop time. Fuel consumption is also reduced by up to 17.3%, while average queue size and maximum queue size reduce more than 50%.

Some conventional functions are realized to simulate the real road traffic lights control system, for example, alternatively working of the red lights, the yellow lights and the green lights, time countdown showing function, manual adjustment of the time, etc. Besides, the system can automatically adjust the time of traffic lights by the traffic flow in different directions, and can automatically change the working modes of the traffic lights by the current system time. The practical application shows that the device can not only promote students' learning interests and improve students' practical ability and creativity, but also can be used to control the real traffic lights if the traffic flow detectors are substituted by the earth inductors or the infrared cameras.

Relationship Between Freeway Flow Parameters and Safety and Its Implication for Adding Lanes	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								The decision to add lanes to a freeway is motivated by the need to relieve congestion. Practicing engineers and planners generally believe that the decreased congestion that results from adding lanes is associated with some degree of improved safety, yet the majority opinion of researchers is that accident rates increase as the number of lanes increases. In more than 70 years of modern road building, these conflicting views have not been reconciled. This paper first examines the relationship of traffic flow parameters, such as volume, density, and speed, with safety by calibrating corridor-specific safety performance functions. On the basis of an understanding of this relationship, a possible explanation of the effect that adding lanes has on safety is formulated. An empirical examination of the relationship of flow, density, and speed to the crash rate on selected freeways in Colorado suggests that, as the flow increases, the crash rate initially remains constant until a certain critical threshold combination of speed and density is reached. Once this threshold is exceeded, the crash rate rapidly rises. The rise in the crash rate may be because an increase in density without a notable reduction in speed produces headways so small that it becomes difficult or impossible to compensate for driver error. This model suggests that, after the construction of additional lanes, crash rates initially decline because of the lower traffic volume and density per lane. However, as development and rerouting occur, freeways with more lanes are expected to have higher crash rates that are attributable to the increased opportunities for lane change-related conflicts.

Ordinary cells and oriented cells are applied to render the crowd roads and their adjacent roads. Therefore the traffic flow could be simulated by these cells. Resorting to the proposed model, the duration of the initial traffic congestion could be predicted and the subsequent secondary congestion could be located. Accordingly, the spatial diffusion of traffic congestion could be estimated. At last, taking a road network region of Hangzhou city as an example, the simulation experiment is implemented to verify the proposed method by PARAMICS software. The result shows that the method could predict the duration of the initial congestion and estimate its spatial diffusion accurately.

To mitigate some of these effects, managed toll lanes are being designed and built in the United States. These managed toll lanes guarantee to drivers that they will be able to travel at free-flow speed during peak hours when the general lanes are congested. The strategy used to price tolls on managed toll lanes has become an important issue; however, few studies have focused on dynamic optimal pricing strategies. This paper formulates the pricing problem on the basis of a stochastic macroscopic traffic flow. model and investigates the methodology used to find a pricing strategy to maximize the total expected revenue. A simulation-based numerical algorithm that obtains the optimal prices efficiently in real time is proposed. The methodology is also applicable and readily adjusted for other objective purposes of administrators, such as maximization of total throughput. The general pricing model developed in this paper is not limited to one specific underlying traffic flow model and is readily adapted to other macroscopic traffic models, such as the classical Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model.

J	Nguyen, LX; Hanaoka, S; Kawasaki, T				Long Xuan Nguyen; Hanaoka, Shinya; Kawasaki, Tomoya			Describing Non-Lane-Based Motorcycle Movements in Motorcycle-Only Traffic Flow	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							FORCE MODEL; DYNAMICS	The motorcycle is the main transport mode for commuters in Vietnam because it costs less than a car and has greater mobility on congested city roads. A better understanding of the characteristics of motorcycle traffic flow can be helpful in formulating proposals for traffic management policies. Under congested conditions, motorcycles are observed to change their directions and speeds quite often. This study focuses on the zigzag movements of motorcycles in motorcycle-only traffic, which are termed "non-lane-based movements." Research was conducted on the mechanisms of non-lane-based movements with a consideration of how two behaviors of a subject motorcycle acceleration and deceleration were affected by the velocity changes of lead motorcycles. A concept of safety space was introduced to explain these behaviors. Calibration data for the proposed model were extracted from video clips taken at road segments in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. By calculating the root mean square error of the estimated value and the field value, the proposed model reproduced the speed and direction of motorcycles with high reliability. A computer simulation was used to reproduce two basic types of non-lane-based movements oblique following and swerving and to verify the difference in the speed-flow relationship between lane-based and non-lane-based movements.

Operational Performance and Speed-Flow Relationships for Basic Managed Lane Segments	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Managed lane facilities, including high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, high-occupancy toll lanes, and express lanes, have become attractive tools for managing today's transportation system. Although managed lanes, specifically, HOV lanes, have existed for several decades, there has been little documentation of their traffic flow behaviors. Because these facilities tend to take on a variety of configurations, including different numbers of managed lanes and separation types from abutting general purpose lanes, transportation engineers should understand the traffic flow differences among facility types. An understanding of the interaction between managed lanes and parallel general purpose lanes is also needed for assessing the performance of managed lanes. A study was done to investigate the performance and traffic flow behavior of managed lane facilities at sites across the country. Traffic flow behavior for five facility types, based on separation type and number of lanes, was analyzed. Factors such as frictional impact on the managed lane-caused by poor performance of the general purpose lanes and slow vehicle effects on managed lane facilities where passing is prohibited-were considered in development of a set of speed-flow curves for each of the five basic facility types. These speed-flow relationships are expressed similarly to basic freeway segments in the Highway Capacity Manual and can be readily incorporated into the manual for predicting the performance of combined general purpose and managed lane facilities.

Short-Term Traffic Flow Forecasting by Mutual Information and Artificial Neural Networks	2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY (ICIT)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Industrial Technology (ICIT)	MAR 19-21, 2012	Athens, GREECE	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Inc (IEEE), Ind Elect Soc (IES), Univ Patras, Ind Syst Inst (ISI), IEEE, Advancing Technol Human			INPUT FEATURE-SELECTION; PREDICTION	Short-term traffic flow forecasting is an important problem in the research area of intelligent transportation system (ITS). Recently, artificial neural networks modeling, such as MLP, have been used in various applications over nonlinear time series forecasting such as traffic controL In modeling, irrelevant inputs cause the deterioration of performance and increment of calculation cost. Therefore, to have an accurate model, some strategies are needed to choose a set of most relevant inputs. Mutual information (MI) is very effective in evaluating the nonlinear relevance of each input from the view of information theory. Feature selection (FS) method is an improved version of the MI technique. This paper presents a novel short-term traffic flow prediction model using MLP predictor and MIFS algorithm. Performance of the proposed MIFS algorithm and MLP predictor is evaluated via simulations using MATLAB subroutine. To validate the algorithm, two different types of data, namely regular and irregular (with high uncertainty) data, are used.

This road traffic control should support the need for mobility as well as the need for environmental protection by selecting control measures that consider the current situation of traffic and the environment. For optimal selection of measures, this traffic control must assess the impact of measures quite precisely. A statistical approach with high-quality local data is used to assess the short-term (minutes) and midterm (hours) effects of traffic control measures on pollution levels of particulate matter and nitrogen oxides. The approach uses high-resolution input data of traffic and meteorological parameters to consider appropriately the influence of volatile parameters such as traffic flow and traffic volume. A regression model is used to describe measured roadside pollution concentrations and to assess the influence of the different input variables. With the quantified influence of traffic-related input variables, the environmental reduction potential is estimated. Potential investigation areas to improve the developed modeling approach and recommendations for data collection and data processing regarding integrated environment-responsive traffic control are offered.

With an increase in the demands on today's transportation network, an efficient system to model and understand the changes in the network is necessary for policy makers to make timely decisions which affect the overall level of service experienced by commuters. This paper proposes a novel approach to traffic modeling and identification using a Self-adaptive Fuzzy Inference Network (SaFIN). The study is performed on a set of real world traffic data collected along the Pan Island Expressway (PIE) in Singapore. By applying a hybrid fuzzy neural network in the traffic modeling task, SaFIN is able to capitalize on the functionalities of both the fuzzy system and the neural network to (1) provide meaningful and intuitive insights to the traffic data, and (2) demonstrate excellent modeling and identification capabilities for highly nonlinear traffic flow conditions.

To control the motion of traffic for visualization and animation purposes, we utilize the popular follow-the-leader method to simulate various vehicle types and intelligent driving styles. We also introduce a continuous lane-changing model to imitate the vehicle's decision-making process and dynamic interactions with neighboring vehicles. By applying our approach in several typical urban traffic scenarios, we demonstrate that our system can well visualize vehicles' behaviors in a realistic manner on complex road networks and generate immersive traffic flow animations with smooth accelerating strategies and flexible lane changes.

J	Zhao, YJ; Sadek, AW; Fuglewicz, D				Zhao, Yunjie; Sadek, Adel W.; Fuglewicz, Daniel			Modeling the Impact of Inclement Weather on Freeway Traffic Speed at Macroscopic and Microscopic Levels	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Inclement weather conditions, such as snowy and icy conditions, could have major impacts on driver behavior and on the performance of surface transportation systems. Recently, researchers have had an increased interest in understanding this impact better as well as in modeling it. This study contributes to the emerging literature in the impact of snowy and icy conditions on traffic and driver behavior by modeling the impact of inclement weather on freeway traffic speed, at both the macroscopic and microscopic levels, with data from Buffalo, New York. At the macroscopic level, freeway speed data observed on a Buffalo section of the New York State Thruway were correlated to a set of weather indices introduced by the study; the result was a regression model that could be used to estimate the average freeway speed as a function of weather conditions. At the microscopic level, the study was the first attempt to calibrate a cellular-automata traffic simulation model, specifically, the TRANSIMS model, to inclement weather (i.e., snowy) conditions. For the calibration of TRANSIMS, a vehicle equipped with a Global Positioning System collected second-by-second vehicle dynamics information during both normal and snowy weather conditions. The collected information was the basis for the adjustment of several of the TRANSIMS model parameters. The adjusted parameters enabled the model to closely replicate observed traffic flow parameters at both the macroscopic and microscopic scales.

In previous work this application has been tested on the road, and traffic simulation has been used to scale up the results of the field test to larger networks and more vehicles. The present study investigates the dependence of the traffic impact of the time headway settings of the application and on its penetration rate. It will be shown both theoretically and empirically that traffic flows and road capacities will improve significantly with the fraction of equipped vehicles, and that this improvement depends on the configuration of the application.

Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) technology can be used to lower vehicle emissions and fuel consumption, in addition to reducing traffic congestion, smoothing traffic flow, and improving roadway safety. As wireless communication advances, connected-vehicles-based Advanced Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) have gained significant research interest due to their high potential. In this study, we examine the concept of ATMS for connected vehicles using a multi-agent systems approach, where both vehicle agents and an intersection management agent can take advantage of real-time traffic information exchange. This dynamic strategy allows an intersection management agent to receive state information from vehicle agents, reserve the associated intersection time-space occupancies, and then provide feedback to the vehicles. The vehicle agents then adjust their trajectories to meet their assigned time slot. Based on preliminary simulation experiments, the proposed strategy can significantly reduce fuel consumption and vehicle emissions compared to traditional signal control systems.

Based on existing traffic conditions analyzing and traditional traffic flow forecasting methods, the cloud model theory is used to simulate and forecast urban traffic conditions. Cloud model theory, the basic principles of fuzzy mathematics, is a comprehensive evaluation method to evaluate the object that cannot be quantitative evaluation. This method can overcome the defects of traditional assessment methods that qualitative and quantitative cannot be considered both. It can also reflect the actual data in ambiguity and randomness. Simulation results show that the cloud model theory can be applied effectively in the prediction and evaluation of urban road traffic, provide a reliable technical support for urban traffic information mining and evaluation and has broad application prospects.

Reducing these required stops combined with an overall smoother traffic flow can reduce the negative effects on the environment in terms of less emissions, noise reduction, and energy consumption. In this paper a cooperative system developed in the research project KOLINE is introduced aiming at the reduction of delay and emissions by adjusting both the signal control and the vehicles' driving strategy. First, the overall system architecture including the wireless communication between traffic signals and vehicles is described. The paper focuses on the vehicles' reaction approaching a signalized intersection and presents a novel approach to optimize the driving strategy based on the traffic information received. The main feature of our approach is the optimization of both longitudinal and lateral guidance of the vehicle simultaneously. Therefore, the surroundings of the vehicles detected by the vehicles' sensors is combined with more precise information on the local traffic state such as tailback length or traffic volume for each lane and forms the basis for proper driving strategies. To handle the complexity of the optimization problem, a metaheuristic considering the possible actions of the vehicle is used to determine the optimal driving strategy in the current driving situation. The optimized strategy is finally realized by a test vehicle capable of driving autonomously in the dense traffic of urban environments.

The key idea of this paper is that when the queue length in front of the queue detector becomes longer, the speeds of the following vehicles to pass through the detector will become smaller, resulting in higher occupancy with constant traffic intensity. Considering the relationship between queue lengths and roll time occupancy affected by many factors, such as link length, lane width, lane number, and bus ratio, twelve different conditions were designed, and the traffic data under different conditions was obtained using VISSIM simulation. Based on the analysis of simulation data, an S-type logistic model was decided to develop for the relationship between queue lengths and roll time occupancy, and the fitting equations were obtained under the twelve simulation situations. The average model for the relationship between queue lengths and roll time occupancy was presented by successive multiple linear regression with the fitting equation parameters and simulation parameters, and the estimation model for queue length was presented through analyzing the equation of the average relation model.

These two types of models represent the trade-off between the level of detail and efficiency. The domain of pedestrian flow simulation on road networks is no exception and theories rely either on equation based model or agent based models. There is a growing interest in hybrid modeling that combines both of these types. This paper addresses the problem of combining both micro and macro models of pedestrians movement to speedup simulations. Hybrid model uses efficient macro modeling in part of the road networks that do not require a fine grained model and more detailed but less efficient micro modeling in critical locations. One key issue raised by such an approach and discussed is the consistency of the resulting hybrid model. Preliminary results presented in this article is a proof of concept that the use of hybrid model to simulate evacuation plan in road networks may be more efficient than the use of micro model alone.

Being able to handle uncertainties and complexity, expert systems are applied in vast areas of real life including intelligent transportation systems. This paper presents a traffic signal control method based on expert knowledge for an isolated signalized intersection. The proposed method has the adaptive signal timing ability to adjust its signal timing in response to changing traffic conditions. Based on the traffic conditions, the system determines to extend or terminate the current green signal group. Using the information from its traffic detectors of isolated intersection, the proposed controller gives optimal signals to adapt the phase lengths to the traffic conditions. A comparative analysis between proposed control algorithm, fuzzy logic (FLC) and fixed-timed (pre-timed) controllers has been made in traffic flows control, with varying traffic volume levels, by using simulation software 'Arena'. Simulation results show that the proposed traffic signal control method (EKC) has better performance over fuzzy logic and conventional pre-time controllers under light and heavy traffic conditions.

J	De Luca, M; Dell'Acqua, G				De Luca, Mario; Dell'Acqua, Gianluca			FREEWAY SAFETY MANAGEMENT: CASE STUDIES IN ITALY	TRANSPORT			English	Article						road safety; highway design; driver speed behavior; operating speed; crashes	MULTILANE HIGHWAYS; EQUATIONS APPROACH; SPEED	Road safety has since become one of the major factors for a description of the state traffic system and crashes are often due to bad made decisions by drivers in environments created by engineers. This study proposes an update of the previous version (Dell'Acqua et al. 2011a) to estimate V-85, for non-conditioned traffic flows on freeways. The databases used in the study come from a series of speed measurements and vehicle ranges on a stretch of freeway using a fixed measuring system. The produced model proved to be very reliable, with the greatest error in the estimation of V-85, being less than 6%. The model obtained was then applied to a stretch of freeway of approximately 20 km. Some significant correlations between DV85 (variation of V-85 among successive stretches) and DN (the variation in the number of crashes among successive stretches) were found, which may be very useful in the management of safety on roads. In particular the obtained results have highlighted some aspects of motorway traffic. In addition, using the procedure illustrated, it has been possible to identify some particular 'black spots' due to the poor design co-ordination of the alignment, positioned between consecutive stretches (for approximately 2 km), with a difference in terms of V-85average greater than 10 km/h.

J	Zhang, M; Cheong, KT; Leong, KF; Zou, FS				Zhang, Min; Cheong, Kuaitat; Leong, Kunfong; Zou, Fasheng			Effect of traffic noise on black-faced spoonbills in the Taipa-Coloane Wetland Reserve, Macao	WILDLIFE RESEARCH			English	Article							PLATALEA-MINOR; BIRD POPULATIONS; DISTURBANCE; BEHAVIOR; CONSERVATION; ROADS	Context. Nearly 20% of black-faced spoonbills (Platalea minor), a globally endangered species, winter along the coasts of the Pearl River Estuary, China. However, these wintering habitats are threatened by urban development. Especially in Macao, road construction for the tourism industry has resulted in habitat deterioration. Aims. Our study aimed to assess the effects of traffic noise on the distribution and behaviour of black-faced spoonbills in the Taipa-Coloane Wetland Reserve, Macao SAR. Methods. We built a traffic-noise prediction model for habitat-suitability division. Then we investigated the relationship between traffic noise and diurnal of spoonbill behaviours by collecting traffic-noise data on surrounding roads and observing the activity of black-faced spoonbills in the area over two winters, from 2007 to 2009. Key results. The maximum number of individuals present in a single month was 50 in the winter of 2007-08 (in February) and 52 in the winter of 2008-09 (in January). Continuous traffic noise was 46.5 and 45.4 dB(A), respectively, at roosting sites in two ecological zones. On the basis of the prediction model, only 10.8 of 30.3 ha were suitable for spoonbills, with noise levels lower than 47 dB(A). Most of the time, the spoonbills were acclimated to the traffic and were not alarmed. However, heavy trucks with a high noise level of 81.8 +/- 2.3 dB(A) sometimes disrupted spoonbill behaviour. Conclusions. The traffic noise around the Taipa-Coloane Wetland Reserve did exist but did not substantially affect black-faced spoonbills. For the birds mainly roosting in a quieter area, the small area of suitable habitat may indirectly limit population growth. Implications. The fences around Ecological Zone I were successful in minimising visual stimuli from human activities and passing cars. To maintain the suitability of the winter habitat in Macao, restrictions on traffic flow, especially on heavy truck volume, are necessary for spoonbill conservation.

The master expression of the arrival time is derived in terms of nonlinear maps with three dimensionless parameters: cycle time, offset time and acceleration. The impact of traffic lights delay control is investigated by analyzing the variation process of travel time. Utilizing the Matlab software, the nonlinear dynamic motion of a vehicle moving through the traffic lights is shown in the simulation.

Expressway resolves the problem in one way, which makes the urban spatial extension multi-poled, organized and form a new urban system by improving the accessibility of area along the expressway. Nowadays, urban expressway becomes an important mean that resolves the city transportation problem. Transverse section types of urban expressway include integral highway and separated highway or a combination of these two types. This research explored the method of using traffic simulation technology to evaluate the operation quality using index such as average delay, travel time, and minor roadway left-turn time. Applying computer simulation, traffic operation was simulated under the condition of future traffic flow. The evaluation index and their differences were obtained.

The model contains a lane-group-based cell transmission model (CTM) which sets different traffic capacities for links with different turning movements to flow out in an evacuation situation, an actual impedance model which is to obtain the impedance of each route in time units at each time interval and a stochastic route choice model according to the probit-based stochastic user equilibrium. In this model, vehicles loading at each origin at each time interval are assumed to choose an evacuation route under determinate road network, signal design, and OD demand. As a case study, the proposed model is validated on the network nearby Nanjing Olympic Center after the opening ceremony of the 10th National Games of the People's Republic of China. The traffic volumes and clearing time at five exit points of the evacuation zone are calculated by the model to compare with survey data. The results show that this model can appropriately simulate the dynamic route choice and evolution process of the traffic flow on the network in an evacuation situation.

J	Khoo, HL; Ong, GP; Khoo, WC				Khoo, Hooi Ling; Ong, Ghim Ping; Khoo, Wooi Chen			Short-term impact analysis of fuel price policy change on travel demand in Malaysian cities	TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						fuel price; subsidy; travel demand management; cross-elasticity; Malaysia	ELASTICITIES; CONSUMPTION; CARS	Malaysia is one of the few countries in the world that provides a fuel subsidy to consumers. Due to the recent economic crisis, the Malaysian Government decided to revise its fuel subsidization policy from a fixed price subsidy to a floating price subsidy dependent on global oil demand. Recognizing that the change in fuel subsidization policy can have an impact on travel behavior, this article investigates the short-term impact of the policy change on private and public transportation in the Klang Valley region of Malaysia. Spectral analyses are performed to investigate if the policy change has an impact on private vehicle travel demand, measured in terms of road traffic, and short-term travel demand elasticity with respect to fuel price is estimated. To measure the impact on the public transportation system, the demand cross-elasticity values of rail transit and buses are also estimated. It was found that traffic flow reduces with an increase in fuel price, although elasticity and cross-elasticity values obtained are low. The article finds that there is a potential mode shift from private vehicles to rail transit with increasing fuel price. It is demonstrated that reducing fuel price subsidy can be an effective travel demand management strategy to alleviate congestion.

J	del Castillo, JM				del Castillo, Jose M.			Three new models for the flow-density relationship: derivation and testing for freeway and urban data	TRANSPORTMETRICA			English	Article						traffic flow models; flow-density models; speed-density curve; fundamental diagram	KINEMATIC WAVES; TRAFFIC FLOW; FUNDAMENTAL DIAGRAM; FUNCTIONAL FORM; CONGESTION; CAPACITY	Three new models for the flow-density relationship are proposed in this work. The resulting flow-density curves are concave in the whole range of feasible values for the parameters. These models have four parameters, three of them being the jam density, the free-flow speed and the kinematic wave speed. The fourth parameter is a shape parameter. The models allow for a great flexibility for fitting of real traffic flow and density data. A remarkable property of these models is the fact that they yield a bilinear fundamental diagram when the shape parameter tends to infinity. The models have been tested with freeway data and urban data. The results demonstrate that the models achieve an excellent goodness of fit and yield realistic estimates of the parameters. The models proposed in this work are a valuable tool not only for fitting flow-density data but also for its use in traffic flow dynamic models.

According to this, the proposed system contains agents and their world which in turn contains roads, cars, traffic lights etc. Each of these agents observe the traffic density and control the traffic light at the junction by using observe-think-act rule i.e. the agents will continuously observe the traffic and depending on the density and waiting time it decides which rule can be inferred and finally it implements the condition to the traffic light controller which can efficiently manage the traffic flow near the junction. The system has been implemented by using NetLogo based traffic simulator. The investigation is to control the traffic at the road junction by applying few inference rules.

In this paper, we propose an efficient single-camera Traffic Monitoring System (TMS), which is capable of automatically analyzing the vehicles flow on urban streets in real time. The system has three main modules included calculating density of vehicles based on background subtraction methods, estimating average speed of traffic flow using optical flow method and counting the number of vehicles on the street by clustering motion features relied on Delaunay Triangulation algorithm. From that fundamental information, our system infers several high semantic events such as traffic jams, breaking-law vehicles, people crossing street.

The passenger flow of bus stops and the limited capacity of buses have a greater effect than road traffic flow on the running time of buses. As a result, conventional public transit assignment models that adopt the econometric road network path concept have numerous limitations. Based on the analysis, the generalized bus trip time chain is analyzed, and the concept of a congestion function is proposed to describe the relationship between trip resistance and flow in the current paper. On the premise of this study, the transit network resistance function is formed and the multiroute probit-based loading model is established. With using STOCH or Dial's algorithm, the process of distribution is proposed. Finally, the model is applied to the transit network assignment of Deqing Town in Zhejiang Province. The result indicates that the model can be applied to practical operations with high-precision results.

Traffic in a city has various aspects such as route planning on the road network and driving operations on a certain road. Both types of human behavior are being studied separately by specialists in their respective domains. We believe that traffic simulation platforms should integrate the various paradigms underlying agent decision making and the target environment. We focus on urban traffic as the target problem and attempt to realize a multiagent simulation platform based on the multi-model approach. While traffic flow simulations using simple agents are popular in the traffic domain, it has been recognized that driving behavior simulations with sophisticated agents are also beneficial. However, there is no software platform that can integrate traffic simulators dealing with different aspects of urban traffic. In this paper, we propose a traffic simulation platform that can execute citywide traffic simulations that take account of the aspects of route selection on a road network and driving behavior on individual roads. The proposed simulation platform enables the multiple aspects of city traffic to be reproduced while still retaining scalability.

Over recent days, there has been severe traffic congestion in many streets of big cities in Vietnam such as Hanoi and HoChiMinh city. There is an urgent need for measures to deal with increasing congestions. The simulation of traffic in Vietnam is a hard problem due to two main reasons including: (1) the traffic participants in Vietnam do not give way according to the rule; (2) the participants do not consider that when waiting for the vehicles in front, stopping in the intersection is obstructing the traffic flow. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent based simulation system for traffic in Vietnam to help transportation planners to find treatments to the problem of congestion of the traffic system in Vietnam as well as to test new designs before committing resources to actually building the transportation infrastructure. By allowing a user to design different road systems as well as to create different simulation scenarios with different agent profiles, our system can simulate the dynamic of traffic in Vietnam in different situations.

However, in such handling process, the problem of massive modeling and data handling exist, and the accuracy is not high. Finite Element Method (FEM) is a production which is developed from the combination of a modern mathematics, mathematics and computer technology, and it has been widely applied in various domain such as engineering. Based on existing theory of traffic flow, ITS and the development of FEM, a simulation theory of the FEM that solves the problems existing in traffic flow is put forward. Based on this theory, using the existing Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software, the traffic flow is simulated analyzed with fluid mechanics and the dynamics. Massive data processing problem of manually modeling and numerical analysis is solved, and the authenticity of simulation is enhanced. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B. V.

J	Si, BF; Zhong, M; Gao, L; Gao, ZY				Si, Bingfeng; Zhong, Ming; Gao, Liang; Gao, Ziyou			Hierarchical network-based equilibrium model and algorithm for a mixed-traffic urban transport system	TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						multimodal network; mixed traffic; choice behavior; equilibrium; variational inequality	COMBINED TRIP DISTRIBUTION; ASSIGNMENT MODEL; MULTICLASS	Many equilibrium models and algorithms based on homogeneous motorized traffic have been devised to model urban transport systems in developed countries, but they are inadequate when it comes to represent mixed-traffic urban transport systems, including automobiles, transit, bicycles, and pedestrians, in developing countries such as China or India. In these cases, traffic flow on a road segment is an aggregated result of travellers' combined mode/route choices and corresponding interactions. Therefore, a special assignment model and algorithm are needed for modeling these distinct behaviors. In this article, the structure of a mixed-traffic urban transport system is analyzed and then expanded and represented using a hierarchical network model based on graph theory. Based on the analysis of travelers' combined mode/route choices, generalized travel cost functions and link impedance functions for different modes are formulated, where the interferences between different modes on the same road segments are taken into account. Due to the 'asymmetric' nature of these functions, a variational inequality model is proposed to represent the equilibrium assignment problem in a mixed-traffic urban transport system. The corresponding solution algorithm is also presented. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the practicality of the proposed model and algorithm.

To remedy the data limitations and the methodological shortcomings suffered by previous studies, a multi-resolution data processing method is proposed and implemented, upon which binary logistic models were developed. The major findings of this paper are: 1) traffic conditions have significant impacts on COL at the study site; Specifically, COL in a congested (transitioning) traffic flow is about 6 (1.6) times of that in a free flow condition; 2) Speed variance alone is not sufficient to capture traffic dynamics' impact on COL; a traffic chaos indicator that integrates speed, speed variance, and flow is proposed and shows a promising performance; 3) Models based on aggregated data shall be interpreted with caution. Generally, conclusions obtained from such models shall not be generalized to individual vehicles (drivers) without further evidences using high-resolution data and it is dubious to either claim or disclaim speed kills based on aggregated data.

The existing studies on traffic density estimation for multi-lane roadways mainly focus on the scenario where either vehicles' lane-change manoeuvres are not common or the lane-change pattern is time-invariant. This research, however, takes into consideration the time-varying nature of drivers' lane-change manoeuvres, and models the lane-change probabilities using a number of discrete choice models. These lane-change models are then embedded into a state space model to capture the dynamics of traffic flow. The extended Kalman filter is used to update the estimated traffic densities of multi-lane motorways. A numerical study is carried out to investigate the performance of the developed approach.

Two kinds of vehicles, conventional car and microcar are defined in the traffic stream. The changing lane behaviour which can make vehicles have more opportunity to higher their speed is considered. Traffic flow with different rates of microcars is investigated in the simulation. Traffic flow and average speed are computed for congestion point of view. The results demonstrate that introduction of microcar will relieve traffic congestion to some extent, and vehicles passing through per hour become more than those without microcars.

Relative congestion in passing lanes or sections allowing passing can be calculated by quantifying delay in no-passing section in two-lane roads and this could serve as a valuable reference material if it contributes to better traffic conditions. This study established congestion model in no-passing section by performing regression analysis with field survey data retrieved from 88 Olympic Expressway, ran TWOPAS, which is traffic flow analysis program in two-lane roads, developed congestion estimation model in passing sections by simulating many passing lanes with different length, and finally analysed congestion reduction in passing lanes compared to no-passing lanes by different length. The analysis found USHCM 2000's linear model to be a more reliable estimation model for PTSF, which indicates congestion in two-lane roads than non-linear model. The appropriate length of passing lane should be more than 2.0 km when there is heavy traffic (1,000vph) as indicated by applying model formula derived in this study to TWOPAS model. In this case, congestion reduced by an average of 23% compared to no-passing section. Furthermore, 1.5km in length of passing section can also turn out to be effective for softening congestion.

In order to develop effective intelligent transportation systems (ITS) strategies to mitigate traffic congestion on freeways, a good understanding of its causes and impacts is vital but has not been achieved at a satisfactory level. Over the past several decades, deterministic queuing theory (DQT) has been widely used to evaluate freeway travel delays resulted from traffic congestion. However, several studies evaluated the accuracy of its delay estimates and claimed that the DQT method consistently underestimates vehicle delays. The reason for the underestimation, however, had not been clearly identified. This study aims at exploring the main cause of such underestimation problems and proposing a solution to fix it. Based on theoretical analysis and empirical justification, it was found the underestimation resulted primarily from the inappropriate estimates of the time offsets, that is, the travel times between the queue starting point and the immediate upstream and downstream traffic sensor locations. To address this issue, a microscopic approach was developed and implemented in a computer application to enhance the time offset estimation. This proposed approach was tested using the real vehicle delay data manually extracted from traffic surveillance video cameras. The test results indicated that the improved DQT-based vehicle delay estimates with appropriate time offset settings were very close to the ground-truth data. The underestimation problem associated with the traditional DQT method can be effectively addressed and fairly accurate estimates of vehicle delay can be achieved by the proposed method.

J	Schnetzler, B; Louis, X; Lebacque, JP				Schnetzler, Bernard; Louis, Xavier; Lebacque, Jean-Patrick			A multilane junction model	TRANSPORTMETRICA			English	Article						macroscopic traffic flow model; lane changes; outflow forecasting	TRAFFIC FLOW; WAVES	Junction modelling is described within the framework of macroscopic traffic flow models. Given previous models, the focus is on the most important factor: first-in first-out (FIFO) effects. According to the number of lanes, current models assume either a perfectly FIFO traffic or a perfectly non-FIFO traffic. Although we assume a single-flow highway traffic model, the improvement takes into account lane changes close to merges and diverges. Thus the traffic is neither perfectly FIFO nor perfectly non-FIFO and so outflows at junctions depend considerably on junction topology, traffic distribution in lanes and driver behaviour. As a consequence, this article suggests a simple improvement of the description of merges and diverges which takes into account some of these factors. With respect to the previous models, the best improvement concerns the outflow forecasting on an uncongested exit of a diverge when the other exit is congested.

J	Chung, Y; Kim, H; Park, M				Chung, Younshik; Kim, Hyun; Park, Minyoung			Quantifying non-recurrent traffic congestion caused by freeway work zones using archived work zone and ITS traffic data	TRANSPORTMETRICA			English	Article						freeway work zone; recurrent traffic congestion; non-recurrent traffic congestion; archived traffic flow data	NEURAL-NETWORK; DELAY; MODEL; CAPACITY; LENGTHS	Non-recurrent traffic congestion has been estimated using the capacity and the number of closed lanes in work zones and the upstream traffic demand of work zones. However, the number of closed lanes may be meaningless due to operational strategies, such as using the shoulder area and composing an additional lane by temporarily reducing the existing lane width to mitigate traffic congestion. The objective of this study is to develop a method to quantify non-recurrent traffic congestion caused by freeway work zones based on traffic flow data and spatio-temporal work zone information. In addition, to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed method, a case study is performed using 1-year historical traffic data and work zone data on major freeways in Korea.

THE CASE OF THESSALONIKI OUTER RING ROAD	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY			English	Article						sustainable transportation; large-scale infrastructure projects; transport modelling; environmental impacts		Within the framework of this paper, the traffic, environmental and energy impacts of large-scale infrastructure projects are examined and evaluated through the use of traffic simulation modelling techniques. In an effort to realise how such projects affect sustainable development, this study initially summarises the main idea of sustainability by integrating its respective goals, objectives and principles. The paper then briefly outlines the basic demographical and geographical characteristics of the case study area, i.e. Thessaloniki, where an external outer ring road is planned for construction. The results of the examination of various indicators such as average speed, travel time, travel distance, fuel consumption and pollutants emmited (CO, CO2, NOx, HC, Pb and PM10) after the implementation of the project are subsequently presented and discussed. The paper concludes that the feasibility of a large-scale project should be examined not only in terms of improving the traffic flow conditions but should also be related with the environmental sustainability of the greater area. The current research confirms the non straight correlation between traffic and environmental improvement.

According to characters of saturated traffic flow of Chinese urban road, this thesis establishes a model for optimization of phase offset for adjacent interactions and finds a solution from such model by adopting genetic algorithm. The model is verified by actual traffic flow datum of two adjacent signal intersections on Changan Avenue. Then a comparison is made between the optimization result of such model and that of the existing mathematical method and SYNCHRO model, which indicates that the model established by this thesis can reduce the delay suffered by vehicles at the intersections and increase the traffic efficiency of the intersections.

First, the basic description of Q-learning algorithm and extension control is given and analyzed necessarily. Then reward function is gained through the extension control theory to judge the state of traffic light.

These effects are the result of heavy vehicles' length, size, weight, and limitations in their maneuverability. Because of the importance of heavy vehicle lane-changing maneuvers, this article presents an exclusive fuzzy logic lane-changing decision model with 2 and 3 fuzzy sets for heavy vehicle drivers on freeways. To examine the accuracy of the heavy vehicle drivers' lane-changing decision model, the authors compared the number of estimated lane-changing maneuvers of heavy vehicles with the observed number of heavy vehicle lane-changing maneuvers. In addition, the authors compared estimated traffic flow measurements (e.g., traffic flow, average speed) with the observed traffic flow measurements through microscopic traffic simulations. Results show that the fuzzy logic heavy vehicle lane-changing model can better replicate the observed lane-changing decisions of heavy vehicle drivers than can the current lane-changing decision models. Furthermore, using an exclusive heavy vehicle lane-changing decision model can increase the accuracy of the microscopic traffic simulation software in estimating the macroscopic traffic flow measurements.

J	Tapani, A				Tapani, Andreas			Vehicle Trajectory Effects of Adaptive Cruise Control	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Adaptive Cruise Control; Acceleration Noise; Traffic Simulation; Driver Behavior	TRAFFIC-FLOW; EMISSIONS; SYSTEMS; IMPACT	Adaptive cruise control (ACC) can potentially improve quality-of-service and safety and reduce the environmental effect of the road traffic system. This article uses vehicle trajectories from traffic simulation to study effects of ACC on vehicle acceleration and deceleration rates. The analysis is based on traffic simulations with car-following models including ACC functionality and driver behavior in ACC-equipped as well as standard nonequipped vehicles. The simulation results show that ACC can improve the traffic situation in terms of reduced acceleration and deceleration rates even though macroscopic traffic properties may remain uninfluenced. This supports the hypothesized positive road safety and environmental effects of ACC. It is also established that the results are largely dependent on the assumptions made regarding driver behavior in ACC-equipped and standard vehicles. It is consequently crucial to include appropriate assumptions regarding driver behavior in traffic simulation-based analyses of ACC.

J	Zhou, Q; Li, ZL				Zhou, Qi; Li, Zhilin			A comparative study of various strategies to concatenate road segments into strokes for map generalization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						road network; road segment; stroke; chi-square test; Marascuilo procedure	NETWORK; MODEL	The study of road networks has been a topic of interest for some time. A road network in a database is often represented by intersections and segments. However, in many cases (e. g., traffic flow analysis and map generalization), one needs to consider individual roads as a whole, instead of individual segments. Thus, it is sometimes very desirable to concatenate road segments into long lines - 'strokes' as they are called in the literature. For stroke building, a number of strategies are available and the effectiveness of using these strategies needs to be evaluated. This article presents a comparative analysis of 17 such strategies, including 3 of the geometric approach, 1 of the thematic approach, and 13 of the hybrid approach for road network generalization purposes. Three sets of real-life data with different patterns are used to test these strategies. Corresponding road maps at smaller scales are used as benchmarks and a new measure called the accuracy rate is proposed to indicate the correctness of the concatenated strokes. The results show that if only the geometric approach is considered, the every-best-fit strategy performs best; if thematic attributes are also added, road class can be more effective than road name. Also significance tests (the chi-square test and the Marascuilo procedure) are carried out to give all pairwise comparisons of these strategies. The results indicate that 45 of the 136 pairs of strategies have statistically significant differences; the purely geometry-based every-best-fit performs significantly better than the purely geometry-based self-fit; and the inclusion of thematic attributes, especially road class, sometimes improves the accuracy rate but the improvement is not significant.

By classifying drivers into aggressive, conservative, and normal groups based on their responses (i.e., stop or pass) and the distances to the stop line when the signal turns yellow, the statistical tests with the ordered probit model clearly indicate some critical variables and their impacts on a driver's decision at intersections. Such variables include average traffic flow speeds, traffic volume rate, the green split, the number of through and crossing lanes in the target approach, signal coordination, the difference between a vehicle's approaching speed and the average traffic flow speeds, a driver's gender and age, talking over a cell phone or not, a vehicle's type and model, and so on. The research findings for this study offer the basis for responsible agencies to identify underlying factors contributing to aggressive maneuvers at signalized intersections which often cause traffic crashes, and to develop improvement strategies, such as customized driver education and intelligent safety protection systems.

The scheme needs only an estimate of the upper boundary of the maximum of absolute eigenvalues. It is based on incorporating an improved fifth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction with relaxation approximation. The scheme benefits from the simplicity of relaxed schemes in that it requires no exact or approximate Riemann solvers and no projection along characteristic directions. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated in several numerical examples.

To detect incidents or disturbances in traffic flow it is necessary to reliably track vehicles in real-time. The tracking is a challenging task due to poor lighting conditions in tunnels and frequent light reflections from tunnel walls, the road and the vehicles themselves. In this paper we propose a multi-clue tracking approach combining foreground blobs, optical flow of Shi-Tomasi features and image projection profiles in a Kalman filter with a constant velocity model. The main novelty of our approach lies in using vertical and horizontal image projection profiles (so-called vehicle signatures) as additional measurements to overcome the problems of inconsistent foreground and optical flow clues in cases of severe lighting changes. These signatures consist of Radon-transform like projections along each image column and row. We compare the signatures from two successive video frames to align them and to correct the predicted vehicle position and size. We tested our approach on a real tunnel video sequence. The results show an improvement in the accuracy of the tracker and less target losses when image projection clues are used. Furthermore, calculation and comparison of image projections is computationally efficient so the tracker keeps real-time performance (25 fps, on a single 1.86 GHz processor).

To cover a large and versatile amount of real world data for calibration and validation processes this paper proposes semi-automated data acquisition by video analysis. This work concentrates mainly on the aspects of a automatic annotation tool applied to create trajectories of traffic participants over space and time. The acquired data is analyzed with a view towards calibrating vehicle models, which navigate through a road's surface and interact with the environment. The applied vehicle tracking algorithms for automated data extraction provide many trajectories not applicable for model calibration. Therefore, we applied an additional automated processing step to filter out faulty trajectories. With this process chain, the trajectory data can be extracted from videos automatically in a quality sufficient for the model calibration of speeds, the lateral positioning and vehicle interactions in a mixed traffic environment.

This paper presents a carbonfootprint/fuel-consumption-aware variable-speed limit (FC-VSL) traffic control scheme that targets minimizing the average vehicular fuel consumption on freeways under live traffic conditions. We first formulated the problem of minimizing fuel consumption for a single vehicle under certain traffic conditions as an optimal control problem. By solving the problem, we obtained the optimal vehicular trajectory, which results in minimum fuel consumption. Then, we designed the FC-VSL scheme based on the optimal trajectory. We evaluated the performance of the FC-VSL scheme through detailed simulation. The results show that the FC-VSL scheme can significantly reduce the average fuel consumption and outperform another speed limit scheme that was designed to smooth traffic flow without considering fuel consumption.

The model for multi traffic states is proposed by integrating the spatial and the temporal distribution characteristics of traffic flow parameters under free traffic, congested traffic and jam traffic respectively. Based on the classical traffic flow conservation equation, the ideology of spatial and temporal dispersions in partial differential equations is adopted to establish short-time traffic flow prediction model. Meanwhile, the impact factors, such as on and off ramp, lane change and road slope are considered, which convertes short-term traffic flow prediction model into short-time traffic flow prediction state space model. Finally, the short-term traffic flow prediction for multi traffic states on urban expressway network is realized. The empirical research shows that compared with the classic ARMA model, the proposed method can not only realize short-term traffic flow prediction for multi traffic states on urban expressway network but also achieve an accuracy of 90.23%. In the same condition, the accuracy of ARMA model is 81%.

J	Mei, ZY; Chen, J				Mei, Zhenyu; Chen, Jun			Modified Motor Vehicles Travel Speed Models on the Basis of Curb Parking Setting under Mixed Traffic Flow	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article								The ongoing controversy about in what condition should we set the curb parking has few definitive answers because comprehensive research in this area has been lacking. Our goal is to present a set of heuristic urban street speed functions under mixed traffic flow by taking into account impacts of curb parking. Two impacts have been defined to classify and quantify the phenomena of motor vehicles' speed dynamics in terms of curb parking. The first impact is called Space impact, which is caused by the curb parking types. The other one is the Time impact, which results from the driver maneuvering in or out of parking space. In this paper, based on the empirical data collected from six typical urban streets in Nanjing, China, two models have been proposed to describe these phenomena for one-way traffic and two-way traffic, respectively. An intensive experiment has been conducted in order to calibrate and validate these proposed models, by taking into account the complexity of the model parameters. We also provide guidelines in terms of how to cluster and calculate those models' parameters. Results from these models demonstrated promising performance of modeling motor vehicles' speed for mixed traffic flow under the influence of curb parking.

J	Chung, Y				Chung, Younshik			Assessment of non-recurrent congestion caused by precipitation using archived weather and traffic flow data	TRANSPORT POLICY			English	Article						Snowfall; Rainfall; Non-recurrent congestion; Quantifying congestion; Road weather information systems (RWIS); Archived traffic flow data		Since precipitation has a negative impact on traffic congestion, there have been various studies for modeling the relationship between precipitation and its impact on traffic flow. However, due to limitations on existing data, none of the previous studies have accounted for the estimation of the total delay caused by precipitation. The objective of this study is to estimate the non-recurrent traffic congestion on freeways caused by precipitation. To accomplish this objective, archived weather and traffic data for the year 2008 from the Korean Freeway Systems was collected and analyzed. As a result, non-recurrent traffic congestion was about 1.6 million vehicle-hours due to rainfall and 186,000 vehicle-hours due to snowfall in 2008. In addition, simple analyses were performed to describe the average non-recurrent traffic congestion per unit distance as a function of precipitation and a function of the time period of precipitation. Although precipitation events might not be handled by human efforts, these results will assist in making strategic plans such as active speed management and contingency planning for mitigating traffic congestion due to precipitation.

J	Li, BB				Li, Baibing			Recursive estimation of average vehicle time headway using single inductive loop detector data	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Bayesian analysis; Microscopic flow characteristic; Recursive estimation; Single loop detector; Vehicle time headway	TRAVEL-TIME; SPEED; MODEL	Vehicle time headway is an important traffic parameter. It affects roadway safety, capacity, and level of service. Single inductive loop detectors are widely deployed in road networks, supplying a wealth of information on the current status of traffic flow. In this paper, we perform Bayesian analysis to online estimate average vehicle time headway using the data collected from a single inductive loop detector. We consider three different scenarios, i.e. light, congested, and disturbed traffic conditions, and have developed a set of unified recursive estimation equations that can be applied to all three scenarios. The computational overhead of updating the estimate is kept to a minimum. The developed recursive method provides an efficient way for the online monitoring of roadway safety and level of service. The method is illustrated using a simulation study and real traffic data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Du, LL; Peeta, S; Kim, YH				Du, Lili; Peeta, Srinivas; Kim, Yong Hoon			An adaptive information fusion model to predict the short-term link travel time distribution in dynamic traffic networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Information fusion model; Short-term link travel time distribution; Mathematical programming	REAL-TIME; CONCAVE MINIMIZATION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; RELIABILITY; ALGORITHM	As intelligent transportation systems (ITS) approach the realm of widespread deployment, there is an increasing need to robustly capture the variability of link travel time in real-time to generate reliable predictions of real-time traffic conditions. This study proposes an adaptive information fusion model to predict the short-term link travel time distribution by iteratively combining past information on link travel time on the current day with the real-time link travel time information available at discrete time points. The past link travel time information is represented as a discrete distribution. The real-time link travel time is represented as a range, and is characterized using information quality in terms of information accuracy and time delay. A nonlinear programming formulation is used to specify the adaptive information fusion model to update the short-term link travel time distribution by focusing on information quality. The model adapts good information by weighing it higher while shielding the effects of bad information by reducing its weight. Numerical experiments suggest that the proposed model adequately represents the short-term link travel time distribution in terms of accuracy and robustness, while ensuring consistency with ambient traffic flow conditions. Further, they illustrate that the mean of a representative short-term travel time distribution is not necessarily a good tracking indicator of the actual (ground truth) time-dependent travel time on that link. Parametric sensitivity analysis illustrates that information accuracy significantly influences the model, and dominates the effects of time delay and the consistency constraint parameter. The proposed information fusion model bridges key methodological gaps in the ITS deployment context related to information fusion and the need for short-term travel time distributions.

J	Matas, A; Raymond, JL; Ruiz, A				Matas, Anna; Raymond, Josep-Lluis; Ruiz, Adriana			Traffic forecasts under uncertainty and capacity constraints	TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						Traffic forecast; Uncertainty; Toll motorways		Traffic forecasts provide essential input for the appraisal of transport investment projects. However, according to recent empirical evidence, long-term predictions are subject to high levels of uncertainty. This article quantifies uncertainty in traffic forecasts for the tolled motorway network in Spain. Uncertainty is quantified in the form of a confidence interval for the traffic forecast that includes both model uncertainty and input uncertainty. We apply a stochastic simulation process based on bootstrapping techniques. Furthermore, the article proposes a new methodology to account for capacity constraints in long-term traffic forecasts. Specifically, we suggest a dynamic model in which the speed of adjustment is related to the ratio between the actual traffic flow and the maximum capacity of the motorway. As an illustrative example, this methodology is applied to a specific public policy that consists of suppressing the toll on a certain motorway section before the concession expires.

Its evolution began with simple modeling of traffic flows without. Today, four types of road traffic simulations depending on the level of detail are commonly used the macroscopic, mesoscopic, microscopic, and nanoscopic simulations. Since the detailed simulations are more time-demanding, it is also possible to utilize a hybrid simulation, which represents various parts of the simulated area at different level of detail. In this paper, we present the design of a hybrid simulator for urban traffic, which uses a nanoscopic simulation for the crossroads and a microscopic simulation for the lanes between the crossroads.

In addition, a signal control strategy on side road is proposed and discussed. Our research is based on traffic simulation software (VISSIM). In this research, the characteristics to describe traffic features include average travelling speed and density. Specifically, we simulate 5 scenarios with different on-ramp and off-ramp distances from 200m to 600m and analyze features of traffic flow and their relations with the distance. When the distance decreases to 200m, traffic states deteriorate significantly. Therefore, the scenario with the distance of 200m is focused, and a signal control strategy on side road is used to alleviate congestions on side roads and expressways. After simulation with the strategy, comparisons and analyses are also given in this paper.

Coherent-moving state, among these states, was firstly proposed in Helbing's paper [1] to discuss the hypothetical steady states in mixed traffic flow in highway traffic. Since then, possible explanations on existence, stability and transition of coherent-moving state have been proposed in other research. In the paper, fast simulation and scenario reproduction in cellular automaton model are taken to test and verify those assumptions. A two-lane highway scenario with variety of vehicle parameters is built to reproduce the situation where coherent-moving phenomenon is likely to occur. At last, according to the simulation results, we bring forward our explanations on coherent-moving state which may be helpful on further study.

Reducing congestion at uphill freeway sections by means of a Gradient Compensation System	2012 IEEE INTELLIGENT VEHICLES SYMPOSIUM (IV)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)	JUN 03-07, 2012	Alcala de Henares, SPAIN	IEEE				Uphill sections have often been identified as capacity bottlenecks in freeway networks. One of the main reasons seems to be that drivers reduce speed when they reach the beginning of an uphill section. With high traffic demand, the deceleration of the first vehicle of a platoon can generate a flow disturbance that amplifies as it propagates upstream, triggering the formation of a traffic jam. This paper presents a proof of concept by exploring whether equipping the leader of a platoon with an in-vehicle Gradient Compensation System (GCS) can improve traffic flow efficiency on uphill sections. The GCS assists the driver in performing the longitudinal driving task at uphill sections. We present the results of a series of traffic simulation experiments in which a platoon of vehicles drive on a single-lane freeway stretch containing an uphill section. The phenomenon of speed reduction is modeled by means of a sub-microscopic traffic simulation program. The results show that if the platoon leader is not equipped with the GCS, its speed drop at the beginning of the uphill section can cause a traffic breakdown, as observed in reality. However, if the platoon leader is equipped with the GCS, the magnitude of the speed drop is reduced, preventing congestion formation.

This not only impacts the productivity of the population but also poses a safety risk. Most of the technologies for intelligent highways focus on safety measures and increased driver awareness, and expect a centralized management for the traffic flow. This paper presents a new approach for enabling autonomous and adaptive traffic management through vehicular networks. By allowing data exchange between vehicles about route choices, congestions and traffic alerts, a vehicle makes a decision on the best course of action. Unlike centralized schemes that provide recommendations, our VANET-based Autonomous Management (VAM) approach factors in the destination and routes of nearby vehicles in deciding on whether rerouting is advisable. In addition, VAM leverages the presence of smart traffic lights and enables coordination between vehicles and light-controllers in order to ease congestion. The collective effect of all vehicles will be an autonomous reshape of the traffic pattern based on their destinations and road conditions. The simulation results demonstrate the advantage of VAM.

However, in large-scale urban transportation systems, traditional centralized coordination methods suffer bottlenecks in both communication and computation. It is hard to make decentralized control with very limited observation to the whole network or avoid conflict traffic flows within a complex intersection. In this paper, we proposed a novel decentralized, multi-agent based schema for massive traffic lights coordination to promote the green-waved effect. In additional, we use constraint optimization agents within a local intersection to efficiently search for joint activities of the lights. This paper also builds a heuristic algorithm to solve the scalable coordination problem and with our massive urban transportation simulator, we have proved the feasibility of our approach.

Nevertheless, calibration (and validation) of microscopic sub-models such as car-following and gap-acceptance models is still a recent matter. The objective of the calibration is to adapt the simulation output to empirical data by adjusting the model's parameters. However, simulation results may vary from the underlying real-world data, despite the calibration. To analyze these deviations the present paper compares two different approaches of calibration using data from a single-lane car-following experiment on a Japanese test track. It is demonstrated that the results of the two methods differ significantly. A recommendation for the more appropriate method to use is given.

Eco-consciousness would be changed by influence of other people. Therefore, the multi-agent transport simulation model with social network in small world is developed to describe the interaction of eco-consciousness for modal shift in the study. The developed simulator consists of four interactive procedures such as the agent travel behavior model, the traffic environment model, the agent eco-consciousness alteration model and the agent eco-consciousness interaction model. The commuting mode choice is described in the agent travel behavior model. On the other hand, the carbon dioxide emission from the traffic flow on urban network is estimated in traffic environment model. Moreover, the agent updates the eco-consciousness according to the evaluation of traffic environment in the agent eco-consciousness alteration model. Furthermore, the ecoconsciousness of the agent is influenced by the related agents in the agent eco-consciousness interaction model. Particularly, the relation between agents is defined based on the small world network by reference to the Watts and Strogatz model.

Nevertheless, there is not much research literature specific to these categories of roads. Hence, this work aims to model traffic flow on Indian Expressways by evaluating Passenger Car Unit (PCU) or Passenger Car Equivalents (PCE) of different vehicle categories at different volume levels in a level terrain using the micro-simulation model, VISSIM. This work also aims to evaluate capacity of expressways and to study the effect of vehicle composition on PCU values. It has been found that PCU decreases with increase in volume-capacity ratio irrespective of vehicle category. The study also revealed that at a given volume level, the PCU of a given vehicle category decreases when its own proportion in the stream increases. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Agogino, AK; Tumer, K				Agogino, Adrian K.; Tumer, Kagan			A multiagent approach to managing air traffic flow	AUTONOMOUS AGENTS AND MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Air traffic control; Multiagent learning; Agent coordination	CONFLICT-RESOLUTION; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; MODEL; OPTIMIZATION	Intelligent air traffic flow management is one of the fundamental challenges facing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) today. FAA estimates put weather, routing decisions and airport condition induced delays at 1,682,700 h in 2007 (FAA OPSNET Data, US Department of Transportation website, http://www.faa.gov/data_statistics/), resulting in a staggering economic loss of over $41 billion (Joint Economic Commission Majority Staff, Your flight has been delayed again, 2008). New solutions to the flow management are needed to accommodate the threefold increase in air traffic anticipated over the next two decades. Indeed, this is a complex problem where the interactions of changing conditions (e.g., weather), conflicting priorities (e.g., different airlines), limited resources (e.g., air traffic controllers) and heavy volume (e.g., over 40,000 flights over the US airspace) demand an adaptive and robust solution. In this paper we explore a multiagent algorithm where agents use reinforcement learning (RL) to reduce congestion through local actions. Each agent is associated with a fix (a specific location in 2D space) and has one of three actions: setting separation between airplanes, ordering ground delays or performing reroutes. We simulate air traffic using FACET which is an air traffic flow simulator developed at NASA and used extensively by the FAA and industry. Our FACET simulations on both artificial and real historical data from the Chicago and New York airspaces show that agents receiving personalized rewards reduce congestion by up to 80% over agents receiving a global reward and by up to 90% over a current industry approach (Monte Carlo estimation).

Traffic Load Models for Long Span Bridges	BRIDGE MAINTENANCE, SAFETY, MANAGEMENT, RESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Bridge Maintenance, Safety and Management (IABMAS)	JUL 08-12, 2012	Stresa, ITALY	Int Assoc Bridge Maintenance & Safety, Politecnico Milano				This paper contributes to the development of traffic load models for long-span bridges through the application of micro-simulation modelling. The latter is used to simulate traffic flow conditions and the effects of vehicle interactions, taking account of driver behaviour. Traffic load on a bridge is considered as a multi-vehicle system where each vehicle is an agent with its own set of driver behaviour characteristics, such as acceleration/deceleration and lane changing. Real traffic observations and weigh-in-motion data were used in this study to develop traffic micro-simulation models, taking account of driver behaviour as traffic changes from free-flowing to congested. The movement of the recorded vehicles over the bridge model generates a history of traffic load effects, which is used to perform the probabilistic assessment of a structure. The extrapolation of the extremes of these effects is incorporated through standard extreme value theory.	[Hayrapetova, A. A.; O'Connor, A. J.; OBrien, E.

Integrated Bridge Management from 3D-Model to Network Level	BRIDGE MAINTENANCE, SAFETY, MANAGEMENT, RESILIENCE AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Bridge Maintenance, Safety and Management (IABMAS)	JUL 08-12, 2012	Stresa, ITALY	Int Assoc Bridge Maintenance & Safety, Politecnico Milano			LIFE-CYCLE MANAGEMENT	In bridge management, namely in complex networks like e. g. in urban areas, it is of equal importance to consider the condition of the individual building as well as the effects of maintenance measures on network level. In this paper we introduce a concept to integrate a 3D-model based management of single bridges with a maintenance schedule optimization on network level. The use of 3D-models in building management has some advantages to the mere textual based approach used in most common management systems: The orientation of building inspectors and maintenance planning engineers at navigation through the data is facilitated; the possibility of misplacements and misinterpretation of data is reduced, as all data is attached directly to a 3D representation of the building. Further the current condition (gained from inspection data), as well as prognoses for the future condition trends can be visualized on this 3D-model thus helping to identify weak points in the construction to be subject of special attention in later inspections. The condition prognosis obtained on building level is input data for finding an ideal schedule of maintenance on network level. This schedule is not only subject to the wish to keep all bridges in the network under good condition and therefore safe, but also to some additional considerations by the building manger: For example, the manager may have a limited budget for maintenance measures each year or may want to steady the amount of money spent on maintenance over the years. It may also be of interest to plan maintenance and thus involved (partial) road closures in such a way, that the impact on traffic flow is as low as possible. Additionally, there may be synergies with maintenance measures by other parties, e. g. streetcar operators, which should also be considered. All these considerations make the task of finding a good schedule a constrained multi-objective optimization problem which we solve using advanced heuristic approaches (e. g. ant colony optimization) which are presented in the paper.

J	Gupta, AK; Sharma, S				Gupta, Arvind Kumar; Sharma, Sapna			Analysis of the wave properties of a new two-lane continuum model with the coupling effect	CHINESE PHYSICS B			English	Article						two-lane traffic; numerical simulation; lane usage inversion	TRAFFIC FLOW; STRUCTURAL-PROPERTIES; SHOCK-WAVES; SPEED; FREEWAYS	A multilane extension of the single-lane anisotropic continuum model (GK model) developed by Gupta and Katiyar for traffic flow is discussed with the consideration of the coupling effect between the vehicles of different lanes in the instantaneous traffic situation and the lane-changing effect. The conditions for securing the linear stability of the new model are presented. The shock and the rarefaction waves, the local cluster effect and the phase transition are investigated through simulation experiments with the new model and are found to be consistent with the diverse nonlinear dynamical phenomena observed in a real traffic flow. The analysis also focuses on empirically observed two-lane phenomena, such as lane usage inversion and the density dependence of the number of lane changes. It is shown that single-lane dynamics can be extended to multilane cases without changing the basic properties of the single-lane model. The results show that the new multilane model is capable of explaining some particular traffic phenomena and is in accordance with real traffic flow.

J	Li, CX; Shimamoto, S				Li, Chunxiao; Shimamoto, Shigeru			An Open Traffic Light Control Model for Reducing Vehicles' CO2 Emissions Based on ETC Vehicles	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Branch and bound (BB); CO2 emission; electronic toll collection (ETC); real-time traffic light control; speed control; three-tier open model	SYSTEM; SPEED	Usually, vehicles' stop-and-go driving will consume more fuel and emit more CO2 than constant speed driving. To reduce vehicles' CO2 emissions, vehicles' travel should be smoothed by reducing the stop-and-go times. In this paper, a three-tier structure is proposed to realize dynamic traffic light control for smoothing vehicles' travel. In tier-1, an electronic toll collection (ETC) system is employed for collecting road traffic flow data and calculating the recommended speed. In tier-2, radio antennas are installed near the traffic lights. Road traffic flow information can be obtained by wireless communication between the antennas and ETC devices. In tier-3, a branch-and-bound-based real-time traffic light control algorithm is designed to smooth vehicles' travels. After smoothing vehicles' travels, more vehicles can pass intersections with less waiting time and fewer short-time stops; therefore, the vehicles' CO2 emissions can be reduced. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme performs much better than the adaptive fuzzy traffic light control method: The average waiting time, short-time stop times, and CO2 emissions are greatly reduced, and the nonstop passing rate is greatly improved.

Modeling the Effects of Weather and Traffic on the Risk of Secondary Incidents	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Secondary Incidents; Traffic Flow; Rainfall; Neural Networks; Logit; Mutual Information; Partial Derivatives	NEURAL-NETWORKS; VARIABLE INFLUENCE; PATTERNS; TRACKING	To extract useful information on variables that are associated with secondary accident likelihood, this article develops neural network models with enhanced explanatory power. Traffic and weather conditions at the occurrence of a primary incident are explicitly considered. Two measures to extract variable significance are introduced: mutual information and partial derivatives. The proposed approach is also compared to other classical statistical approaches of the Logit family. Results suggest that traffic speed, duration of the primary accident, hourly volume, rainfall intensity, and number of vehicles involved in the primary accident are the top five factors associated with secondary accident likelihood. However, changes in traffic speed and volume, number of vehicles involved, blocked lanes, and percentage of trucks and upstream geometry also significantly influence the probability of having a secondary incident. Finally, the incident management implications of the proposed modeling approach are discussed.

The minimizing total travel time of vehicle in the road network was taken as control target, and the dynamic path model was built. The ant colony algorithm was used to find out the optimum path from start point to destination by collecting the real-time traffic information of the road network. Then using the theory of group decision making, the dynamic path optimization method was put forward. In this method, the two parameters of distance between adjacent intersections and section traffic flow saturation which have influence on the control target was considered, and they were combined with ant colony algorithm, and the optimal path was gotten through the group decision making for different results of the algorithm, and the realization of the optimization method was given. The dynamic path optimization process of regional network was described by programming with Matlab through a simulation example. The results show that the new method in this paper had better control effect compared with other methods.

Pedestrian Simulation for Urban Traffic Scenarios	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2012 SUMMER COMPUTER SIMULATION CONFERENCE (SCSC '12)	Proceedings of the Summer Computer Simulation Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	44th Summer Computer Simulation Conference as Part of SummerSim Multiconference	JUL 08-11, 2012	Genoa, ITALY			Pedestrian Simulation; Traffic Simulation; Urban Scenarios; GIS		Simulations are widely used for modeling, analysis, planning, and optimization of traffic flows and phenomena. Every human moving in a city participates at least to some extent as a pedestrian in urban traffic. Nevertheless, pedestrians usually are not part of traffic simulations. This work presents a model for pedestrian movement, taking into account interactions with other road users and among pedestrians on pedestrian crossings. The components of the model are evaluated separately and in a city scenario with an accumulated road length of about 550km. Experimental results indicate an influence of pedestrians on urban traffic. This leads to the finding, that the consideration of pedestrians in urban traffic simulation may lead to a gain of knowledge.

Traffic simulation methods have emerged with the aim to evaluate traffic congestion and improve road safety. However, assessment of traffic safety and congestion requires significant amount of data which in most cases is not available. This work illustrates an approach that aims to alleviate this problem through the integration of two mature technologies namely, simulation-based Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) and Bayesian Belief Networks (BN). The former generates traffic flow data, utilised by a BN model that quantifies accident risk. Traffic flow data is used to assess the accident risk index per road section and hence, escape from the limitation of traditional approaches that use only accident frequencies to quantify accident risk. The development of the BN model combines historical accident records obtained from the Cyprus police and data generated from the DTA simulation	[Gregoriades, Andreas; Katzis, Konstantinos] European Univ Cyprus, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Mouskos, Kyriacos] Cyprus Transport & Logist Ltd, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Michail, Harris] Cyprus Univ Technol, Dept Elect Engn & Informat Technol, Nicosia, Cyprus	Gregoriades, A (corresponding author), European Univ Cyprus, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Nicosia, Cyprus.

An interval type-2 fuzzy logic system is designed to evaluate the randomization parameter of a vehicle based on the spatial headway and speed difference. Some basic qualitative results and the fundamental diagram of our new model are got through computer numerical simulations. The experimental results show that our new model is able to reproduce some of the real macroscopic traffic characteristics such as stop-and-go waves, hysteresis and metastability phenomena.

One way is to adopt a fully Networked Vehicle System (NVS), where the information is exchanged and control is applied to ensure smooth traffic flow. We propose to use discrete event/hybrid system theory to model and control such an NVS in a hierarchical and distributed fashion. Control is achieved at three levels: vehicle level, infrastructure level, and system level, by vehicle supervisors, infrastructure supervisors, and master supervisors, respectively. At the vehicle level, vehicles are modeled as hybrid machines, where both continuous variables and discrete events are considered. At infrastructure and system levels, all vehicles are modeled as finite state machines with parameters, which can be viewed as abstractions of hybrid machines. Control at each level has its own control objectives and is implemented in a distributed fashion.

An improve ChSch model base on cellular automaton is constructed in order to conform to the actual situation of traffic. The simulation results show that big intersection is the main bottleneck and the synchronous and fixed traffic signal makes the road in serious congestion when car flow is large. This paper presents an adaptive fuzzy neural network to control semaphores method is used to improve road congestion. Based on fuzzy neural network method, we use RBF neural network as fuzzy rules for learning network, the control signal is improved, and the results show that the two level fuzzy neural network control of traffic flow of the city's main thoroughfares are obviously improved, road more clear.

First, the freeway traffic model is built which is nonlinear in nature and can be linearized to a universal model with error correction. The control objective is to maintain the freeway operated at a desired traffic density. Then, an improved PSO algorithm is presented which has high speed convergence and can overcome the problem of being trapped in local optimum. The unknown parameters in the controller are optimized by the IPSO and the range of the particles can be given by analyzing the convergence of the controller. Finally, a simulation example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Pounding usually causes damage to bridge decks. Such damage might result in complete or partial closure of the bridge, which might have significant impacts on post-earthquake rescue and recovery, and subsequently resulting in possible life and economy losses. To mitigate seismic pounding damage of bridges, intensive researches have been conducted. These include experimental tests and numerical simulations. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review in this field, discusses the pros and cons of each approach and its limitation, and the current research and challenges.

The usage of Multi Criteria Analysis (McA) is a pertinent tool in decision making when some of specific objectives are imperative to achieve. Besides, the road infrastructure is very important for the system of civil protection and defence for all countries. This work shows the methodology for definition of criteria and determination of weight for each criterion. The following six main criteria are assessed: traffic flow, impact of spatial plan, civil engineering criteria, economical and financial criteria, environmental criteria, criteria for defence and system of civil protection. More specific sub criteria are defined in each group of main criteria. The questionnaire with a list of main and specific criteria is sent to several institutions and experts in the country to give their opinion thereon, or to estimate each main criterion (first step of weighting) as well as to assess each sub criterion (second step of weighting). The results of the survey concerning measurement of the importance of each criterion are used to develop Multi Criteria Analysis. The assessment of three variants of road infrastructure is calculated through three methods of MCA: Sum Weight Method (swm), Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and ELECTRE.

The usage of Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) is a pertinent tool in decision making when some of specific objectives are imperative to achieve. Besides, the road infrastructure is very important for the system of civil protection and defence for all countries. This work shows the methodology for definition of criteria and determination of weight for each criterion. The following six main criteria are assessed: traffic flow, impact of spatial plan, civil engineering criteria, economical and financial criteria, environmental criteria, criteria for defence and system of civil protection. More specific sub criteria are defined in each group of main criteria. The questionnaire with a list of main and specific criteria is sent to several institutions and experts in the country to give their opinion thereon, or to estimate each main criterion (first step of weighting) as well as to assess each sub criterion (second step of weighting). The results of the survey concerning measurement of the importance of each criterion are used to develop Multi Criteria Analysis. The assessment of three variants of road infrastructure is calculated through three methods of MCA: Sum Weight Method (swm), Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and ELECTRE. The comparison and recommendation for usage of MCA and choice of the calculation method is also provided in this work.

This is especially true when modeling noise at rounda-bouts, where temporal and spatial variations in vehicle kinematics can cause different noise levels than free flow traffic on open road segments. Depending on the way noise prediction models account for traffic flow, these dynamic effects are more or less accurately captured. In this paper, a case study is presented, consisting of a road traffic noise level analysis in the vicinity of three suburban roundabouts in the City of Zagreb. Noise calculations were conducted by means of specialized noise prediction software using static and analytic noise models (modified RLS 90 and European interim method). Accuracy of the obtained noise contour maps was demonstrated by comparing the simulated and the observed noise levels at three receiver points along every roundabout. The aim of this research is to establish the level of reliability of applied noise models and to determine whether they can be used in road traffic noise prediction for suburban roundabouts in Croatia.

Traffic is inevitable in order to guarantee people's accessibility to various types of functions. On the other hand, traffic noise, traffic emissions, road safety, threatens people health and well being. Because quality of life is more and more under pressure, because of the increasing traffic flow, traffic livability has become a key issue in nowadays' (Flemish) traffic planning. Therefore, it is remarkable that little research has been done about assessing the total impact of traffic on the quality of life of the surrounding areas. Methods that are currently commonly used in Flanders have some important restrictions; the most crucial one is that the impact of traffic is considered to be very local. This is remarkable because people's quality of life depends on the whole living environment, covering a wider area. For this reason, a project was set up by the Flemish Policy Research Centre Mobility & Public Works in order to develop a model to give a better representation of the impact of traffic on quality of life. The main focus was to achieve a better simulation of people's exposure to different types of traffic impacts by including not only the exposure at the home address, but also the impacts during activities at other locations and the impacts during trips.

The object of the present study is made by a series of junctions situated on National Road 1 in Busteni town, on a dangerous road sector. For this study, traffic measurements, simulations and suggestions for improving the existing situation were made. Based on the simulated traffic flows, there were performed capacity analysis with PTV Vissim and Traficware Synchro softwares, and were developed appropriate planning solutions for the intersections, resulting in tables with extracted performance indicators based on micro simulation of the traffic values. Also planning solutions for horizontal design and proposals for traffic lights were made for junctions that can not operate under priority traffic on one direction or which are presenting traffic safety risk. Based on the traffic data, it was taken in consideration the necessity to make planning proposals and to develop design solutions immediately applicable, with minimum intervention. Solutions will refer to the geometric planning of the intersections, but with new plans and timings for traffic lights, including proposals for new equipment; regulating the traffic flow: development/ refurbishment of intersections and pedestrian crossings; optimization of routing programs in order to achieve a higher level of service and more efficient traffic control indicators; segregation of pedestrian movements by vehicles traffic, implementation of physical devices to lock/ channel the traffic.

The use of micro-simulation for congested traffic load modeling of medium- and long-span bridges	STRUCTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article						micro-simulation; traffic load; bridge; loading; long; span		This paper presents a new approach to the modeling of congested traffic loading events on long span bridges. Conventional traffic load models are based on weigh-in-motion data of non-congested traffic, or something similar to a Poisson Arrival process. In neither case do they account for the mixing between lanes that takes place as traffic becomes congested. It is shown here that cars move out from between trucks as traffic slows down which results in a higher frequency of long platoons of trucks in the slow lane of the bridge. These longer platoons increase some characteristic load effects under the slow lane by a modest but significant amount. Micro-simulation, the process of modeling individual vehicles that is widely used in traffic modeling, is presented here as a means of predicting imposed traffic loading on long-span bridges more accurately. The traffic flow on a congested bridge is modeled using a random mixing process for trucks and cars in each lane, where each vehicle is modeled individually with driver behaviour parameters assigned randomly in a Monte Carlo process. Over a number of simulated kilometres, the vehicles move between lanes in simulated lane-changing manoeuvres. The algorithm was calibrated against video recordings of traffic on a bridge in the Netherlands. Extreme value statistics of measured strains on the bridge are then compared to the corresponding simulation statistics to validate the model. The micro-simulation algorithm shows that the histograms of truck platoon length are moderately affected by lane changing. This in turn is shown to influence some characteristic load effects of the bridge deck.	[OBrien, E.

We set out several different properties that it is generally agreed that flow-density functions should satisfy. We then take the many forms of flow-density functions that have been proposed or used over the past several decades, derive the properties of each one and consider whether, or to what extent, they satisfy each of the desirable properties. We find that few, if any, flow-density functions satisfy all of the desirable properties. The main reasons for this are that, in almost all cases, there are not enough independent parameters in the flow-density functions to capture all of the desirable properties and that, in almost all cases, the flow-density functions are specified as a single analytic function rather than a different function for each range of traffic behaviours, such as free-flow, congested and heavily congested traffic.

Traffic flow data collected at a section of four lane divided highway were used to draw the speed-flow and speed distribution curves. These were used to determine capacity of the highway and speed distribution parameters for the different categories of vehicles plying on the road. VISSIM program was run with the input parameters of speed distributions, traffic composition as observed in the field and with default values of all driver behaviour parameters CC0 to CC9 as provided in the VISSIM. The results showed that VISSIM in its present form is not able to replicate the mixed traffic flow on Indian highways. The standstill distance parameter (CCO) and time headway parameter (CC 1) were changed in step of 0.5 and variation in capacity with CC0 and CC1 is explained in the paper. Finally, it was observed that a value of 0.7 m for CC0 and 1.5 sec for CC1 is optimum to get simulated speed-flow curve and capacity same as obtained from field data.

Without this formula, highway engineers are unable to determine the travel time savings of such projects, and this situation deters a reasonable progress of this great plan. The research carried out a field survey study in mountain tunnels in Seoul to capture the characteristics of tunnel traffic flow and a follow-up study was conducted to calibrate parameter values embedded in the tunnel traffic flow. The Golden Section search method was applied in this regard and the findings revealed that the VDF applicable to the underground tunnel projects could be successfully developed with the use of tunnel flow data. It was also found that although a final calibration based on local traffic conditions would be required, traffic volume levels estimated by the existing VDF and the VDF developed in this study showed a consistent pattern of volume reduction across all the traffic corridors in Seoul's underground tunnel projects, regardless of their traffic volume levels. The research recommends more active research on this topic by other interested cities.

Although the total flows on links of the urban road network are uniquely determined by this principle, multi-class link flows are not. An additional assumption, the condition of proportionality, may be imposed to determine these flows uniquely. This condition was the basis for adding a post-processing adjustment to the software system, Visum. Analyses of class link flows from Visum assignments of cars and trucks to the Chicago regional network, with and without the condition of proportionality, are presented. Differences in class link flows are analyzed in relation to link attributes. The findings offer insights into the role of proportionality in multi-class road traffic assignments at the link level.

Whereas, spatial development frameworks are updated regularly to support and encourage more land development. To assess the possible effects of land development projects on the transportation and traffic system, a Traffic Impact Assessment (TIA), as a traffic engineering planning tool, is commonly used. This study aimed at predicting Peak Hour Factor (PHF) per land-use type and compare with the existing Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) PHF default values in intersection performance analysis. The land-uses selected were hospital, office and industrial developments which share almost the same traffic characteristics. Intersections closer to these land-uses were identified and analyzed leading to the determination of PHF per land-use. Results obtained showed that the traffic flow rate could be adjusted when using HCM default values thus underestimating the measures of effectiveness of a facility.	[Phahlane, M.

J	Zhang, LY; Peng, ZR; Sun, D; Liu, XF				Zhang, Li-Ye; Peng, Zhong-Ren; Sun, Daniel (Jian); Liu, Xiaofeng			Rule-Based Forecasting of Traffic Flow for Large-Scale Road Networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							ROUGH-SET APPROACH; NONPARAMETRIC MODELS; PREDICTION; CLASSIFICATION; REDUCTION	As traffic data collection becomes less costly and more commonplace, large-scale traffic flow forecasting is increasingly needed. This paper proposes a rule-based approach for forecasting traffic flow based on the K nearest neighbor (KNN) nonparametric regression model, the rule-based KNN (RKNN) model. Rules were extracted from the historical data through the use of rough set theory, which found the nearest neighbors. Traffic impact factors, such as weather and time of day, were incorporated into the rules. Every historical record was labeled with a rule. With current data on traffic flow states and traffic flow impact, the nearest neighbors could be found quickly from the historical data records covered by the corresponding rule. An additional methodology was proposed to keep the historical data and the rules up to date. A case study on an Interstate freeway in Virginia, I-395, was conducted to evaluate the performance of the RKNN approach. The results showed that the proposed approach could decrease the mean absolute percentage error by 26.86%. Moreover, the proposed algorithm reduced calculation time by 65.69%, compared with the traditional KNN algorithms. This difference indicates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for use with large urban road networks.

J	Song, S; Yeo, H				Song, Sungjun; Yeo, Hwasoo			Method for Estimating Highway Collision Rate That Considers State of Traffic Flow	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Among traffic-related variables, vehicle speed is thought to be a major one closely related to collision occurrence. This study aimed to develop a methodology to estimate a collision rate that considers the traffic state in a freeway section and focuses on speed variables. To define the traffic condition of a section, four section-based traffic states related to the speed of upstream and downstream locations were used. The collisions were classified into three types (rear-end, sideswipe, and other), and two variables (speed difference between upstream and downstream and average speed of upstream and downstream) were considered as independent for standard linear regression analysis. The findings showed that both speed difference and average speed had an influencing effect on the collision rate for each type of collision and traffic state. Rear-end and sideswipe collisions showed a different collision rate pattern than the others, and the influence of the speed difference between upstream and downstream changed with the traffic state. Through regression analysis, rear-end and sideswipe collision rates were expressed by speed difference while other types of collisions were described by average speed. This research can provide a methodology for understanding the collision potential of a highway as it relates to the traffic state and can be widely used for roadway traffic safety improvement.

In this paper the delay performance of a single-lane roundabout with an adjacent slip lane is modeled with the VISSIM microsimulation tool for three slip lane exit types (free-flow, yield, and stop) and the results are compared with a roundabout having no slip lane. The VISSIM assessment considers four experimental traffic percentage turning volume distributions as balanced flow scenarios (total traffic flow into and out of every roundabout approach is the same). Simulated slip lane right-turning traffic volumes range from 50 to 500 vehicles/h, and the four pedestrian volume levels range from 0 to 100 pedestrians/h. VISSIM results confirm that average delays in a roundabout with a slip lane are a function of circulating conflict volumes and are related exponentially to slip lane volumes regardless of the slip lane exit type. Results also indicate that a free-flow slip lane exit type best reduces total average delay in the roundabout and in the slip lane itself. Yield and stop slip lane exit types also reduce the roundabout total average delay but to a lesser degree. Finally, at a higher traffic volume, a free-flow slip lane exit type can increase round-about delay from 6.6 to 34.7 s/vehicle if drivers must yield the right-of-way to high pedestrian traffic (100 pedestrians/h) crossing a free-flow slip lane (priority rule).

For severe accidents involving violations of laws, the direct economic loss is trivial compared with the indirect economic loss resulting from long hours of congestion and large numbers of affected travelers. Drivers who violate transportation laws should be subject to legal liabilities for both direct and indirect economic losses. To calculate the penalties for violating laws related to traffic accidents, it is important to establish a standard for evaluating the indirect costs of accidents. A general framework for estimating accident-induced indirect costs is proposed. As a key component of the estimation procedures, the delay estimation can be conducted by reconstructing the spatial-temporal traffic flow evolutions on the basis of intelligent transportation system sensors or archived data, or both. The proposed evaluation methodology, which measures on-site arrival-departure cumulative flows and speeds, was compared with the spatial-temporal traffic state evolution approach. As a case study, the proposed approach was applied to two severe traffic accidents that occurred on the G6 Highway (Beijing-Tibet Highway). The promising results verify the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed procedures. The analytic study results also support drafting the related national standard in China.

J	Ngoduy, D				Ngoduy, D.			Application of gas-kinetic theory to modelling mixed traffic of manual and ACC vehicles	TRANSPORTMETRICA			English	Article						gas kinetic theory; linear stability; adaptive cruise control; traffic flow dynamics	FLOW; STABILITY; DERIVATION; SIMULATION	In this article, we propose an extended multiclass gas-kinetic theory applicable to mixed traffic flow of manual and adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles. In the model, the acceleration/deceleration of ACC vehicles is specified explicitly using microscopic models. The macroscopic multiclass traffic equations are obtained from the proposed gas-kinetic model using the well-known method of moments. The influencing conditions to traffic flow stability with respect to a small perturbation are derived by the linear stability method. The analytical results show that ACC vehicles contribute to the improved stabilisation of traffic flow. The numerical simulations of our developed multiclass macroscopic model on a circular freeway support our analytical findings and indicate that increasing the penetration of ACC vehicles results in more stable traffic flow. Simulations of merging flows at an on-ramp in an open freeway are carried out to describe the effects of the penetration of ACC vehicles on the bottleneck capacity. It is found that around 30% ACC vehicles in traffic flow leads to significantly increased capacity and reduced travel time. We argue that, together with other microscopic models, our model provides a wider picture of the effects of ACC vehicles on traffic flow characteristics.

REAL TIME SPEED ESTIMATION FROM MONOCULAR VIDEO	XXII ISPRS CONGRESS, TECHNICAL COMMISSION III	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	22nd Congress of the International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing	AUG 25-SEP 01, 2012	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing, Hexagon, ESRI, RMIT Univ, Sch Math Geospatial Sci		Video images; speed estimation; monocular video; object tracking; optical flow; traffic surveillance	VEHICLES; IMAGES; CAMERA	In this paper, detailed studies have been performed for developing a real time system to be used for surveillance of the traffic flow by using monocular video cameras to find speeds of the vehicles for secure travelling are presented. We assume that the studied road segment is planar and straight, the camera is tilted downward a bridge and the length of one line segment in the image is known. In order to estimate the speed of a moving vehicle from a video camera, rectification of video images is performed to eliminate the perspective effects and then the interest region namely the ROI is determined for tracking the vehicles. Velocity vectors of a sufficient number of reference points are identified on the image of the vehicle from each video frame. For this purpose sufficient number of points from the vehicle is selected, and these points must be accurately tracked on at least two successive video frames. In the second step, by using the displacement vectors of the tracked points and passed time, the velocity vectors of those points are computed. Computed velocity vectors are defined in the video image coordinate system and displacement vectors are measured by the means of pixel units. Then the magnitudes of the computed vectors in the image space are transformed to the object space to find the absolute values of these magnitudes. The accuracy of the estimated speed is approximately +/- 1-2 km/h. In order to solve the real time speed estimation problem, the authors have written a software system in C++ programming language. This software system has been used for all of the computations and test applications.	[Temiz, M.

Both the roads cross at a point and the intersecting roads are cyclic. Each vehicle may pass or occupy the intersection where all the vehicles on both roads are not allowed to turn. Different from Ishibashi and Fukui's studies in which the update is carried out for both roads in turn, the parallel update is proposed and its detailed rules are presented in our model. In this work, the cases of different maximum vehicle velocities on both roads are considered. Based on simulation results and the principle for constructing phase diagrams, phase diagrams are mapped out and their specific flow formulas for all the regions in the phase diagrams are obtained for various vehicle densities, which are seldom done in previous studies. One also finds that the topology of phase diagrams depends on the update rules of eastbound and northbound roads and their maximum velocities of vehicles. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Under the planning paradigm employed in the US, this rationing process occurs independently at each resource. The stochastic integer programming model proposed in this paper brings coordination to this process while considering capacity uncertainty. Results of a case study suggest that the model is tractable, and generates capacity allocations that improve efficiency and enable greater responsiveness to changing capacity conditions.

The performance of the model at street scale is evaluated and the importance of the boundary conditions like wind field and traffic emissions on the UFP concentration is demonstrated. To support and validate the modelled results, a short-term measurement campaign was conducted in a street canyon in Antwerp, Belgium. The UFP concentration was measured simultaneously with P-TRACK (TSI Model 8525) at four different locations in the canyon. The modelled UFP concentrations compare well with the measured data (correlation coefficient R from 0.44 to 0.93) within the standard deviation of the measurements. Despite the moderate traffic flow in the street canyon, UFP concentrations in the canyon are in general double of the background concentrations, indicating the high local contribution for this particle number concentration. Some of the observed concentration profiles are not resembled by the model simulations. For these specific anomalies, further analysis is performed and plausible explanations are put forward. The role of wind direction and traffic emissions is investigated. The performance evaluation of ENVI-met (R) shows that in general the model qualitatively and quantitatively describes the dispersion of UFP in the street canyon study. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In many Chinese cities, the interactions among buses, bicycles and cars bring difficulty to travel time prediction and traffic safety management. The aim of this paper is to develop a new model to estimate car travel time near bus stops in developing countries by data mining techniques and survival analysis methods. The travel time data under mixed traffic conditions are collected by video camera. Four influential factors including car volume, nonmotorized volume, bus departure volume and free ratio of bus stop are chosen by using data mining techniques. A proportional hazard-based duration model is proposed to analyze the factors related to car travel time. The results indicate that mixed traffic flow impacts the car travel time significantly. In addition, various factors can modify the travel time distribution in different degrees and the model can be used to estimate the travel time under assumed conditions. It is hoped to help improve the planning and designing of proper facilities with mixed traffic flow.

The models were developed using the input parameters of driver's age and gender, the use of a seat belt, the type and safety of a vehicle, weather conditions, road surface, speed ratio, crash time, crash type, collision type and traffic flow. The models were constructed based on 1000 of crashes in total that occurred during 2007 on the Tehran-Ghom Freeway due to the fact that the remaining records were not suitable for this study. The GA evaluated eleven equations to obtain the best one. Then, GA and PS methods were combined using the best GA equation. The neural network used multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture that consisted of a multi-layer feed-forward network with hidden sigmoid and linear output neurons that could also fit multi-dimensional mapping problems arbitrarily well. The ANN was applied during training, testing and validation and had 12 inputs, 25 neurons in the hidden layers and 3 neurons in the output layer. The best-fit model was selected according to the R-value, root mean square errors (RMSE), mean absolute errors (MAE) and the sum of square error (SSE). The highest R-value was obtained for the ANN around 0.87, demonstrating that the ANN provided the best prediction. The combination of GA and PS methods allowed for various prediction rankings ranging from linear relationships to complex equations. The advantage of these models is improving themselves adding new data.

The main issue of this study is to assess the driver's behavior at different highway lanes based on a headway distribution analysis. The study was conducted in the city of Isfahan, Iran. Shahid Kharrazi six-lane highway was selected for collecting the field headway data. The under-study lanes consisted of passing and middle lanes. The appropriate models of headway distributions were selected using a methodology based on Chi-Square test for each lane. Using the selected models, the headway distribution diagrams were predicted for high levels of traffic flow in both the passing and middle lanes and the relationship between statistical criteria of the models and the driver's behaviors were analyzed. The results certify that the appropriate model for the passing lane is different than the one for the middle lane. This is because of a different behavioral operation of drivers which is affected by specific conditions of each lane. Through car-following conditions in the passing lane, a large number of drivers adopt unsafe headways. This shows high risk-ability of driver population which led to considerably differences in capacities and statistical distribution models of two lanes.

J	Mhirech, A				Mhirech, Abdelaziz			Traffic flow controlled by synchronized traffic lights in an open and periodic boundaries system	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article							CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; DEPENDENT RANDOMIZATION	The traffic flow controlled by synchronized traffic lights on a single-lane roadway with open and periodic boundaries is studied. This study is based on a modified version of the Nagel and Schreckenberg (NaSch) (J. Phys. I (France), 2, 2221 (1992)) model recently proposed by Zhu et al. (Eur. Phys. J. B, 57, 103 (2007)) in parallel dynamics, which takes into account the sensitivity of drivers and vehicles. Five traffic lights are placed on the road at equal distances and are synchronized with a cycle time T. The density, flow, and (alpha, beta) phase diagrams are established for different values of T, where alpha and beta are the injecting and extracting rates, respectively, of cars in the traffic lane. In the deterministic NaSch model, the presence of signal lights on the road causes early onset of the high-density region. Additionally, it is shown that the low-density region shrinks with an increase in T, when T is less than a certain value. However, the modified NaSch model shows that the low density phase shrinks even more. Finally, in the presence of traffic lights, a comparison is made between the original NaSch model with a constant braking probability and the modified one.

Interactive Hybrid Simulation of Large-Scale Traffic	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON GRAPHICS			English	Article						traffic; road networks; hyberbolic models	MODEL; WAVES	We present a novel, real-time algorithm for modeling large-scale, realistic traffic using a hybrid model of both continuum and agent-based methods for traffic simulation. We simulate individual vehicles in regions of interest using state-of-the-art agent-based models of driver behavior, and use a faster continuum model of traffic flow in the remainder of the road network. Our key contributions are efficient techniques for the dynamic coupling of discrete vehicle simulation with the aggregated behavior of continuum techniques for traffic simulation. We demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of our interactive visual simulation technique on extensive road networks using both real-world traffic data and synthetic scenarios. These techniques demonstrate the applicability of hybrid techniques to the efficient simulation of large-scale flows with complex dynamics.

The single-lane with three sections (downgrade, flat, and upgrade) is taken into account and they are characterized with different velocity limit. At the low density, the traffic current increases linearly with density and saturates at some values of immediately density. As the density increases, the traffic jam appears firstly before the upgrade section and then extends to the downgrade section. Additionally, the relationships of the velocity and headway against position in different densities are obtained from simulation. These results clearly clarify where and when the traffic jam appears. Finally, the critical densities are derived via the theoretical analysis before and after the discontinuous fronts and the theoretical results are consistent with the critical values of simulation results.

Integrated route guidance and ramp metering consistent with drivers' en-route diversion behaviour	IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	17th ITS World Congress	OCT 25-29, 2010	Busan, SOUTH KOREA				VARIABLE MESSAGE SIGNS; REAL-TIME CONTROL; MOTORWAY NETWORKS; TRAFFIC FLOW; BOULEVARD-PERIPHERIQUE; SOUTHERN PART; INFORMATION	The primary focus of this study is to present a new integrated traffic control model for urban freeways using model-based predictive control (MPC) framework, where the effect of traffic information on drivers' en-route diversion behaviour is explicitly modelled using an adaptive constrained Kalman filtering theory. This captures the effect of traffic information on drivers' real-time en-route diversion behaviour, based on on-line traffic surveillance data. The integrated control task is formulated as a dynamic, non-linear, discrete time optimal control problem with constrained control variables. The network traffic flow process is modelled by a dynamic network traffic flow model, which is deterministic, discrete in time and space, macroscopic and suitable for model-based traffic control. Feedback control is realised by solving the optimisation problem for each control interval over a long future-time horizon. Simulation results for a case study show that the proposed integrated MPC model takes in consideration of the time-dependent traffic characteristics and drivers' actual behaviour and can significantly enhance the traffic efficiency and reduce the cost of traffic system by 17.1-30.0%.

Risk Analysis of Safety Service Patrol (SSP) Systems in Virginia	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						Network simulation; safety service patrol; transportation	NETWORK; ALGORITHMS; CAPACITY	The transportation infrastructure is a vital backbone of any regional economy as it supports workforce mobility, tourism, and a host of socioeconomic activities. In this article, we specifically examine the incident management function of the transportation infrastructure. In many metropolitan regions, incident management is handled primarily by safety service patrols (SSPs), which monitor and resolve roadway incidents. In Virginia, SSP allocation across highway networks is based typically on average vehicle speeds and incident volumes. This article implements a probabilistic network model that partitions "business as usual" traffic flow with extreme-event scenarios. Results of simulated network scenarios reveal that flexible SSP configurations can improve incident resolution times relative to predetermined SSP assignments.

J	Meng, Q; Qu, XB; Yong, KT; Wong, YH				Meng, Qiang; Qu, Xiaobo; Yong, Kum Thong; Wong, Yoke Heng			QRA Model-Based Risk Impact Analysis of Traffic Flow in Urban Road Tunnels	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						Impact analysis; quantitative risk assessment model; road tunnel; societal risk; traffic volume	SAFETY; LIFE	Road tunnels are vital infrastructures providing underground vehicular passageways for commuters and motorists. Various quantitative risk assessment (QRA) models have recently been developed and employed to evaluate the safety levels of road tunnels in terms of societal risk (as measured by the F/N curve). For a particular road tunnel, traffic volume and proportion of heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) are two adjustable parameters that may significantly affect the societal risk, and are thus very useful in implementing risk reduction solutions. To evaluate the impact the two contributing factors have on the risk, this article first presents an approach that employs a QRA model to generate societal risk for a series of possible combinations of the two factors. Some combinations may result in F/N curves that do not fulfill a predetermined safety target. This article thus proposes an "excess risk index" in order to quantify the road tunnel risk magnitudes that do not pass the safety target. The two-factor impact analysis can be illustrated by a contour chart based on the excess risk. Finally, the methodology has been applied to Singapore's KPE road tunnel and the results show that in terms of meeting the test safety target for societal risk, the traffic capacity of the tunnel should be no more than 1,200 vehs/h/lane, with a maximum proportion of 18% HGVs.

A shockwave profile model for traffic flow on congested urban arterials	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Shockwave profile model (SPM); Traffic flow theory; Traffic signals; Intersection queue; Oversaturation; Spillover	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; HIGHWAY; WAVES	In this paper a new traffic flow model for congested arterial networks, named shockwave profile model (SPM), is presented. Taking advantage of the fact that traffic states within a congested link can be simplified as free-flow, saturated, and jammed conditions, SPM simulates traffic dynamics by analytically deriving the trajectories of four major shockwaves: queuing, discharge, departure. and compression waves. Unlike conventional macroscopic models, in which space is often discretized into small cells for numerical solutions, SPM treats each homogeneous road segment with constant capacity as a section; and the queuing dynamics within each section are described by tracing the shockwave fronts. SPM is particularly suitable for simulating traffic flow on congested signalized arterials especially with queue spillover problems, where the steady-state periodic pattern of queue build-up and dissipation process may break down. Depending on when and where spillover occurs along a signalized arterial, a large number of queuing patterns may be possible. Therefore it becomes difficult to apply the conventional approach directly to track shockwave fronts. To overcome this difficulty, a novel approach is proposed as part of the SPM, in which queue spillover is treated as either extending a red phase or creating new smaller cycles, so that the analytical solutions for tracing the shockwave fronts can be easily applied. Since only the essential features of arterial traffic flow, i.e., queue build-up and dissipation, are considered, SPM significantly reduces the computational load and improves the numerical efficiency. We further validated SPM using real-world traffic signal data collected from a major arterial in the Twin Cities. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the model. We expect that in the future this model can be applied in a number of real-time applications such as arterial performance prediction and signal optimization. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sheng, N; Tang, UW				Sheng, Ni; Tang, U. Wa			A building-based data capture and data mining technique for air quality assessment	FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING IN CHINA			English	Article						traffic air pollution; spatial distribution; high resolution; geographic information system	ROAD TRAFFIC EMISSIONS; POLLUTION	Recently, a building-based air quality model system which can predict air quality in front of individual buildings along both sides of a road has been developed. Using the Macau Peninsula as a case study, this paper shows the advantages of building-based model system in data capture and data mining. Compared with the traditional grid-based model systems with input/output spatial resolutions of 1-2 km, the building-based approach can extract the street configuration and traffic data building by building and therefore, can capture the complex spatial variation of traffic emission, urban geometry, and air pollution. The non-homogeneous distribution of air pollution in the Macau Peninsula was modeled in a high-spatial resolution of 319 receptors center dot km(-2). The spatial relationship among air quality, traffic flow, and urban geometry in the historic urban area is investigated. The study shows that the building-based approach may open an innovative methodology in data mining of urban spatial data for environmental assessment. The results are particularly useful to urban planners when they need to consider the influences of urban form on street environment.

In this paper, we apply iterative learning control (ILC) to address rampmetering in amacroscopic-level freeway environment. By formulating the original ramp metering problem as an output regulating and disturbance rejection problem, ILC has been applied to control the traffic response. The learning mechanism is further combined with Asservissement Lineaire d'Entree Autoroutiere (ALINEA) in a complementary manner to achieve the desired control performance. The ILC-based rampmetering strategy and the modified modularized ramp metering approach based on ILC and ALINEA in the presence of input constraints are also analyzed to highlight the advantages and the robustness of the proposed methods. Extensive simulations are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

A possible way to deal with this problem is to have transportation authorities distribute traffic information to drivers, which, in turn, can decide (or be aided by a navigator) to route around congested areas. Such traffic information can be gathered by relying on static sensors placed at specific road locations (e.g., induction loops and video cameras) or by having single vehicles report their location, speed, and travel time. While the former approach has been widely exploited, the latter has come about only more recently; consequently, its potential is less understood. For this reason, in this paper, we study a realistic test case that allows the evaluation of the effectiveness of such a solution. As part of this process, (a) we designed a system that allows vehicles to crowd-source traffic information in an ad hoc manner, allowing them to dynamically reroute based on individually collected traffic information; (b) we implemented a realistic network-mobility simulator that allowed us to evaluate such a model; and (c) we performed a case study that evaluates whether such a decentralized system can help drivers to minimize trip times, which is the main focus of this paper. This study is based on traffic survey data from Portland, OR, and our results indicate that such navigation systems can indeed greatly improve traffic flow. Finally, to test the feasibility of our approach, we implemented our system and ran some real experiments at UCLA's C-Vet test bed.

J	Geroliminis, N; Srivastava, A; Michalopoulos, P				Geroliminis, Nikolas; Srivastava, Anupam; Michalopoulos, Panos			A Dynamic-Zone-Based Coordinated Ramp-Metering Algorithm With Queue Constraints for Minnesota's Freeways	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Coordination; queues; ramp metering; traffic congestion; traffic control	TRAFFIC FLOW	Following about 40 years of successful deployment of coordinated traffic-responsive ramp control, a new generation is being developed for Minnesota's freeways based on density measurements, rather than flow rates. This was motivated from recent research indicating that the critical value of density at which capacity is observed is less sensitive and more stable than capacity, thereby allowing the opportunity for more effective control. The main goals of the new approach are to delay the onset of the breakdown and accelerate system recovery when ramp metering is disabled due to the violation of maximum allowable ramp waiting times. This is obtained by a dynamic zone partitioning of the freeway network to identify critical bottleneck locations and coordinated balancing of ramp delays, which aims to avoid mainline breakdown. The effectiveness of the new control strategy is assessed by comparison with the currently deployed version of the stratified zone metering algorithm through microscopic simulation of a real 12-mi 17-ramp freeway section. Simulations show a decrease in delays of mainline and ramp traffic and an improvement of 8% in overall system delays while avoiding maximum ramp delay violations.

Interpolating Sparse GPS Measurements Via Relaxation Labeling and Belief Propagation for the Redeployment of Ambulances	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Belief propagation; interpolation; Global Positioning System; graph theory	SIMULATION	One major challenge for traffic management systems is the inference of traffic flow in regions of the network for which there are little data. In this paper, Global-Positioning-System (GPS)-based vehicle locator data from a fleet of 40-60 roving ambulances are used to predict the most likely ambulance speeds in a network of 20 000 streets in the city of Ottawa, ON, Canada. First, the road network is represented as a directed graph data structure. Then, we compare two algorithms, i.e., relaxation labeling and belief propagation, that interpolate the sparse and noisy measurements from the fleet to obtain dense locally consistent ambulance speeds. Unlike several other systems in the literature, we model all of the city's freeways and surface streets, and both road types are treated with equal importance. Furthermore, the data structure and algorithms described in this paper are not only extended to real-world needs such as road closures and the incorporation of live data with historical data but are also computationally efficient, providing updates in intervals of less than 5 min on commodity hardware.

J	Shende, A; Singh, MP; Kachroo, P				Shende, Apoorva; Singh, Mahendra P.; Kachroo, Pushkin			Optimization-Based Feedback Control for Pedestrian Evacuation From an Exit Corridor	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Conservation of mass; feedback linearization; linear programming; pedestrian evacuation; traffic flow models	COMPUTER-MODEL; FLOW	The evacuation of pedestrians is the most important task when a building is subjected to a significant level of threat that compromises occupant safety. However, very few studies have dealt with the problem of controlling pedestrian evacuation in real time. Due to modern developments in sensor technology and computational facilities, it now seems possible to attempt a real-time controlled evacuation by instructing pedestrians to adjust their velocities according to an algorithm to effect an efficient evacuation. This paper deals with the development of such a control algorithm for an exit corridor where high congestion can be expected during evacuation. To accommodate the possible variation in the pedestrian density along the length, the corridor is divided into several sections. Using the conservation of pedestrian mass, ordinary differential equations that define the pedestrian flow in all sections are developed. For the system of state-space equations that define the flow in all the sections of the corridor, an optimization-based feedback control scheme is developed, which ensures the maximum input discharge subject to tracking the critical state and boundedness of the control variables. Simulation results are obtained, which indicate the superior performance of the controlled flow over the uncontrolled flow. The proposed flow control is also applicable to the regulation of vehicular traffic on a long section of a freeway in urban areas that receives input at several ramps along its length.

A simple local MTFC feedback controller is designed in this paper, taking into account a number of practical requirements and restrictions. The MTFC controller relies only on readily available real-time measurements (no online model usage and no demand predictions are needed) and is therefore robust and suitable for field implementations. The controller is evaluated in simulation and compared with optimal control results. Despite its simplicity, the new controller's performance is shown to approach the optimal control results while considering several practical and safety restrictions for a number of investigated scenarios.

For daytime surveillance, vehicles are detected via background modeling. For nighttime videos, headlights of vehicles need to be located and paired for vehicle detection. An algorithm based on likelihood computation is developed to pair the headlights of vehicles at night. Moreover, to balance between the robustness and abundance of acquired information, the proposed system adapts different strategies under different traffic conditions. Performing tracking would be preferred when traffic is smooth. However, under congestion conditions, it is better to obtain traffic parameters by estimation. We utilize a time-varying adaptive system state transition matrix in Kalman filter for better prediction in a traffic surveillance scene when performing tracking. We also propose a mechanism for estimating the traffic flow parameter via regression analysis. The experimental results have shown that the self-diagnosis ability and the modules designed for the system make the proposed system robust and reliable.

J	Punzo, V; Borzacchiello, MT; Ciuffo, B				Punzo, Vincenzo; Borzacchiello, Maria Teresa; Ciuffo, Biagio			On the assessment of vehicle trajectory data accuracy and application to the Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) program data	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Vehicle trajectory data; Data accuracy; Analysis of error; Delta method; Trajectory consistency; Spectral analysis; Traffic flow theory; NGSIM	DYNAMICS	Trajectories drawn in a common reference system by all the vehicles on a road are the ultimate empirical data to investigate traffic dynamics. The vast amount of such data made freely available by the Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) program is therefore opening up new horizons in studying traffic flow theory. Yet the quality of trajectory data and its impact on the reliability of related studies was a vastly underestimated problem in the traffic literature even before the availability of NGSIM data. The absence of established methods to assess data accuracy and even of a common understanding of the problem makes it hard to speak of reproducibility of experiments and objective comparison of results, in particular in a research field where the complexity of human behaviour is an intrinsic challenge to the scientific method. Therefore this paper intends to design quantitative methods to inspect trajectory data. To this aim first the structure of the error on point measurements and its propagation on the space travelled are investigated. Analytical evidence of the bias propagated in the vehicle trajectory functions and a related consistency requirement are given. Literature on estimation/filtering techniques is then reviewed in light of this requirement and a number of error statistics suitable to inspect trajectory data are proposed. The designed methodology, involving jerk analysis, consistency analysis and spectral analysis, is then applied to the complete set of NGSIM databases. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Fei, X; Lu, CC; Liu, K				Fei, Xiang; Lu, Chung-Cheng; Liu, Ke			A bayesian dynamic linear model approach for real-time short-term freeway travel time prediction	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Real-time travel time prediction; Advanced Traveler Information Systems; Bayesian inference; Prediction confidence intervals; Adaptive control	TRAFFIC FLOW; NETWORK	This paper presents a Bayesian inference-based dynamic linear model (DLM) to predict online short-term travel time on a freeway stretch. The proposed method considers the predicted freeway travel time as the sum of the median of historical travel times, time-varying random variations in travel time, and a model evolution error, where the median is employed to recognize the primary travel time pattern while the variation captures unexpected supply (i.e. capacity) reduction and demand fluctuations. Bayesian forecasting is a learning process that revises sequentially the state of a priori knowledge of travel time based on newly available information. The prediction result is a posterior travel time distribution that can be employed to generate a single-value (typically but not necessarily the mean) travel time as well as a confidence interval representing the uncertainty of travel time prediction. To better track travel time fluctuations during non-recurrent congestion due to unforeseen events (e.g., incidents, accidents, or bad weather), the DLM is integrated into an adaptive control framework that can automatically learn and adjust the system evolution noise level. The experiment results based on the real loop detector data of an 1-66 segment in Northern Virginia suggest that the proposed method is able to provide accurate and reliable travel time prediction under both recurrent and non-recurrent traffic conditions.

J	Son, H; Kweon, YJ; Park, B				Son, Hojun 'Daniel'; Kweon, Young-Jun; Park, Byungkyu 'Brian'			Development of crash prediction models with individual vehicular data	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Crash analysis; Surrogate measure; Count data model; Hurdle model; Highway safety	SELECTION	Typical engineering research on traffic safety focuses on identifying either dangerous locations or contributing factors through a post-crash analysis using aggregated traffic flow data and crash records. A recent development of transportation engineering technologies provides ample opportunities to enhance freeway traffic safety using individual vehicular information. However, little research has been conducted regarding methodologies to utilize and link such technologies to traffic safety analysis. Moreover, traffic safety research has not benefited from the use of hurdle-type models that might treat excessive zeros more properly than zero-inflated models. This study developed a new surrogate measure, unsafe following condition (UFC), to estimate traffic crash likelihood by using individual vehicular information and applied it to basic sections of interstate highways in Virginia. Individual vehicular data and crash data were used in the development of statistical crash prediction models including hurdle models. The results showed that an aggregated UFC measure was effective in predicting traffic crash occurrence, and the hurdle Poisson model outperformed other count data models in a certain case.

J	Dong, CF; Paty, CS				Dong, Chuanfei; Paty, Carol S.			Application of adaptive weights to intelligent information systems: An intelligent transportation system as a case study	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Intelligent transportation systems; Information feedback; Cellular automaton model; Adaptive weights; Route selection strategies; Congestion cluster	REAL-TIME INFORMATION; TRAFFIC-FLOW; MODEL; TRANSITION; DYNAMICS; SCENARIO; PHYSICS	Optimization of information feedback technologies is very important for many socioeconomic systems such as stock markets and traffic systems aiming to make full use of resources. In this paper, we propose an adaptive weight method, which has potential value for a variety of information processing contexts. We apply this adaptive weight method to an intelligent transportation system (ITS) as a case study. A feedback strategy named Improved Congestion Coefficient Feedback Strategy (ICCFS) is introduced based on a two-route scenario in which dynamic information can be generated and displayed on the roadside in order to enable drivers to make an informed route decision. Our model incorporates the effects of adaptability into the cellular automaton models of traffic flow. Simulations demonstrate that adopting this optimal information feedback strategy provides a high efficiency in controlling spatial distribution of traffic patterns when compared with the three other information feedback strategies, i.e., Travel Time Feedback Strategy (TTFS), Mean Velocity Feedback Strategy (MVFS) and Congestion Coefficient Feedback Strategy (CCFS).

Ever since the terrorist attacks of 9/11, there has been increasing concern over the extent to which an attack on infrastructure could result in serious economic disruption. This research develops a model to analyze the economic consequences of an attack on a major element of the highway network. We add a freight network to a national multiregional economic impact model and make freight traffic flows endogenous. The use of a sub-national interstate model recognizes that most infrastructure planning is at the state level and most political leaders' interest is local. We base our approach on the National Interstate Economic Model (NIEMO) and refer to an elaboration that we name Transportation network and the National Interstate Economic Model (TransNIEMO). The new model enables us to study the state-specific and industry-specific economic impacts of some significant changes in the nature of highway freight movements. We tested the model for selected freight movements in and out of California. The results are entirely plausible and encourage us to elaborate and test the model for hypothetical disruptions of freight traffic throughout the US. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Cirianni, F; Leonardi, G				Cirianni, Francis; Leonardi, Giovanni			Road traffic noise prediction models in the metropolitan area of the Strait of Messina	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-TRANSPORT			English	Article								The paper outlines a methodological approach for the quantitative analysis of the level of noise produced on and by transport infrastructure in urban settings. Traffic-related noise is a source of pollution which can cause severe damage to communities in terms of health and social welfare. It is thus necessary to develop adequate and specific mathematical tools to reproduce or simulate different acoustic scenarios. An analysis is presented of the acoustic data measured in the metropolitan area of the Straits of Messina (Italy), which for its location is always subject to heavy traffic flows in transit between Sicily and the mainland (Calabria). An integrated neural-fuzzy approach to assess traffic noise, which was calibrated with the field data, is also proposed. The application of this model is compared with the traditional regressive prediction models known in the literature and the results are presented.

J	Leclercq, L; Laval, JA; Chiabaut, N				Leclercq, Ludovic; Laval, Jorge A.; Chiabaut, Nicolas			Capacity drops at merges: An endogenous model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Capacity drop; Merge; Merge ratio; Kinematic wave model; Active bottleneck	BREAKDOWN PHENOMENON; KINEMATIC WAVES; TRAFFIC FLOW; FREEWAY	The Newell-Daganzo merge model is not only very simple but also accurately reproduces experimental findings. However, the capacity downstream of the merge is an exogenous variable in the model. This is a serious limitation for merges that behave as active bottlenecks because their downstream capacity is a direct consequence of the merging behavior. This paper proposes an analytical model that extends the Newell-Daganzo model by incorporating, endogenously, the capacity drop related to the merging process. Two cases are investigated depending on the traffic states on the on-ramp. The model properties are analyzed and a sensitivity analysis is performed to quantify the relative contribution of the each parameter in the capacity drop. Finally, the extended Newell-Daganzo model is validated with experimental data coming from an active merge bottleneck on the M6 freeway in UK. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The proposed model contains two models of stochastic processes associated with traffic flow dynamics: a model of platoon formation behind a bottleneck and a model of speed transitions within a platoon. After these proposed models are validated, they are applied to a simple one-way, one-lane expressway section containing a bottleneck, and the stochastic nature of traffic breakdown is demonstrated through theoretical exercises.

However, the effects of traffic air pollution on asthma and wheeze have been very sparsely studied in areas with low traffic intensity in cold climate with poor dispersion. We evaluated the impact of vehicle traffic on childhood asthma and wheeze by objective exposure assessment. Methods: As a part of the Obstructive Lung Disease in Northern Sweden (OLIN) studies, a questionnaire was sent to the families of all children attending first or second grade in Lulea (72,000 inhabitants) in Northern Sweden in 2006. The age of the children was 7-8 years and the participation rate was 98% (n = 1357). Skin prick tests were performed in 1224 (89%) children. The home addresses were given geographical coordinates and traffic counts were obtained from the local traffic authorities. A proximity model of average daily traffic and average daily heavy vehicle traffic within 200 meters from each participant's home address was used. The associations between traffic exposure and asthma and wheeze, respectively, were analysed in an adjusted multiple logistic regression model. Results: Exposure to high traffic flows was uncommon in the study area; only 15% of the children lived within 200 meters from a road with a traffic flow of >= 8000 vehicles per day. Living closer than 200 meters from a road with >= 500 heavy vehicles daily was associated with current wheeze, odds ratio 1.7 (confidence interval 1.0-2.7). A dose-response relation was indicated. An increased risk of asthma was also seen, however not significant, odds ratio 1.5 (confidence interval 0.8-2.9). Stratified analyses revealed that the effect of traffic exposure was restricted to the non-sensitized phenotype of asthma and wheeze. The agreement between self-reported traffic exposure and objective measurements of exposure was moderate. Conclusions: This study showed that already at low levels of exposure, vehicle traffic is related to an increased risk of wheeze among children. Thus, the global burden of traffic air pollution may be underestimated.

J	Jimenez, M; Sarmiento, I				Jimenez, Margarita; Sarmiento, Ivan			ADAPTIVE CONTROL SYSTEM AND OPTIMIZATION OF ROAD TRAFFIC IN A SIGNALIZEDCORRIDOR APPLICATION TO THE CITY OF MEDELLIN	DYNA-COLOMBIA			Spanish	Article						Traffic flow; evolutionary algorithms; strategies of responsive control; sensible strategies of control to the traffic		There are three key aspects to consider in designing an adaptive control system. The first aspect is related to the nature of the traffic phenomenon. This is far of being approached from the perspective of a deterministic model. The second, is inherent to a physical reality, considering that the road network, regardless of their design and / or establishment support a maximum traffic flow and a maximum density defined by their size, number of lanes and traffic conditions. All demonstrate, that more sophisticated than the system is, it is not possible to improve the performance of traffic flow per unit of time, beyond the physical limitations imposed by the road design and traffic regulations. On the other hand, initial investment costs plus operating costs and external costs related to the efficient flow of traffic are a third factor to consider as a result of the previous two. Likewise, the magnitude of the cost will largely depend on the degree of intelligence that is allocated on the strategy to implement the technology used in the detection and communication system.

NO and NO2 interconversion downwind of two different line sources in suburban environments	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Line sources; NO and NO2 concentrations; Chemical transformation; Dispersion modelling	LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION; NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; AIR-QUALITY; POLLUTANT CONCENTRATIONS; TRAFFIC POLLUTANTS; O-3 CONCENTRATIONS; MODELING APPROACH; URBAN; ROAD; EMISSIONS	Nitrogen monoxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O-3) have been measured downwind (0-450 m) from two line sources in a suburban environment in a set of initial experiments designed to investigate the role of chemistry in determining the partitioning of NOx into NO and NO2 and the ability of a commercial modelling package (ADMS) to reproduce downwind speciated NOx concentrations. NO concentrations decrease more rapidly than NO2 as NO is removed both by dilution and by chemical reaction with ozone. Whilst NO is the dominant form of NOx at the roadside, NO2 concentrations decay more slowly (due to chemical production and higher background levels) and NO2 typically forms the majority of NOx by 50-100 m from the source. For a majority of modelling studies the input NO and NO2 concentrations were set to match the experimental concentrations at the initial site. The measured decays of NO and NO2 can be accurately reproduced by the ADMS dispersion model only when chemical transformation is taken into account. When NOx is estimated directly from traffic flow measurements, the modelled NO2 tends to underestimate the measured value. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Chaney, A. M.; Cryer, D.

J	Martchouk, M; Mannering, F; Bullock, D				Martchouk, Maria; Mannering, Fred; Bullock, Darcy			Analysis of Freeway Travel Time Variability Using Bluetooth Detection	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bluetooth detection; Travel time reliability; Highway level of service		Travel time has long been an important performance measure for assessing traffic conditions and the extent of highway congestion. However, recently, more and more attention has been given to understanding the uncertainty regarding the variability in travel time from hour to hour and day to day-variability that is known to be a source of great frustration among road users. In this paper, travel-time variability is studied by collecting travel-time data using probe data on freeway segments in Indianapolis obtained using anonymous Bluetooth sampling techniques. The data show considerable travel-time variability is induced by adverse weather, but also show that variability results from unexpected changes in traffic flow rates and driver behavior. Various statistical models are estimated to understand the effect that traffic-related variables have on variability in individual vehicle travel times as well as average travel times. For individual vehicle travel times, a model is estimated to study how the probability of a vehicle's duration of time spent on freeway segments changes over time. Interestingly, this model shows that the point where the conditional probability of travel times becoming longer occurs roughly at the onset of level-of-service F conditions-an important finding that supports the traffic-density definitions of level of service F used in the highway capacity manual. Another model, estimated using seemingly unrelated regression estimation, studies 15-min interval average vehicle travel times and the standard deviation of these travel times on the basis of speed and volume (available from remote traffic microwave sensors) and time of day indicators. This model provides interesting insights into the traffic parameters that affect average travel time and its variability. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000253.

In this paper, traffic flow cellular automaton models for four-lane highway system with two opposing directions under the above two modes are established considering car and truck mixed running. Through computer numerical simulating, the fundamental diagrams with different parameters are obtained, and after the analysis of density-flux diagrams, the variation discipline of flux with traffic density under different control models is gained. The results indicate that, compared with lane-control, utilization ratio of road can be further improved with speed-control when the truck number increases. The research result is of great significance for reasonable providing theoretical guidance for highway traffic control.

Firstly, a new macro model with the consideration of road width was proposed. Secondly, the effects of road width on uniform flow and small perturbation were studied. The analytical and numerical results show that widening (shrinking) road can enhance (reduce) the equilibrium speed and flow, and the increments (decrements) will increase with the absolute value of road width gradient. In addition, the numerical results illustrate that the new model can describe the effects of road width on the evolutions of uniform flow and small perturbation.

The numerical simulation results depict several relation curves between road section capacity, speed and road width under different directional distributions of traffic flow, as well as the curves between the major and minor direction saturation flow, speed and road width. These relation characteristics indicate that except the one-way road section capacity and speed remaining unchanged, other road section capacities and speeds under different directional distributions increase with the increase of road width. On narrow road, the two-way traffic capacity and speed are less than those of one-way traffic; on wide road, the two-way traffic capacity doubles that of one-way traffic, but their speeds are almost the same. As the directional distribution moves to an even distribution of 50/50, the major direction saturation flows and speeds as well as the minor direction speeds tend to decease, while the minor direction saturation flow tends to increase.

J	Poister, TH; Thomas, JC				Poister, Theodore H.; Thomas, John Clayton			The Effect of Expectations and Expectancy Confirmation/Disconfirmation on Motorists' Satisfaction with State Highways	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND THEORY			English	Article							CITIZEN SATISFACTION; DISCONFIRMATION; DETERMINANTS; MODEL	Over the past several years, scholars have asked how citizen satisfaction with public services might be affected by the expectations citizens have for service quality. Might satisfaction with public services be affected just not only by the perceived quality of those services but also by the quality citizens expect services to have? This line of questioning uses the so-called "expectancy disconfirmation" model drawn from private sector research, which views consumer satisfaction with privately provided goods and services as typically deriving from a comparison of perceived performance to expected performance. This article extends this research by examining the effects of expectations and expectancy confirmation/disconfirmation on motorists' satisfaction with road conditions, traffic flow, and safety on state highways in Georgia. Expectations were found to have consistently negative, though modest, effects on satisfaction, with satisfaction declining as expectations increase. Those effects obtain in addition to those of perceived performance, grades, and expectancy confirmation/disconfirmation, providing further support for the expectancy disconfirmation model and clarifying some mixed findings from prior research. The conclusions discuss what these findings suggest about possible future research.

J	Bham, GH				Bham, Ghulam H.			A simple lane change model for microscopic traffic flow simulation in weaving sections	TRANSPORTATION LETTERS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH			English	Article						microscopic traffic simulation; lane change behavior; lane change model; car-following; weaving section; calibration; validation	CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL	This paper presents the development and validation of a simple microscopic traffic simulation model for driver lane change behavior in freeway weaving sections. The simple model, called the weaving model, is computationally efficient and requires fewer calibration parameters. The model's calibration parameters can be found from the field data which makes the calibration process simpler compared to more detailed simulation models. Two types of lane change logics were developed: a) discretionary and b) mandatory. Discretionary lane change logic considers a driver's dissatisfaction with his/her current speed and feasibility of speed gain in the target lane. A mandatory lane change is performed for vehicles exiting, entering or moving to a preferred lane on the highway. The weaving model was validated at the microscopic level by comparing the trajectories of vehicles from simulation with the field data, whereas macroscopic validation was performed using statistical and error tests for average speed and section density. Lane change frequency from the proposed model was also compared with the field data and good agreement was observed. The results from the proposed model were compared with two popular simulation models, VISSIM and AIMSUN, which indicated that the proposed model performed at least as good as these models.

J	Antoniou, C; Psarianos, B; Brilon, W				Antoniou, Constantinos; Psarianos, Basil; Brilon, Werner			Induced traffic prediction inaccuracies as a source of traffic forecasting failure	TRANSPORTATION LETTERS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH			English	Article						Transportation engineering; transportation forecasting models; induced traffic; land use - transport interaction; traffic demand forecasting	LAND-USE; UNCERTAINTY; MODEL	In this paper, evidence from the literature on the inaccuracy of forecasts from transport planning models is presented and its impact on capital infrastructure planning decision-making is demonstrated. Empirical evidence suggests that forecasts used for major planning decisions have been found to be rather inaccurate (when comparing forecast volumes with actually realized volumes after time passed). A meta-analysis of the relevant literature provides insight into the expected magnitude of these deviations as well as the main contributing factors, including induced demand. Furthermore, evidence of these irregularities in the case of two major expressway infrastructure projects in Southern Greece is presented, providing insight about a typical example of a country with a developing freeway network. Data from the immediate impact zone of the Attica Tollway in the metropolitan area of Athens and the neighboring interurban Elefsina-Korinth motorway are used to demonstrate that the projects resulted in considerable changes in the land use patterns and density, both in terms of residential and commercial development, resulting in the generation of additional traffic flows. Having demonstrated the need for re-thinking how long-term traffic is forecast, suitable recommendations for promising directions are made. Dealing with uncertainty is one key aspect that can be easily incorporated to existing forecasting tools. Furthermore, the need for more detailed and area-specific models, e. g. through the integration of activity-based modeling, specific mobility patterns and demands are also outlined.

Phase coexistence induced by a defensive reaction in a cellular automaton traffic flow model	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow modeling; Phase diagram; Cellular automaton; Dynamical phase transitions	WAVES; TIME	Traffic flow modeling is an elusive example for the emergence of complexity in dynamical systems of interacting objects. In this work, we introduce an extension of the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NaSch) model of vehicle traffic flow that takes into account a defensive driver's reaction. Such a mechanism acts as an additional nearest-neighbor coupling. The defensive reaction dynamical rule consists in reducing the driver's velocity in response to deceleration of the vehicle immediately in front of it whenever the distance is smaller than a security minimum. This new mechanism, when associated with the random deceleration rule due to fluctuations, considerably reduces the mean velocity by adjusting the distance between the vehicles. It also produces the emergence of bottlenecks along the road on which the velocity is much lower than the road mean velocity. Besides the two standard phases of the NaSch model corresponding to the free flow and jammed flow, the present model also exhibits an intermediate phase on which these two flow regimes coexist, as it indeed occurs in real traffics. These findings are consistent with empirical results as well as with the general three-phase traffic theory. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Neto, J. P. L.; Lyra, M. L.; da Silva, C.

J	de-la-Rocha, E; Palacios, R				de-la-Rocha, E.; Palacios, R.			Speed estimation of vehicles approaching an intersection: a digital image processing method	IMAGING SCIENCE JOURNAL			English	Article						vehicle speed estimation; digital image processing; intelligent transportation systems; road safety	SENSOR	Most severe car accidents that occur in urban environments involve side impacts at street intersections, even at those regulated with traffic lights. Hence, it is very common to implement a small delay since one road changes to red until the other road changes to green. This delay is intended to avoid accidents in which a vehicle decides to go through the intersection after the sequence green-yellow-red is started, underestimating the time required to overtake the intersection. A better approach is to adjust the delay dynamically, depending on the speed of the vehicles approaching to the intersection. Using the dynamic approach, it is possible to improve traffic flow by reducing unnecessary delays, and to improve safety by applying longer delays when needed. This paper proposes a speed estimation method based on digital image processing of pictures taken with wireless cameras installed on top of existing traffic lights. The algorithm finds a vehicle in two consecutive images (either in day or night condition) and computes its speed by correlation. When a traffic light turns red, the systems estimates the speed of the cars approaching and decides to change the other road to green immediately, or to wait until it is safe to do so. The system was tested with real traffic flow at a street located in the city of Talavera de la Reina, Spain, with vehicles at different speeds. The image processing method proved to be accurate for this application, and adding the advantage of low cost equipment and easy installation results in a very attractive solution.

This study examined the relation between long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution and type 2 diabetes prevalence among 50- to 75-year-old subjects living in Westfriesland, the Netherlands. Methods: Participants were recruited in a cross-sectional diabetes screening-study conducted between 1998 and 2000. Exposure to traffic-related air pollution was characterized at the participants' home-address. Indicators of exposure were land use regression modeled nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration, distance to the nearest main road, traffic flow at the nearest main road and traffic in a 250 m circular buffer. Crude and age-, gender- and neighborhood income adjusted associations were examined by logistic regression. Results: 8,018 participants were included, of whom 619 (8%) subjects had type 2 diabetes. Smoothed plots of exposure versus type 2 diabetes supported some association with traffic in a 250 m buffer (the highest three quartiles compared to the lowest also showed increased prevalence, though non-significant and not increasing with increasing quartile), but not with the other exposure metrics. Modeled NO2-concentration, distance to the nearest main road and traffic flow at the nearest main road were not associated with diabetes. Exposure-response relations seemed somewhat more pronounced for women than for men (non-significant). Conclusions: We did not find consistent associations between type 2 diabetes prevalence and exposure to traffic-related air pollution, though there were some indications for a relation with traffic in a 250 m buffer.

Marine traffic risk modelling - an innovative approach and a case study	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART O-JOURNAL OF RISK AND RELIABILITY			English	Article						maritime risk; maritime transportation; collision; grounding; modelling; tankers; oil spill; the Gulf of Finland	COLLISION; PROBABILITY	This paper presents a model to analyse the risk of two common marine accidents: collision and grounding. Attention is focused on oil tankers since they pose the highest environmental risks. A case study in selected areas of the Gulf of Finland in ice-free conditions is presented. The model utilizes a formula for risk calculation that considers both the probability of an unwanted event and its consequences. The model can be decomposed into a block representation in which blocks for the probability of a collision, probability of a grounding event, and the consequences of an accident are linked. The probability of vessel colliding is assessed in terms of a minimum-distance-to-collision-based model. The model defines the collision zone using a mathematical ship motion model and considers the traffic flow to be a non-homogeneous process. Calculations are performed using data for traffic flows in the Gulf of Finland with particular attention being paid to the crossing of the channel used by scheduled ferries between Helsinki and Tallinn, and the main shipping channel. For the assessment of a grounding probability, a new approach is proposed, which utilizes a gravity-like model, where a ship and navigational obstructions are perceived as interacting objects and their repulsion is modelled by a formulation inspired by gravitational force. The considered situation in this case is the movement of oil tankers in the approach channel to an oil terminal at Skoldvik, near Helsinki. The consequences of an accident are expressed in monetary terms, and concern the costs of cleaning up an oil spill, based on the statistics of compensation levels claimed from the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund.

J	Rawat, K; Katiyar, VK; Pratibha				Rawat, K.; Katiyar, V. K.; Pratibha			Effect of speed fluctuations due to driving imperfections on road traffic noise emission	NOISE CONTROL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article							ANNOYANCE; MODEL	Propagation of traffic noise in metro cities is a complex phenomenon. Since fluctuations in traffic flow are basic nature of a traffic stream, it can be studied by using Cellular Automata (CA). Braking tendencies among vehicles which reflect the driving imperfections affect the overall traffic flow. CA traffic flow model gives the wide description of stochastic nature of traffic flow. The present study reveals the influence of stochastic nature of traffic flow over traffic noise emission. Vehicles are classified into 7 types. To simulate traffic flow CA is used with simple updated rules for movement of vehicles. Stochastic CA is used for calculating flow, average speed and equivalent Sound Pressure Level (SPL) of traffic stream for various densities. Influence of speed fluctuations in continuous traffic streams over the noise emission level of different types of vehicles has been studied in conditions in India. A value of braking parameter p has been estimated for road conditions in India which is found suitable when compared with real observed data. (C) 2011 Institute of Noise Control Engineering.

Subtractive Clustering-Based K-means Technique for Determining Optimum Time-of-Day Breakpoints	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Time-of-day breakpoints; K-means clustering technique; SimTraffic; Z-score in clustering		In many countries, the most widely used method for timing plan selection and implementation is the time-of-day (TOD) method. In TOD mode, a few traffic patterns that exist in the historical volume data are recognized and used to find the signal timing plans needed to achieve optimum performance of the intersections during the day. Traffic engineers usually determine TOD breakpoints by analyzing 1 or 2 days worth of traffic data and relying on their engineering judgment. The current statistical methods, such as hierarchical and K-means clustering methods, determine TOD breakpoints but introduce a large number of transitions. This paper proposes adopting the Z-score of the traffic flow and time variable in the K-means clustering to reduce the number of transitions. The numbers of optimum breakpoints are chosen based on a microscopic simulation model considering a set of performance measures. By using simulation and the K-means algorithm, it was found that five clusters are the optimum for a major arterial in Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia. As an alternative to the simulation-based approach, a subtractive algorithm-based K-means technique is introduced to determine the optimum number of TODs. Through simulation, it was found that both approaches results in almost the same values of measure of effectiveness (MOE). The proposed two approaches seem promising for similar studies in other regions, and both of them can be extended for different types of roads. The paper also suggests a procedure for considering the cyclic nature of the daily traffic in the clustering effort. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000099.

Design of an adaptive maximum likelihood estimator for key parameters in macroscopic traffic flow model based on expectation maximum algorithm	IET SCIENCE MEASUREMENT & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							STATE-SPACE MODELS; FILTERS	A large number of freeway networks can be described by non-linear, non-Gaussian macroscopic second-order state-space models. One of the most challenging problem in traffic monitoring systems is estimation of key parameters in traffic flow model including critical density, free flow speed and exponent of a motorway segments, which are continuously subject to changes over time due to traffic conditions (traffic composition, incidents, ... ) and environmental factors (dense fog, strong wind, snow, ... ) and missing data regarding to problems in distributed sensor network and communication links. These parameters have critical effects on the performance of the traffic control strategies and applications such as traffic control, ramp metering, incident management and many other applications in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). So, they must be estimated accurate and on-line. Here, in the first step, mentioned parameters will be estimated offline using all available measured data by implementing maximum likelihood method via the employment of an expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm. Then proposed approaches will be developed to construct an adaptive estimator for calibrating online the static parameters in non-linear non-Gaussian state space model of traffic flow. These approaches are asymptotic and statistical techniques and are based on online EM-type algorithms. Unlike to recently proposed standard sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods, these algorithms do not degenerate over time. To approximate first and second derivatives of optimal filter, required in these approaches, without sticking in analytical complexities, here EM algorithm has been implemented based on particle filters and smoothers. Two convincing simulation results for two set of field traffic data from the Berkeley Highway Laboratory (BHL) and Regional Traffic Management Center (RTMC), a part of Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT), are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

DISTRIBUTED MATHEMATICAL MODELS OF UNDETERMINED "WITHOUT PREFERENCE" MOTION OF TRAFFIC FLOW	DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Traffic flows; non -deterministic vehicular traffic motion; density of traffic flow; integro-differential equation; probabilistic treatment; Markov chain		Present work proceeds non-deterministic motion of the two-dimensional (2D) vehicular traffic flow, where the traffic flow is assumed as flow of particles in the investigated environment with allowed motion in both forward and opposite directions. Besides, it is assumed that at any fixed time interval in the 2D flow, vehicles could change its positions on the road to any arbitrary placements at the defined probabilities, even they might be not the neighbouring ones. Such a non-deterministic motion of 2D traffic flow will be named as motion "without preference". Under the pointed assumptions, first it is constructed the non-deterministic discrete mathimatical model, and later by means of using the principle of continuous system there are applied limiting transitions to the constructed discrete model. As a result nondeterministic continuous model in the form of initial-boundary value problem for the integro-differential equation is elaborated. In addition probabilistic interpretations of the constructed models and the received results are given.

More specifically, we apply robust optimization (RO) for dynamically assigning emergency response and evacuation traffic flow problems with time dependent demand uncertainty. This paper studies a Cell Transmission Model (CTM) based system optimum dynamic traffic assignment model. We adopt a min-max criterion and apply an extension of the RO method adjusted to dynamic optimization problems, an affinely adjustable robust counterpart (AARC) approach. Simulation experiments show that the AARC solution provides excellent results when compared to deterministic solution and sampling based stochastic programming solution. General insights of RO and transportation that may have wider applicability in humanitarian relief supply chains are provided. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In existing models, such as the Stochastic Exposure and Dose Simulation model for Particulate Matter (SHEDS-PM), in-vehicle exposure is estimated using linear regression based on area-wide ambient PM2.5 concentration. An alternative modeling approach is explored based on estimation of near-road PM2.5 concentration and an in-vehicle mass balance model. Near-road PM2.5 concentration is estimated using a dispersion model and fixed site monitor (FSMs) data. In-vehicle concentration is estimated based on air exchange rate and filter efficiency. In-vehicle concentration varies with road type, traffic flow, windspeed, stability class, and ventilation. Average in-vehicle exposure is estimated to contribute 10-20 percent of average daily exposure. The contribution of in-vehicle exposure to total daily exposure can be higher for some individuals. Recommendations are made for updating exposure models and implementation of the alternative approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Liu, Xiaozhen; Frey, H.

J	Zheng, QPP; Arulselvan, A				Zheng, Qipeng P.; Arulselvan, Ashwin			Discrete time dynamic traffic assignment models and solution algorithm for managed lanes	JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION			English	Article						Managed lane; Dynamic traffic assignment; Time expanded network; System optimum; Mixed integer programming; Decomposition	USER EQUILIBRIUM PROBLEM; CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; DEPARTURE TIME; CHOICE PROBLEM; ROUTE CHOICE; NETWORK; HORIZON; SYSTEM	"Managed" lanes of highways usually refer to lanes that are not open to all types of vehicles, such as "High Occupancy Vehicles" (HOV) lanes and "High Occupancy Toll" (HOT) lanes, etc. The HOV lanes of highways are reserved only for vehicles with a driver and one or more passengers. Whereas, HOT lanes allow all vehicles but require tolls from the vehicles with no passenger except the driver. In this paper, we present a discrete-time traffic assignment system optimum model to predict the optimal traffic flows on managed lanes at various times in the entire planning horizon. This model minimizes the overall delay (travel time) and belongs to the class of dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) problems. When applied to general networks, DTA problems can be large and difficult to solve, but the problem is manageable when it is applied to a network with managed lanes. In particular, the DTA model in this paper for managed lanes is reduced to a mixed integer program for which several efficient heuristic algorithms exist. This paper also discusses the special properties of the discrete-time DTA model, based upon which a heuristic algorithm is proposed. Numerical results show that this algorithm is efficient for many cases of the managed lane problems.

It describes the relationship between the vehicles' running speed and the fraction of running vehicles. The two parameters of the model essentially represent 'free flow' travel time and level of interaction among vehicles, and may be used to evaluate urban roadway networks and urban corridors with partially limited access. These parameters are influenced by not only the roadway characteristics but also by behavioral aspects of driver population, e.g., aggressiveness. Two-fluid models are estimated for eight arterial corridors in Orlando, FL for this study. The parameters of the two-fluid model were used to evaluate corridor level operations and the correlations of these parameters' with rates of crashes having different types/severity. Significant correlations were found between two-fluid parameters and rear-end and angle crash rates. Rate of severe crashes was also found to be significantly correlated with the model parameter signifying inter-vehicle interactions. While there is need for further analysis, the findings suggest that the two-fluid model parameters may have potential as surrogate measures for traffic safety on urban arterial streets.

Applying the linear stability theory, we obtain the linear stability condition of the model. Through nonlinear analysis, we derive the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation to describe the propagating behaviour of a traffic density wave near the critical point.

Following the description of an optimal velocity model for two vehicle groups and the derivation of their stability conditions, the feedback signals, which involve information about vehicles from both lanes acting on the two-lane traffic system, are introduced into the optimal velocity model. The control signals play a role in alleviating the traffic jam only if the traffic state is in congestion, and their role will vanish if the traffic state is in the steady state. The numerical simulations show that lane changing behaviours can break the steady state of two-lane traffic flow and aggravate the traffic disturbance, but the control method would successfully suppress the traffic jam eventually, which implies that the conclusions obtained here have certain theoretical and practical significance.

In order to show the different psychological characters of drivers when changing lane and braking, lane-changing choice probability and safety parameter are introduced. By computer simulation, the relationships among speed, density and traffic volume are given to show the influence of driving psychology on the traffic flow. The simulation results indicate that the lane-changing choice probability has little effect on the average speed, but it makes the variance of speed larger. And the safety parameter can increase the average speed and the traffic volume.

However, according to the field survey data, in complex traffic conditions, a lateral separation between the leader and the follower frequently occurs. Accordingly, by taking lateral separation into account, we redefined the equation of time-to-collision (TTC) using visual angle information. Based on the stimulus-response framework, TTC was introduced into the basic General Motors (GM) model as a stimulus, and a non-lane-based car-following model of steady-state traffic flow was developed. The property of flow-density relationship was further investigated after integrating the proposed car-following model with different parameters. The results imply that the property of steady-state traffic flow and the capacity of each lane are highly relevant to the microscopic staggered car-following behavior, and the proposed model significantly enhances the practicality of the human driving behavior model.

J	Chen, K; Makki, K; Pissinou, N				Chen, Kai; Makki, Kia; Pissinou, Niki			MACHINE LEARNING ON CONGESTION ANALYSIS BASED REAL-TIME NAVIGATION SYSTEM	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS			English	Article						Congestion; traffic jam; real-time traffic; fastest path; support vector regression (SVR); machine learning; travel time prediction; urban traffic networks; multi-lane		In the metropolitan region, most congestion or traffic jams are caused by the uneven distribution of traffic flow that creates bottleneck points where the traffic volume exceeds the road capacity. Additionally, unexpected incidents are the next most probable cause of these bottleneck regions. Moreover, most drivers are driving based on their empirical experience without awareness of real-time traffic situations. This unintelligent traffic behavior can make the congestion problem worse. Prediction based route guidance systems show great improvements in solving the inefficient diversion strategy problem by estimating future travel time when calculating accurate travel time is difficult. However, performances of machine learning based prediction models that are based on the historical data set degrade sharply during a congestion situation. This paper develops a new navigation system for reducing travel time of an individual driver and distributing the flow of urban traffic efficiently in order to reduce the occurrence of congestion. Compared with previous route guidance systems, the results reveal that our system, applying the advanced multi-lane prediction based real-time fastest path (AMPRFP) algorithm, can significantly reduce the travel time especially when drivers travel in a complex route environment and face frequent congestion problems. Unlike the previous system,(1) it can be applied either for single lane or multi-lane urban traffic networks where the reason for congestion is significantly complex. We also demonstrate the advantages of this system and verify the results using real highway traffic data and a synthetic experiment.

J	Lederman, R; Wynter, L				Lederman, Roger; Wynter, Laura			Real-time traffic estimation using data expansion	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Traffic equilibrium; Real-time traffic analytics; Bilevel programming; OD matrix estimation	BILEVEL OPTIMIZATION; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; MATRIX ESTIMATION; IDENTIFICATION; EQUILIBRIA; NETWORKS	This paper presents a method for estimating missing real-time traffic volumes on a road network using both historical and real-time traffic data. The method was developed to address urban transportation networks where a non-negligible subset of the network links do not have real-time link volumes, and where that data is needed to populate other real-time traffic analytics. Computation is split between an offline calibration and a real-time estimation phase. The offline phase determines link-to-link splitting probabilities for traffic flow propagation that are subsequently used in real-time estimation. The real-time procedure uses current traffic data and is efficient enough to scale to full city-wide deployments. Simulation results on a medium-sized test network demonstrate the accuracy of the method and its robustness to missing data and variability in the data that is available. For traffic demands with a coefficient of variation as high as 40%, and a real-time feed in which as much as 60% of links lack data, we find the percentage root mean square error of link volume estimates ranges from 3.9% to 18.6%. We observe that the use of real-time data can reduce this error by as much as 20%. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Iwasaki, Y; Kawata, S; Nakamiya, T				Iwasaki, Yoichiro; Kawata, Shinya; Nakamiya, Toshiyuki			Robust vehicle detection even in poor visibility conditions using infrared thermal images and its application to road traffic flow monitoring	MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						vehicle detection; infrared thermal images; poor visibility conditions; Haar-like features; traffic monitoring; ITS (intelligent transportation systems)		We propose an algorithm for detecting vehicle positions and their movements by using thermal images obtained through an infrared thermography camera. The infrared thermography camera offers high contrast images even in poor visibility conditions like snow and thick fog. The proposed algorithm specifies the area of moving vehicles based on the standard deviations of pixel values along the time direction of spatio-temporal images. It also specifies vehicle positions by applying the pattern recognition algorithm which uses Haar-like features per frame of the images. Moreover, to increase the accuracy of vehicle detection, correction procedures for misrecognition of vehicles are employed. The results of our experiments at three different temperatures show that the information about both vehicle positions and their movements can be obtained by combining those two kinds of detection, and the vehicle detection accuracy is 96.2%. Moreover, the proposed algorithm detects the vehicles robustly in the 222 continuous frames taken in poor visibility conditions like snow and thick fog. As an application of the algorithm, we also propose a method for estimating traffic flow conditions based on the results obtained by the algorithm. By using the method for estimating traffic flow conditions, automatic traffic flow monitoring can be achieved.

J	Ngoduy, D				Ngoduy, D.			Kernel Smoothing Method Applicable to the Dynamic Calibration of Traffic Flow Models	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK MODEL; KINEMATIC WAVES; KALMAN FILTER; PREDICTION; TIME; SIMULATION; VOLUME; STATES	Real time traffic flow simulation models are used to provide traffic information for dynamic traffic management systems. Those simulation models are supplied by traffic data in order to estimate and predict traffic conditions in unobserved sections of a traffic network. In general, most of recent real time traffic simulators are based on the macroscopic model because the macroscopic model replicates the average traffic behavior in terms of observable variables such as (time-space) flow and speed at a relatively fast computational time. Like other simulation models, an important aspect of the real time macroscopic simulator is to calibrate the model parameters online. The most conventional way of the online calibration is to add a random walk to the parameters to constitute an augmentation of the traffic variables and the model parameters to be estimated. Actually, this method allows the parameters to vary at every time step and, therefore, describes the adaptation of the model to the prevailing traffic conditions. However, it has been reported that the use of the random walk results in a loss of information and an increase of the covariance of parameters, which consequently leads to posteriors that are far more diffuse than the theoretical posteriors for the true parameters. To this end, this article puts forward a Kernel density estimation technique in the calibration process to handle the covariance issue and to avoid the information loss. The Kernel density estimation technique is embedded in the particle filter algorithm, which is extended to the calibration problems. The proposed framework is investigated using real-life data collected in a freeway in England.

J	Chung, Y				Chung, Younshik			Assessment of non-recurrent traffic congestion caused by freeway work zones and its statistical analysis with unobserved heterogeneity	TRANSPORT POLICY			English	Article						Freeway work zone; Recurrent traffic congestion; Non-recurrent traffic congestion; Archived traffic flow data; Unobserved heterogeneity; Frailty	NEURAL-NETWORK; DELAY; LENGTHS	Freeway work zones with patching, paving, lane marking, debris removing, and weeding cause temporary capacity reduction in the freeway and may lead to non-recurrent traffic congestion. Such non-recurrent traffic congestion amounts to 10% of total traffic congestion in the U.S. and 31% in Germany. Non-recurrent traffic congestion has been estimated by using the capacity and the number of closed lanes in work zones and the upstream traffic demand of work zones. However, the number of the closed lanes may be insignificant due to operational strategies such as using the shoulder area and composing additional lanes by temporarily reducing the existing lane width to mitigate traffic congestion. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a method to quantify non-recurrent traffic congestion caused by freeway work zones based on traffic flow data and spatio-temporal work zone information. In addition, to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed method, a case study is conducted based on one-year historical traffic data and work zone data on major freeways in Korea. Then, multivariate statistical analysis with unobserved heterogeneity is performed to describe factors of non-recurrent traffic congestion caused by work zone activities. Due to the fact that a work zone project is usually implemented according to schedule, such negative impact as non-recurrent traffic congestion is inevitably produced. Thus, the results can be practical for the performance evaluation of congestion management programs for work zone by quantifying non-recurrent traffic congestion. Additionally, the results from the statistical analysis can be potentially useful in developing a forecasting model for providing travelers with traffic information such as an alternative route to escape non-recurrent traffic congestion by freeway work zones.

Non-lane-based lattice hydrodynamic model of traffic flow considering the lateral effects of the lane width	PHYSICS LETTERS A			English	Article						Traffic flow; Non-lane-based lattice model; Lateral separation	MODIFIED KDV EQUATION; JAMMING TRANSITION	A new non-lane-based lattice model is proposed by incorporating the lateral separation effects of the lane width in traffic flow. The stability condition of the extended model is obtained by using the linear stability theory. The modified KdV equation near the critical point is derived to describe the phase transition of traffic flow and to estimate the evolution of traffic congestion through nonlinear analysis. Numerical simulation also shows that the incorporation of the lane width effects in lattice model can stabilize traffic flow and suppress the traffic jam, which implies that the lateral separation effects have important impacts in lattice models.

J	Peng, Y; Shang, HY; Lu, HP				Peng Yu; Shang Hua-Yan; Lu Hua-Pu			Analysis of Phase Transition in Traffic Flow based on a New Model of Driving Decision	COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						driving decision; cellular automaton; phase transition; traffic flow	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA MODELS; HIGHWAY; STATES; SPEED	Different driving decisions will cause different processes of phase transition in traffic flow. To reveal the inner mechanism, this paper built a new cellular automaton (CA) model, based on the driving decision (DD). In the DD model, a driver's decision is divided into three stages: decision-making, action, and result. The acceleration is taken as a decision variable and three core factors, i.e. distance between adjacent vehicles, their own velocity, and the preceding vehicle's velocity, are considered. Simulation results show that the DD model can simulate the synchronized flow effectively and describe the phase transition in traffic flow well. Further analyses illustrate that various density will cause the phase transition and the random probability will impact the process. Compared with the traditional NaSch model, the DD model considered the preceding vehicle's velocity, the deceleration limitation, and a safe distance, so it can depict closer to the driver preferences on pursuing safety, stability and fuel-saving and has strong theoretical innovation for future studies.

From indoor wireless LANs to outdoor cellular mobile networks, wireless technologies have benefited billions of users around the globe. The era of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is now evolving, gaining attention and momentum. Researchers and developers have built VANET simulation software to allow the study and evaluation of various media access, routing, and emergency warning protocols. VANET simulation is fundamentally different from MANETs (mobile ad hoc networks) simulation because in VANETs, vehicular environment imposes new issues and requirements, such as constrained road topology, multi-path fading and roadside obstacles, traffic flow models, trip models, varying vehicular speed and mobility, traffic lights, traffic congestion, drivers' behavior, etc. Currently, there are VANET mobility generators, network simulators, and VANET simulators. This paper presents a comprehensive study and comparisons of the various publicly available VANET simulation software and their components. In particular, we contrast their software characteristics, graphical user interface (GUI), popularity, ease of use, input requirements, output visualization capability, accuracy of simulation, etc. Finally, while each of the studied simulators provides a good simulation environment for VANETs, refinements and further contributions are needed before they can be widely used by the research community.

This approach not only differs from the static methods in conventional transportation planning, which only obtains one equilibrium traffic volume at one point in time, it also avoids the daily learning and adaptive travel decision behavior theorem. Any variation in daily traffic volumes during the roadwork period are predicted by a simple and accurate method. Real-life traffic data on a roadwork section during long-term maintenance work on #3 National Freeway in Taiwan was provided by the National Taiwan-Area Freeway Bureau. After the data were selected and transformed, a reverse-S-Curve based on the logistic function was applied in the establishment and evaluation of the model. In addition to verification by statistical methods, this model demonstrates high-predictive accuracy based on the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). This model can be used to predict gradually decreasing daily traffic flows towards another equilibrium level on roadwork sections undergoing long-term maintenance work in freeway or expressway networks. The shortcomings of past prediction methods are addressed with a view to effectively improving the construction of traffic volume forecasting methods. Finally, based on the characteristics of the reverse-S-Curve model, an innovative indicator-impact loss' was developed as an evaluation criterion in roadwork plans. The model and the 'impact loss' features are considered in a concluding discussion of potential applications.

J	Lee, C; Lee, JB; Kim, M				Lee, Chungwon; Lee, Jung-Beom; Kim, Minsung			Density measurement algorithm for freeway segment using two point detectors	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						density; ITS; flow		Density is the most important congestion indicator among fundamental traffic flow variables flow, speed, and density. Measuring density by aerial monitoring, although accurate, cannot be widely used because of its cost and dependency on weather. The conventional method, estimating density based on the relationship between traffic flow and speed as measured by a point detector, does not yield an accurate density value, because the flow is not homogeneous. A new and advanced density measurement method, which is based on the in-out counting method, is proposed. This method uses average density instead of instantaneous density. By using two point detectors, this method can capture considerable variation in density and is accurate for single and multilane freeway segments. Establishing the number of floating vehicles necessary to obtain a fair approximation of the true density is for future research. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper combines two aspects of this problem. On the one hand, the traffic flows must be routed through the road network in such a way that e.g. the time required to get all out is as small as possible. Hence, we have to solve an optimization problem to find out which roads shall be used in what direction. On the other hand, even if routes are defined, traffic flows are dynamic in nature and phenomena related to the traffic jam are to be examined by simulation. By defining an optimization-based simulation procedure, we get a heuristic for the overall problem. As an example we compute and simulate an evacuation plan for a neighborhood in the city of Duisburg, Germany, to demonstrate the applicability of our approach to real-world sized problems.

J	Flotterod, G; Rohde, J				Floetteroed, Gunnar; Rohde, Jannis			Operational macroscopic modeling of complex urban road intersections	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Traffic flow modeling; Intersection modeling; Cell-transmission model; Kinematic waves	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; KINEMATIC WAVE MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW; SIMULATION; NETWORK; ASSIGNMENT; MERGE	This article describes a new approach to the macroscopic first order modeling and simulation of traffic flow in complex urban road intersections. The framework is theoretically sound, operational, and comprises a large body of models presented so far in the literature. Working within the generic node model class of Tampere et al. (2011), the approach is developed in two steps. First, building on the incremental transfer principle of Daganzo et al. (1997), an incremental node model for general road intersections is developed. A limitation of this model (as of the original incremental transfer principle) is that it does not capture situations where the increase of one flow decreases another flow, e.g., due to conflicts. In a second step, the new model is therefore supplemented with the capability to describe such situations. A fixed-point formulation of the enhanced model is given, solution existence and uniqueness are investigated, and two solution algorithms are developed. The feasibility and realism of the new approach is demonstrated through a synthetic and a real case study. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Meng, Q; Weng, JX				Meng, Qiang; Weng, Jinxian			Evaluation of rear-end crash risk at work zone using work zone traffic data	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Work zone; Rear-end crash; Stepwise regression; Risk	COLLISION; TIME; PROBABILITY	This paper aims to evaluate the rear-end crash risk at work zone activity area and merging area, as well as analyze the impacts of contributing factors by using work zone traffic data. Here, the rear-end crash risk is referred to as the probability that a vehicle is involved in a rear-end crash accident. The deceleration rate to avoid the crash (DRAC) is used in measuring rear-end crash risk. Based on work zone traffic data in Singapore, three rear-end crash risk models are developed to examine the relationship between rear-end crash risk at activity area and its contributing factors. The fourth rear-end crash risk model is developed to examine the effects of merging behavior on crash risk at merging area. The ANOVA results show that the rear-end crash risk at work zone activity area is statistically different from lane positions. Model results indicate that rear-end crash risk at work zone activity area increases with heavy vehicle percentage and lane traffic flow rate. An interesting finding is that the lane closer to work zone is strongly associated with higher rear-end crash risk. A truck has much higher probability involving in a rear-end accident than a car. Further, the expressway work zone activity area is found to have much larger crash risk than arterial work zone activity area. The merging choice has the dominated effect on risk reduction, suggesting that encouraging vehicles to merge early may be the most effective method to reduce rear-end crash risk at work zone merging area.

Seventy-five years after the seminal Greenshields model, a variety of models have been proposed to mathematically represent the speed-density relationship which underlies the fundamental diagram. Observed in these models was a clear path toward two competing goals: mathematical elegance and empirical accuracy. As the latest development of such a pursuit, this paper presents a family of speed-density models with varying numbers of parameters. All of these models perform satisfactorily and have physically meaningful parameters. In addition, speed variation with traffic density is accounted for; this enables statistical approaches to traffic flow analysis. The results of this paper not only improve our understanding of traffic flow but also provide a sound basis for transportation engineering studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, most of these models were derived and validated using data such as vehicle trajectories, with no consideration of driver characteristics. In this research, focus group studies were conducted to obtain driver-related information so that the driver characteristics can be incorporated into lane-changing models. Different urban lane-changing scenarios were examined and discussed in the focus group meetings. The likelihood for initiating lane changes under each scenario was obtained. The participating drivers were categorized according to their background information and verbal responses, so that the lane-changing behavior can be related to driver characteristics for each group. Two types of information, quantitative and qualitative responses from participants, were used to establish this relationship. The paper concludes by providing recommendations related to the implementation of study findings into micro-simulators to better replicate driver behavior in urban street networks.

Even though this model is normally used in a discrete form, it is important to consider that it is obtained by discretizing both in time and space a set of differential (continuous) equations. The discretization is of course necessary in order to numerically solve the differential equations with finite difference approximations, but the choice of the sampling intervals is crucial for the numerical stability of the scheme. In a previous work, we found some numerical constraints for the definition of stable freeway traffic simulations obtained by using the classic discretization, i.e. by applying an explicit finite difference numerical solution scheme. In this paper we propose a new discretization method in order to avoid numerical instability phenomena. In particular, we introduce an implicit discretization scheme which shows analogous results to the classic one in case of stable simulations and does not show any unstable behaviour in the cases in which the classic model fails. In this paper, the two methods (the classic explicit method and the new implicit one) are compared through an extensive simulative campaign. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The numerical study is made using the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NS) model in parallel dynamics. Indeed, in this study we suppose that the cars involved in head-on collisions with a sufficiently impact speed V-12 are damaged and then must be removed from the ring. It is found that the probability, P-ac perpendicular to, per car and per time step for a head-on collision to occur depends strongly on the fraction r of the density of cars in the second lane. In fact, it increases and passes through a maximum then decreases for large values of r. Taking into account the braking probability P-1, the critical density rho(c), for which P-ac perpendicular to > 0, decreases with increasing P-1. Furthermore, the final density and current flow, at steady state, depend strongly on the threshold value of the impact speed V-12 and/or the head-on collision probability P-perpendicular to. However, for a sufficiently large value of P-perpendicular to, an abrupt jump is observed in the final density depending on the value of V-12.

J	Ayati, E; Abbasi, E				Ayati, Esmaeel; Abbasi, Ehsan			Investigation on the role of traffic volume in accidents on urban highways	JOURNAL OF SAFETY RESEARCH			English	Article						No injury accidents; More severe accidents; Urban highways; Light non-passenger car vehicles; Negative binomial (NB) regression model	POISSON-GAMMA MODELS; REGRESSION; SEVERITY	Introduction: Roadway safety is a major concern for the general public and public agencies, as roadway crashes claim many lives and cause substantial economic loss each year. In Iran, a large number of vehicles are involved in road accidents each year, which cause many deaths and extensive property damage; such accidents are among the major causes of death and disability in the country. Method: To reduce roadway accidents, the factors that affect the occurrence and severity of accidents should be scrutinized to prevent or reduce their effect. The method that many researchers have adopted to determine the effective parameters surrounding road accidents in recent years is through statistical modeling of accidents. In this article, the role of different kinds of vehicles in traffic flow are investigated separately in terms of the likelihood of crashes on urban highways, and the vehicles are divided into three groups: passenger cars, heavy vehicles, and light non-passenger car vehicles. Poisson and negative binomial (NB) regression models were applied to model the accidents in this research, which were categorized into two groups: no injury (property damage only) accidents and more severe (injury and fatal) accidents. Results: Ultimately, we conclude that light non-passenger car vehicles (i.e., taxis and motorcycles) play the largest role in the occurrence of crashes on urban highways for both types of accidents.

The support vector machine is a much better method than ever, because it may solve some actual problems in small samples, high dimension, nonlinear and local minima etc. The article utilizes the theory and method of support vector machine (SVM) regression and establishes the regressive model based on the least square support vector machine (LS-SVM). Through predicting passenger flow on Hangzhou highway in 2000-2008, the paper shows that the regressive model of LS-SVM has much higher accuracy and reliability of prediction, and therefore may effectively predict passenger flow on the highway.

Simulation results show that COVM is an improvement over the previous ones theoretically. Then, the stability condition of the model is obtained by the linear stability analysis, which has shown that the model could obtain a bigger stable region than previous models in the phase diagram. Through the nonlinear analysis, the Burgers, Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) and modified KdV (mKdV) equations are derived for the triangular shock wave, the soliton wave, and the kink-antikink soliton wave. At the same time, numerical simulations are also carried out to show that the model could simulate these density waves.

J	Punzo, V; Ciuffo, B				Punzo, Vincenzo; Ciuffo, Biagio			Integration of Driving and Traffic Simulation: Issues and First Solutions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Driver simulation; driving simulation; intelligent transportation systems (ITSs); ITS evaluation; traffic-flow microsimulation	MODELS; CALIBRATION	Driving simulators are very suitable test beds for the evaluation and development of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). However, the impact of such systems on the behavior of individual drivers can properly be analyzed through driving simulators only if autonomous vehicles in the driving scenario move according to the system under evaluation. This condition means that the simulation of the traffic surrounding the interactive vehicle should already take into account the driver's behavior as affected by the system under analysis. Currently, this "loop" is not properly tackled, because the effects on individuals and traffic are, in general, separately and, often, independently evaluated. The integration of traffic and driving simulations, instead, may provide a more consistent solution to this challenging evaluation problem. It also opens up new scenarios for enhancing the credibility of both traffic modeling and driving simulation and for their combined development. For instance, because drivers directly interact with driver/traffic models in a driving simulation environment, such models may also be tested against nonnormative behavior, and this case seems the only way to test driver/traffic models for safety applications. Based on this idea, this paper describes the integration of a driving simulation engine known as SCANeR and a traffic-flow microsimulation model known as AIMSUN. Methodological and technical issues of such integration are first presented, and future enhancements for higher consistency of the simulation environments are finally envisaged.

The population density function along the corridor is exogenous, and except for location vehicles are identical. All vehicles travel along the corridor from home to work in the morning rush hour, and have the same work start-time but may arrive early. The two components of costs are travel time costs and schedule delay (time early) costs. Determining equilibrium and optimum traffic flow patterns for this continuous model, and possible extensions, is termed "The Corridor Problem". Equilibria must satisfy the trip-timing condition, that at each location no vehicle can experience a lower trip price by departing at a different time. This paper investigates the no-toll equilibrium of the basic Corridor Problem. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The output of the measurement is velocity-headway distance data pairs. Because density can be directly acquired by the reciprocal of headway distance, the data pairs have the advantage of better simultaneity than those from common detectors. By now, over 33 000 pairs of data have been collected from two road sections in the cities of Shanghai and Zhengzhou. Through analyzing the video files recording traffic movements on urban expressways, the following issues are studied: laws of vehicle velocity changing with headway distance, proportions of different driving behaviors in the traffic system, and characteristics of traffic flow in snowy days. The results show that the real road traffic is very complex, and factors such as location and climate need to be taken into consideration in the formation of traffic flow models.

And the relevant data of the model are calculated. Through analyzing the results of numerical simulation it is found that the accident has a great influence on the highway traffic flow and considerably on traffic flow density within a certain range. And the influence of the accident blocking point on traffic flow on lane 1 is less than on lane 2. Meanwhile, in this range of traffic flow density, the longer the blocking time and the length of blocking section, the greater the influence of traffic flow is.

Interval Macroscopic Models for Traffic Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Compositional model (CM); interval methods; macroscopic models; METANET model; traffic modeling	FLOW	The development of real-time traffic models is of paramount importance for the purposes of optimizing traffic flow. Inspired by the compositional model (CM) and the METANET model, this paper proposes an interval approach for macroscopic traffic modeling. We develop an interval CM (ICM) and an interval implementation of the METANET model (IMETANET) that provide a natural way of predicting traffic flows without the assumption of uniform distribution of vehicles in a cell. The interval macroscopic models are suitable for real-time applications in road networks and can be part of road traffic surveillance and control systems. The performances of the interval approaches are investigated for both the ICM and the IMETANET models. The efficiency of the interval models is demonstrated over simulated data, and as well as over real traffic data from Motorway Incident Detection and Automatic Signalling (MIDAS) data sets from the United Kingdom.

Mathematical models for acoustical pollution prognosis at signalized intersections	JOURNAL OF VIBROENGINEERING			English	Article						traffic noise; intersection; mathematical model	NOISE	Noise related problems are increasing worldwide with detrimental effects on health and quality of life [18]. The regulations and laws of European Union and Lithuania emphasize the importance of noise reduction, the necessity to collect and disseminate information related to traffic flow, the development of traffic flow mathematical models and their implementation for noise evaluation. In this paper, mathematical methods are applied to determine the noise intensity. Measurements of urban traffic noise were performed at the arterial street intersections in Kaunas ant its suburbs. At this location traffic flow rates are high and noise is dominated by low frequencies. It was determined that the L-Aeq levels decrease continuously till the end of cycle of the green traffic signal. The developed methodology can be used to estimate traffic noise levels in a city and country districts using data provided by the automated traffic flow registration system. The aim of the article is to develop the mathematical model of a longitudinal noise sources and to apply it for the prediction of acoustical pollution in an environment of roads and streets intersections.

J	Hong, WC				Hong, Wei-Chiang			Traffic flow forecasting by seasonal SVR with chaotic simulated annealing algorithm	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Traffic flow forecasting; Seasonal adjustment; Support vector regression (SVR); Chaotic simulated annealing algorithm (CSA); SARIMA; Seasonal Holt-Winters (SHW); Back-propagation neural network (BPNN)	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; NEURAL-NETWORK MODELS; PREDICTION; OPTIMIZATION; RELIABILITY; VOLUME	Accurate forecasting of inter-urban traffic flow has been one of the most important issues globally in the research on road traffic congestion. However, the information of inter-urban traffic presents a challenging situation; the traffic flow forecasting involves a rather complex nonlinear data pattern, particularly during daily peak periods, traffic flow data reveals cyclic (seasonal) trend. In the recent years, the support vector regression model (SVR) has been widely used to solve nonlinear regression and time series problems. However, the applications of SVR models to deal with cyclic (seasonal) trend time series have not been widely explored. This investigation presents a traffic flow forecasting model that combines the seasonal support vector regression model with chaotic simulated annealing algorithm (SSVRCSA), to forecast inter-urban traffic flow. Additionally, a numerical example of traffic flow values from northern Taiwan is employed to elucidate the forecasting performance of the proposed SSVRCSA model. The forecasting results indicate that the proposed model yields more accurate forecasting results than the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and seasonal Holt-Winters (SHW) models. Therefore, the SSVRCSA model is a promising alternative for forecasting traffic flow. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

When modelling traffic flows in the Kaunas city centre, the simulation models of crossroads were created based on the principle of cellular automaton model, taking into consideration such relevant traffic indicators as the average speed of traffic flow in different streets, traffic intensity, congestions and distributed flows. Operation of cellular automaton model is associated with the improved approach of further vehicle model. Modelling of microscopic traffic flows is based on the brake light-cellular automaton (BL-CA) model. Random functions were made discreet and autocorrelation values of these functions were calculated in this work. Fundamental macroscopic traffic characteristics were obtained. Numerical dependences of the average traffic speed and traffic flow, traffic density and traffic flow, the average traffic speed and density were determined, with a help of which the demand parameters of transport network were evaluated in the Kaunas city centre in certain time intervals.

However, to our best knowledge, there seems to be no research about the value and incentive effect of the non-competition guarantee. In the competitive and non-competitive condition respectively, this paper constructs the models of investment value and investment threshold by adopting the option game theory and measurement approach. The results of theory derivation indicate that the non-competition guarantee plays a strong role in investment incentives by reducing investment threshold. The simulation results indicate that the non-guaranteed value increases as the expected growth rate of traffic flow increases, and decreases as volatility increases.

J	Daganzo, CF				Daganzo, Carlos F.			On the macroscopic stability of freeway traffic	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Freeway traffic; Traffic instability; Macroscopic fundamental diagram; Hysteresis	KINEMATIC WAVES; URBAN; VARIABLES; FEATURES; HIGHWAY; MODEL	A simple model of traffic flow is used to analyze the spatio-temporal distribution of flow and density on closed-loop homogeneous freeways with many ramps, which produce inflows and allow outflows. As we would expect, if the on-ramp demand is space-independent then this distribution tends toward uniformity in space if the freeway is either: (i) uncongested; or (ii) congested with queues on its on-ramps and enough inflow to cause the average freeway density to increase with time. In all other cases, however, including any recovery phase of a rush hour where the freeway's average density declines, the distribution of flow and density quickly becomes uneven. This happens even under conditions of perfect symmetry, where the percentage of vehicles exiting at every off ramp is the same. The flow-density deviations from the average are shown to grow exponentially in time and propagate backwards in space with a fixed wave speed. A consequence of this type of instability is that, during recovery, gaps of uncongested traffic will quickly appear in the unevenly congested stream, reducing average flow. This extends the duration of recovery and invariably creates clockwise hysteresis loops on scatter-plots of average system flow vs. density during any rush hour that oversaturates the freeway. All these effects are quantified with formulas and verified with simulations. Some have been observed in real networks. In a more practical vein, it is also shown that the negative effects of instability diminish (i.e., freeway flows increase) if (a) some drivers choose to exit the freeway prematurely when it is too congested and/or (b) freeway access is regulated in a certain traffic-esponsive way. These two findings could be used to improve the algorithms behind VMS displays for driver guidance (finding a), and on-ramp metering rates (finding b). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the data analysis universe, there are two 'schools of thought': the first uses statistics as the tool of choice, while the second - one of the many methods from - Computational Intelligence. Although the goal of both approaches is the same, the two have kept each other at arm's length. Researchers frequently fail to communicate and even understand each other's work. In this paper, we discuss differences and similarities between these two approaches, we review relevant literature and attempt to provide a set of insights for selecting the appropriate approach.

Traffic flow evolution effects to nitrogen dioxides predictability in large metropolitan areas	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Nitrogen dioxide prediction; Temporal neural networks; Modular prediction genetic algorithms	TIME-SERIES; UNIT-ROOT; STATIONARITY; EMISSIONS; INVENTORY; TRANSPORT	A genetically-optimized modular neural network is used to predict the temporal of nitrogen dioxides in a highly congested urban freeway by integrating, in a single prediction shell, information on past values of nitrogen dioxide and ozone, as well as traffic volume, travel speed and occupancy. Results indicate that the approach is more accurate for one and multiple steps ahead predictions when compared to a simple static neural network. They also indicate that the integration of traffic information in the process of prediction improves to some extent the predictability of nitrogen dioxides evolution. It is also shown that the look-back time window for pollutants-related data increases with relation to the increase of the prediction horizon. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

CROSS-CORRELATION ANALYSIS IN MIXED TRAFFIC FLOW TIME SERIES	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B			English	Article						Traffic flow; time series; cross-correlation coefficient	SYNCHRONIZED FLOW; ON-RAMP; MODEL; HIGHWAY; STATES	In this paper, we investigate the complexity behind the mixed traffic flow time series generated by multi-lane cellular automaton model. Throughout the paper, the cross-correlation coefficient is introduced to characterize the time series. It is found that there exists a critical vehicle density S, when S < S(1) and the ratio of slow vehicle R > 0.01, the cross-correlation coefficient r is larger than 0.5, which indicates a significant linear correlation. Otherwise, the cross-correlation coefficient r < 0.5 which corresponds to a weak linear correlation. That is to say, the vehicle density plays an important role in the cross-correlation coefficient. Additionally, we also found that the asymmetric lane-change probability has no great influence on the cross-correlation coefficient.	[Xu, S.

A traffic flow model for U-turn movement based on the NaSch cellular automaton model is proposed to simulate and analyze the dynamics of U-turn movement. The results indicated that the U-turn movement has significant effect on the traffic flow, and it is a typical bottleneck. The U-turn movement can cause phase transition at small probability of vehicle generation and the critical flow also decreases obviously. The system with two U-turn movement is different from the system with one U-turn movement in traffic features such as phase transition and critical flux. The one U-turn system has a good performance. It is suggested that the system with a couple of U-turns may help mitigate the negative effect of U-turn movement in traffic planning and management.

J	Liu, Y; Chang, GL; Yu, J				Liu, Yue; Chang, Gang-Len; Yu, Jie			An Integrated Control Model for Freeway Corridor Under Nonrecurrent Congestion	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Diversion; freeway operation; integrated traffic control; traffic flow model	RAMP CONTROL; MOTORWAY NETWORKS; ROUTE GUIDANCE	This paper presents an integrated model and its solution algorithm for freeway corridor control during incident management. With a parallel arterial as the detour route, the proposed model aims at producing the optimal diversion rates from the freeway mainline to relieve the congestion at the incident segment and concurrently adjust signal timings at the arterial intersections to best accommodate the detour traffic. Different from previous studies, the presented model and algorithm have the following two critical features: 1) modeling explicitly the evolution of detour traffic along the ramps and surface streets with a set of dynamic network flow formulations to capture the local bottlenecks caused by demand surge due to diversion operations and to properly set the responsive signal timing plans and 2) developing a multiobjective optimization framework to maximize the utilization of the available corridor capacity via detour operations but not to incur excessive congestion on the arterials and ramps. This study employs a genetic algorithm (GA)-based heuristic to efficiently yield the reliable solution, depending on the decision maker's preference. Extensive numerical tests on a segment along the I-95 corridor with its neighboring arterials have demonstrated the potential of the developed model for integrated freeway corridor control.

After providing an overview of architecture design of the adaptive TSP system, the article presents an adaptive TSP optimization model that optimizes green splits for three consecutive cycles to minimize the weighted sum of transit vehicle delay and other traffic delay, considering the safety and other operational constraints under the dual-ring structure of signal control. The model is illustrated using a numerical example under medium and heavily congested situations. The findings from a field operational test are also reported to validate and demonstrate the developed TSP system. At a congested intersection, it is found that the average bus delay and average traffic delay along the bus movement direction were reduced by approximately 43% and 16%, respectively. Moreover, the average delay of cross-street traffic was increased by about 12%.

Modeling stochastic live load for long-span bridge based on microscopic traffic flow simulation	COMPUTERS & STRUCTURES			English	Article						Traffic; Live load; Microscopic; Bridge; Simulation	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA MODELS; DYNAMIC-ANALYSIS; HIGHWAY; VEHICLE; WIND; SYSTEMS	A general framework of modeling the stochastic live load from traffic for a long-span bridge is developed. The cellular automaton (CA) traffic flow simulation technique is adopted to develop the analytical basis of the framework. Based on the traffic flow simulation results, the live load on a long-span bridge from the stochastic traffic is studied with a focus on the static component. Parametric studies of major variables of the framework, such as the length of the connecting roadways, the speed limit, and the vehicle combination, are conducted. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Particles are simulated by a cellular automaton model with a slow-to-start (SlS) rule. Spontaneous merging is induced by a local rule that the hopping probability of particles moving in one lane decreases with the approach of particles from the other lane. By means of numerical simulations, we show that, by varying the rate of injection of particles, the SlS rules and the hopping probabilities, the particle flux is improved as a result of the spontaneous zipper merging even if each SDP decreases its hopping probability during the zipper merging. We also investigate asymmetric interactions between particles moving in one lane while ignoring particles in the other lane. We find that asymmetric interactions are unsuitable for improving the particle flux except for the onset of congestion. Lastly, we estimate an approximate particle flux by a mean-field analysis, which confirms the improvement in particle flux, and is in good agreement with the results of numerical simulations.

J	Park, PY; Abdel-Aty, M				Park, Peter Y.; Abdel-Aty, Mohamed			A stochastic catastrophe model using two-fluid model parameters to investigate traffic safety on urban arterials	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Catastrophe model; Urban arterials; Two-fluid model; Pro-active safety	ACCIDENT PROCESS; POISSON; FLOW	During the last few decades, the two-fluid model and its two parameters have been widely used in transportation engineering to represent the quality of operational traffic service on urban arterials. Catastrophe models have also often been used to describe traffic flow on freeway sections. This paper demonstrates the possibility of developing a pro-active network screening tool that estimates the crash rate using a stochastic cusp catastrophe model with the two-fluid model's parameters as inputs. The paper investigates the analogy in logic behind the two-fluid model and the catastrophe model using straightforward graphical illustrations. The paper then demonstrates the application of two-fluid model parameters to a stochastic catastrophe model designed to estimate the level of safety on urban arterials. Current road safety management, including network safety screening, is post-active rather than pro-active in the sense that an existing hotspot must be identified before a safety improvement program can be implemented. This paper suggests that a stochastic catastrophe model can help us to become more pro-active by helping us to identify urban arterials that currently show an acceptable level of safety, but which are vulnerable to turning into crash hotspots.

J	Duret, A; Ahn, S; Buisson, C				Duret, Aurelien; Ahn, Soyoung; Buisson, Christine			Passing Rates to Measure Relaxation and Impact of Lane-Changing in Congestion	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							MULTILANE TRAFFIC FLOW; CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; KINEMATIC WAVES; MICROSCOPIC SIMULATION; DYNAMICS; FEATURES	Passing rate measurements of backward-moving kinematic waves in congestion are applied to quantify two traffic features; a relaxation phenomenon of vehicle lane-changing and impact of lane-changing in traffic streams after the relaxation process is complete. The relaxation phenomenon occurs when either a lane-changer or its immediate follower accepts a short spacing upon insertion and gradually resumes a larger spacing. A simple existing model describes this process with few observable parameters. In this study, the existing model is reformulated to estimate its parameter using passing rate measurements. Calibration results based on vehicle trajectories from two freeway locations indicate that the revised relaxation model matches the observation well. The results also indicate that the relaxation occurs in about 15 seconds and that the shoulder lane exhibits a longer relaxation duration. The passing rate measurements were also employed to quantify the postrelaxation impact of multiple lane-changing maneuvers within a platoon of 10 or more vehicles in queued traffic stream. The analysis of the same data sets shows that lane-changing activities do not induce a long-term change in traffic states; traffic streams are perturbed temporarily by lane-changing maneuvers but return to the initial states after relaxations.

J	Cai, H; Xie, SD				Cai, Hao; Xie, Shaodong			Traffic-related air pollution modeling during the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games: The effects of an odd-even day traffic restriction scheme	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Traffic-related air pollution; Traffic restriction scheme; Air pollution modeling; Ozone weekend effect; Beijing Olympic Games; PM10	SOURCE APPORTIONMENT; CONTRASTING URBAN; EMISSION FACTORS; OZONE; QUALITY; ADMS; DISPERSION; PM2.5; VALIDATION; REGRESSION	An integrated urban air quality modeling system was applied to assess the effects of a short-term odd-even day traffic restriction scheme (TRS) on traffic-related air pollution in the urban area of Beijing (UAB) before, during and after the 2008 Olympic Games. Using traffic flow data retrieved from an on-line traffic monitoring system, concentration levels of CO, PM10, NO2 and O-3 on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th Ring Roads (RR) and Linkage Roads (LRs), the main roads distributed around the UAB, were predicted for the pre- (10th-19th, July), during- (20th July-20th September) and post-TRS (21st-30th, September) periods. A widely used statistical framework for model evaluation was adopted, the dependences of model performance on time-of-the-day and on wind direction were investigated, and the model predictions turned out reasonably satisfactory. Results showed that daily average concentrations on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th RR and LRs decreased significantly during the TRS period, by about 35.8, 38.5, 34.9 and 35.6% for CO, about 38.7, 31.8, 44.0 and 34.7% for PM10, about 30.3, 31.9, 32.3 and 33.9% for NO2, and about 36.7, 33.0, 33.4 and 34.7% for O-3, respectively, compared with the pre-TRS period. Hourly average concentrations were also reduced significantly, particularly for the morning and evening peaks for CO and PM10, for the evening peak for NO2, and for the afternoon peak for O-3. Consequently, both the daily and hourly concentration level of CO, PM10, NO2 and O-3 conformed to the China National Ambient Air Quality Standards Grade II during the Games. In addition, notable reduction of concentration levels was achieved in different regions of Beijing, with the traffic-related air pollution in the downwind northern and western areas relieved most significantly. The TRS policy was therefore effective in alleviating traffic-related air pollution and improving short-term air quality in Beijing during the Games. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Pel, A; Bliemer, M; Hoogendoorn, S				Pel, Adam; Bliemer, Michiel; Hoogendoorn, Serge			Modelling Traveller Behaviour under Emergency Evacuation Conditions	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND INFRASTRUCTURE RESEARCH			English	Article						Compliance; Evacuation; Network modelling; Road infrastructure dynamics; Traffic information; Traveller behaviour	CHOICE SET GENERATION; LANE REVERSAL; INFORMATION; DEMAND; IMPACT	Dynamic traffic simulation models are frequently used to support decisions when planning an evacuation. This paper focuses on limitations in the modelling of travellers' behaviour with respect to traffic information and compliance to evacuation instructions. More specifically, we propose a model framework where the traffic simulation is executed only once (instead of many times within an iterative traffic flow convergence framework, e. g., yielding a user-equilibrium assignment). Within this one-time execution of the traffic simulation (or dynamic network loading procedure), travellers are initially assigned to their instructed route (and destination), yet may continuously update their destination and route during their trip - while accounting for the possibly disutility associated with non-compliance - thereby responding to the changing (traffic) conditions (but not anticipating these conditions, as otherwise assumed by an iterative user-equilibrium assignment). This way, the realized departure time, destination and route decisions are a result of the trade-off that travellers make between complying with the prescribed travel behaviour and following their preferred travel behaviour (i.e., the travel decisions that would have been made in absence of an active evacuation plan). Also, this approach allows modelling full compliance, no compliance, and any state in between. The face-validity of the model characteristics are illustrated using a hypothetical test example. The results show the importance of capturing compliance and information levels in the traffic simulation model, as they have a large impact upon the evacuation efficiency.

In our model, we present the effect of slopes on the acceleration/deceleration capabilities and safety distance of the vehicles in highways as in real traffic situations. By numerical simulations, we investigate the dependence of the vehicle capacities in highways on the length and grade of slopes. It is shown that the larger the slope grade, the more significant the effect of slopes on the traffic flow is. Especially when the slope grade is beyond a certain value (i.e. vertical bar sigma vertical bar > 3%), the effect of slopes on traffic flow becomes quite markedly.

Based on the model, the characteristics of the urban traffic flow on a single-lane road are investigated under three different control strategies, i.e., the synchronized, the green wave and the random strategies. The fundamental diagrams and time-space patterns of the traffic flows are provided for these strategies respectively. It finds that the dynamical transition to the congested flow appears when the vehicle density is higher than a critical level. The saturated flow is less dependent on the cycle time and the strategies of the traffic light control, while the critical vehicle density varies with the cycle time and the strategies. Simulated results indicate that the green wave strategy is proven to be the most effective one among the above three control strategies.

We apply this model to an existing road network in the Australian city of Melbourne, using empirical data as input. For comparison, we also apply this model to a square-grid network using hypothetical input data. On both networks we compare the effects of non-adaptive versus adaptive traffic lights, in which instantaneous traffic state information feeds back into the traffic signal schedule. We observe that not only do adaptive traffic lights result in better averages of network observables, they also lead to significantly smaller fluctuations in these observables. We furthermore compare two different systems of adaptive traffic signals, one which is informed by the traffic state on both upstream and downstream links and one which is informed by upstream links only. We find that, in general, both the mean and the fluctuation of the travel time are smallest when using the joint upstream-downstream control strategy.

A stochastic computational framework for the joint transportation network fragility analysis and traffic flow distribution under extreme events	PROBABILISTIC ENGINEERING MECHANICS			English	Article						Transportation networks; Bridges; Fragility analysis; Random field simulation; Extreme events; HAZUS	SYSTEM RELIABILITY METHOD; SEISMIC RESILIENCE; SHORTEST-PATH; ALGORITHMS; BRIDGES	This paper deals with a novel technique that jointly uses structural fragility analysis, network flow analysis, and random field theory to assess the correlation among the damage levels of bridges in a transportation network under extreme events, and to estimate the sensitivity of the network performance to the correlation distance. A stochastic computational framework for the combined use of the individual bridge damage level due to extreme events and the bridge network performance evaluation is presented. Random field theory is used to simulate the bridge damage level, so that iris possible to directly control its correlation and perform a parametric analysis. Two numerical examples that involve bridges in parallel and series configurations subject to extreme events (e.g. earthquakes) show that the correlation distance of the damage can strongly affect the network performance indicators. Therefore, this correlation should be taken into account for every analysis that involves the network performance assessment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Guo, RJ; Lin, BL				Guo, Rui-Jun; Lin, Bo-Liang			Gap Acceptance at Priority-Controlled Intersections	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Gap Acceptance; Priority-controlled intersection; Critical gap; Rejected proportion; Total accepted coefficient; Capacity	CAPACITY	Critical gap is the threshold by which drivers in the minor stream judge whether to accept a gap. If the gap is larger than critical gap, drivers accept it and enter the intersection; otherwise, drivers reject the gap and wait for the next gap. At a priority-controlled intersection, critical gap is usually considered as a fixed value or to follow a certain distribution. The major stream and minor stream are both one-way traffic flows at the priority-controlled intersection. Vehicles in the major stream have priority to run into conflict sections, and vehicles in the minor stream can enter conflict sections during the larger gap of two successive vehicles in the major stream. The capacity of minor roads is the maximum number of vehicles that can pass the intersection during a special period under prevailing roadway, traffic, and control conditions. Under a few assumptions, the survey method of rejected gaps and accepted gaps was designed. Four new calculation models of the critical gap are proposed. The probability function of rejected gap and accepted gap can be deduced by exponential rejected proportion function. Some important relations among variables of these functions can be obtained. The typical capacity functions were improved in terms of accepted proportion function. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000217. (C) 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.

In this paper we propose a generic model of cooperation among vehicles, which is designed not to saturate the communication medium and to be insensitive to information loss among vehicles. We also propose an original software simulator, which helps us to show how this model can be used in realistic traffic situations. In the simulation, we evaluate one instance of our model, which features an algorithm for limiting the risks of information storms. This feature is particularly interesting in urban settings, where radio communication must fit within the traditional IEEE-802.11 traffic. We show that this algorithm can considerably reduce the amount of communication, without affecting the quality of traffic self-organization. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A stability analysis of the proposed model provides the conditions that ensure its linear stability. Issues related to lane changing, shock waves and rarefaction waves, local clustering and phase transition are also investigated with numerical experiments. The simulation results show that the proposed model is capable of providing explanations to some particular traffic phenomena commonly observable in real traffic flows.

Due to complex nonlinear data pattern of the urban traffic flow, there are many kinds of traffic flow forecasting techniques in literature, thus, it is difficult to make a general conclusion which forecasting technique is superior to others. Recently, the support vector regression model (SVR) has been widely used to solve nonlinear regression and time series problems. This investigation presents a SVR traffic flow forecasting model which employs the hybrid genetic algorithm-simulated annealing algorithm (GA-SA) to determine its suitable parameter combination. Additionally, a numerical example of traffic flow data from northern Taiwan is used to elucidate the forecasting performance of the proposed SVRGA-SA model. The forecasting results indicate that the proposed model yields more accurate forecasting results than the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), back-propagation neural network (BPNN), Holt-Winters (HW) and seasonal Holt-Winters (SHW) models. Therefore, the SVRGA-SA model is a promising alternative for forecasting traffic flow. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We synthesized the results of studies and reviews that explore the effects of roads on birds with an emphasis on paved roads. The well-known direct effects of roads on birds include habitat loss and fragmentation, vehicle-caused mortality, pollution, and poisoning. Nevertheless, indirect effects may exert a greater influence on bird populations. These effects include noise, artificial light, barriers to movement, and edges associated with roads. Moreover, indirect and direct effects may act synergistically to cause decreases in population density and species richness. Of the many effects of roads, it appears that road mortality and traffic noise may have the most substantial effects on birds relative to other effects and taxonomic groups. Potential measures for mitigating the detrimental effects of roads include noise-reduction strategies and changes to roadway lighting and vegetation and traffic flow. Road networks and traffic volumes are projected to increase in many countries around the world. Increasing habitat loss and fragmentation and predicted species distribution shifts due to climate change are likely to compound the overall effects of roads on birds.	[Kociolek, A. V.; Clevenger, A.

However, existing dynamic OD prediction models do not achieve this reliably for two main reasons. First, this is a bi-level system that consists of a traffic flow process at the lower level and a dynamic OD process at the upper level. Due to the inherent non-convexity of bi-level systems, it is difficult to guarantee that any calculated solution is globally optimal. In this paper, we propose a new traffic flow model that uses real-time traffic data, such as traffic flows, speed and occupancy, collected from vehicle detectors, to address the difficulties that arise in existing bi-level programming formulations. Second, in order to estimate a dynamic OD demand between on and off-ramps on the freeways, a traffic flow model is needed to estimate the proportion of traffic moving between them. In this paper, we present a dynamic traffic estimation model based on Kerner's [1] three-phase traffic theory, which represents the complexity of traffic phenomena based on phase transitions between free-flow, synchronized flow and moving jam phases, and on their complex nonlinear spatio-temporal features. The present model explains and estimates traffic congestion in terms of speed breakdown, phase transition and queue propagation. We show how a genetic algorithm can be used to solve this to estimate dynamic OD flows and the associated link, on and off-ramp flows during each time interval using traffic data collected from vehicle detection systems implemented on Korean freeways.

J	Hellinga, B; Mandelzys, M				Hellinga, Bruce; Mandelzys, Michael			Impact of Driver Compliance on the Safety and Operational Impacts of Freeway Variable Speed Limit Systems	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Variable speed limit; Safety; Modeling; Traffic control; Driver compliance		Variable speed limit (VSL) systems enable freeway system managers to change the posted speed limit on a section of roadway in response to varying conditions. VSL system goals may include homogenizing traffic flow, improving safety, and/or reducing driver stress. Although it is understood that the effectiveness of VSL systems is impacted by the level of driver compliance, which itself is influenced by the extent of speed limit enforcement, very little is known about the strength of these impacts. This paper uses a simulation model to evaluate the sensitivity of the safety and operational impacts of VSL to driver compliance. Several scenarios for driver compliance were modeled using the PARAMICS microscopic traffic simulator. Findings indicated that VSL impacts are very sensitive to the level of driver compliance. Safety was shown to be positively correlated with the level of compliance, and travel time was shown to be negatively correlated. However, it was also found that the magnitude of the impact is strongly influenced by the VSL control strategy (i.e., set of rules for incrementing and decrementing the speed limits) being used. Therefore, selection of the VSL control strategy cannot be done independently of the decision regarding speed limit enforcement. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000214.

J	Rodriguez-Molares, A; Sobreira-Seoane, MA; Martin-Herrero, J				Rodriguez-Molares, Alfonso; Sobreira-Seoane, Manuel A.; Martin-Herrero, Julio			Noise variability due to traffic spatial distribution	APPLIED ACOUSTICS			English	Article						Traffic noise; Uncertainty; Spatial distribution	PREDICTION; DYNAMICS; MODELS	The inverse relation of the uncertainty of the equivalent sound pressure level to the square root of the number of vehicle pass-bys is investigated. The influence of the traffic spatial distribution is evaluated by means of a computer model, based on Monte Carlo and the Weyl-Ingard Theory. The model results are discussed and compared with experimental data. By least mean squares fitting of simulated results, a new expression is obtained for the sound pressure level uncertainty, that takes into account the receiver position, road configuration and traffic flow balance. This expression explains the different values found in the literature and yields uncertainty values that may not be covered by the ISO 1996-2:2007 recommendation, in some specific circumstances. Finally the path for building traffic noise uncertainty maps is sketched out. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The delay probability of a vehicle depends on its corresponding gap. According to simulation results, it has been found that the structure of the fundamental diagram of the new model is sensitively dependent on the values of the delay probability. In comparison with the NS model, one notes that the fundamental diagram of the new model is more consistent with the results measured in the real traffic, and the velocity distributions of the new model are relatively reasonable.

Heterogeneity in car-following behavior: Theory and empirics	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory (ISTTT 18)	JUL, 2009	Polytech Univ, Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA		Polytech Univ	Car-following models; Model calibration	TRAFFIC FLOW; MODEL	The aim of this paper is to gain insights into the level of heterogeneity in car-following behavior in real traffic. We use a large sample of trajectory observations collected by means of a helicopter to identify differences between the car-following behaviors of: (1) passenger car drivers, (2) passenger car drivers and truck drivers and (3) passenger car drivers following a passenger car and passenger car drivers following a truck. We thereto calibrate eight car-following models making different assumptions about the way in which drivers follow their leader(s) on the same lane. We show that considerable behavioral differences exist between passenger car drivers. Different passenger car drivers do not only consider different stimuli (like speed difference(s) with the leading car(s) and distance headway(s) to leading car(s)) but also the extents to which these stimuli influence their behavior differ. Truck drivers turn furthermore out to adopt in general a more robust car-following behavior than passenger car drivers. Their speeds show, for example, less variation over time. We also find indications that the desired headways of passenger car drivers are lower when following a truck than when following a passenger car. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

By statistical analysis of traffic data from the UK motorway network, we find that the functional form preferred for this does not have an explicit jam density that will induce zero speed in traffic. We deduce that it is zero speed that induces jam density in traffic rather than vice versa, so that the direction of causality between speed and density differs according to circumstances. We develop an approach to modelling traffic in light of this. We apply this to analyse speed control as a traffic management measure and show how it can be used to estimate the effect of speed management on road capacity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Modeling heterogeneous network user route and departure time responses to dynamic pricing	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory (ISTTT 18)	JUL, 2009	Polytech Univ, Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA		Polytech Univ	User responses to pricing; Dynamic traffic assignment; Simultaneous route and departure time user equilibrium; Dynamic road pricing; User heterogeneity	SOLUTION ALGORITHM; EQUILIBRIUM PROBLEM; CHOICE; RELIABILITY	The ability to realistically capture trip-makers' responses to time-varying road charges is essential for network equilibrium assignment models typically applied to predict network flows in the presence of dynamic road (congestion) pricing. User responses to pricing are governed by individual trip-makers' preferences, such as their value of time (VOT), and the cost they attach to late vs. early arrival relative to the destination. These behavioral characteristics vary across users. This paper presents a joint route and departure time network equilibrium assignment model explicitly considering heterogeneous users with different preferred arrival times at destinations, VOT, and values of early and late schedule delays (VOESD and VOLSD). The model is formulated as an infinite-dimensional variational inequality and solved by a column generation-based algorithmic framework that embeds: (i) an extreme non-dominated alternative-generating algorithm to obtain combinations of VOT. VOESD, and VOLSD subintervals (or breakpoints) that define multiple user classes, and the corresponding least trip cost alternative (joint departure time and path) for each user class, (ii) a traffic simulator to capture traffic flow dynamics and determine experienced travel costs; and (iii) a multi-class alternative flow updating scheme to solve the reduced multi-class simultaneous route and departure time user equilibrium problem defined by a subset of feasible alternatives.

J	Zheng, LA; Ma, SF; Zhong, SQ				Zheng, Liang; Ma, Shoufeng; Zhong, Shiquan			Analysis of honk effect on the traffic flow in a cellular automaton model	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Cellular automaton; Traffic flow; Honk effect; Slow-to-start	CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; DIFFERENCE MODEL; STATES; SIMULATION; VELOCITY; HIGHWAY; JAMS	The paper mainly studies the following vehicle's honk effect on the driver of its predecessors in the single-lane cellular automaton model (CA model); besides, the determined condition of honk's state is investigated in detail, which has seldom been studied before. Then, the influence of honk sensitivity threshold and slow-to-start sensitivity threshold on the traffic flow is examined: the numerical simulations indicate that the smaller the honk sensitivity threshold or the larger the slow-to-start sensitivity threshold, a heavier synchronized flow can be maintained. Three main factors of S -> J transition are then analyzed and the process of S -> J transition is observed. Finally, a contrastive study is made on the performances of three different CA models from four aspects, it is evidenced that the performance of the new CA model proposed in the paper is the best and more consistent with the real traffic. Therefore, the following vehicle's honk effect should not be neglected in study of the traffic flow. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kayacan, O				Kayacan, Ozhan			A theoretical model for uni-directional ant trails	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Ant trails; Cellular automata; Computer simulation	STATISTICAL PHYSICS; TRAFFIC FLOW; OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEMS	A theoretical model of uni-directional ant traffic, motivated by the motion of ants in trail is proposed. Two different type of ants, one of which smells very well and the other does not, are considered. The flux of ants in this model is investigated as functions of the probability of evaporation rate of pheromone. The obtained results indicate that the mean velocity of the ants varies non-monotonically with their density. In addition, it is observed that phase transition in the flux and the mean velocity vs. density occurs at certain density for a fixed evaporation rate. The effective hopping probability is investigated as well depending on the evaporation rate of pheromone. It is worth to note that the proposed model can be generalized for vehicular traffic on freeways. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A set of traffic lights operating in a fixed-time scheme controls the traffic flow. An open boundary condition is applied to the streets each of which conducts a unidirectional flow. Streets are single lane and cars can turn upon reaching to the intersection with prescribed probabilities. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to find the model flow characteristics. In particular, we investigate the flow dependence on signalization parameters, turning probabilities and input rates. It is shown that for each set of parameters, there exists a plateau region inside which the total outflow from the intersection remains almost constant. We also compute total waiting time of vehicles per cycle behind red lights for various control parameters.	[Foulaadvand, M.

J	Naito, Y; Nagatani, T				Naito, Yuichi; Nagatani, Takashi			Safety-collision transition induced by lane changing in traffic flow	PHYSICS LETTERS A			English	Article						Vehicular dynamics; Self-driven many-particle system; Collision; Safety; Dynamical transition	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; MODEL; SIMULATION; DYNAMICS; PHYSICS; STATES	We study the traffic behavior when a vehicle changes from the first lane to the second lane on a two-lane highway. We apply the optimal velocity model to the vehicular motion. If the incoming vehicle does not decelerate successfully, it crashes into the vehicle ahead. On the other hand, if the headway between the incoming vehicle and the vehicle behind on the second lane is not long sufficiently, the rear vehicle may come into collision with the incoming vehicle. The safety-collision transition occurs by changing the lane. The dynamical transition depends highly on the vehicular speed, the sensitivity, and the headway. We derive the phase diagram (or region map) for the safety-collision transition. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Optimum principle for a vehicular traffic network: minimum probability of congestion	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL			English	Article							SYSTEMS; INFORMATION; FEEDBACK; PHYSICS; FLOW	We introduce an optimum principle for a vehicular traffic network with road bottlenecks. This network breakdown minimization ( BM) principle states that the network optimum is reached when link flow rates are assigned in the network in such a way that the probability for spontaneous occurrence of traffic breakdown in at least one of the network bottlenecks during a given observation time reaches the minimum possible value. Based on numerical simulations with a stochastic three-phase traffic flow model, we show that in comparison to the well-known Wardrop's principles, the application of the BM principle permits considerably greater network inflow rates at which no traffic breakdown occurs and, therefore, free flow remains in the whole network.

When analyzing multilane traffic flow, it is important how we define lane-changing rules. However, conventional models have used simple lane-changing rules that are dependent only on the distance from neighboring vehicles. We propose a new lane-changing rule considering velocity differences with neighboring vehicles; in addition, we embed the rules into a variant of the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NaSch) model, called the S-NFS model, by considering an open boundary condition. Using numerical simulations, we clarify the basic characteristics resulting from different assumptions with respect to lane changing.

J	Gokhale, S				Gokhale, Sharad			Traffic flow pattern and meteorology at two distinct urban junctions with impacts on air quality	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Pollutant emission; Urban air quality; Traffic flow; Traffic junction; Pollution episode	CARBON-MONOXIDE CONCENTRATIONS; FINITE LINE SOURCE; MODEL; INTERSECTION; DISPERSION; EMISSIONS	Traffic during operation at a junction undergoes different flow conditions and modal events which result into dynamic fleet characteristics generating more emissions and stronger vehicle-induced heat and wakes generating obscure dispersion. Traffic in a manner operated at junctions often creates pockets of higher concentrations the locations of which shift as a result of the combine effects of traffic dynamics and random airflow. This research examined the impacts of traffic dynamics and meteorology on the levels and locations of higher concentrations of pollutant CO, NO(2) and PM within the influence of signalized traffic intersection and a conventional two-lane roundabout in a response to varying flow conditions and emissions resulted from the traffic operations. Three line source dispersion models have been used to determine the impact on air quality. Emissions have been calculated for different scenarios developed from different combinations of semi-empirical and field based time and space-mean speeds and lane-width based density when traffic undergoes free, interrupted and congested-flow conditions during operation. It has been found that the locations of highest concentrations within the domain change as traffic with different modal share encounters different flow conditions at different times of a day.

The proposed method enables approximation of the yearly average value of the day-night sound level, L(den), and its uncertainty, U(den). The method requires measurements of the one-hour average sound level, L(Aeq),(1h), and concurrent measurements of the hourly traffic flow and traffic speed. The measurements have to be carried out under four types of meteorological conditions. Calculations of L(den) and U(den) are facilitated by the use of the Japanese model of noise generation.

J	Jagabathula, S; Shah, D				Jagabathula, Srikanth; Shah, Devavrat			Fair Scheduling in Networks Through Packet Election	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY			English	Article						Fair scheduling; packet-based fairness; ranked election; throughput optimality	THROUGHPUT; STABILITY	We consider the problem of designing a fair scheduling algorithm for discrete-time constrained queuing networks. Each queue has dedicated exogenous packet arrivals. There are constraints on which queues can be served simultaneously. This model effectively describes important special instances like network switches, interference in wireless networks, bandwidth sharing for congestion control and traffic scheduling in road roundabouts. Fair scheduling is required because it provides isolation to different traffic flows; isolation makes the system more robust and enables providing quality of service. Existing work on fairness for constrained networks concentrates on flow based fairness. As a main result, we describe a notion of packet based fairness by establishing an analogy with the ranked election problem: packets are voters, schedules are candidates, and each packet ranks the schedules based on its priorities. We then obtain a scheduling algorithm that achieves the described notion of fairness by drawing upon the seminal work of Goodman and Markowitz (1952). This yields the familiar Maximum Weight (MW) style algorithm. As another important result, we prove that the algorithm obtained is throughput optimal. There is no reason a priori why this should be true, and the proof requires nontraditional methods.

Vehicle infrastructure integration system using vision sensors to prevent accidents in traffic flow	IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article							TRACKING; MODELS; ROBUST	This study describes the development of a vision sensor for detecting shock waves which is one of the main factors of accidents in highway traffic flow. The major contributions of this research are development of vehicle tracking and detection of shock wave in saturated traffic. Moreover, realisation of a vehicle infrastructure integration (VII) system for providing arrival information of such propagation to drivers is proposed. The experiment on the analysis of the propagation with the developed image sensor has shown that an error might occur in the arrival time information of the propagation provided to the driver. Therefore a prediction technique at the arrival time of the propagation is integrated in the authors' system. By using this prediction technique and taking the error tolerance of drivers into account, the experimental results show that prediction success rates are improved by about 5%.

The procedure was extended from homogeneous traffic flow to mixed traffic flow. The conflicts among cars, buses and bicycles near the stop can be described by the extended procedure. The procedure can be understood more easily than the theory of gap acceptance. Car capacity near the stop is the function of both bus stream and bicycle stream. The proposed model can also analyze the cases of pedestrian effects and limited priority of bicyclists. Numerical results show that the car capacity decreases with the increasing flow rates of other streams. In addition, pedestrian effects and bicyclist's limited priority have negative effects on car capacity near bus stops with mixed traffic flow.

Using a realistic microscopic model to represent the vehicular traffic flow, we investigate the performance of the above broadcast algorithm classes by simulation, considering different classes of network services (e. g., Critical, Normal, and Low-priority). In order to explore a very large algorithmic design space, we devise a convex hull framework that allows us to effectively compare and compactly present the boundaries of the solution space for each algorithm class. By the use of such framework, we show that the beaconless performance encompasses a wider spectrum with respect to the beaconed one, with lower complexity and overhead.

Under any conditions, traffic congestion reduces the annual average sound level. The final conclusion is that strong traffic congestion cannot be ignored in noise prediction. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Kim, J; Park, B; Lee, J; Won, J				Kim, Joonhyo; Park, Byungkyu (Brian); Lee, Joyoung; Won, Jongsun			Determining optimal sensor locations in freeway using genetic algorithm-based optimization	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Genetic algorithm; Traffic simulation; Travel time estimation; VISSIM-based freeway modeling; Transportation management		Travel time is the most intuitive measure of effectiveness for road users and transportation agency operators. However, travel times derived from speed data measured at fixed point sensors often varies from actual travel time. This is, in part, due to the intentional positioning of sensors to avoid lane changing and/or to inadequate numbers of sensors capturing the dynamic characteristics inherent in freeway traffic flow. This paper presents an approach that optimizes the location of sensors in a freeway to support more accurate estimations of travel times than those obtained from conventionally deployed fixed point sensors. Evaluation results, under varying traffic conditions, including incidents, showed that the proposed approach produced average travel time estimation errors within 10% and performed much better than the conventional approach. Thus, the proposed approach provides a promising tool to support re-positioning of the existing non-intrusive point sensors (e.g., video sensors) or deployment of new sets of point sensors for improving travel time estimation.

JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Air pollution; Transportation; Trade services; Environmental policy; Panel data; SUR model	REGRESSIONS; TESTS; RATES	We apply a fixed-effects model to examine the impact of trade and environmental policies on air quality at ports along the U.S.-Mexico border. We control for other factors influencing air quality, such as air quality of cities near the border, volume of traffic flows and congestion. Results show the air quality improved after 2004, when the diesel engine policy was applied. We see mixed results for the trade policy, whose implementation time varies across ports along the international border. Controlling for air quality in cities near the border is essential for assessing the policy contributions to air quality. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Because the information of inter-urban traffic presents a challenging situation, the traffic flow forecasting involves a rather complex nonlinear data pattern. In the recent years, the support vector regression model (SVR) has been widely used to solve nonlinear regression and time series problems. This investigation presents a short-term traffic forecasting model which combines the support vector regression model with continuous ant colony optimization algorithms (SVRCACO) to forecast inter-urban traffic flow. Additionally, a numerical example of traffic flow values from northern Taiwan is employed to elucidate the forecasting performance of the proposed SVRCACO model. The forecasting results indicate that the proposed model yields more accurate forecasting results than the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) time series model. Therefore, the SVRCACO model is a promising alternative for forecasting traffic flow. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Stochastic cell transmission model (SCTM): A stochastic dynamic traffic model for traffic state surveillance and assignment	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Cell transmission model discrete time bilinear stochastic system; Dynamic link model; Macroscopic stochastic dynamic traffic model; Traffic flow		The paper proposes a first-order macroscopic stochastic dynamic traffic model, namely the stochastic cell transmission model (SCTM), to model traffic flow density on freeway segments with stochastic demand and supply. The SCTM consists of five operational modes corresponding to different congestion levels of the freeway segment. Each mode is formulated as a discrete time bilinear stochastic system. A set of probabilistic conditions is proposed to characterize the probability of occurrence of each mode. The overall effect of the five modes is estimated by the joint traffic density which is derived from the theory of finite mixture distribution. The SCTM captures not only the mean and standard deviation (SD) of density of the traffic flow, but also the propagation of SD over time and space. The SCTM is tested with a hypothetical freeway corridor simulation and an empirical study. The simulation results are compared against the means and SDs of traffic densities obtained from the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) of the modified cell transmission model (MCTM). An approximately two-miles freeway segment of Interstate 210 West (I-210W) in Los Ageles, Southern California, is chosen for the empirical study. Traffic data is obtained from the Performance Measurement System (PeMS). The stochastic parameters of the SCTM are calibrated against the flow-density empirical data of I-210W. Both the SCTM and the MCS of the MCTM are tested. A discussion of the computational efficiency and the accuracy issues of the two methods is provided based on the empirical results. Both the numerical simulation results and the empirical results confirm that the SCTM is capable of accurately estimating the means and SDs of the freeway densities as compared to the MCS.

This study investigated the association between road traffic noise exposure and the prevalence of diagnosed hypertension among 321 male and 499 female resided near main roads in Taichung, Taiwan. Road traffic noise levels and traffic flow rates were measured simultaneously during 0900-1700 on weekdays in 2008. Multivariate logistic regressions were applied to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for hypertension by adjusting for potential confounders. Road traffic noise levels were significantly associated with traffic flow rates of motorcycles, light-duty gasoline vehicles, light-duty diesel trucks and heavy-duty diesel trucks and had the highest correlation with motorcycles. Per one unit (vehicle per hour) increase in the log-transformed traffic flow rate of motorcycles was significantly related to the increment of 7.20 +/- 1.40 A-weighted decibels (dBA) in the traffic noise exposure. The high-exposure group (82.2 +/- 1.7 dBA, n = 358) had the significantly higher prevalence of hypertension (adjusted OR = 2.15,95% CI = 1.08-4.26) than the low-exposure group (77.2 +/- 1.6 dBA, n = 462). There was an increasing trend (p = 0.023) between the prevalence of hypertension and residents exposed to <77 dBA, 77-80 dBA, 80-83 dBA and >= 83 dBA, respectively. Such an association was pronounced after adjusting for the total traffic flow rate. The study findings suggest that road traffic noise exposure may be associated with hypertension and the dominant source of traffic noise is motorcycles in central Taiwan. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	Pandian, S; Gokhale, S; Ghoshal, AK				Pandian, Suresh; Gokhale, Sharad; Ghoshal, Aloke Kumar			An open-terrain line source model coupled with street-canyon effects to forecast carbon monoxide at traffic roundabout	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Traffic emission; Air quality; Roundabout; Street canyon; Traffic flow; Dispersion model	VEHICULAR POLLUTION PREDICTION; SEMIEMPIRICAL MODEL; URBAN ENVIRONMENTS; DISPERSION; FLOW; ROADWAYS; WIND	A double-lane four-arm roundabout, where traffic movement is continuous in opposite directions and at different speeds, produces a zone responsible for recirculation of emissions within a road section creating canyon-type effect. In this zone, an effect of thermally induced turbulence together with vehicle wake dominates over wind driven turbulence causing pollutant emission to flow within, resulting into more or less equal amount of pollutants upwind and downwind particularly during low winds. Beyond this region, however, the effect of winds becomes stronger, causing downwind movement of pollutants. Pollutant dispersion caused by such phenomenon cannot be described accurately by open-terrain line source model alone. This is demonstrated by estimating one-minute average carbon monoxide concentration by coupling an open-terrain line source model with a street canyon model which captures the combine effect to describe the dispersion at non-signalized roundabout. The results of the modeling matched well with the measurements compared with the line source model alone and the prediction error reduced by about 50%. The study further demonstrated this with traffic emissions calculated by field and semi-empirical methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Florian. 2002. A note on the entropy solutions of the hydrodynamic model of traffic flow. Transportation Sci. 36(4) 435-446) dealing with the entropy condition in traffic flow models. It aims to clarify the application of this condition for nondifferentiable fundamental diagrams and then to correct some misunderstandings that appear in the above-mentioned paper. This note clearly exhibits that the nonsmoothness of the fundamental diagram does not change the properties of the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) solutions: (i) existence of a unique entropy solution and (ii) nonuniqueness of weak solutions. These precisions are important because piecewise linear fundamental diagrams appear to accurately fit with experimental observations and cannot be disproved on an alleged mathematical basis.

The simulation results show that, for asymmetric two-route model, average flux can be significantly improved if only partial road information is provided for road users. However, for symmetric two-route model, average flux of the two routes adopting information feedback cannot outweigh the flux of two routes chosen completely at random. We explain the results by studying the vehicle number on two routes. We hope the study may provide a good suggestion to the design of Advanced Traveler Information Systems.

J	Ugarte, MF; Briz, S; Duran, L				Ugarte, M. F.; Briz, S.; Duran, L.			Nonintrusive system for road traffic detection and characterization	REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS			English	Article								Knowing the number, type, and velocity of the vehicles that drive along a road is extremely important to manage efficiently the traffic flow and also to estimate the environmental impact that the road may have in the surroundings. In this work the development and preliminary tests for a nonintrusive instrument and method for traffic characterization have been carried out. The system is part of a methodology to estimate the contaminants emitted to air due to urban and suburban road traffic. Based on a set of ultrasonic sensors, the system has shown reliability and accuracy in the determination of the number, type, and velocity of vehicles in a suburban road with several lanes and two ways. The success of this system lies on the method and data processing which overcomes the intrinsic noise problems of ultrasonic sensors. The developed system is easy to install and does not interfere with the road traffic. It is also of low cost, has no moving parts, and requires small power supply. The proposed system is an ideal tool to perform traffic studies where portability and low costs are required, for example, in environmental impact assessments studies.

J	Karwa, V; Donnell, ET				Karwa, Vishesh; Donnell, Eric T.			Predicting Pavement Marking Retroreflectivity Using Artificial Neural Networks: Exploratory Analysis	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Pavement markings; Neural networks; North Carolina; Degradation; Service life	INFORMATION CRITERION; MODEL	Providing adequate nighttime visibility to roadway users is an important consideration for state and local transportation agencies. Driving at night is less dangerous when pavement markings are easily discernable. Retroreflectivity is a measure of nighttime visibility. Transportation agencies could use estimates of the expected service life of pavement markings to plan restriping operations at a time when markings are near a minimum threshold level of retroreflectivity. The present study proposes the use of an artificial neural network to predict pavement marking retroreflectivity as a function of initial retroreflectivity, the age of the markings, traffic flow, pavement marking type, and route location information using data from North Carolina. The results show that many of the input variables have a nonlinear association with pavement marking retroreflectivity. Surface plots of the degradation pattern are provided to illustrate the relationship between input and output variables. Estimates of service life are provided to show how the output can be used to manage pavement marking systems.

Based on the analysis on the cellular automata theory, and combining with on-site survey data, several key parameters were defined, namely, cellular length, cellular speed, cellular acceleration, updating time interval. In addition, cellular acceleration rule, cellular deceleration rule, random rule, lane-changing rule and other micro-simulation rules were set, and cellular automaton micro-simulation model was set up. Furthermore, a micro-simulation module was developed for traffic operation actions of on-ramp junction with Matlab toolbox. Finally, a simulation experiment for traffic operation reliability was done with this micro-simulation module, and the situation of change for on-ramp junction area was obtained under the conditions of different mainline design speed, acceleration lane length, vehicle generation probability and lane-changing probability. The results show that operation reliability for on-ramp junction is determined by the parameters of the probability of vehicle generation and the length of acceleration lane, especially for on-ramp.

The proposed HORC comprises a fuzzy logic system and a decision-making model. The former determines the switching probability of the traffic light, while the latter makes the decision concerning the switching of the traffic light. The HORC requires only the velocities and the difference of velocities of the vehicles that are entering the highway. Simulation results indicate that the proposed HORC outperforms pre-timed ramp control.

To investigate the effect of bicycles going in the wrong direction, a Bi-Directional Adaptive EBCA model is developed in this paper. The phase transition F-J as well as the phase transition F-S-F are suggested by observing the spatial-temporal pattern. The deterministic case that the linear relationship between the average flow rate and the bicycle number disappears when the average density exceeds a particular value is shown. Under the stochastic case, the impacts of the avoiding probability Ps and the returning probability Pr on the traffic system are analyzed. The results of the simulation are in good agreement with the realistic bicycle flow.

Phys. A 41:465001, 2008). It is shown that with different configurations of hopping rates, the two-lane system exhibits diverse phase diagram and density profiles. Specifically, it shows how the phase diagram changes from having seven phases, via six phases, to three phases. Moreover, it shows that the phase diagram could have only one phase, which exhibits quadrilateral or triangular density profile. The vertical cluster mean-field approach is used to get the stationary-state bulk densities and phase diagrams.

The modeled region is arbitrary in shape with a single central business district (CBD) and travelers continuously distributed over the region. Within this region, the road network is represented as a continuum and travelers patronize a two-dimensional continuum transportation system to travel to the CBD. The PDUO-C model is solved by a promising solution algorithm that includes elements of the finite volume method (FVM), the finite element method (FEM), and the explicit total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta (TVD-RK) time-stepping method. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the utility of the proposed model and the effectiveness of the solution algorithm in solving this PDUO-C problem. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A wavelet-based freeway incident detection algorithm with adapting threshold parameters	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Freeway operations; Incident detection algorithms; Multi-resolution analysis; Wavelets; Varying threshold value	NEURAL-NETWORK; MODELS	This paper presents a wavelet-based novel freeway automated incident detection algorithm with varying threshold parameters considering the level of traffic flow. In this approach, new test statistics for incident detection are extracted from occupancy and speed data using discrete wavelet transform, which decomposes traffic measurements into different resolution-time components. Unlike conventional incident detection algorithms, which apply fixed threshold values and often result in undesirably high false alarm rates, our proposed algorithm varies its threshold values adaptively based on the level of traffic volume. We have derived the mathematical relationship between the false alarm probability and the threshold value of our proposed decision function. For a given target false alarm rate, the threshold values can be changed adaptively depending on the traffic levels of normal traffic conditions. Also, we propose the new feature selection technique to measure the quality of different features that may be used to discriminate between normal and incident traffic conditions. Using both simulated data set and real-life incident data set, the performance of our proposed algorithm was compared with existing popular approaches such as California algorithm, Minnesota algorithm, conventional neural networks algorithm, and a wavelet-based neural-net algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed wavelet-based algorithm consistently outperformed others with a higher detection rate, lower false alarm rate, and shorter mean time to detection. It is conclusive that the proposed algorithm is a superior alternative to existing algorithms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, Y; Chang, GL				Liu, Yue; Chang, Gang-Len			An arterial signal optimization model for intersections experiencing queue spillback and lane blockage	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Arterial signal timing; Macroscopic traffic flow formulation; Lane-group; Queue interactions; Optimal control	REAL-TIME; DESIGN; ALGORITHMS	This paper presents an arterial signal optimization model that features its effectiveness on: (1) explicitly modeling physical queue evolution on arterial links by lane-group to account for shared-lane traffic interactions; and (2) capturing the dynamic interactions of spillback queues among lane groups and between neighboring intersections due to high demand, geometric constraints, or signal settings. Depending on the detected traffic patterns, one can select the control objective to be either minimizing the total travel time or maximizing the total throughput over the target area. The solution procedures developed with the Genetic Algorithm (GA) have been tested with an example arterial of four intersections under different demand scenarios. Extensive experimental analyses in comparison with results from TRANSYT-7F (version 8) reveal that the proposed model and solution method are quite promising for use in design of arterial signals, especially under congested, high demand traffic conditions.

Optimal dynamic pricing strategies for high-occupancy/toll lanes	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						High-occupancy/toll lanes; Dynamic pricing; Self-learning; Lane changes	TRAVEL-TIME; RELIABILITY	This paper proposes a self-learning approach to determine optimal pricing strategies for high-occupancy/toll lane operations. The approach learns recursively motorists' willingness to pay by mining the loop detector data, and then specifies toll rates to maximize the freeway's throughput while ensuring a superior travel service to the users of the toll lanes. In determination of the tolls, a multi-lane hybrid traffic flow model is used to explicitly consider the impacts of the lane-changing behaviors before the entry points of the toll lanes on throughput and travel time. Simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate and validate the proposed approach, and provide insights on when to convert high-occupancy lanes to toll lanes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The traffic phases of road networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Fundamental diagram of 2D-traffic; Microscopic traffic modeling; Traffic control	MACROSCOPIC FUNDAMENTAL DIAGRAMS; CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; FLOW MODELS; SYSTEMS; CROSSROAD; EXISTENCE	We study the relation between the average traffic flow and the vehicle density on road networks that we call 2D-traffic fundamental diagram. We show that this diagram presents mainly four phases. We analyze different cases. First, the case of a junction managed with a priority rule is presented, four traffic phases are identified and described, and a good analytic approximation of the fundamental diagram is obtained by computing a generalized eigenvalue of the dynamics of the system. Then, the model is extended to the case of two junctions, and finally to a regular city. The system still presents mainly four phases. The role of a critical circuit of non-priority roads appears clearly in the two junctions case. In "Traffic control", we use traffic light controls to improve the traffic diagram. We present the improvements obtained by open-loop, local feedback, and global feedback strategies. A comparison based on the response times to reach the stationary regime is also given. Finally, we show the importance of the design of the junction. It appears that if the junction is enough large, the traffic is almost not slowed down by the junction. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Estimation of traffic stream space mean speed from time aggregations of double loop detector data	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Space mean speed; Time mean speed; Traffic fundamental variables; Speed variance; Traffic flow theory	VELOCITY	In one of the very first papers on traffic flow theory back in 1952. Wardrop presented the difference between the space mean speed (SMS) and the time mean speed (TMS) of a group of traveling vehicles, and derived a relationship suitable for estimating TMS, given SMS and the speed variance over SMS. As time goes by, traffic practitioners have tended towards computing TMS instead of SMS, mainly when using double loop detectors, and nowadays this is the usual practice in traffic management centers. Therefore, the useful relationship between TMS and SMS should go the other way around in relation to Wardrop's. Recently, the complementary relationship, suitable for estimating SMS from TMS and the speed variance over TMS, has been proved. However this is not enough, as speed variance is usually not available. The present paper develops a probabilistic method to estimate SMS from TMS without the previous knowledge of speed variance and only using the usual time aggregations of double loop detector data. The main assumption of the method - the normality of vehicle speed distribution - is discussed and a formulation to obtain the expected error of the estimation is derived. The results obtained with test data from the AP-7 highway, near Barcelona in Spain, show that the developed methodology is able to estimate SMS with an average relative error as low as 0.5%.

The model was improved by introducing the variable brake distance on different gradient. A simulation is carried out to examine the validity and reasonability of the improved model. The result of the simulation shows that the amplitude of the density waves decreases with the decrease of the slope of the gradient on highway. Moreover the density waves propagate backward. The results indicated that the new model was reasonable and valid in describing the motion of the vehicles on highway with some gradients.

A sustainable development of transport contains two essential physical activities. These are a formation of the traffic flows divided into different means of transportation that cover the pro-environmental transport on one side, and an innovation technology development to reduce the negative results of transportation for the surroundings on the other. There is apart from the two factors already mentioned a huge need for changes in the travel behaviour of people making the trips as well as a need for changes in the approach to the problem of a city development in terms of mobility. The knowledge of decision-making factors in the mode choice is important during the transport processes designing. The traffic distribution modelling should follow principles of sustainable development. It requires undertaking steps to increase competitiveness of alternative transportation modes.

Using the 2006 North Luzon Expressway Balintawak-North Bound (NLEX Blk-NB) hourly traffic volume and time mean speed data sets provided by the National Center for Transportation Studies (NCTS), we generate hourly traffic density data set. Each point in the data was represented by a 4D data signature where cluster models and 21) visualizations were formulated and varying traffic density behaviors were identified, i.e. high and low traffic congestions, outliers; etc. Best-fit curves, confidence bands and ellipses were generated in the visualizations for additional cluster information. We ascertain probable causes of the behaviors to provide insights for better traffic management in the expressway. Finally, from a finer-grained 6-minute interval NLEX Blk-NB density data set, the coarser-grained hourly density data set were validated for consistency and correctness of results.

Then, the paper went on to set the values of compensation coefficients for road breadth, vehicles in parking in and driving out, non-motor vehicles, and lateral clearance, so as to calculate, with the precondition of guaranteeing certain service standards, the maximal values of curb parking lots on road sections under the constraints of traffic capacity. In addition, it also constructed the driving speed model according to BRP resistance function and, via the analysis of "Friction" effect and "Blocking" effect of curb parking on traffic flows of motor vehicle lanes, measured the influence of curb parking on driving speed in order to exactly determine of maximal parking value under the condition that the minimal driving speed of motor vehicles can be ensured. Finally, for the purpose of finding the balance between dynamic and static traffic and of maximally utilizing the remaining road resources, the maximal number of curb parking lots shall be the minimal value to satisfy the constraints of road conditions, traffic capacity and driving speed.

Although based on cellular automata (CA) and interchangeable with a CA model in some special cases, the spatial aspect of the model presented here includes some characteristics that set it apart from CA models, such as overlapping cells and extended stochasticity. These characteristics allow easy incorporation of a variety of network elements into a spatial network model. The behaviour model includes rules for movement along stretches of road, as well as rules of behaviour at decision and conflict points on the road. Agent based simulations are run for three simple scenarios and results of these simulations are presented.

This paper describes an application of this approach in the city of Wroclaw (Poland) using ant algorithms and a multi-agent system. A model of the cities road network was generated which, combined with an analysis of traffic data, enabled traffic flow in the city to be simulated and then optimised. As a result, modifications were proposed to existing road layouts including delineation of a new road section. The results achieved clearly demonstrate the suitability of this approach for route optimisation.

In this article, a Bayesian network framework is introduced to model the correlation structure of highway networks in the context of traffic forecast. We formulate the dependency learning problem as an optimization problem and propose an efficient algorithm to identify the inclusion-optimal dependency structure of the network given historical observations. The optimal dependency structure learned by the proposed algorithm is evaluated on benchmark tests to show its robustness to measurement uncertainties and on field data from the Mobile Millennium traffic estimation system to show its applicability in an operational setting.

Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has become more and more popular. At present, the collection of real-time traffic information is executed in two ways: (1) Stationary Vehicle Detectors (VD) and (2) Global Position System (GPS)-based probe cars reporting. However, VD devices need a large sum of money to build and maintain. Therefore, we propose the linear regression model to infer the equation between vehicle speed and traffic flow. The traffic flow can be estimated from the speed which is obtained from GPS-based probe cars. In experiments, the Speed Error Ratio (SER) and Flow Error Ratio (FER) of linear regression model are 4.60% and 24.63% respectively. The estimated speed and traffic flow by using linear regression model is better than by using linear model, power law model, exponential model, and normal distribution model. Therefore, the linear regression model can be used to estimate traffic information for ITS.

This article presents the strategy of the variable speed limit (VSL) on highway work zones that brings about gradual deceleration and low speed variance. To evaluate the safety of the proposed VSL strategy, this study uses the microscopic simulation software VISSM to estimate the traffic flow and adopt transversal and longitudinal coefficients of safety (MSDE and cv) to compare the different speed limit strategies. The results of simulation and analysis confirm that VSL yield a substantial decrease the traffic turbulence caused by speed limit and increase the traffic safety throughout work zones.

Using the video detection device, one of the traffic flow information collecting devices, a large number of data in the period of ice-snow of cold area are collected, which is the research base of this paper. The macro and micro traffic flow characteristic of urban road under ice-snow conditions is analyzed, such as the traffic flow, the distribution of headway time, and the properties of the speed distribution. The relation models of FC of ice-snow road and speed-volume are built. Then, the traffic flow characteristics are compared between ice-snow and non- ice-snow road. The outcomes studied above are the foundation for analyzing traffic operation and capacity of urban road in the period of ice-snow.

In this model, two different road cells, roads and crosses, are configured. Vehicle distribution is generated by real-time traffic flow randomly. Based on two-dimensional topology, Monte Carlo collision between road and vehicles promote time evolution of the system. Monte Carlo collision is the core of the model and traffic flow is study target. The solution of relationship equations of road and vehicles is very simple in this model to speed up the computing. In addition, parameters can be corrected and configured at any time in the process of time evolution. Experimental results show that the model has the advantages of real-time, visual interface, easy configuration, and can be corrected by real-time feedback. The model can not only simulate and predict macroscopic data, such as flow, velocity distribution, but also follow the track of each vehicle in detail. So, the model can be used in researching both macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of vehicle movement.

The second-order traffic flow model is firstly formulated. Then traffic density is selected as the control variable in place of traffic occupancy. Based on the traffic flow model and in conjunction with nonlinear feedback theory, a fuzzy logic based traffic density controller is designed. The ramp metering rate is determined by the fuzzy control according to density tracking error and error variation. Triangle curves are used for the membership functions of the fuzzy variables. The rule base including 56 fuzzy rules is also established. Finally, the fuzzy logic based feedback controller is simulated in Matlab software. Simulation results show that this method has good dynamic and steady-state performance, and can achieve an almost perfect tracking performance.

In this model, some input variables are selected from four aspects, including time factors, traffic dynamic factors, road conditions and tunnel environment, and the output variable is the operating speed. Then the sensitivity analysis method is selected to study the effects of input variables on output variable. The results show that this algorithm can avoid the difficulty of constructing traffic flow model comparing to the traditional algorithm, and it is suitable to realize online modeling for speed limit of freeway tunnel group.

In this paper, we study this issue using the optimal velocity model, in which two kinds of vehicles (fast and slow) are introduced. The asymmetric lane changing rules in the slowdown section and the lane squeezing behaviors at the bottleneck are taken into account. Under the periodic boundary condition, the numerical simulations are performed. The fundamental diagram is obtained. Then, the influences of speed limit and the length of the slowdown section on traffic are discussed in detail from the view of traffic control. The currents are dependent on the speed limit, but independent of the length.

The performance of most such applications is dependent on an effective density estimation of the vehicles in the surroundings. Of the various methods, clustering demonstrates to be an effective concept to implement this. However due to high mobility a stable cluster, within a vehicular framework, is difficult to implement. In this work, we propose a direction based clustering algorithm with a clusterhead switching mechanism. This mechanism is aimed to overcome the influence of overtaking within the clusters. The proposed algorithm facilitates to attain better stability and thus accurate density estimation within the clusters. Simulation results show that the proposed clustering algorithm is rendered stability through switching mechanism and hence provides a better accuracy in density estimation.

Daily and weekly seasonal components of the data are analysed and several features are extracted to support the forecasting. Various short-term forecasting models are developed for one hour ahead forecasting of the traffic flow. Models include benchmark models (random walk, seasonal random walk, naive model). AR and ARMA models, and various configuration of feedforward neural networks. Results show that the best forecasting results (correlation coefficient R > 0.99) are obtained by a feedforward neural network and a selected set of inputs but this sophisticated model surprisingly only slightly surpasses the accuracy of a simple naive model.

Comparison of Macroscopic and Microscopic Simulation Models in Modern Roundabout Analysis	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Modern roundabouts are more and more widely used at both urban and rural intersections in North America. The results of traffic operations analysis at roundabouts often depend on the software used and parameters adopted. For an evaluation of types of traffic analysis tools on roundabout operations, a macroscopic traffic analysis software (SIDRA) and a microscopic simulation package (VISSIM) were used to analyze a two-lane roundabout at the intersection of two rural arterial highways in Alberta, Canada. A full range of traffic flow rates and left-turn proportions was loaded to the roundabout to compare the two traffic analysis tools and to evaluate the effects of different factors on the roundabout performance. Average control delay and 95% queue length were used as measures of effectiveness. Factors such as total traffic flow rate and left-turn vehicle proportion in each approach were analyzed to evaluate the sensitivity of the roundabout performance at different factor levels. The results showed that there was no significant difference for the delays predicted by VISSIM simulation and SIDRA at medium-to-high traffic flow rates and at all left-turn proportion levels. The 95% queue length predicted by VISSIM was longer than those predicted by SIDRA. Good correlation existed between predicted delays and 95% queue length from the two types of software. Both types of software needed parameter calibration for local traffic conditions. Roundabout capacity could also be estimated from a delay curve obtained from the method presented in this study.

How to use the information provided by adjacent links more efficiently is a key to improving the performance of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). In this paper, we build a sparse graphical model for multi-link traffic flow through the Graphical Lasso (CL) algorithm and then implement the forecasting with Neural Networks. Through a large number of experiments, we find that network-scale traffic forecasting with modeling by Graphical Lasso performs much better than previous research. Traditional approaches considered the information provided by adjacent links but did not extract the information. Thus, although they improved the performance to some extent, they did not make good use of the information. Furthermore, we summarize the theoretical analysis of Graphical Lasso algorithm. From theoretical and practical points of view, we fully verify the superiority of Graphical Lasso used in modeling for multi-link traffic flow forecasting.

The proposed methodology leads to two functions to evaluate traffic emission: a model for actually realized emissions and one for the emission level of traffic. The former one is useful for a more exact estimation of emissions relative to inventory methods; the latter one is for the analysis of optimal traffic control objectives. The introduced functions are validated in VISSIM/MatLab environment on a real motorway segment model located in Hungary.

With vehicle positions being the most frequently exchanged information in vehicular networks; it becomes imperative to establish a strong level of trust in the announced positions before a vehicle may take action in response. This paper proposes a position verification scheme that involves the collaborative exchange of one-hop neighbor information in order to help a vehicle make better judgments of position announcements. Vehicles can assess neighborhood connectivity and use the logical traffic flow to form a verdict on trusting a position announcement, thus enabling the detection of possible position falsifications. The scheme analyzes accumulated 2-hop neighbors' information in order to define a plausibility area within which a vehicle should exist in order for its position to be considered "correct". In very sparse traffic scenarios, a vehicle will depend on measuring the consistency of a vehicle's Received Signal Strength (RSS) with its announced position. Performance evaluation was carried out via simulation, and results show that defining this plausibility area yields accurate detection of position falsifications with low false positives.

Simulations of the developed model are conducted using MATLAB FullBNT toolbox where different parameter estimations are used. This study demonstrates the efficiency as well as flexibility of using Bayesian analysis on large data sets containing a large number of attributes. The developed BSA can be used in the incident management process. It can assist decision makers in estimating the severity of a certain incident based on given attributes for better preparedness. BSA can also be used in order to assess the safety transportation system.

This paper first briefly introduces the Curve-Fitting Estimation Model (CFEM), which is one of the typical methods using GPS data to estimate the traffic flow state. After that, it is detailedly analyzed how many probe vehicles the CFEM requires in order to ensure enough estimated accuracy. Furthermore, a sample size algorithm is developed to calculate the minimum sample size of the CFEM. In the algorithm, the road type, the length of road section, and sample frequency are taken into account. Finally, the proposed algorithm of sample size analysis are tested by the experiments using the data collected from the road network of the whole center region of Shanghai.

Real Time Energy Management Algorithm for Hybrid Electric Vehicle	2011 14TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITSC)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	OCT 05-07, 2011	Campus George Washington Univ (GWU), Washington, DC	IEEE, George Washington Univ (GWU), Sch Engn & Appl Sci, IEEE ITS Soc, Ctr Intelligent Syst Res (CISR), FHWA/NHTSA Natl Crash Anal Ctr (NCAC)	Campus George Washington Univ (GWU)			The rapid development of mobile Internet and smart devices and advent of new generation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) increase information about future driving conditions and makes on-board energy management of Hybrid Electrical Vehicle (HEV) realistic. In this paper we propose a real time energy management algorithm R T E M A for a HEV composed of batteries and Super-Capacitors (SC). We suppose that the On-board Dedicated Computer (ODC) has a permanent Internet connection and has the possibility to perform Google-Maps application queries to calculate 3D route to destination. Based on 3D route to destination and average speeds for each road segment the state of charge (SOC) for battery and SC at the end of each receding horizon are predicted. A cost function considering the efficiency of battery, SC, DC/DC converter and electric motor as well as the battery life cycles increase is presented and an optimization problem is formulated and resolved. As ODC for real-time communication and computation we use Samsung Galaxy Pad which is an Android smart device. Performance results in terms of energy optimization, increased battery life and computing time are given which show the practical usefulness of this approach and application. Such a system can be made available to potential users of HEV as well as to the Android community driver members who share information on the state of traffic flow via their Android mobile phones [30].

We have introduced the concept of a stationary r-connected traffic flow on k-lane road as a development of the hydrodynamic approach and cellular automata method. A client-server based software "SSSR"-system, using smart-phone programming, for evaluating a distance of safety in continuous traffic was developed. A series of experiments were carried out using the SSSR-system, the results showing good agreement with those obtained by Greenshields in 1933. Other problems of traffic monitoring and control by the programmed SSSR-system are discussed. We also introduce a few open problems.	[Bugaev, A.
