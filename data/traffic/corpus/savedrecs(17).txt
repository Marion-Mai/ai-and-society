It is the traffic flow characteristics representing the current traffic situation that provide a basis for the planning, designing and management of intersections. In this paper, we constructed an automatic processing framework on traffic flow characteristics analysis and understanding the traffic state at the urban road intersections, based on the collected raw vehicle motion trajectories. Our proposed method is basically attributed to identifying distinct vehicle motion patterns at intersections hierarchically using raw trajectory. Firstly, the fundamental assumption in traditional approaches that the trajectory set of high quality are readily available after manual rectification is not taken for granted any more. And by fully analyzing the local characteristics of trajectories, we figure out and explain various patterns behind traffic flow as well as yielded higher accuracy in motion trajectory clustering under the multi-layer spectral clustering method. At last, coupling the analyzing results with the surrounding characteristics of the intersection, the examples computing traffic flow features and predicting vehicle activity illustrates the potential of applying vehicle trajectories to traffic study, which are all suggested by experimental results.

As a result the demand for mobility is increasing. However, the supply of infrastructure is low. This study models the flow of vehicles at several intersections in Addis Ababa in order to simulate different strategies to improve the use of infrastructure. It appears that the share of minibuses, the share of slow vehicles, the number of lanes per stream and the productivity of the type of control have significant influence on the total flow of conflict groups at intersections. Manual intersection control appears to result in a relatively high productivity. Simple solutions to improve the vehicle throughput exist.	[Hellendoorn, J.; Zegeye, S.

Evaluation of Velocity Fields via Sparse Bus Probe Data in Urban Areas	2011 14TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITSC)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	OCT 05-07, 2011	Campus George Washington Univ (GWU), Washington, DC	IEEE, George Washington Univ (GWU), Sch Engn & Appl Sci, IEEE ITS Soc, Ctr Intelligent Syst Res (CISR), FHWA/NHTSA Natl Crash Anal Ctr (NCAC)	Campus George Washington Univ (GWU)		TRAFFIC PROBES	The goal of this paper is to investigate how sparse public transport data such as bus data might be used in evaluating congestion in urban areas and in providing better information for road users and traffic managers. With this aim we use the well known concept of a velocity field and, building on our previous work, we specifically show how velocity fields can be usefully reconstructed from sparse bus data. Buses provide good coverage of cities and, increasingly, are being equipped with satellite navigation devices and monitored in order to display their predicted arrival times to bus passengers. We have had access to a wealth of bus data for the city of Cambridge, England for some years. We describe these bus data and show how its specifics may be used in conjunction with other sources of data, such as OpenStreetMap, in order to reconstruct information on transport traffic flow dynamics. Finally, we consider examples in which we compare our knowledge of the traffic regimes with the outputs of the technique presented.

The model introduces a new set of simple rules to change the speed of vehicles that incorporates three important thresholds required by the follower vehicle to accelerate, slow down or maintain its speed. Thus, the space gap, relative speed and limited acceleration/deceleration capabilities are introduced into simulations. Simulation results obtained from a system with periodic conditions show that the model avoids unrealistic deceleration behavior found in most previous cellular automata models. Besides, the model is also capable to reproduce most empirical findings including the three states of traffic flow and the backward speed of the downstream front of the traffic jam. Moreover, the new model preserves the computational simplicity of the cellular automata models.

Platoon-Based Self-Scheduling for Real-Time Traffic Signal Control	2011 14TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITSC)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	14th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	OCT 05-07, 2011	Campus George Washington Univ (GWU), Washington, DC	IEEE, George Washington Univ (GWU), Sch Engn & Appl Sci, IEEE ITS Soc, Ctr Intelligent Syst Res (CISR), FHWA/NHTSA Natl Crash Anal Ctr (NCAC)	Campus George Washington Univ (GWU)			In this paper, we take a self-scheduling approach to solving the traffic signal control problem, where each intersection is controlled by a self-interested agent operating with a limited (fixed horizon) view of incoming traffic. Central to the approach is a representation that aggregates incoming vehicles into critical clusters, based on the non-uniformly distributed nature of road traffic flows. Starting from a recently developed signal timing strategy based on clearing anticipated queues, we propose extended real-time decision policies that also incorporate look-ahead of approaching vehicle platoons, and thus focus attention more on keeping vehicles moving than on simply clearing queues. We present simulation results that demonstrate the benefit of our approach over simple queue clearing, both in promoting the establishment of "green waves" where vehicles move through the road network without stopping and in improving overall traffic flows.

Many solution models have been proposed in the previous work and analyzed in detail. Successive link travel time correlation has been identified to play an important role in these models to realistically reflect the property of traffic flows. In this paper, we establish a framework to find the best route in a stochastic time-dependent network by considering link travel time indeterminacy and correlation between adjacent links with real time information.

Details are discussed including VMS positioning, guided speed calculation, signal timing adjustment and DSDS integration model. This strategy provides the vehicles with a possibility of passing the intersections without stop through guiding them with necessary speed dynamically in the link segment and adjusting the signal timing of the preceding intersection according to vehicle detected data. Thus the stopped delay of traffic flow can be impressively decreased. VISSIM, a microscopic simulator is applied to develop simulation architecture as a test tool of this strategy. As a case study, Cao'an Highway, a suburban highway in Shanghai, is taken for simulation and evaluation. The preliminary assessment results show that: the improvement of the delay and number of stops is obvious and robust considering the driver behavior.

The approach is intended for predicting travel time variability caused by such stochastic phenomena. It is assumed that breakdown may occur at different flow levels with some probability, and would sustain for a random duration. This is modeled at the microscopic level by considering speed changes that are initiated by a leading vehicle and propagated by the following vehicles with correlated-distributed behavioral parameters. Numerical results from a Monte Carlo simulation demonstrate that the proposed stochastic modeling approach produces realistic macroscopic traffic flow behavior and can be used to generate travel time distributions.

Both controllers are evaluated and compared to a previously developed local MTFC feedback cascade controller and to a sophisticated optimal control approach. All feedback controllers rely on readily available real-time measurements; are simple and robust; and take into account a number of practical and safety restrictions; therefore being suitable for implementations in the field. The evaluations are conducted for a hypothetical freeway network by use of a validated second-order macroscopic traffic flow model. The results show that the feedback controllers exhibit a satisfactory control behavior and, indeed, approach the optimal control results. Recommendations for the operation of the feedback controllers are given.

It has been specially designed to operate in real time with high correct detection and classification rates. The system is capable of providing accurate and robust results in challenging road scenarios, with rain, traffic jams, casted shadows in sunny days at sunrise and sunset times, etc. A Bayesian inference method has been designed to generate estimates of multiple variable objects entering and exiting the scene. This framework allows easily mixing different nature information, gathering in a single step observation models, calibration, motion priors and interaction models. The inference of results is carried out with a novel optimization procedure that generates estimates of the maxima of the posterior distribution combining concepts from Gibbs and slice sampling. Experimental tests have shown excellent results for traffic-flow video surveillance applications that can be used to classify vehicles according to their length, width, and height. Therefore, this vision-based system can be seen as a good substitute to existing inductive loop detectors.

J	Sadabadi, KF; Haghani, A				Sadabadi, Kaveh F.; Haghani, Ali			Real-Time Solution of Velocity-Based First-Order Continuum Traffic Model with Finite Element Method	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							FLOW; HIGHWAY; WAVES	Two approximate solution methods are investigated for the velocity-based version of a first-order continuum traffic flow model commonly known as the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model. The finite difference and finite element methods are commonly used to numerically solve partial differential equations. The finite difference method adopted uses a standard Godunov scheme to solve the continuum model. The finite element method uses one-dimensional simplex elements with first-order interpolation function along with a Galerkin scheme to derive the element characteristic matrices and vectors. A high-resolution, real-world data set from the Next Generation Simulation program is used to evaluate the two solution methods. Results show that both methods provide accurate approximations to the observed speeds. The accuracy and quality of solutions and future directions of work in this area are discussed.

J	Zou, YJ; Zhang, YL				Zou, Yajie; Zhang, Yunlong			Use of Skew-Normal and Skew-t Distributions for Mixture Modeling of Freeway Speed Data	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							LIKELIHOOD; ALGORITHM; EM	Normal, lognormal, and other forms of distribution have been used to characterize speed data. Recently, several researchers have used the normal mixture model to fit the distribution of speed. To investigate the applicability of mixture models with other types of component density, a study was done that fits 24-h speed data collected on 1-35 in Texas by using skew-normal and skew-t mixture models with an algorithm of expectation maximization type. The results show that a finite mixture of skew distributions can significantly improve the goodness of fit of speed data. Compared with normal distribution, skew-normal and skew-t distributions can accommodate skewness and excess kurtosis themselves; thus the skew mixture models require fewer components than normal mixture models to capture the asymmetry and bimodality present in speed data. The results of the study indicate that a two-component skew-t mixture model is the optimal model, and this model can better account for heterogeneity in the data. The study verifies that traffic flow condition is the main cause for heterogeneity in the 24-h speed data. The research methodology can be used to analyze freeway speed data characteristics. The findings can also be used in development and validation of microscopic simulation of freeway traffic.

J	Toledo, T; Farah, H				Toledo, Tomer; Farah, Haneen			Alternative Definitions of Passing Critical Gaps	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							2-LANE HIGHWAYS; DISTANCE; VEHICLES	A substantial proportion of the road network in most countries consists of two-lane highways. Available gaps for passing are a fundamental element in the operation of such highways. Providing passing opportunities is important for reducing the formation of vehicle platoons in the traffic flow, increasing the level of service, and improving safety. Passing opportunities also affect fuel consumption and emissions. Despite the importance of passing on two-lane highways, few studies have focused on exploring passing gap definitions when modeling passing behavior. Research was done to investigate various definitions of passing gaps, and these definitions were used to develop passing gap acceptance models. Data on passing maneuvers collected with a driving simulator were used to develop and calibrate three models. The generic structure of these models was composed of the drivers' desire to pass and their gap acceptance decisions. The impact of traffic characteristics, road geometry, and driver characteristics was included in these models. The results show that the passing gap definition has a significant impact on the models' ability to explain passing behavior. Moreover, the estimation results show that modeling a driver's desire to pass the vehicle ahead has a statistically significant contribution in explaining passing behavior. Variables that capture the impact of the traffic conditions, geometric characteristics of the road section, driver characteristics, and the unobserved heterogeneity in the driver population were found to have a significant impact on drivers' desire to pass and their gap acceptance decisions.

Different approaches based on different data sources have been presented. With the latest developments in vehicle detection technologies, especially probe vehicle technologies, use of vehicle trajectory data has become possible. In this paper, an improved method for queue length estimation for signalized intersections is proposed. This method is able to provide cycle-by-cycle queue length estimation for signalized intersections with sampled vehicle trajectories as the only input. The keystone of the entire approach is the concept of the critical point (CP), which represents the changing vehicle dynamics. A CP extraction algorithm is introduced to identify CPs from raw trajectories. Using the CPs related to queue formation and dissipation, the authors propose an improved queue length estimation method based on shock waves. The performance of this approach is evaluated with several data sets under different flow and signal timing scenarios, including a recently collected data set from a Global Positioning System logger. The results indicate that this trajectory-based approach is promising.

Vehicle lane-changing maneuvers often result in instability in traffic flow. The impact on traffic flow of lane changes by heavy vehicles can be even more serious than that of lane changes by passenger vehicles because of vehicle characteristics and driver behavior. This impact is being exacerbated because the number of heavy vehicles and their share in the traffic steam are increasing. Models of lane-changing behavior were reviewed. It was found that the lane-changing maneuver of heavy vehicles has not received appropriate attention. Real-world data were applied to a comparison of this behavior with the behavior of passenger car drivers. The behavior of drivers is explored for both arterial roads and freeways considering the impact of the size of vehicles on the lane-changing maneuver. The results indicate that the type and size of vehicles influence the lane-changing maneuver, in particular on arterial roads. A new area of study is opened for investigating the microscopic behavior of heavy vehicles in a traffic steam with more detail and leads toward a model that incorporates the characteristics of heavy vehicles.

The approach uses the exponential smoothing method to pre-process traffic flow data before implementing on neural networks for training purpose. The pre-processed traffic flow data, which is lesser non-smooth, discontinuous and lumpy than the original traffic flow data, is more suitable to use for neural network training. This neural network development approach was evaluated by forecasting real-time traffic conditions on a section of the freeway in Western Australia. Regarding training errors which indicate capability in fitting traffic flow data, the neural network models developed by the proposed approach was capable to achieve more than 20% of the rate of improvement relative to the neural network developed based on the original traffic flow data. Regarding testing errors which indicate generalization capability for traffic flow forecasting, the neural network models developed by the proposed approach was capable in achieving more than 8% of the rate of improvement relative to the neural networks developed based on the original traffic flow data.

First, the macroscopic, non-linear and second-order model of freeway traffic flow dynamics is transformed to an equivalent and quasi Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) representation by steady-state centering and state variable factorization. Second, a polytopic LPV model form is obtained from the quasi model reformulation. The latter polytopic LPV form is then used as a basis for the computation and analysis of disturbance invariant sets. This framework is able to characterize constrained sets of states which can be reached by pure ramp metering control input signals. Furthermore, these sets become invariant to other measured and unmeasured disturbance inputs. The application of disturbance invariant set theory provides an analytical tool for constrained freeway ramp metering describing the set of states being invariant under the system dynamics, measured disturbance and other physical constraints regardless to the value unmeasured disturbance signal. The proposed idea is fully based on the analysis of the (transformed) non-linear macroscopic system and aims at filling the gap between the traffic modeling and quantitative freeway ramp metering.

The considered model involves a continuum of indistinguishable drivers commuting between a common origin/destination pair in an acyclic transportation network. The drivers' route choices are affected by their, relatively infrequent, perturbed best responses to global information about the current network congestion levels, as well as their instantaneous local observation of the immediate surroundings as they transit through the network. A novel model is proposed for the drivers' route choice behavior, exhibiting local consistency with their preference toward globally less congested paths as well as myopic decisions in favor of locally less congested paths. The simultaneous evolution of the traffic congestion on the network and of the aggregate path preference is modeled by a system of coupled ordinary differential equations. The main result shows that, if the frequency of updates of path preferences is sufficiently small as compared to the frequency of the traffic flow dynamics, then the state of the transportation network ultimately approaches a neighborhood of the Wardrop equilibrium. The proposed analysis combines techniques from singular perturbation theory, evolutionary game theory, and cooperative dynamical systems.

J	Zhang, N; Zhang, YL; Lu, HT				Zhang, Ning; Zhang, Yunlong; Lu, Haiting			Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average and Support Vector Machine Models Prediction of Short-Term Traffic Flow on Freeways	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							FEATURE-SELECTION; NETWORK MODEL; HYBRID ARIMA; REGRESSION; OPTIMIZATION; PARAMETERS; VOLUME	Predictions of short-term traffic volume support proactive transportation management and traveler information services. To address the periodicity, nonlinearity, uncertainty, and complexity of short-term traffic forecasting, seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and support vector machine (SVM) models are often used separately to forecast the time series of traffic flow. SARIMA can discover intrinsic relations (correlations) in time series data, especially fit for modeling seasonal, stochastic time series. In contrast, SVM has a strong nonlinear mapping ability for input and output, appropriate for solving complex, nonlinear problems. The few combined schemes that have been presented previously tend to be complicated. A simple and effective novel hybrid methodology that combines the SARIMA and SVM models is proposed to take advantage of the individual strengths of the two models. Two key issues in building a hybrid model process are discussed: identification of SVM input dimensions via SARIMA and parameter optimization of the hybrid model with particle swarm optimization. Experimental results with real-world data sets indicated that the hybrid model was superior to the individual SARIMA or SVM model in terms of root mean square error and mean absolute percentage error for the prediction of the short-term traffic flow.

Novel Freeway Traffic Control with Variable Speed Limit and Coordinated Ramp Metering	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							FEATURES; MODEL	Freeway corridor traffic flow is limited by bottleneck flow. If the section upstream of a bottleneck is congested, the bottleneck flow will drop well below its capacity. A logical approach to maximizing recurrent bottleneck flow is to create a discharge section immediately upstream of the bottleneck. This paper proposes a control strategy for combining variable speed limits (VSL) and coordinated ramp metering (CRM) design to achieve this objective when the bottleneck can be represented as a lane (or virtual lane) reduction. At each time step, VSL is designed first, with mainline flow, on-ramp demand and length, and driver acceptance taken into account. VSL values are determined for three locations: (a) the critical VSL to regulate the discharge section flow to match bottleneck capacity, (b) the VSL for the potentially congested section (mainline storage), and (c) the VSL upstream of the congestion tail. With the selected VSL, the first-order mainline flow model is linearized and then used for CRM design with model predictive control to minimize the difference between scaled total travel time (or vehicle hours traveled) and the total travel distance (equivalent to vehicle miles traveled). Microscopic simulation shows that this control strategy should improve bottleneck throughput significantly.

J	Princeton, JF; Cohen, S				Princeton, Judith F.; Cohen, Simon			A Priori Assessment of Safety Impacts of Traffic Management Operations Level of Service-Based Approach	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							FLOW	The number of accidents that occur on a road is often linked to traffic flow, whereas the severity is related to mean speed. The method developed in this paper links the level of service-described by both traffic mean flow and speed-to the number of accidents observed on a road section. The objective is to use this relationship in a priori assessment of traffic management strategies by using traffic simulation tools. Flows and speeds represent the main outputs of such models and are assumed to be influenced by other parameters such as road geometry, lighting, and weather conditions. Four levels of service are considered according to the classification used in several European countries. The levels define traffic conditions from free flow to congestion. The study uses accident and traffic data collected for a 9-year period on a 17-km stretch of the A1 motorway in the Paris region. An accident rate is computed for each level of service. The results confirm the existence of a relationship between accident rates and levels of service, with more accidents observed during congestion. An application example of a real case study illustrates the use of the proposed method for a priori assessment of traffic management strategies.

Directing Traffic to Increase Passenger Drop-Off Capacity Case Study at an Urban School	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							INFORMATION	Many schools have a designated student drop-off area for private vehicles, but the capacity rarely meets demand during peak drop-off times. To determine whether drop-off capacity could be effectively increased when school personnel direct traffic flow, a case study was performed at an urban elementary school. Total drop-off time per vehicle consisted of both the stopping time of the vehicle (the time it stopped for unloading) and the maneuvering-idle time. Mean stopping time was measured and calculated for representative samples during peak drop-off time in the morning. Stopping times ranged from 2 to 55 s. When the school principal was present and directed traffic, mean stopping time was reduced from 26.5 to 19.7 s. This reduction was statistically significant with p < .025. The mean maneuvering-idle time during the period of peak drop-off was estimated to be 33.3 s; with the principal guiding traffic, it was reduced to 28.1 s. Taken together, the mean drop-off time (stopping time plus maneuvering time) was estimated at 59.8 s without human guidance and 47.8 s with human guidance of traffic flow. This difference predicts an increase in drop-off capacity of 21.7% during the peak drop-off period. Dispatching school personnel to guide traffic flow during peak times can provide an efficient and cost-effective means to increase drop-off capacity at schools that do not have the space or cannot afford the capital expense to make major structural improvements to school access roads.

The model extends earlier partial differential equations that represent deterministic coarse grained models of stochastic production systems based on mass conservation. The finite size buffers lead to a discontinuous clearing function describing the throughput as a function of the work in progress (WIP). Following previous work on stationary distribution of WIP along the production line, the clearing function becomes dependent on the production stage and decays linearly as a function of the distance from the end of the production line. A transient experiment representing the breakdown of the last machine in the production line and its subsequent repair is analyzed analytically and numerically. Shock waves and rarefaction waves generated by blocking and reopening of the production line are determined. It is shown that the time to shutdown of the complete flow line is much shorter than the time to recovery from a shutdown. The former evolves on a transportation time scale, whereas the latter evolves on a much longer time scale. Comparisons with discrete event simulations of the same experiment are made.

J	Kersys, A				Kersys, Arturas			Sustainable Urban Transport System Development Reducing Traffic Congestions Costs	INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS			English	Article						urban transport; sustainable development; traffic congestions; external costs	MANAGEMENT; LOSSES	Traffic congestions are formed due to irrational city facilities in communication terms and improper traffic system's facilities; improper crossings of streets with intense traffic; absence of high-speed continuous traffic main streets; no passenger traffic parking lots in the largest routs. In consequence of congestions there arises increasing pollution, impairment of people health and economic loss. Investigation of traffic flows is complex multidimensional task, solution complication of which depends on complexity extent of transport network. In order to analyze the particularity of forming congestions, investigation describing in details the interaction of vehicles and road facilities are necessary. The main research purpose is to determine vehicle's waste of time with flow close to system overcrowding or moving in congestion. In order to evaluate congestions expenses and rare occasional loss many parameters and assumptions are necessary, because these parameters are expressed by physical expressions. The most important of them are: value of travel time is used to convert time loss and/or reduced reliability and comfort into monetary units; variation of demand, defining reaction of possible consumers to internalization of exterior expenses of congestions. Expenses evaluation methods used are based on the evaluation of travel time. To this end lots of investigations have been performed in various European countries. Actually experts are inclined to use general VOT values for public and goods traffic. Traffic flow intensity is determined by specified averages traffic flow speeds in separate sectors, travel time and, the main thing, defining sector throughput. Flow particularity has been determined, as well, i.e. impact of a number of lanes and evaluated wasted time with different intensity of vehicles flow. Having data on traffic flows, it is possible to determine frequency of arriving and outgoing vehicles and time intervals between them and evaluate situation in a crossing. Schemes of vehicles movement were formed, projecting the arrival of vehicles one by one or by blocks, and data on flows directions and intensity collected. According to queue extent it is possible to judge about quality of traffic control system and loading of crossing with transport and forecast possible congestions. After the analysis of some transport flows in the city traffic, investigation of traffic congestions reasons, these conclusions could be made: there is no methodical facilities development programme of the city streets; roads with intense traffic crossings of the city are old-fashioned, and their throughput is three or four times smaller than streets throughput and traffic flows intensity; there is no high speed public traffic service created and this becomes a pretext to use an individual transport, increasing traffic intensity and traffic congestions; there is no reverse lanes in the streets with intense traffic, what could increase road throughput and no public transport traffic lights before crossings, which at least would reduce, congestions of this traffic. Sustainable urban traffic system development reducing congestions costs shall be based on long term "sustainable people and goods mobility vision".

A kind of level of detail modeling methodology is used. After an aggregate model of the urban traffic network system is defined, the key elements such as traffic lights and intersections, which describe the typical feature of the traffic network in the aggregate model, are refined to introduce detail models. The proposed model of the intersection describes the turning direction of each traffic flow explicitly and takes into account the conflicts among the traffic flows. Furthermore, the time factor is considered in the system model. As a result, the total model obtained can not only reflect the logical relationship among the traffic flows, but also describe and calculate the physical characteristics of the vehicles such as the location, velocity, and passing time interval. Consequently, the performance index can be calculated with less effort for a given traffic timing plan and different timing plans can be compared in order that an optimal or suboptimal traffic control plan may be chosen. Finally, the implementation issues of the methodology are discussed.

Generalized bridge network performance analysis with correlation and time-variant reliability	STRUCTURAL SAFETY			English	Article						Bridge network; Transportation network; Life-cycle; Time-variant reliability	MAINTENANCE	A novel approach and framework for the analysis of bridge networks is presented. The goal of the analysis is to assess the life-cycle performance of the network and its time-variant reliability. The proposed approach combines three important features that determine its ability to estimate with accuracy and robustness the reliability of a network along its life-cycle. The first one is that the reliability of the individual bridges is modeled as time-variant, due to the deterioration of their structural components. The network performance analysis is repeated for several time instants, with the relative reliability of the bridges. Therefore, the network performance indicators are also time-variant. In this way, the proposed procedure can be used as a basic tool for maintenance planning at the network level. The second asset is that the proposed framework takes into account complex (i.e. "generalized") network layouts, not necessarily describable using series, parallel or series-parallel models. In fact, when all the possible traffic flows in a network and all the possible trip origins and destinations are considered, it is not feasible, in general, to model the network with a simple scheme. In the present paper, techniques derived from transportation engineering for the traffic flow distribution and assignment are used. The third feature is that the proposed approach considers a correlation structure among the states (in/out of service) of the various bridges of the network. In fact, bridges associated with the same network are likely to share similar characteristics and external loads. Therefore, a correlation structure for the service state of individual bridges is estimated and implemented in the analysis. A case study involving a transportation network with fourteen bridges is presented as a numerical application. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We combine the probability of time loss because of an incident with the expected average time loss in the cost function of the road user. A new element is that the elasticity of demand is included in the model. The change in welfare because of IM will be overestimated if the elasticity of demand is not included in the model. In a numerical example, we show that this overestimation can increase by up to 30 per cent for roads where the number of road users is close to capacity. Therefore, there can be a risk of overinvesting in IM.

J	Vasirani, M; Ossowski, S				Vasirani, Matteo; Ossowski, Sascha			LEARNING AND COORDINATION FOR AUTONOMOUS INTERSECTION CONTROL	APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article							TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT	Future urban road traffic management is an example of a socially relevant problem that can be modeled as a large-scale, open, distributed system, composed of many autonomous interacting agents, which need to be controlled in a decentralized manner. In this context, advanced, reservation-based, intersection control-where autonomous vehicles controlled entirely by agents interact with a coordination facility that controls an intersection, to avoid collisions and minimize delays-will be a possible scenario in the near future. In this article, we seize the opportunities for multiagent learning offered by such a scenario, studying i) how vehicles, when approaching a reservation-based intersection, can coordinate their actions in order to improve their crossing times, and therefore, speed up the traffic flow through the intersection, and ii) how a set of reservation-based intersections can cooperatively act over an entire network of intersections in order to minimize travel times.

A non-conventional technique is proposed to transform the nonlinear freeway traffic flow model into a parameter-dependent form. The resulting exact LPV model is equivalent to the original nonlinear dynamics. Simplification of the nonlinear model gives rise to the introduction of an approximate LPV description. The application of parameter varying identification approaches are made possible by the transformation. Closed-loop predictor-based subspace identification for LPV systems (PBSID LPV) is applied to estimate the affine parameter matrices of the LPV freeway models developed. If the model structure of the original plant is assumed to be known, this paper shows a solution how to estimate LPV model parameters based on the identified model. Parameter-dependent models are identified and validated using real detector measurement data in order to emphasize the applicability of the kernel PBSID LPV methodology. Comparison with traditional nonlinear parametric identification, generally used in traffic identification, is also provided.

Estimation of free flow speed and critical density in a segmented freeway using missing data and Monte Carlo-based expectation maximisation algorithm	IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article							MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; STATE ESTIMATION; SYSTEMS	This study is concerned with the estimation of two key parameters in a stochastic non-linear second-order state-space model of traffic flow using the maximum likelihood approach while employing a recursive Monte Carl-based filtering and smoothing to solve related expectation maximisation (EM) algorithm. A maximum likelihood (ML) framework is employed in the interests of statistical efficiency. EM algorithm may be used to compute these ML estimates and Monte Carlo approach is used to compute required conditional expectations. Considered parameters, free flow speed and critical density are traffic flow characteristics which are key parameters used for traffic control, ramp metering, incident management etc. A set of field traffic data from the Interstate-494 highway located in Metro Freeway Network Area at Minnesota is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

A number of factors including individual differences of age, gender, and risk-taking behavior, have been found to influence car following behavior. This paper presents a novel idea to calculate the DVU instantaneous reaction delay of Driver-Vehicle Unit (DVU). Considering the proposed idea, three input-output models are developed to estimate FV acceleration based on soft computing approaches. This idea is used to select the proper inputs and outputs to design the models. The performance of models is evaluated based on field data and compared to a number of existing car following models. The results show that new soft computing models based on instantaneous reaction delay outperformed the other car following models.

Cooperative systems based on wireless communication are a specific form of advanced driver assistance that is currently evolving rapidly. A drawback in the development of such systems is that options for large scale field-testing and -development of these automated systems are limited. Traffic simulation however offers widespread options for testing. In this paper the effects of cooperative driving using cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) to influence congestion shockwaves are evaluated on a part of the Amsterdam freeway network. The effects of congestion shockwaves on a network scale can be different to uniform freeway sections due to interaction between varying traffic flows. The application of CACC to mitigate the negative effects of shockwaves on a network level are simulated and analysed in this research for varying levels of CACC penetration. The results are analysed on both a quantitative as well as qualitative level and give a deeper understanding into the possibilities of the mass application of CACC systems.	[Calvert, S.

Where Dynamic Traffic Management aims to more efficiently use existing road capacity by generic measures, Microscopic Dynamic Traffic Management anticipates suboptimal use of the available infrastructure by disturbing behavior of one or a few drivers. Using simulation, anticipation of slow predecessors in the same lane and anticipation of slow merging vehicles from an on-ramp are assessed on throughput, average travel time loss and traffic flow stability. The simulation results show positive effects, mainly on traffic flow stability, but also on throughput and travel time in the case of anticipating slow merging vehicles.

The increasing number of electric vehicles causes a need to develop the charging infrastructure, and moreover, it is necessary to analyze the network effects of the simultaneous charging of numerous electric vehicles. A further interesting question is how all this affects the distribution fee paid by the electricity end-user. In this paper, the challenge is approached by an actual case example. The data used in the simulation are collected by measuring the traffic flow of the road leading to the case area. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the grid effects of large-scale electrification of transportation can be assessed and to define the needed reinforcements and effects on the distribution fee paid by the end customers. The data are processed by applying the Monte-Carlo method. The network effects and the change in the distribution fee are evaluated. The key result is that EV charging causes a substantial amount of additional load to the grid. Hence, the distribution fee may increase if the charging system is not intelligent.

The method collects traffic flow data with Global Positioning System (GPS)-equipped taxies, which are taken as the probe vehicles. Then, the A* heuristic search algorithm is employed to judge the optimal vehicle tracking path. In addition, the average velocities of road links are calculated by considering the velocities of vehicle tracks as well as their corresponding credibility factors. Finally, an experiment with massive real-world traffic data in the surface road network of Shanghai was carried out, and the ground truth of the average velocity was obtained by repeating the videos shot on the 24 links in Shanghai downtown. The experiment results verify that the method has high accuracy and can be applied in engineering practice.

Floating car data (FCD) is emerging technique for traffic flow collection of urban large-scale road network, and it can provide effective means to model and analyze road traffic conditions. Map-matching is one of the key techniques for FCD. The typical navigation map-matching algorithms are not suitable for handling FCD with large sample interval. Through analyzing FCD characteristics, we first propose FCD map-matching algorithm based on local path searching. The information of the previous matched GPS point is utilized to reduce the search space significantly. Square confidence area is constructed to decrease the number of candidate paths. This algorithm can not only achieve FCD location with high accuracy, but also determine vehicle moving trajectory. The experimental results show our method is robust for the different sample intervals of FCD. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

How to estimate AADT and VMT on local area roads is a long-time existing problem due to lack of traffic monitor counts. This paper presents a novel approach to the community area AADT and VMT estimation by developing circuit network model and simulation to solve this difficult problem for community local traffic network roads. The circuit network model is developed based on the community traffic network, and has three sub-models combined by the least squares method (LSM). These sub-models respectively represent even, local and separate distributions of the entrance traffic flows among households in a community. The method is well validated by sampled measurement data and circuit network simulation results. In addition, it is discovered that the total entrance traffic amount is strongly related to the total number of households in communities. Thus, it makes the new method feasible to estimate the AADT and VMT on community local area roads even without any measurement in future. The proposed method not only can provide accurate estimate, but also can dramatically reduce the labor load and cost of traffic counts.

First, a selection process of the interest region is applied to the image sequences, multiplying a mask image with the original image to focus the segmentation in this region. Then, it is segmented by an iterative algorithm, which estimates the background to offset the light intensity variation, it extracts the objects on the road and, through morphological processing, removes the small lines and shapes. Finally, an analysis based on obtained contours areas calculation and addition, which compared with an experimentally obtained rate, determines the road occupation level, and controls the traffic lights status, based on this occupancy level. In experiments with different video sequences the proposed algorithm allows to control the traffic lights status by 95%, adequately.

Cellular automaton models could simulate acceleration, random deceleration and determined deceleration characteristics and lot of traffic phenomenon. Since the calculation results of cellular automation models are related to how the road is separated and the time step, they apparently have the characteristics what static models have. Imaginary slop model introduces a kind of auxiliary slope to represent the velocity restriction performed by a leading car. The related algorithm is a kind of continuous and analytical algorithm. For a giving slope length, the cars might be separated too far when the cars run slow or might be separated too near when the cars run fast. To this end, we let the slope length varied with the speed of the followed car. In this way another one way traffic simulation model based on imaginary slope with changing length is gotten. Simulation results showed that this kind of model could avoid colliding with each other when the cars run fast and the cars could approach their leading cars sufficiently when the cars run slow. This is coincident with the real tendency.

The new model considers the relative speed between vehicles and the change process of deceleration value. A simulation using Matlab software verifies that the new model overcomes inaccurate defects in computing safe-distance of the traditional models. Finally, we established an intersection traffic-wave simulation system using Visual C++ 6.0 as the software platform. Simulation results demonstrate that the new model produces better safe-distance prediction between vehicles. Hence, it improves road-use efficiency, reduces vehicle pollution and intersection delays under condition that the safety distance production is ensured. The new model can provide new ideas for control of signalized intersection.

The key factor which affects the transportation performance's further improvement is the uncertainty of traffic flow. Moreover, peak flows are rather common in buildings, while their uncertainties aren't considered by most algorithms, that could result in larger scheduling price. It's feasible to solve the problem of uncertain peak flows' dispatching with the method of Adjustable Robust Optimization (ARO). In this paper, ARO theory is put into practice, an ARO model for peak flows of Elevator Group Control System (EGCS) is built, the idea of modeling is shown, and an ARO dispatching approach is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the approach. Finally, future trends of ARO group scheduling are summarized.

By the designed tracking differentiator (TD) of ADRC, we can arrange a transition process to avoid system overshoot, and by designing an extended state observer (ESO) of ADRC, the state variables and comprehensive disturbances can be estimated and compensated. As a result, the ADRC can produce the on-ramp entering traffic flow to realize the desired traffic density without requring any information about the freeway traffic model. Furthermore, the capability and feasibility of the proposed ADRC is tested by some simulations.

We studied the 3-way circle with single-lane first and developed a detailed simulation methodology to test the performance of different control strategies. Then, we developed the model to the universal situation of N-way circles. We came up with a special theory to describe chaos and used traffic-entropy as a measure standard. Here, we focused on the pre-weaving section of each traffic circle. In addition, we came to the consideration of traffic-density and discuss the advantage of traffic lights in traffic-saturation control and entropy control. Of course, such goodness is gained with some lost, with limiting its usability. More detail was discussed in the paper and efficient advice will be given for each situation.

The simulations were conducted at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center's Airspace Operations Laboratory (AOL) in 2009 and 2010. The test airspace for all three simulations assumed the mid-term NextGen En-Route high altitude environment utilizing high altitude sectors from the Kansas City and Memphis Air Route Traffic Control Centers. Trajectory assessment, modification and coordination decision support tools were developed at the AOL in order to perform future ATFM tasks. Overall tool usage results and user acceptability ratings were collected across three areas of NextGen operations to evaluate the tools. In addition to the usefulness and usability feedback, feasibility issues, benefits, and future requirements were also addressed. Overall, the tool sets were rated very useful and usable, and many elements of the tools received high scores and were used frequently and successfully. Tool utilization results in all three HITLs showed both user and system benefits including better airspace throughput, reduced controller workload, and highly effective communication protocols in both full Data Comm and mixed-equipage environments.

The model integrates Traffic Flow Management strategies and avionics capabilities for the Next Generation Air Transportation System. It generates Traffic Management Initiatives that are designed to improve National Airspace System performance and considers best-equipped best-served prioritization schemes. This work extends previous approaches by considering Required Navigation Performance levels in the Super-Dense Operations airspace with probabilistic weather scenarios to minimize ground and en route holding delays. The paper also presents results of simulation experiments in which the feasibility of the optimization model was evaluated using several scenarios for a Super-Dense Operations problem around Chicago, including varied demand levels, Required Navigation Performance equipage distributions, and weather scenarios. The results show that without improved navigation performance system delays may increase up to five times with the expected threefold demand growth. Simulations also showed that the majority of delays may be eliminated with improved Required Navigation Performance equipage and Traffic Flow Management algorithms properly exploiting increased navigation performance.

The information exchange is mostly foreseen to be handled via decentralized Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC). But, the required information could also be exchanged via cellular networks, potentially providing better coverage. The ability of cellular systems to handle the additional traffic is an open question. The introduced network load heavily depends on the number of communicating vehicles per cell. In this paper, we predict the number of communicating vehicles per cell. First, we analyze the coverage area of existing cells in the City of Munich. Second, we match street layout and traffic flow data with cells. The study shows that over 600 vehicles per cell might be reached. The resulting numbers are primarily discussed with regard to the communication demand of a cross-traffic assistance system. However, the results can also be used to predict load as introduced by other vehicular applications that communicate via cellular networks.

Recently, various advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) have been proposed. In these ADAS, however, it is not sufficiently considering the influence of own vehicle behavior. With a novel driver assistance system based on the traffic interactions, each vehicle keeps not only own vehicle but also surrounding space in safety and comfortable, such as, Lane Change Assist for reducing traffic jam. We estimate the interactions from the behavior data of the traffic participants using Bayesian filtering techniques. Efficiency of the novel driving support with the interactions is evaluated in simple traffic simulations. In the simulated experiments, our approach improves traffic flow 140% smoother than without the driving support. Constructions of more detail traffic interaction models and demonstrations of effectiveness using real-vehicles are important feature works.

In this paper, we propose an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (ARIMA-GARCH) model for traffic flow prediction. The model combines linear ARIMA model with nonlinear GARCH model, so it can capture both the conditional mean and conditional heteroscedasticity of traffic flow series. The model is calibrated, validated and used for prediction based on PeMS single loop detector data. The performance of the hybrid model is compared with that of standard ARIMA model. The results show that the introduction of conditional heteroscedasticity cannot bring satisfactory improvement to prediction accuracy, in some cases the general GARCH(1,1) model may even deteriorate the performance. Thus for ordinary traffic flow prediction, the standard ARIMA model is sufficient.

The performance of most such applications is dependent on an effective density estimation of the vehicles in the surroundings. Of the various methods, clustering demonstrates to be an effective concept to implement this. However due to high mobility a stable cluster, within a vehicular framework, is difficult to implement. In this work, we propose a new clusterhead election policy for direction based clustering algorithm C-DRIVE. This policy facilitates to attain better stability and thus accurate density estimation within the clusters. Simulation results show that the C-DRIVE is rendered stability through new clusterhead election policy by electing fewer clusterheads in the network. This supports for a better accuracy in density estimation with fewer overheads.

This ground-breaking model focuses on the decomposition of traffic lanes, which then contributes to the scientific traffic projection. The hypernetwork model consists of hypernodes and hyperedges at the macro level. The hypernodes are defined by one-dimensional (1D) CA to represent traffic intersection states. The hyperedges are the links between hypernodes and therefore used to represent the movement or flow of the intersections. At the micro level, cells dwell in 1D CA hypernodes. By applying a set of state equations on these cells, the simulation results show that the traffic system could reach its asymptotic state, and the traffic flow characteristics are much consistent with the academic conclusions.

The objective is to minimize both the risk of the network associated to the DG transport flow and the variance of the assigned delivery planning in respect to the expected one. Different simulation tests have been performed to evaluate the goodness of the proposed model, planning one or two deliveries from different OD pairs, varying risk values on the links of the network during the time horizon. The results demonstrates that model application guarantees a decrease of risk costs splitting flows on multiple paths avoiding to transit on links characterized by an high risk at a certain time, as well as the respect of expecting flow over each link.

In this paper, we propose a new traffic control system without traffic lights at an intersection. We assume a system with fully autonomous driverless cars, and infrastructure to avoid collision completely. When automobiles approach an intersection, they communicates with the access point in both random access mode and polling mode, and the movement of the automobiles will be coordinated by the infra structure (access point). Traffic congestion is very difficult to predict and deal with because it is a function of many unknown factors such as number of cars, weather, road constructions, accidents, etc. The proposed algorithm is designed for urban road networks to ease the congestion, and make it more predictable at the same time. A key idea of this paper is that IEEE 802.11 DCF/PCF mechanisms are used to control traffic flow for driverless cars when there are no traffic lights at an intersection. The algorithm utilizes the concept of contention/contention-free period of IEEE 802.11 to find a balance between efficiency of traffic flow and fairness between users.

A method of choosing the final solution from pure strategy Nash equilibrium, mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, Pareto efficiency solution and Pareto improvement solution of Nash equilibrium was proposed. And, the single intersection coordination was combined with multi intersections coordination. Furthermore, different priorities were set for different intersections in coordination rule. The simulation showed that by adopting such method in road network, the average delay time of vehicles can be reduced up to 71.34% effectively, and the method can also be adapted to single intersection and road network in different traffic flow.

In China, the rapid development of local and regional transportation systems has been accompanied by environmental problems, which prove to be detrimental for the economic development, social stability and public health. The project METRASYS provide a prototype for an integrated environmental monitoring and simulation system. This project deals with one of the most exigent problems of current and future mega cities and metropolitan regions. Under a scenario, various case studies of environmental impacts caused by transport in urban areas have been studied using the REGOZON model. This model includes a built-in mesoscale meteorological model that computes the local meteorological fields from synoptic fields. Since the emission model strongly depends on the other submodels, the whole system architecture for traffic flow, traffic emissions and air pollution dispersion will also be introduced. This paper describes the methodology used to evaluate these impacts. Data bases for model input and simulation results, as well as a graphic user interface for spatial data visualization. Some of the results are presented here in this paper, in particular a scenario analysis for the region Hefei. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

By classifying the vehicle into three types, the equivalent traffic flows of different vehicle types can be transformed by multiply the traffic flow of different vehicle types with corresponding weighing factor. Then the total equivalent traffic flow can be obtained by adding the equivalent traffic flows of different vehicle types. Considering the traffic speed, tire/road noise, and traffic flow, the equivalent traffic flows model can be established. Using variance analysis with the data of measured noise values and computed ones, the results show that the difference between calculated mean value and measure ones is 0.145 dB(A), in 95% confidence interval of the difference the maximal difference is between -0.054 to 0.343 at locations near the road carriage way. Finally, by frequence analysis using the measured values, it can be found that the maximal frequency is the equivalent noise level of 69 dB(A), which exceeds the ideal value far. and within the housing estate. The established model can simplify the problem of noise prediction as well as satisfy the requirement of precision, is suitable for use of prediction and analysis of road traffic noise.

In regard to this, a transit signal priority strategy for isolated intersections without bus-lane was developed. Designed to give priority to buses without seriously disturbing the general traffic flow, the control strategy included three categories of phase transition rules: rules based on bus priority and green utilization, rules for phase transition between rings, rules based on bus priority for initial green phase generation. Simulation tests conducted by VISSIM and VisVAP indicate that in the case of different traffic volumes, the isolated transit signal priority strategy ensures a lower delay for the buses, and decreases weighted average delay between buses and general traffic through the intersection.

Like any simulation software, model calibration prior to its application plays a crucial role in producing reliable results. However, transportation professionals face difficulties in performing the daunting tasks of calibrating a model for each transportation network design to satisfy the targeted traffic flow demand, especially during data collection and distillation. Our innovative approach utilizes sensor and geography networking technology to seamlessly collect data about real world network, traffic, and driver behavior. This data is then distilled as needed by data mining before feeding the data to a simulation model. The data is validated automatically to instantaneously reflect the real world and to avoid typographical errors often involved with human intervention, resulting in a more accurate model. We conduct a feasibility study for our vision of model calibration automation. The research flexes multidisciplinary expertise in traffic flow simulation, geosciences, sensing/networking, and knowledge discovery. As a proof of concept, we implement a prototype that demonstrates how to convert sensor data about traffic flow collected by a state depaitment of transportation into a format taken.by CORSIM, a popular traffic simulation model. A running example shows encouraging results.

Traditional methodologies to manage congestion are not fulfilling the requirements. Limited financial resources and restricted right of way make this statement truer for developing countries. This paper evaluates low cost "Indirect Right Turn Treatment" to reduce conflicts and congestion at signalized intersections in urban areas. Volume and travel time studies were conducted at three signalized intersections in Islamabad (Capital city of Pakistan), where indirect right turn treatments were applied. Travel time study was done using GPS device. It should be noted that traffic operates on left hand side in Pakistan i.e. right turning movements are signalized. To monitor the traffic flow and driver behavior video recordings were also done on each intersection during the peak hours. Microscopic simulation model (VISSIM) and field travel time runs were used to evaluate before and after scenarios. It is found that at some locations, application of indirect right turn reduce travel time and increase the vehicle output. However, at one intersection the implementation of indirect right turn treatment resulted in increased travel times and reduced vehicle output. This is because of the number of vehicles affected by the closure of intersection are higher and also the movement of vehicles at the u-turns was effected by on-street parking. It was also observed that U-turns provided at all locations are not properly design, which elevates the safety issues. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Expressing capacity as number of vehicles passing a given section of road or traffic lane per unit time will be inappropriate when several types of vehicles with widely varying static and dynamic characteristics are comprised in the traffic. The problem of measuring volume of such heterogeneous traffic has been addressed by converting the different types of vehicles into equivalent passenger cars and expressing the volume in terms of Passenger Car Unit (PCU) per hour. The effect of variation of traffic volume, road width, magnitude of upgrade and its length on PCU value is studied. A recently developed heterogeneous traffic-flow simulation model, named, HETEROSIM is used for this study. Field data collected on traffic flow characteristics are used in calibration and validation of the simulation model. The validated simulation model is then used to derive PCU values for different types of vehicles. The PCU estimates, made through microscopic simulation, for the different types of vehicles of heterogeneous traffic, for a wide range of traffic volume and roadway conditions indicate that the PCU value of a vehicle significantly changes with change in traffic volume, width of roadway, magnitude of upgrade and its length. Using the derived PCU values, capacity guidelines are also developed for typical roadway and traffic conditions. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Likewise, many past studies investigated the effects of ITS implementation on vehicle speeds in freeway work zones. However, the effects of police enforcement and ITS implementation on work zone traffic flow characteristics and capacity have not yet been extensively studied. Hence, this study investigates the distinct effects of police enforcement and ITS implementation on work zone speed-flow curve and capacity. Three sets of traffic data were collected in a two-lane-open work zone located on I-55 near Chicago. The first data set was collected when there was only the traditional Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) signage in the work zone. The second and the third data sets were collected when there was additionally police enforcement and Speed Photo Enforcement (SPE) in the work zone, respectively. The results showed that both the police enforcement and SPE led to significant changes in the work zone speed-flow curve compared to only MUTCD signage conditions. The general shape of the speed-flow relationship inside the work zone was similar to the speed-flow curve under basic freeway conditions, but the bending point of the upper branch of the curve occurred at lower traffic flow rates and the rate of the decrease in speed was higher. The speed-flow curve for the MUTCD signage-only case returned a work zone capacity of around 1,850 passenger cars per hour per lane (pcphpl). Compared to that speed-flow curve, both the police enforcement and SPE moved the upper (uncongested) branch of the speed-flow curve downward, which caused a work zone capacity reduction of about 50 pcphpl in the case of police enforcement and 100 pcphpl in the case of SPE implementation. The results obtained through this study reveals the distinct effects of police enforcement and ITS on work zone capacity. Accurately estimating the capacity of work zones with different speed reduction treatments provides more efficient operation in a real-time system, more accurate diversion and traveler information for alternate routing, improved reliability of the system, and better understanding of the traffic flow characteristics in work zones.

While ATS is difficult to observe directly, it is virtually impossible to obtain PTSF from traffic observations; thus, the HCM2000's procedure uses ATS-flow and PTSF-flow functions derived from simulation to estimate the level of service. The highway environment in Brazil is sufficiently different from the North-American one to invalidate the use of the original HCM2000 ATS and PTSF functions. The objective of this study was to adapt HCM2000's ATS and PTSF functions for two-lane rural highways in Brazil. Traffic data were collected in 11 locations, capturing a wide range of road and traffic conditions. These data were used to calibrate and validate TWOPAS, using a genetic algorithm (GA). Synthetic traffic data, similar to those collected by in-road traffic detectors, were generated for a wide range of conditions. The generation of synthetic data uses solutions created by the GA during the calibration of TWOPAS that were just marginally worse than the optimal calibration parameter set. The synthetic data set obtained consists of distributions of flow-ATS-PTSF observations for a hypothetical road segment representing a two-lane rural highway with ideal conditions in Brazil. The HCM2000 functions were then recalibrated using these synthetic data. New mathematical relationships were also investigated: a concave ATS-flow function and an exponential function for PTSF-flow. Besides being capable of representing several curve shapes (including those in the HCM2000), these new models are more compatible with the experimental data and are thus able to better represent the behavior traffic streams on Brazilian roads. These models could potentially be used to develop an adaptation of the HCM for Brazil. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This division of the traffic flow in two parts plus the congested conditions is a rather pragmatic approach. Further the three steps pretend three separate traffic flow regimes, which don't exist. A continuous function, like it is used in the other guidelines, would replicate the traffic conditions comprehensibly and realistically. Therefore, a model based on simple queueing theory analogy is presented to represent the non-congested part of traffic flow. Moreover several models which represent each state of traffic flow by one function are discussed. These different approaches are compared to real world data from the US and Germany. Based on this analysis a new single-stage model for the approximation of fundamental diagrams for freeways is recommended. The model can also be modified in order to represent the capacity drop effect. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

There is a great variety of control algorithms to decide on red times of ramp metering signals. Based on current research results about the probability of flow-breakdown on freeway segments, a new approach for ramp metering strategies was developed. It is based on the idea of a network-wide consistent probability for a flow breakdown. This idea has been actualized for various popular ramp metering concepts. For two real-world cases, one from Minneapolis and the other from Toronto, new ramp metering algorithms have been formulated in detail based on traffic flow data from these freeways. To test the effects of these modified algorithms, microscopic simulation by VISSIM was applied. It was possible to represent traffic flow with the currently applied metering concept, and with the use of the new probability-based concepts. Simulation runs over 5 to 6 hours of traffic flow, including the decisive peak hours, have been performed. The results showed that the new algorithms were able to improve the overall performance of the freeway systems concerned. The method was able to postpone the beginning of breakdown, reduce the duration of congested periods, and, thus, reduce the total amount of travel time for drivers. Therefore, the concept of probability based ramp metering algorithms appears to be a useful tool to achieve balanced ramp metering strategies for congested freeway systems.

Empirical Study of Lane Changing in Urban Streets under Varying Traffic Conditions	6TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON HIGHWAY CAPACITY AND QUALITY OF SERVICE	Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Symposium on Highway Capacity and Quality of Service (ISHC)	JUN 28-JUL 01, 2011	Stockholm, SWEDEN	Transportat Res Board		Microscopic Traffic Simulation; Repetitions; Initialization Time; MOE; LOS; Saturation		This paper investigated the variations in accepted gaps and lane change durations with respect to different traffic flow rates on urban street. Data for accepted gaps and lane change durations were collected during the peak, off peak, and mid-day hours on normal working days to cover flow rates ranging from free flow to congested conditions. Descriptive statistics and best fit distributions were obtained for the collected data. Hypothesis testing using Mann-Whitney U Test proved that the mean size of accepted gaps was statistically different between free flow and congested conditions. The best fit distributions showed that a considerable number of drivers accepted smaller gaps during congested traffic conditions than in free flow conditions. However, lane change durations did not show any statistical difference between different flow rates. The findings from this study have direct implications on the gap acceptance and lane changing parameters used in microscopic traffic simulation, particularly during model calibration.

Critical Gap Analysis of Dual Lane Roundabouts	6TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON HIGHWAY CAPACITY AND QUALITY OF SERVICE	Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Symposium on Highway Capacity and Quality of Service (ISHC)	JUN 28-JUL 01, 2011	Stockholm, SWEDEN	Transportat Res Board		Critical Gap; Roundabout; Capacity; Gap acceptance		Roundabouts are increasingly popular because of their performance in terms of safety, capacity, and cost. Roundabouts have the potential to reduce accident risk since the traffic flows merge and diverge at small angles, and low speeds. Under certain conditions, roundabouts also improve the flow of traffic at the intersection, compared to other choices. In this paper we present a methodology for estimating an important input in the calculation of the capacity of roundabouts: the critical gap. The critical gap is the smallest gap that a driver is willing to accept to merge with the circulating traffic and mainly determines the gap acceptance behavior of the driver. The critical gap is not directly observable. Only gaps that drivers have accepted or rejected are observed. These gaps define upper and lower values for the underlying critical gap but not its exact value. The paper builds on previous literature proposing a rigorous statistical methodology for the estimation of the critical gap, and demonstrates its application through field measurements. It is assumed that the critical gap has a lognormal distribution among the driver population with a mean value that is a function of a number of explanatory variables. Based on these assumptions the critical gap and its distribution can then be estimated using maximum likelihood. A case study in a dual lane roundabout in Stockholm is used to illustrate the proposed methodology using video and other data. The results show that the critical gap depends, among other factors, on the target lane (near or far), the type of the vehicle. The results are aslo compared to values recommended by other studies.

Implementing Two-lane Highway Simulation Modeling into CORSIM1	6TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON HIGHWAY CAPACITY AND QUALITY OF SERVICE	Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Symposium on Highway Capacity and Quality of Service (ISHC)	JUN 28-JUL 01, 2011	Stockholm, SWEDEN	Transportat Res Board		Two-lane highways; Traffic Simulation; CORSIM		While urban areas and the corresponding traffic demand continue to grow, rural areas are experiencing significant growth as well. This growth is now resulting in congestion on facilities that previously did not have any. One area that is becoming a concern, particularly in Florida, is rural areas transitioning into a more developed area. Access to these areas is usually by two-lane highways, but within these areas, there may be an occasional traffic signal, and possibly segments of multilane highway as well. Currently, no analysis tool exists for analyzing two-lane highway facilities with occasional intersections. The signal spacing and other general characteristics of these roadways do not fit with the analysis criteria for signalized arterials in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), and the two-lane highway analysis procedure does not account for interruptions to the flow, such as from signals. To pursue further investigation of the traffic operations within these areas and to assist with developing a facility-level analysis methodology, a simulation tool is required. However, the existing simulation tools cannot fully meet the research demands. The objective of this project was to develop a simulation tool that is capable of modeling the combination of two-lane highway segments and signalized intersections. The development approach used was to incorporate this modeling capability into CORSIM by making the necessary additions and modifications to the existing CORSIM software code base. The primary issues that had to be addressed to implement this modeling capability included: developing the model components that deal with passing maneuvers in an oncoming lane, developing the model components that deal with passing lanes, and developing a mechanism to link highway segments to signalized intersections. Preliminary testing showed that the developed two-lane highway modeling logic produced results that are reasonably consistent with expected traffic flow theory and field observations discussed in the literature.

The road surface conditions analyzed were dry and covered with compacted snow. As evaluation indicators, average travel speed, the percentage of following vehicles and the density of following vehicles were used. As a result, the evaluation found that the installation of an auxiliary lane at certain intervals improved the level of service on two-lane highways.

Specifically, this study identified the zones that were most susceptible to bottlenecks and provided regression models that calculate the traffic density as a function of the traffic volume. In addition, the second objective of this study was to look at how the number of traffic conflicts varied with the traffic volume. Two geometric design cases were studied: four-lane and six-lane arterials using 1000 foot long (305 m long) weaving sections. VISSIM traffic simulations were used to identify the critical zones, and calculate the traffic density for different traffic flows. Volumes and densities allowed the development of regression models. Two critical zones were identified: where vehicles coming from the minor road merge to enter the U-turn and where vehicles exiting the U-turn merge to the multilane arterial. Also, based on the classification given by this study to the traffic volumes, a sensitivity analysis determined which of them had the greatest impact on the level of service.

A newly developed traffic micro-simulation model has been used for this purpose and the well known ALINEA and Demand-Capacity local ramp metering algorithms were integrated within it. Several parameters such as critical occupancy to trigger the signals, position of ramp traffic signals, position of loop detectors and length of ramp were considered. The effectiveness of ramp metering for a range of traffic flow conditions has been tested for various scenarios to show the range of values where ramp metering is beneficial.

According to the changes of the scale index, it is shown that the traffic flow time series has long-range correlation characteristics or short-range correlation characteristics. It is found that the traffic flow series shows long-range correlation when the density rho(1) < rho < rho(2); and when rho < rho(1) or rho > rho(2), the time series displays short-range correlation. That is to say, the vehicle density plays an important role in the changes of the scale index. Additionally, we also found that the ratio of slow vehicles have influence on the changes of the scale index.

Barriers could, impede pedestrian channel, but it can ensure the smooth flow of pedestrians. Quasi-sliding mode control will be introduced in LWR model. The control variable can be derived for simulation at the impact of barriers. Based on the three-lane macroscopic traffic flow model, we carry out simulation to verify our control methods. The results indicate that the maximum pedestrian flow can be maintained due to the threshold value of the quasi-sliding mode control variables as the threshold value corresponds to one of the maximum flows in the fundamental diagram. Optimization of control variables can improve efficiency of one-way pedestrian at bottleneck.

In pedestrian crosswalk without signals, there are a lot of traffic conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles crossing the intersection, which badly affects the traffic capacity and increases security risks. Through an analysis on the behavior pattern of pedestrians and vehicles crossing through the crosswalk, the paper first proposes a model based on dirty-face game to study the behavior characteristics of intersection traffic, which perfects analysis approaches to the traffic capacity of road crossing and the mixed traffic flow theory.

To operating speed as the premise, the necessary length that drivers change to the inside lane from the nearside lane is analyzed in terms of waiting for the gap acceptance, and the necessary length that drivers change to the nearside lane from the inside lane is also analyzed in terms of running for the gap acceptance, then calculation model of minimum net distance between interchanges on eight-lane expressway is constructed. The recommended value is then put forward. With the rapid development of economy and continued growth in traffic volume, domestic four-lane expressways that were built in early days present scarcity in the aspects of traffic capability, service levels and safety, etc, therefore they have been extended into eight-lane expressways in some areas. Because eight-lane expressways have characteristics of wide subgrade, several lanes, large traffic flow, drivers need to look for the gap and change lanes repeatedly in order to achieve vehicles' diversion or merging. If the distance between interchanges is too short, which lead to weaving traffic flow frequently and causing traffic accidents. At present, each component of interchange area has been researched extensively at home and abroad. Based on analysis of urban expressway, the calculation model of minimum interchange distance has been proposed by He Yu-long([1]); From the viewpoint of interchange system, using the gap acceptance theory, the model of minimum interchange distance has been constructed by Xiao Zhong-bin([2]); Basic expressway sections, weaving section and ramp junction are all studied detailedly in Highway Capacity Manual released in 2000 by American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials([3]); The path management of intersections around interchanges has also been examined in detail by National cooperative highway research program in 2004; To export notice signs as the premise, the minimum distance between interchanges has been studied and standardized by German research; Due to the definition of minimum distance is different in countries, its corresponding standard values are quite different. Without systematically researching and referring to the Japanese Road Design Specifications, the minimum net distance is defined as 1km for four-lane expressway by Highway Route Design Standard([4]) in China, and it hasn't been studied on eight-lane expressway.

The macroscopic model to describe the evolution of freeway traffic flow is firstly established. Then the coordinated ramp control system is designed. There are two layers in this coordinated control system: the coordination control layer to select traffic models, to adjust the model parameters, and to determine the desired traffic density in each freeway section according to the current traffic status; and the direct control layer to keep the actual values of state variables in the vicinity of the desired state points via PI controllers. Ant colony algorithm is used to find the optimal PI control parameters. Simulation results show that the control system is of good performance. It can eliminate traffic jams, maintain traffic flow stability, and make vehicles travel more efficiently and safely.

So, the electronic map of route network is important to collect traffic information. As present, the link dividing methods can't take into account the different conditions of traffic flow and the different attributes of the route. This paper presents a novel link dividing method: Firstly, the speed of the floating car history track is regarded as a stochastic and its frequency spectrum is obtained using Fourier transform; Secondly, the optimal sampling intervals of the link dividing are obtained using the frequency spectrum of speed and Shannon sampling theory; Finally, the novel link dividing model is founded based on the optimal sampling intervals and the attributes of the routes. This method not only considers the different conditions of traffic flow, but also distinguishes the different traffic flow of the different places of a link, which can improve application effect of the route traffic conditions and vehicle dynamic navigation.

Entropy-type conditions are considered to determine dynamics at nodes. Since entropy dispersion is a local concept, we consider a network composed by a single node J with n incoming and m outgoing arcs. We extend at J the classical Kruzkov entropy obtaining two conditions, denoted by (E1) and (E2), the first requiring entropy condition for all Kruzkov entropies, the second only for the value corresponding to a sonic point. First we show that in the case n not equal m, no Riemann solver can satisfy the strongest condition. Then we characterize all the Riemann solvers at J satisfying the strongest condition (E1), in the case of nodes with at most two incoming and two outgoing arcs. Finally we focus three different Riemann solvers, introduced in previous papers. In particular, we show that the Riemann solver introduced for data networks is the only one always satisfying (E2).

Recent advances in reliability based assessment of highway bridges	APPLICATIONS OF STATISTICS AND PROBABILITY IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering (IC ASP)	AUG 01-04, 2011	Zurich, SWITZERLAND	BKW FMB Energie AG, Bundesamt Strassen ASTRA, Fed Roads Off, Walt Galmarini AG, Det Norske Veritas AS, ETH Zurich				Often in bridge assessment the failure of a deterministic assessment at some limit state is taken to imply that the structure requires either rehabilitation or replacement. There is however a third option, probability-based safety assessment, which is often ignored by bridge owners/managers but which if considered can lead to considerable savings by avoiding the need for costly repair or rehabilitation. The principles of probabilistic assessment are no different than the techniques used in code derivation. A minimum safety index is specified for the structure, dependent upon its importance, expected failure mode etc. and at each limit state the computed level of safety of the structure is required to exceed this minimum. Therefore probabilistic assessment can be related to the derivation of a bridge specific code for the structure. The approach benefits from a lack of generalisation inherent in design codes without compromising the level of safety of the structure. A logical progression from probabilistic assessment of individual structures is the concept of safety based maintenance management. The basic premise lies in acceptance of the concept that when it becomes impossible or too costly to maintain bridges to their as-built standard, bridge owners must at least ensure that the bridges fulfil specified requirements of structural safety. Safety based bridge maintenance management is attractive as it enables bridge owners/managers to extend service lifetimes by reducing or postponing costly major rehabilitation projects. Instead focused repairs are performed on specific critical components of the structure to ensure the overall level of safety remains above the minimum requirement. The critical structural components are determined from deterministic assessment. Significantly, at no stage in the process is the required level of safety compromised. Central to the process of probability-based safety assessment is accurate modelling of the resistance and load. Original structural drawings and material records may be employed to provide information on the distributions of the material variables and consequently the parameters governing structural resistance. Bayesian updating of these distributions may be performed using results of bridge inspections, testing etc. Modelling of the loads to which the structure is subjected is often performed using codified assessment models or site surveys of loading. It is critical to assess random variables as accurately as possible to reduce the level of uncertainty. Of all loads to be modeled, by far the most variable are live loads, traditionally prescribed based upon subjective assumptions of the maximum expected axle, vehicle or combination of vehicles. These assumptions led to conservative and/or inconsistent design load effects and consequently, inconsistency in safety levels among structures. Using of Weigh in Motion (WIM) data in probabilistic safety assessment reduces uncertainty in the load-modelling process. Statistical parameters governing traffic flow at site may be accurately recorded and modelled and realistic estimates of load effects can be obtained through realistic simulations of multiple transverse and longitudinal presences. The response of the structure is also modelled with greater accuracy as the WIM system enables computation of the actual influence surface for the structure. Therefore the actual structural behaviour, incorporating any damage or change of structural system is modelled rather than that as idealised from finite element models or theory. It is however important to recognise that just as probability-based assessment attempts to model structural resistance degradation with time, some effort is required to allow for evolution of traffic with time. This paper presents through example the benefit of some of the aforementioned recent advances for reliability based safety assessment and maintenance management of highway bridges.

Traffic Flow Models which are propounded in Japanese "Fatigue design Guide Line for Road Bridges" are adopted. In those models, vehicles are classified into eight categories and have hierarchal component percentages. Each category has separate weight probability distribution. Random Numbers are generated for each category in accordance with the probability distributions and the component percentage. They are merged and shuffled. Thus a random arrayed motorcade is built for each Traffic Flow Model. An assumption is herein introduced that the generated motorcade samples have the similar probability distribution to that of traffic loads in the whole bridge life. Reliability assessment examples for the Plate-Girder Bridge are carried out using these probability characteristics, being compared with allowable stress design. Thus, a interrelation of the allowable stress design method and Reliability Theory is identified for each Traffic Flow Model. In other words, allowable stress design method can be converted to Reliability assessment method practically on the premise of Traffic Flow classification.

Along with the development of Artificial Intelligent Technology, some excellent methods have been developed to find exact or approximate solutions of optimal problems, which include Neural Network (NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and so on. Obviously, whatever Artificial Intelligence is very useful for massive Data mining. As we know, how to monitor and predict the traffic flow through urban road tunnel is a particular important problem in the traffic project of city. If this problem can be solved effectively, it would be significantly helpful for improving the quality of urban traffic service nowadays. In the present paper, an introduction on the forecast analysis of traffic flow through urban road tunnel based on artificial intelligent methods is presented. With reference to experimental data and artificial intelligent methods, a new type of analyzing model is set up for solving the problem of Data mining and knowledge discovery that will happen in forecasting traffic flow through urban road tunnel. Given its effectiveness in solving the problem, more optimal and better forecasting results can be obtained. Finally, examples show that this method is effective in predicting the traffic flow through urban road tunnel.

To understand these relationships and fix essential factors and elements, which must be taken into account, when making design solution or analyzing it, the system model was established. Based on this model the system functioning was analyzed. Results obtained explain importance of content and quality of information in sources from which driver obtains it for decision making. It was also established, that visual road image is the main information source for decision making in situation, where the traffic flow influence is small. Therefore, content and quality of this information, contained in road image, visible for driver, is formed and must be checked during design process.

J	Dell'Acqua, G; Russo, F				Dell'Acqua, Gianluca; Russo, Francesca			SAFETY PERFORMANCE FUNCTIONS FOR LOW-VOLUME ROADS	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ROAD AND BRIDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						crashes; prediction models; road safety analysis		This paper analyzes roadway safety conditions using the network approach for a number of Italian roadways within the Province of Salerno. These roadways are characterized by low-volume conditions with a traffic flow of under 1000 vpd and they are situated partly on flat/rolling terrain covering 231.98 km and partly on mountainous terrain for 751.60 km. Since 2003, the Department of Transportation Engineering at the University of Naples has been conducting a large-scale research program based on crash data collected in Southern Italy. The research study presented here has been used to calibrate crash prediction models (CPMs) per kilometer per year. The coefficients of the CPMs are estimated using a non-linear multi-variable regression analysis utilizing the least - square method. In conclusion, two injurious crash prediction models were performed for two-lane rural roads located on flat/rolling area with a vertical grade of less than 6% and on mountainous terrain with a vertical grade of more than 6%. A residuals analysis was subsequently developed to assess the adjusted coefficient of determination and p-value for each assessable coefficient of the prediction model. CPMs are a useful tool for estimating the expected number of crashes occurring within the roads' geometric components (intersections and road sections) as a function of infrastructural, environmental, and roadway features. Several procedures exist in the scientific literature to predict the number of crashes per kilometer per year. CPMs can also be used as a tool for safety improvement project prioritization.

The proposed model inherits the parameter p which considers the influence of next-nearest car introduced in the GOVM model. The simulation results show that the new model is strictly consistent with the former microscopic model. Using this macroscopic model, we can avoid considering the details of each traffic on the road, and build more complex models such as road network model easily in the future.

Therefore the need arises for simulating and optimizing traffic control algorithms to better accommodate this increasing demand. However, some limitations to the usage of intelligent traffic control exist. Avoiding traffic jams for example is beneficial to both environment and economy like a decrease in each of delay, number of stops, fuel consumption, pollutant emissions, etc., but improved traffic-flow may also lead to an increase in demand Optimization of traffic light switching increases road capacity and traffic flow, and can prevent traffic congestions. The fuzzy controller will regularly query the traffic conditions in icier to decide whether to extend or terminate a current phase. The work shows that replacing the conventional traffic control system by fuzzy based traffic control system can considerably reduce traffic congestion delay.

Developing traffic control systems require less cost than other parts of the transport infrastructure improvements. If you want to implement traffic control system to the streets of cities you must to estimate all traffic factors. In order to implement all traffic factors you need to create traffic flows imitation model. The developed imitational model of the traffic flows permits the modeling of various traffic flows at the intersections. The main task of this imitation model is traffic jam detection. Imitation model was tested with real and forecasted data. The developed imitational model of the intersection can be applied to any intersection of the city.

However, neither Lithuanian STR (Construction Technical Regulations), nor HCM/HBS (Highway...2005; Handbuch...2001) contain a more accurate methodology for the calculation of perviousness of such crossroads and road accident rate in relation to the current situation as well as in relation to the growth forecast of a traffic flow from the short-term perspective (up to 5 years). The analysis has shown that the number of road accidents resulting in deaths or injuries and the number of road accidents not resulting in deaths or injuries on such crossroads increases. The article describes a proposed methodology for the calculation of perviousness of traffic lanes and road accident rate taking account of the traffic flow volume on 1st traffic lane and of pedestrians' flow volume as well as evaluating the discipline of persons participating in road traffic in the context of Lithuanian towns.

Comprehensive approach for the development of traffic noise prediction model for Jaipur city	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Noise indices; Road traffic; Equivalent number; Conversion factors	POLLUTION	The main objective of the present study was to develop an empirical noise prediction model for the evaluation of equivalent noise level (Leq) in terms of equivalent traffic density number under heterogeneous traffic flow conditions. Ten commercial road networks are selected for monitoring and modeling. A new factor, i.e., equivalent number of light vehicles (EqLv) and for heavy vehicles (EqHv), has been used for evaluating the equivalent traffic density for each class of vehicles, and correlation graphs are plotted between equivalent traffic density with respect to EqLv and EqHv and observed equivalent noise level [Leq(o)] for the calculation of equivalent noise levels in terms of light vehicles [Leq(Lv)] and heavy vehicles [Leq(Hv)] for different identified locations as well as for the entire city. Furthermore, regression noise prediction equations have been developed between Leq(o), Leq(Lv), and Leq(Hv). After comparison of the results, it can be depicted that the light motor vehicles are the main source of noise pollution in the city and gives significantly higher correlation coefficient values. This model can be applied for the calculation of road traffic noise under interrupted traffic flow conditions in urban areas of Indian cities.	[Agarwal, Sheetal; Swami, B.

The second-order traffic flow model is firstly formulated. Then traffic density is selected as the control variable in place of traffic occupancy. Based on the traffic flow model and in conjunction with nonlinear feedback theory, an iterative learning based traffic density controller is designed. Finally, the iterative learning based feedback controller is simulated in Matlab software. Simulation results show that this method has good dynamic and steady-state performance, and can achieve an almost perfect tracking performance.

Traffic flows are unbalanced severely in two aspects of time and space. Traffic control program is key point while few researches put emphasis upon it. In this paper, a bi-level programming model to make traffic control measure is brought forward. In upper level, providing key member with high transportation service is first thought over, and then the sum of travel delay of the masses and cost of traffic control is minimized. In lower level, evacuation delay of activities personnel is designed to ensure no traffic jam emerged. Rough set genetic algorithm is employed to solving bi-level programming problem in the paper, and an example of traffic control to massive activity verifies the validity of the proposed model.

It is important to design a reasonable road network within logistics hub to reduce the whole carbon emissions. Previous studies have targeted as maximum economics benefits or least time consumed, which ignored the environmental effects. This paper uses the model of minimum cost maximum flow to optimize the road network, in the model, "cost" is defined as carbon emissions, so we can finally achieve the goal, then classify the type of road according to the capacity, the decreasing order is trunk road, secondary road and slip road. The above classification can help with arranging transportation and guiding the traffic flow. The paper lists the specific optimal plan to the logistics hub in Luan County. However the factors concluded in the model is not adequate, we should consider the factor of road length, and it is also a factor affected carbon emission.

One of the most successful areas these technologies have been applied are in the simulation and optimization of complex systems. Traffic simulation/optimization problems are a specially suitable target for such a platform. This paper proposes a new Multi-Agent simulation platform, where agents are based on a Swarm model (lightweight agents with very low autonomy or proactivity). Using this framework, simulation designers are free to configure road networks of arbitrary complexity, by customizing road width, geometry and intersection with other roads. To simulate different traffic flow scenarios, vehicle trajectories can be defined by choosing start and end locations and providing traffic generation functions for each one trajectory defined. Finally, how many vehicles are generated at each time step can be determined by a time series function. The domain of traffic simulation has been selected to investigate the effect of traffic light configuration on the flow of vehicles in a road network. The experimental results from this platform show a strong correlation between traffic light behavior and the flow of traffic through the network that affects the congestion of the road.

Given the positions of each car at two recorded locations on a highway and the corresponding time instances, our approach can reconstruct the traffic flows (i.e., the dynamic motions of multiple cars over time) between the two locations along the highway for immersive visualization of virtual cities or other environments. Our algorithm is applicable to high-density traffic on highways with an arbitrary number of lanes and takes into account the geometric, kinematic, and dynamic constraints on the cars. Our method reconstructs the car motion that automatically minimizes the number of lane changes, respects safety distance to other cars, and computes the acceleration necessary to obtain a smooth traffic flow subject to the given constraints. Furthermore, our framework can process a continuous stream of input data in real time, enabling the users to view virtualized traffic events in a virtual world as they occur. We demonstrate our reconstruction technique with both synthetic and real-world input.

Application of automatic vehicle identification technology for real-time journey time estimation	INFORMATION FUSION			English	Article						Real-time traveler information system; Journey time estimation; Automatic vehicle identification data; Hong Kong	TRAFFIC FLOW SIMULATOR; TRAVEL; INFORMATION	This paper presents a real-time traveler information system (RTIS) for journey time estimation using automatic vehicle identification (AVI) data in Hong Kong. This RTIS can also deduce the travel times on the other road links without real-time AVI data. The travel times, in RTIS, are estimated by the real-time AVI data, the off-line travel time estimates and the related spatial variance-covariance relationships between road links. The real-time AVI data adopted for RTIS are Autotoll tag data in Hong Kong: whereas the off-line link travel time estimates and their spatial variance-covariance matrices are obtained from a traffic flow simulator. By integration of these real-time and off-line traffic data together, the travel times on the road links either with or without real-time AVI data can be updated at 5-min intervals. Validation of journey time estimates is carried out at various selected paths in Hong Kong urban area. The results show that the performance of RTIS on real-time journey time estimation in Hong Kong is satisfactory and acceptable. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Among methods for detection of traffic flow parameters, video camera is a promising candidate for traffic flow parameters detection due to large detection region, low cost and no influence to traffic. In this paper, some key issues in image processing of video records, including background model, image segmentation, shadow suppression and object matching, are investigated. The incorporation of video monitoring technology into structural health monitoring system, is recommended to bridge the gap between traffic load monitoring and structural response monitoring. Research conducted reveals that video monitoring is capable of detecting various traffic flow parameters and that more meaningful information can be achieved via sensor data fusion. A comprehensive solution of traffic monitoring is also presented in light of the shortcomings of traffic monitoring by video alone.

Available data include air pollution concentrations measured in Gottinger Strasse (Hannover, Germany), Schildhornstrasse (Berlin, Germany), Jagtvej (Copenhagen, Denmark) and Hornsgatan (Stockholm, Sweden), background pollution, wind speed and direction measured on the roof of a nearby building and information of traffic flow. Results show that coefficients a and h, related to natural- and traffic- produced turbulences, vary with wind direction. The variation of critical wind speed with traffic density and wind direction is also studied for each street canyon.	[Mazzeo, N. A.; Venegas, L.

It predicts vehicular flows on the transportation network by assigning travel demands given in terms of an origin-destination trip table to routes in a network according to some behavioral route choice rules. In this paper, we enhance the realism of the traffic equilibrium problem by explicit modeling various physical and environment restrictions as side constraints. These side constraints are a useful means for describing queuing and congestion effects, restraining traffic flows to limit the amount of emissions, and modeling different traffic control policies. A generalized side-constrained traffic equilibrium (GSCTE) model is presented and some characterizations of the equilibrium solutions are discussed. The model is formulated as a variational inequality problem and solved by a predictor-corrector decomposition algorithm. Two numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate some properties of the GSCTE model and the convergence properties of the decomposition algorithm.

As sources of information, the authors consider 2 separate types of link sensors: counters and scanners. The first type leads to a method, which is an alternative to the previous method of Hu, Peeta, and Chu. First, the authors show how the previous method can be directly used for solving the partial observability problem. Next, the authors present a simple alternative algorithm, based on the pivoting strategy, that can include information about route and Origin-Destination (OD) flows observability. The observability problem based on scanners leads to a more difficult problem but supplies much more information about traffic flows. The authors give 2 simple algorithms for solving this problem in this case. The first algorithm allows checking that a given subset of links supplies the required information to estimate the flows in the selected subset of links, and provides information about route and OD observability. The second, which is a random algorithm, permits reducing the number of links of an initial subset of scanned links that solves the problem, and when a further reduction is not possible, modifies the initial set of scanning links for a new trial randomly. The proposed methods are illustrated using the parallel highway network of Hu, Peeta, and Chu. Last, the authors apply methods to two examples of applications-the Nguyen-Dupuis and the real Cuenca network-and provide some conclusions.

Risk assessment of highway bridges under multiple hazards	JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH			English	Article						quantitative risk assessment; multi-hazard; time-dependent probability; structural redundancy; hazard function; time-to-failure; bridge	CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE; RELIABILITY; DECISIONS; SAFETY	The aim of this paper is to provide a rational framework for the quantitative risk assessment of highway bridges under multiple hazards. Risk is a crucial indicator to be considered when managing structures of great importance such as highway bridges. It associates the consequences of a structural failure or malfunction with the probability of bridge failure. Time-dependent total risk is computed and the effect of structural redundancy is investigated and implemented. The proposed framework includes the estimation of the effects of multiple common hazards such as abnormal traffic loads, environmental attacks, scour, and earthquakes. The failure probabilities associated with the considered hazards are evaluated separately using different approaches. Time-dependent failure probabilities, hazard functions, and probability density functions of the time-to-failure are also assessed for each hazard. These assessments contribute to the evaluation of risk considering the traffic flow and the local economy at the bridge location. Both epistemic and aleatory uncertainties are considered in this approach. Time-dependent profiles of risk, accounting for direct and indirect consequences, are obtained for an existing highway bridge.

Based on the vehicle dynamic analysis, therefore, a 3 step-based safety following space identification model according to Mazda vehicle is proposed to describe the brake performance and three driving states are taken into considering, including total following state, part following state, and three-kind extreme states. Then, a self-adaptive fuzzy reasoning model is used to control the traveling speed so as to adjust the traffic flow as smoothly as possible. The Matlab simulation results shows this proposed fuzzy control model helps minimize the occurrence probability of rear-end collision on highway and improve the overall traffic safety performance and management level.

In traditional coordinated system operation, whether plans are set by time of day or by traffic responsive plan selection, traffic flow can be severely disrupted by the sudden changes in traffic signal timing. Although various transition methods have been developed and refined, existing transition methods are not based on optimizing operational measures of effectiveness during plan transition periods. As the first step in remedying this situation, this paper presents a nonlinear mathematical model that provides constrained delay minimization through incremental and simultaneous adjustments in offset and cycle length during plan transitions. According to the simulation results, currently used transition methods tend to assign an excessive amount of green time to the main street, resulting in additional side street delay without performance improvement for the total transportation network. By contrast, the proposed transition method showed measurable improvement in delay performance under a broad range of traffic and geometric conditions. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Under the planning paradigm employed in the U. S., this rationing process occurs independently at each resource. The stochastic integer programming model proposed in this paper brings coordination to this process while considering capacity uncertainty. Results of a case study suggest that the model is tractable, and generates capacity allocations that improve efficiency and enable greater responsiveness to changing capacity conditions.

After these proposed models are validated, they are applied to a simple one-way, one-lane expressway section containing a bottleneck, and the stochastic nature of traffic breakdown is demonstrated through theoretical exercises.

In this paper we investigate the accuracy of satellite-based positioning data in various system environments using a detailed system model, which includes all relevant impairments of the propagation channel as well as receiver behavior. Based on a multi-scale simulation concept, which takes into account satellite mobility and constellations, satellite selection by the receiver using GDOP and determination of TOA impacted by shadowing and multi-path propagation, the feasibility of a lane-specific positioning is investigated. The results presented in this paper include a detailed discussion of the evaluation of the lane-specific positioning accuracy of different satellite systems and their combination (GPS/GALILEO) as well as rural, sub-urban and urban system environments.

The congestion phase is described by a two-dimensional zone defined around a standard fundamental diagram. General criteria for building such a set-valued fundamental diagram are enumerated and instantiated on several standard fluxes with different concavity properties. The solution to the Riemann problem in the presence of phase transitions is obtained through the design of a Riemann solver, which enables the construction of the solution of the Cauchy problem using wavefront tracking. The free-flow phase is described using a Newell-Daganzo fundamental diagram, which allows for a more tractable definition of phase transition compared to the original Colombo phase transition model. The accuracy of the numerical solution obtained by a modified Godunov scheme is assessed on benchmark scenarios for the different flux functions constructed.

CONVEX FORMULATIONS OF DATA ASSIMILATION PROBLEMS FOR A CLASS OF HAMILTON-JACOBI EQUATIONS	SIAM JOURNAL ON CONTROL AND OPTIMIZATION			English	Article						data assimilation; data reconciliation; convex optimization; Hamilton-Jacobi equations	VISCOSITY SOLUTIONS	This article proposes a new method for data assimilation and data reconciliation problems applicable to systems modeled by conservation laws. The problem is solved directly in the equivalent format of a Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation, for which the solution is fully characterized by a Lax-Hopf formula. Using properties of the solution, we prove that when the data of the problem is prescribed in piecewise affine form, the resulting constraints which consist of the partial differential equation in data assimilation and reconciliation problems are convex, and can be instantiated explicitly. This property enables us to identify a class of data assimilation and data reconciliation problems that can be formulated using convex programs in standard form. We illustrate the capabilities of the method for reconstruction of highway traffic flow using experimental data generated from the Mobile Century experiment.

Despite the importance of these networks, archival databases that often have update rates on the order of years or even decades have historically been the main source for obtaining and analyzing road network information. This somewhat static view of a potentially changing infrastructure can cause the information to therefore be incomplete and incorrect. Furthermore, these road databases are not only static, but rarely provide information beyond a simple two-dimensional view of a road, where divided high-ways are represented in the same manner as a rural dirt road. It is for these reasons that the use of Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) data and tracks to create road networks is explored. This data lends itself to being able to not only provide a single static snapshot of a network that is considered the network for years, but to provide a consistently accurate and updated changing picture of the environment. The approach employed for creating a road network from GMTI tracks includes a technique known as Continuous Dynamic Time Warping (CDTW), as well as a general fusion routine.

Our aim is to improve traffic flows by dynamic traffic management which is supported by vehicular communication interlinking centralized and decentralized decision making. We focus on traffic state estimation and the optimization of traffic lights as a central component to influence local traffic states, while individual traffic participants' behavior is modeled by multiagent systems. Traffic participants achieve their individual goals by formation of groups and improving their knowledge about the road network by means of learning. Modeling of vehicular communication takes into account specific characteristics of urban areas, ensuring the realistic collection and dissemination of (de)centralized information. We provide a comprehensive microscopic traffic simulation framework featuring innovative functionality regarding dynamic traffic management, decentralized decision making as well as realistic communication modeling. To illustrate and validate our approach, we present a use case in a city scenario. Simulations are implemented based on the microscopic traffic simulator AIMSUN, which is significantly extended using the. AIMSUN API.

In particular, studies have confirmed that the reproduction by simulation of user behaviour under different flow and geometric conditions, can identify a potential incident hazard and allow to take appropriate countermeasures at specific points of the road network. The objective of this paper is to assess the validity of this approach and present a new methodology for investigating road safety issues. A calibrated microsimulation model has been developed to analyze vehicle trajectories, and hence vehicle interactions, in some different scenarios and verify traffic safety levels. The microscopic model allows the estimation of road safety performance through a series of indicators (Crash Potential Index, Deceleration Rate to Avoid Crash, Maximum Available Deceleration Rate, Time to Collision, etc.), representing interactions in real time between different pairs of vehicles belonging to the traffic stream. When these indicators take a certain critical value, a possible accident scenario is identified. The validation of the proposed methodology can be done by comparing the value assumed by safety performance indicators in simulated and real scenarios. The microscopic simulation model is also combined with a new video image traffic detection algorithm to detect vehicle trajectories. Microscopic traffic flow parameters obtained by video detection are, in fact, used to calibrate the microsimulation model. The above described methodology has been applied in the analysis of overtaking maneuvers on single lane for direction fast rural roads. Results indicate that the methodology can be useful in the estimation of safety performance indicators and in evaluating traffic control measures. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The numerical analyses are carried out on the succeeding sections of a freeway segment inputting data obtained from microwave radar sensor units located successively at the cross-sections of a freeway segment of approximately 4 km. Measurements on traffic variables, i.e., vehicle counts, speed, and occupancy, for the reference time periods are processed. The structure of the employed radial basis function neural networks are configured considering the data of a three-lane freeway segment obtained by succeeding sensors located in side-fired position. Travel time measures approximated by the neural models are compared with the corresponding field measurements obtained by probe vehicle. Results prove neural model's performance in representing spatiotemporal variation of flow dynamics as well as travel times. Adaptability of the proposed travel time specification procedure to real-time intelligent control systems is a possible future extension. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The first generation of such systems has been based on historical traffic data. The second generation took advantage of detectors, which enabled the collection of real-time traffic data, in order to re-adjust and select traffic signalization programs. The third generation provides the ability to forecast traffic conditions, in order to have traffic signalization programs and strategies pre-computed and applied at the most appropriate time frame for the optimal control of the current traffic conditions. Nowadays, the fourth generation of traffic control systems is already under development, based among others on principles of artificial intelligence and having capabilities of on-time information provision, traffic forecasting and incident detection is being developed according to principles of large-scale integrated systems engineering. Although these systems are largely benefiting from the developments of various information technology and computer science sectors, it is obvious that their performance is always related to that of the underlying optimization and control methods. Until recently, static traffic assignment (route choice) modes were used in order to forecast future traffic flows, considering that the parameters which affect the network capacity are fixed over a given origin-destination matrix. Traffic engineering considers traffic flows as being constant and tries to optimize the control parameters in order to optimize certain parameters and measures of effectiveness. These two procedures, although largely depend on each other and known as the combined traffic assignment and control problem, are usually handled separately. The recent scientific and research developments in the fields of traffic assignment, with the rapid development of the advantageous Dynamic Traffic Assignment models, the new dynamic traffic control strategies and the evolution of ITS tend to modify the way with which networks are being modelled and their efficiency is measured. The current paper aims to present the major findings out of a critical review of existing scientific literature in the fields of dynamic traffic assignment and traffic control. Combined traffic assignment and traffic control models are discussed both in terms of the underlying mathematical formulations, as well as in terms of algorithmic solutions, in order to better evaluate their applicability in large scale networks. In addition, a generic and easily transferable scheme, in the form of a methodological framework for the Combined Dynamic Traffic Assignment and Urban Traffic Control problem is presented and applied on a realistic urban network, so as to provide numerical results and to highlight the applicability of such models in cases, which differ from the standard test networks of the related bibliography, which are usually of simple nature and form.

The network is viewed as a continuum of orthotropic roads. This (and the side-constraints) constitutes the main research contributions of the paper. Each point of the area is characterized by a travel cost and a side constraint that depend on the privileged directions. A side constraint is a means to obtain a more precise description of traffic flow as far as it does not allow it to exceed the capacity of the roads (Larsson & Patriksson, 1995; Taguchi & Iri, 1982). Each destination is characterized both by a monotonic strictly decreasing function to reflect the customers' elastic demand with respect to the total cost (Yang & Wong, 2000) and a satisfaction function to reflect the customers' gain as entering the desired destination. The study deals with a multi-commodity traffic assignment. We suppose that there are a few destinations for the commuters in the area. All the commuters are uniformly distributed in the area and try to reach their destination. A commodity is defined as the traffic flows from the area to one of the destinations (Yang & Wong, 2000). We express equilibrium as a primal problem which is the minimization of a mathematical convex program (Yang, Yagar & Iida, 1994) adapted to the orthotropic case. This program is inspired from the Beckmann objective function (Beckmann, 1952). To solve this program, we use a Lagrangian scheme and a dual method. This technique provides a potential function that explains the flows of traffic over the city, and the over costs generated by the saturated flows. We prove that the solution fits with the User Equilibrium principle (Wardrop, 1952). We apply the model to the case of Paris urban area, where we put an orthotropic network. The commuters are uniformly distributed on the city, and try to reach some destinations located on the ring on-ramps. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This is largely because simulation saves engineering time and costs, and virtual situations provide an easier and safer way to carry out road and traffic safety studies. Scenarios or scenes that realistically reproduce traffic behaviour according to the traffic flow theory has been developed since the 1980s and traffic simulators are a widely used technology in the research, planning, evaluation and development of new traffic systems (for instance Intelligent Traffic Systems). The aim of this paper is to explain how providing a simulation framework based on the integration of a driving simulation engine and a traffic simulation can respond to the issues addressed by offering multi-level and multi-domain simulation models. This paper describes the integration of the driving simulator SCANER and the traffic simulator Aimsun, where the driving simulator (including visual, audio and kinaesthetic restitution) manages the simulation in the immediate driver environment and the traffic simulator manages the whole road network situation, creating a large-scale, realistic and minutely detailed virtual world.

Examining Traffic Flow and Speed Data: Determining Imitative Behavior	TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION			English	Article						Contagion theory; Social context; Speeding; Temporality	CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; ACCIDENTS; SUGGESTIONS	Objectives: This article will empirically examine the contagion theory using traffic count and speed data. This theory proposes that a driver's choice of speed will be influenced by the speed of other drivers on the road. Thus, if a person is driving at the speed limit but a certain number of the surrounding vehicles are driving faster, the person can be influenced to increase his speed. It is implied that there would be different types or groups of drivers, each with different propensities toward imitation. Imitative behavior will be considered as a possible mechanism behind contagion theory. Methods: A standard traffic counter was used to collect for a period of 8 days. Using cluster analysis, the data will be differentiated and the group characteristics examined. Finally, these effects will be examined on an hourly basis to determine whether time of day has any effect upon the outcome. Results: The analysis produced several groups of drivers similar to that predicted by contagion theory. Two groups of drivers, high-speed and lower speed drivers, remain relatively stable in numbers as expected. Two intermediate groups showed signs of imitative behavior. Conclusions: The results appear to support contagion theory as a social mechanism influencing individual drivers' choices of speed. Several alternative explanations are introduced as partial explanations. In light of the traffic accident problem in the United Arab Emirates and recent police programs aimed at reducing this problem, such studies aid in determining the extent of speeding behavior and the effectiveness of recent initiatives.

HETEROGENEOUS TRAFFIC FLOW MODELING USING MACROSCOPIC MODEL: A PRACTICAL APPROACH	TRANSPORT DYNAMICS			English	Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference of Hong-Kong-Society-for-Transportation-Studies	DEC 17-20, 2011	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	Hong Kong Soc Transportat Studies, Univ Hong Kong, Inst Transport Studies, Dept Civil Engn		Heterogeneous traffic; macroscopic model; speed-gradient model	WAVES	In this paper, a simulation study of a higher order macroscopic model for heterogeneous traffic consisting of six vehicle types is presented. The macroscopic model consists of the conservation equation, a momentum equation, equilibrium relationship between speed and the density, and the relation 'flow is equals to density * speed'. The momentum equation derived from a microscopic model by Tang et al. (2009) that deals with the lane disciplined heterogeneous traffic, has been utilized in a slightly modified form. The modification is to incorporate, the side-by-side movement of motorized two-wheelers and other small sized vehicles within a single lane. The parameters used in the equilibrium speed density relationship are obtained from the field data. Stationary field data have been collected using Edie's generalized definitions. The modification for side-by-side movement of smaller vehicles has also been incorporated in the speed-density relation. Model calibration and validation have been carried out using the stationary field data. It has been observed that the model is able to regenerate the variability in most of the macroscopic variables.

Recently, the amount of empirical traffic data has become widely available from multiple (heterogeneous) sources such as loop detectors, floating cars and cell phones, etc. The estimation and reconstruction of traffic states from such heterogeneous data sources are a challenging problem in traffic science. Many efforts have been undertaken to make use of information from multiple data sources in order to better predict the evolution of traffic states on freeways. However, a definite answer for a successful method has not been found yet. This paper concerns the development of a traffic state estimator on freeways using such multiple data sources. The proposed estimator is a model based type which combines a traffic prediction model with information obtained from multiple data sources to provide a robust and complete description of traffic dynamics on freeways.

PROBLEMS OF ESTIMATION OF THE GENERALIZED DISTANCE BETWEEN ZONES IN TRANSPORTATION MODELS	TRANSPORT DYNAMICS			English	Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference of Hong-Kong-Society-for-Transportation-Studies	DEC 17-20, 2011	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	Hong Kong Soc Transportat Studies, Univ Hong Kong, Inst Transport Studies, Dept Civil Engn		Generalized distance; traffic flow; trip matrices; correspondence split		In this work, we consider the problem which lies in the basis of numerous models intended for modeling the dynamics of complex large-scale multimodal transportation systems. We consider the problem of estimation of generalized distance between different regions which is used for the evaluation of trip matrices for a given transport network. We base our approach on averaging transportation costs for different transportation modes (pedestrian mode or various modes of motorized transport). Our approach provides an estimation formula with a natural property of monotonicity with respect to transportation costs for different transportation modes. The proposed approach suggests a set of criteria for producing individualized estimates and for averaging such estimates over all users of the transportation network. Derived models were tested using the "TRANSNET" software, developed by researchers at the Institute of System Analysis of the Russian Academy of Science for modeling transport flow in a city or urban agglomeration.

The proposed model considers traffic flows and queue lengths of cars and motorcycles as state variables and extension of green time as control variable towards the minimization of total vehicle delays. For the learning efficiency of SGFLC and the capability in capturing traffic behaviors of Asian urban streets where mixed traffic of cars and motorcycles is prevailing, mixed traffic cell transmission model (MCTM) is also proposed to replicate traffic behaviors. To validate the performance of the proposed SGFLC model, comparisons to two enumeration pre-timed signal timing plans and two adaptive signal timing models are conducted. Results show that our proposed SGFLC model almost achieves the optimal control. As traffic flows vary more noticeably, the SGFLC model performs even better, suggesting that the proposed SGFLC signal control model is effective, robust and applicable.

In this paper a geometric interpretation for the reverse assignment is proposed. In the reverse assignment the input are the link flows and performance and the output are the link cost parameters of the cost-flow functions utilised in the supply model and the value (number of trips) and/or the model parameters of the demand model. From the application of this methodology derives several implications in a real-size transport system with real-time monitoring, calibration and control with Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). The model and the procedure are tested in a small city in order to verify the applicability of the methodology and the difference with the traditional model.

Such analyses are sensitive to the temporal aggregation of the data, an issue that has been widely ignored in the transportation literature. In traffic engineering, aggregation usually equals to the average of a variable across large regular time intervals, such as 15 minutes, hours, days, months and so on. We investigate the effects of temporal aggregation on time series of traffic volume and occupancy in urban signalized arterials. Results indicate that aggregation eliminates long memory characteristics and variance heterogeneity; this leads to smoothing traffic variation and creating a time series structure that has reduced sensitivity to changes in traffic. Moreover, aggregation was found to directly affect volatility as captured by the parameters of the Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditionally Heteroskedastic (GARCH) models.

Current unsignalized intersection delay models have been developed mostly for operational purposes, and demand detailed geometric data and complicated procedures to estimate delay. These difficulties result in unsignalized intersection delays being ignored or assumed as a constant in TA models. Video and vehicle license plate number recognition methods are used to collect traffic volume data and to measure delays during peak and off-peak traffic periods at four unsignalized intersections in the city of Tehran, Iran. Data on geometric design elements are measured through field surveys. An empirical approach is used to develop a delay model as a function of influencing factors based on 5- and 15-min time intervals. The proposed model estimates delays on each approach based on total traffic volumes, rights-of-way of the subject approach and the intersection friction factor. The effect of conflicting traffic flows is considered implicitly by using the intersection friction factor. As a result, the developed delay model guarantees the convergence of TA solution methods. A comparison between delay models performed using different time intervals shows that the coefficients of determination, R-2, increases from 43.2% to 63.1% as the time interval increases from 5- to 15-min. The US Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) delay model (which is widely used in Iran) is validated using the field data and it is found that it overestimates delay, especially in the high delay ranges.

A generic class of first order node models for dynamic macroscopic simulation of traffic flows	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Macroscopic node model; Dynamic network loading; Dynamic traffic assignment	NETWORK; ASSIGNMENT; MERGE	Node models for macroscopic simulation have attracted relatively little attention in the literature. Nevertheless, in dynamic network loading (DNL) models for congested road networks, node models are as important as the extensively studied link models. This paper provides an overview of macroscopic node models found in the literature, explaining both their contributions and shortcomings. A formulation defining a generic class of first order macroscopic node models is presented, satisfying a list of requirements necessary to produce node models with realistic, consistent results. Defining a specific node model instance of this class requires the specification of a supply constraint interaction rule and (optionally) node supply constraints. Following this theoretical discussion, specific macroscopic node model instances for unsignalized and signalized intersections are proposed. These models apply an oriented capacity proportional distribution of the available supply over the incoming links of a node. A computationally efficient algorithm to solve the node models exactly is included. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Tampere, Chris M.

The key assumption of current car-following theory is that vehicles travel in the middle of a single lane. However, this assumption is unrealistic and cannot describe driving behavior in a complex traffic environment. When the lateral separation characteristics between the follower and the leader are taken into account, the time-to-collision equation is modified with visual angle information and introduced into the General Motors model. A non-lane-based model of car following was developed; it uses time to collision and is based on the stimulus response framework. The proposed model was investigated with simulations conducted under several driving scenarios. The model could describe local and asymptotic stabilities, lateral movement, and the effect of neighboring vehicles. Results implied that this staggered car-following model incorporating lateral separation greatly enhanced the realism of car-following behavior.

J	Chen, XH; Han, H; Ye, JH; Ma, SJ; Xu, YL				Chen, Xiaohong; Han, Hui; Ye, Jianhong; Ma, Shijiang; Xu, Yilun			Normalized Volume Measurement for Nonmotorized Traffic Flow Mixed with Mopeds	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Mopeds, experiencing faster growth of use than bicycles, have been swarming urban streets in China in recent years. The mixture of mopeds and bicycles in the same road space has led to great change in the composition and the traffic flow characteristics of nonmotorized traffic. It is impractical to measure the nonmotorized traffic flow by simply aggregating the vehicle counts of mopeds and bicycles because of their distinct temporal spatial traffic features. This paper proposes a methodology to measure the normalized volume of a nonmotorized traffic mix of mopeds and bicycles. A bicycle equivalent (BE) concept is introduced to measure the moped in equivalent bicycle units and then to normalize the traffic flow mix. Two BE analysis methods that express the relationship between speeds, densities, and occupied spaces for mopeds and bicycles have been developed. A case study estimates the BE from these methods by using field data collected at a midblock section of an arterial in Shanghai. Statistical analysis of observed data shows that the estimated equivalent unit of moped to bicycle is variable under different traffic conditions. Specifically, the equivalent value of moped to bicycle is less than one under lower-density conditions. The value is, however, more than one under higher-density conditions. These findings are valuable to support the measurement of a nonmotorized traffic mix of mopeds and bicycles.

This study proposes a methodology for estimating lane-level travel times ((LTT)-T-2) under an environment referred to as V2X, which includes vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. A framework is presented for a V2X-based traffic information system that is capable of transmitting vehicle positions and speeds, which are used as inputs of the proposed methodology. A concept of establishing temporal nodes and links based on the dynamic change in traffic conditions is proposed to estimate more reliable and accurate (LTT)-T-2. VISSIM, a microscopic traffic simulator for multimodal traffic flow modeling, is used to evaluate the proposed travel time estimation method. Statistical analysis techniques including analysis of variance and a homogeneity test between data groups are adopted to derive more generalized conclusions. The evaluation results show that less than a 10% mean absolute percentage error was achievable with a 20% probe vehicle rate. It is expected that the proposed methodology will serve as a useful precursor to the development of a next-generation traffic information system in the robust wireless communications era.

Relation of Flow, Speed, and Density of Urban Freeways to Functional Form of a Safety Performance Function	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Constructive discussion of the appropriate choice for the functional form of safety performance functions (SPFs) is generally absent from research literature on road safety. Among researchers who develop SPFs, there appears to be a consensus that the underlying randomness in accident counts is well described by the negative binomial (NB) distribution. The underlying phenomenon itself, however, is not well understood and is rarely discussed. The choice of the regression equation is usually not explained or documented. Researchers most commonly use the power function, possibly because most generalized linear modeling (GLM) statistical packages can accommodate the power function with little effort. The modeling process, however statistically rigorous, at times seems disconnected from the physical phenomenon that it is trying to describe. The disconnect, however, has attracted only limited interest from researchers to date. Accidents on an urban freeway are a by-product of traffic flow; therefore, changes in the flow parameters may give clues about the probability of accident occurrence and changes in accident frequency. This study related traffic flow parameters, such as speed and density, to the choice of the functional form of the SPF. It compared SPF models for urban freeways developed with sigmoid and exponential functional forms with the use of data from Colorado and California and contrasted the cumulative residual (CURE) plots of the models. SPFs developed around a sigmoid functional form through the use of neural network (NN) methodology suggested underlying relationships between safety and traffic flow characteristics. CURE plots for NN-generated SPFs generally showed a better-quality model tit when compared with power-function SPFs, which were developed in the GLM framework with an NB error structure.

Location-Based Data for Estimated Traffic on Urban Arterial in Heterogeneous Traffic Conditions	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							WAVES; MODEL	Accurate estimation of traffic in intelligent transportation system applications, such as the advanced traveler information system and the advanced traffic management system, requires fixed location-based measurements, vehicle-based measurements, or both. Using both data sources is too expensive for most government agencies, especially in developing countries such as India, and also leads to issues related to installation and maintenance, especially on urban roads. The main drawback of vehicle-based measurements is the potential lack of participation because of privacy concerns; lack of participation would limit data collection to a sample of the population, primarily on public transport vehicles. The study aims to overcome such difficulties by using only location-based flow data for the estimation of spatial parameters, such as density and travel time. These parameters are difficult to measure or estimate on an urban arterial, especially under heterogeneous traffic conditions, because of lack of lane discipline and because of complex interactions among different vehicle types. The Lighthill-Whitham-Richards macroscopic traffic flow model discretized in both space and time was employed in the estimation scheme. The resulting partial differential equations were solved numerically with the finite difference formulation of forward time backward space. Both linear and exponential speed density relationships were considered and incorporated into the macroscopic model. Linear and cubic spline interpolations of input flow values were compared.

The composite behavior of acceleration and gap acceptance of the merging traffic as well as the cooperative behavior of the freeway traffic can result in conflicts and trigger congestion. The goal of this research was to develop a ramp-merging model that considered the merging process as perceived by drivers and to investigate the contribution of individual drivers' merging behavior to the breakdown event. Focus group meetings were conducted, and drivers' merging behavior was observed in in-vehicle experiments. The data were used to develop a gap-acceptance model under different merging conditions and a model of driver behavior that predicted vehicle interactions on the freeway with merging vehicles, considering different driver types. A merging turbulence model that evaluated the effect of vehicle interactions on traffic flow also is presented. Study findings can be used to refine existing micro-simulation models, realistically replicate freeway flow breakdown, and provide insight into the triggers of the breakdown of freeway flow.

J	Nimes, SC; Donnell, ET; Porter, RJ				Nimes, Scott C.; Donnell, Eric T.; Porter, Richard J. (R. J. )			New Insights on Evaluations of Design Consistency for Two-Lane Highways	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							OPERATING SPEEDS; RURAL HIGHWAYS	Operating speed prediction models along horizontal curves of two-lane rural highways have been the topic of a significant body of literature. Operating speed models for two-lane rural highway tangents and for horizontal curves on low-speed urban streets also exist but are less developed. These models, estimated primarily by means of ordinary least squares regression, generally use aggregate-level data to estimate the effect of geometric design variables on the mean or 85th percentile operating speed but do not explicitly consider measures of speed dispersion (e.g., standard deviation). Most existing models consider speeds of free-flow passenger vehicles; traffic flow effects on speed are generally not quantified. Finally, published literature shows that researchers have not converged on a consistent modeling practice about the use of posted speed limit as an explanatory variable in operating speed models. Collectively, these issues may lead to design consistency assessments that are not truly reflective of the operating conditions along a two-lane highway. These issues are explored in this paper with the use of operating speed data collected at multiple points along eight two-lane highway segments. A simultaneous equations approach is used to estimate a three-equation model of the posted speed limit, mean speed, and speed deviation. The predicted 85th percentile speed is compared with the observed 85th percentile speed along a high-speed, two-lane rural highway. Predicted 85th percentile operating speeds along the same high-speed highway determined with the Interactive Highway Safety Design Model design consistency module are also compared with observed 85th percentile speeds as a basis for evaluating the simultaneous equations approach. Finally, the paper proposes an alternative approach to evaluating design consistency that uses inferred design speed.

J	Brewer, MA; Venglar, SP; Ding, L				Brewer, Marcus A.; Venglar, Steven P.; Ding, Liang			Operational Characteristics of Super 2 Highways in Texas	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								As traffic volumes increase in many jurisdictions in both urban and rural areas, the demand on the highway network also increases. Specifically, as rural traffic volumes rise in Texas, the pressure on the state's network of two-lane highways rises accordingly. High proportions of heavy vehicles compound the problem and contribute to a decrease in safety as impatient drivers attempt to pass slower vehicles in no-passing zones or to pass trucks, despite diminished sight distance beyond such vehicles. Previous research in Texas demonstrated that periodic passing lanes can improve operations on two-lane highways with low to moderate volumes; these Super 2 highways can provide many benefits of a four-lane alignment at lower cost. The current Texas Roadway Design Manual contains these guidelines for highways with average daily traffic (ADT) lower than 5,000 vehicles per day. A current project expands on that research to develop design guidelines for passing lanes on two-lane highways with higher volumes. The project investigates the effects of volume, terrain, and heavy vehicles on traffic flow. This paper discusses findings from field observations of existing Super 2 highway corridors in Texas and computer modeling of traffic conditions on a simulated Super 2 corridor. Results indicate that passing lanes do provide added benefit at higher traffic volumes by reducing delay and percent time spent following. The incremental benefit of adding passing lanes or adding length to lanes diminished, and the effects of ADT on operations were more substantial than the effects of terrain or truck percentage for the study corridor.

New Model for Variable Speed Limits	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							FREEWAY TRAFFIC FLOW; OPTIMAL COORDINATION; WAVES	Traffic flow models play an irreplaceable role in the design and evaluation of variable speed limit (VSL) controllers. All existing models for incorporating VSL effects are based on modifications of the steady-state fundamental diagram. A new model is proposed: it is derived from driver behaviors with VSL control. The proposed model is validated with simulated data from VISSIM microscopic models and is compared with an existing macroscopic model modified to account for VSL. The proposed model is shown to have more accurate descriptions of the transient effects of VSL than the existing model, which takes into account only the steady-state effects of speed control inputs.

J	Cheewapattananuwong, W; Taneerananon, P; Nakatsuji, T				Cheewapattananuwong, Weeradej; Taneerananon, Pichai; Nakatsuji, Takashi			Mitigating Traffic Congestion and Accidents in Thailand with Intelligent Transportation System Technology	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Geometrical features of intersections, such as T-intersections and four-leg intersections, can give rise to several conflict points at those intersections. Without proper control at such conflict points, accidents can occur. In Thailand, the application of intelligent transportation system (ITS) technology for improvement of traffic flow and road safety is still in its infancy. This paper describes one of the pioneering uses of ITS technology to mitigate congestion and reduce accidents at intersections. The intersections under study are located in suburban Bangkok, Thailand, where major accidents have occurred as a result of red light running and speeding. Through the use of accident analysis modeling and ITS technology, it is possible to improve traffic flow and reduce the number of crashes. ITS technology, including an image-sensing concept for adaptive synchronization (green wave), was used to detect headway, spacing, number of speeding vehicles, angle of lane changing, and number of vehicles changing lanes. In particular, the image-sensing concept of traffic classified counting was used to calculate and evaluate signal phasing and cycle times for adaptive synchronization. In this operation, two closed-circuit television cameras and electronic equipment installed at each intersection were used to track vehicles passing through virtual loops, similar to the way in which induction loops in pavement detect vehicles. A variable message sign was used to flash a warning to errant drivers. After the implementation of this locally developed ITS technology, traffic flow improved significantly and the number of accidents caused by red light running and speeding decreased drastically.

J	Li, W; Tarko, AP				Li, Wei; Tarko, Andrew P.			Effect of Arterial Signal Coordination on Safety	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Traffic signals are coordinated to improve traffic mobility, but the impact of coordination, particularly specific coordination solutions, on safety is not well known. Engineers who set coordinated signals can use several tools to improve traffic mobility but have no tool with which to account for safety. A study was done on the impact of arterial signal coordination on the frequency and severity of rear-end and right-angle collisions the two types of crashes that are both prevalent at signalized intersections and likely affected by signal coordination. Multinomial logit models were developed to estimate crash likelihood in short time intervals on arterial intersection approaches, as well as the severity of crash outcome. The obtained models were used to investigate the safety impact of signal coordination and other road and traffic variables. The following results were determined: (a) signal coordination can significantly affect crash likelihood and severity; the concentration of vehicle arrivals in the second half of a green phase is associated with significantly lower crash likelihood and severity; (b) certain components of the traffic flow are most susceptible to crashes; (c) short distances between intersections and short cycle lengths are associated with a lower risk of crash; and (d) the presence of a right-turn bay is associated with a considerable improvement in safety manifested by a lower risk of rear-end and right-angle collisions. The developed models can be used as a tool for evaluating alternative signal coordination plans for safety.

Conflict Models for Single-Lane Roundabout Slip Lanes from Microsimulation Development and Validation	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Conflict patterns at single-lane roundabouts with and without slip lanes were evaluated and compared through VISSIM, the microscopic simulation program for multimodal traffic flow modeling, and surrogate safety assessment model (SSAM) analysis. From a sensitivity analysis of several volume distribution scenarios of the percentage of turning traffic, five zone-based conflict prediction models were developed through the use of Poisson regression. The models captured simulated conflict differences that resulted from the addition of a right-turn slip lane. The models were evaluated under three exit control scenarios (yield, stop, and free-flow merge). With SSAM analysis, the models predicted the occurrence of conflicts for roundabout zones with different R-squared values, which ranged from.69 to .97. The models were compared with national and international crash prediction models for single-lane roundabouts and were further validated by actual crash data from 10 single-lane roundabouts in the city of Carmel, Indiana. The number of conflicts for a single-lane roundabout was predicted as a function of approach entry, circulation, and slip lane traffic flows and was determined to be sensitive to the slip lane exit type. Results confirmed that conflicts in the merge area were more frequent than in the roundabout approach area and that the installation of a free-flow slip lane exit type reduced overall conflict occurrence. The results demonstrated the usefulness of SSA M analysis for evaluating roundabout safety and developing an empirical relationship between simulated conflicts and field-observed crashes.

J	Calvi, A; De Blasiis, MR				Calvi, Alessandro; De Blasiis, Maria Rosaria			Driver Behavior on Acceleration Lanes Driving Simulator Study	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							LENGTHS; DESIGN; SAFETY	Acceleration lanes provide access to freeways with the aim of improving traffic flow conditions and safety. Therefore, provision of an appropriate entrance ramp and acceleration lane geometry that allows the entering vehicle to accelerate to a speed closer to the main flow speed is crucial for comfortable and safe merging maneuvers. This paper presents an analysis of driver behavior on different acceleration lanes in various traffic conditions performed on an interactive driving simulator. Three different traffic volumes combined with two lengths of acceleration lane were simulated and their effects on driving performances have been studied. It has been observed that driver behavior during merging maneuvers is significantly influenced by traffic volume on the main lane and that the acceleration lane length does not show any significant effect on drivers' speed, trajectories, and accelerations. In particular, as the traffic volume increases, so does the merging length of the driver; the acceleration oscillations and the number of gaps rejected also increase. The general results show that the advanced techniques of driving simulation can disclose the relationships between road design parameters and behavioral aspects important to create safer road infrastructure. Further simulation studies are planned to confirm the findings and to strengthen and generalize the results.

J	Peng, YC; Lord, D				Peng, Yichuan; Lord, Dominique			Application of Latent Class Growth Model to Longitudinal Analysis of Traffic Crashes	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							TRAJECTORIES	One of the most important and meaningful tasks in traffic safety is to describe how traffic crash risk changes over time. Over the past 20 years, much work has been done about this task. The recent introduction of latent class models to analyze crash data has created a need to examine how these models could be used for longitudinal data analysis. Latent class models dictate that part of the heterogeneity be attributed by grouping distinct subpopulations into a common data set. Investigation of the commonalities of the subgroups can be useful for targeting specific safety interventions. This paper describes the application of the latent class growth model (LCGM), which is tailored to longitudinal data. Analysis was accomplished with the use of data collected between 1997 and 2007 on rural, two-lane highways in Texas. Trends for all crash severities and injury crashes were examined. It was determined that the crash data could be drawn from three population subgroups for which crash risks were low, medium, and high. The results of this study showed that average shoulder width and speed limit had stronger effects at sites classified as high crash risks, whereas traffic flow had a stronger influence at sites classified as low risks. As expected, higher speed limits increased crash risk, whereas a wider shoulder width reduced risk. In conclusion, the LCGM showed good potential for use in the analysis of longitudinal data, but further research is needed.

Survey of Models to Locate Sensors to Estimate Traffic Flows	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							TRIP MATRIX; IDENTIFICATION	With the advent of intelligent transportation systems, transportation networks have a considerable amount of traffic detectors, and large amounts of streaming data are available to manage and plan a multi-modal network and provide real-time traffic information to travelers. The related problem of optimally locating sensors on the network to estimate flows has been the object of growing interest in the past few years. Available sensors use various technologies and measure different aspects of traffic flows. This paper classifies sensor location problems in the literature in two categories: the sensor location flow-observability problem and the sensor location flow-estimation problem. This paper reviews the existing contributions for the latter of the two problem types and presents a unifying bilevel optimization framework in which the upper level addresses the location decisions and the lower level addresses the estimation variables. Several directions for future research are discussed.

On these highways, passing maneuvers that involve the use of the oncoming lane are frequently observed. Such passing is observed even when road surfaces are covered with compacted snow. To optimize speed and safety, simulated passing maneuvers have been conducted to make use of the oncoming lane of a two-way, two-lane highway. No such traffic simulations, however, have taken into consideration the surface conditions of roads in winter (e.g., snow-covered, icy, with poor visibility caused by snowfall and fog). In this study, a traffic flow simulation to model passing maneuvers that involved the oncoming lane was created through the use of values measured in a passing-maneuver field survey conducted on a two-lane road in summer and winter. The field values for the number of passing maneuvers, traffic volume, and speed distribution were compared with the simulation results. The outcomes confirmed that the difference between them was small. The sensitivity analysis results revealed that the number of passing maneuvers on surfaces covered with compacted snow under conditions of poor visibility did not increase as much as they did on dry surfaces, even when the traffic volume in the original lane was higher. The passing success rate tended to decrease with higher volumes of traffic in the oncoming lane, regardless of surface conditions.

Microscopic fuel consumption and emission models use vehicle speed and acceleration as inputs and are suitable for investigating the environmental effects of DTM measures at the link level. However, the lack of microscopic traffic data limits the application of these models. A method is provided for acquiring microscopic information from macroscopic traffic data. The main approach is to reconstruct the traffic state and vehicle group trajectories with an adaptive smoothing method, derive acceleration from the reconstructed vehicle trajectories, and calculate fuel consumption and emissions with filtered speed and estimated acceleration as inputs. The derived acceleration is compared with vehicle trajectories from simulation. Validation of the Method shows that the estimated acceleration reflects the congestion characteristics. A case study investigating the environmental benefits of a freeway control algorithm on a Dutch freeway was conducted to illustrate the application potential of the method.

J	Nair, H; Habib, A; Saha, B; Nelson, S				Nair, Harikrishnan; Habib, Affan; Saha, Bipad; Nelson, Sean			Ride Specifications Virginia's Experience, Accomplishments, and Challenges	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Road roughness is a major factor in pavement condition because of its effects on pavement resurfacing and vehicle operating costs. Rougher pavements require more frequent resurfacing, generate complaints from highway users, reduce optimum travel speeds, disrupt traffic flow, and create safety hazards. Ride specification is one of the tools practiced by almost all state agencies including the Virginia Department of Transportation (DOT) to achieve the desired smoothness on the road. A ride specification dictates the level of smoothness from paving projects and can adjust the contractor's payment, depending on the finished ride. Virginia DDT's experience, accomplishments, and challenges with ride specifications are presented. Through application of the ride specification during the past decade, the ride quality on Virginia's rideability project roads has continued to improve. The average roughness after paving has improved dramatically in the past few years compared with that of the early 2000s. Between 2005 and 2009, 3,068 lane miles were paved according to the ride specification and a net bonus of $4,928,422 was paid to contractors. The benefit of having smoother roads could result in direct savings to an agency from deferring resurfacing activities by about 2 years and substantial savings in terms of fuel efficiency (especially for the trucks), reduced congestion due to deferred resurfacing, reduced vehicle maintenance costs (from smoother roads), and other benefits. The estimated benefits from applying the	[Nair, Harikrishnan; Habib, Affan; Saha, Bipad; Nelson, Sean] Virginia Dept Transportat, Richmond, VA 23219 USA	Nair, H (corresponding author), Virginia Dept Transportat, 1401 E Broad St, Richmond, VA 23219 USA.

Both periodic and open boundary conditions are considered. Under periodic boundary condition, the fundamental diagram and the properties of synchronised flow are studied in detail. Under open boundary condition, different congested patterns induced by an on-ramp are analysed. The results are consistent with the well-known results of Kerner's three-phase traffic theory published before.

In this study, we extend the algorithm to an inhomogeneous highway in which two homogeneous sections with different fundamental diagrams are connected by a junction (interface). According to the entropy condition of the Riemann problem, the flow conditions at the interface can be categorized into four groups, and the density on both sides of the interface can be uniquely determined. Based on the physical conditions, we construct a fictitious element as an appropriate boundary condition for each homogeneous section. Consequently, the Riemann problem of an inhomogeneous highway can be transformed into a problem of equivalent homogeneous sections to which the shock-fitting algorithm can be applied. We apply this algorithm to some representative traffic flow cases and compare the results with numerical solutions obtained using the Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) scheme.

Ramachandra			Heterogeneous traffic flow modelling: a complete methodology	TRANSPORTMETRICA			English	Article						heterogeneous traffic; traffic flow modelling; cellular automata; video image processing; data collection		A comprehensive methodology for modelling the heterogeneous traffic is presented in this article. Considering the no-lane discipline and the presence of various sizes of vehicles, several microscopic and macroscopic traffic variables are analysed for their suitability in describing the heterogeneous traffic. Applicability in the modelling process and the feasibility in collecting field data are the important criteria used in deciding the suitable traffic variables. In place of occupancy, its variant termed as area occupancy was found to be suitable in describing the heterogeneous traffic. Vehicle size, mechanical characteristics, lateral distribution of vehicles and the lateral gaps maintained by them are found to be more suitable microscopic traffic variables. Data on these variables have been used in modifying the cell structure and the updating procedures of the cellular automata (CA)-based traffic flow model. A customised video image processing-based data collection technique has been used in collecting the field data on these variables. The modified CA model with the relevant parameter values has been used in simulating the flow.

The risk-disturbance hypothesis predicts that animals exhibit risk-avoidance behaviours when exposed to human disturbance because they perceive the disturbance as a predatory threat. Aims. This study aimed to examine whether Tibetan antelopes (Pantholops hodgsoni) exhibit risk-avoidance behaviour with proximity to a major highway and with increasing traffic flow consistent with the risk-disturbance hypothesis. Methods. Focal-animal sampling was used to observe the behaviour of Tibetan antelopes. The behaviours were categorised as foraging, vigilance, resting, moving, or other. The time, frequency, and duration of foraging and vigilance were calculated. Key results. As distance from the road increased, time spent foraging and foraging duration increased while foraging frequency, time spent being vigilant and vigilance frequency decreased, indicating that there is a risk perception associated with roads. Tibetan antelopes presented more risk-avoidance behaviours during high-traffic periods compared with low-traffic periods. Conclusions. Tibetan antelopes exhibited risk-avoidance behaviour towards roads that varied with proximity and traffic levels, which is consistent with the risk-disturbance hypothesis. Implications. The consequences of risk-avoidance behaviour should be reflected in wildlife management by considering human disturbance and road design.

In order to explore as timescales as possible, at a microscopic level we implement an event driven dynamics as the infinite time limit of a class of already existing model (Follow the Leader) on an Erdos-Renyi two-dimensional graph, the crossroads being accounted by standard Kirchoff density conservations. We define a dynamical order parameter as the ratio among the moving spheres versus the total number and by varying two control parameters (density of the spheres and coordination number of the network) we study the phase transition. At a mesoscopic level it respects an, again suitable, adapted version of the Lighthill-Whitham model, which belongs to the fluid-dynamical approach to the problem. At a macroscopic level, the model seems to display a continuous transition from a fluid phase to a jammed phase when varying the density of the spheres (the amount of cars in a city-like scenario) and a discontinuous jump when varying the connectivity of the underlying network.

In particular, we describe the effects of variation of permeability parameters, that indicate the amount of flow allowed to enter a junction from incoming roads. On each road, a model suggested by Helbing et al. (2007) [11] is considered: free and congested regimes are distinguished, characterized by an arrival flow and a departure flow, the latter depending on a permeability parameter. Moreover we provide a rigorous derivation of the model from fluid dynamic ones, using recent results of Bretti et al. (2006) [3]. For solving the dynamics at nodes of the network, a Riemann solver maximizing the through flux is used, see Coclite et al. (2005) [4] and Helbing et al. (2007) [11]. The network dynamics gives rise to complicate equations, where the evolution of fluxes at a single node may involve time-delayed terms from all other nodes. Thus we propose an alternative hybrid approach, introducing additional logic variables. Finally we compute the effects of variations on permeability parameters over the hybrid dynamics and test the obtained results via simulations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The misanthrope process is a stochastic process allowing for an exact steady-state solution; hence, we have an exact flow-density diagram for two-lane traffic. In addition, we introduce two parameters that indicate, respectively, driver's driving-lane preference and passing-lane priority. Due to the additional parameters, the model shows a deviation of the density ratio for driving-lane use and a biased lane efficiency in flow. Then, a mean-field approach explicitly describes the asymmetric flow by the hop rates, the driving-lane preference, and the passing-lane priority. Meanwhile, the simulation results are in good agreement with an observational data, and we thus estimate these parameters. We conclude that the proposed model successfully produces two-lane traffic flow particularly with the driving-lane preference and the passing-lane priority.

J	Moussa, N				Moussa, Najem			SIMULATION STUDY OF TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS IN BIDIRECTIONAL TRAFFIC MODELS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Cellular automata; bidirectional traffic; head-on collision; rear-end collision; lane-changing collision	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; CAR ACCIDENTS; DANGEROUS SITUATIONS; SYSTEMS; PHYSICS; RULES; FLOW	Conditions for the occurrence of bidirectional collisions are developed based on the Simon-Gutowitz bidirectional traffic model. Three types of dangerous situations can occur in this model. We analyze those corresponding to head-on collision; rear-end collision and lane-changing collision. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we compute the probability of the occurrence of these collisions for different values of the oncoming cars' density. It is found that the risk of collisions is important when the density of cars in one lane is small and that of the other lane is high enough. The influence of different proportions of heavy vehicles is also studied. We found that heavy vehicles cause an important reduction of traffic flow on the home lane and provoke an increase of the risk of car accidents.			najemmoussa@yahoo.fr					Boccara N, 1997, J PHYS A-MATH GEN, V30, P3329, DOI 10.1088/0305-4470/30/10/012; Chowdhury D, 2000, PHYS REP, V329, P199, DOI 10.1016/S0370-1573(99)00117-9; Helbing D, 2001, REV MOD PHYS, V73, P1067, DOI 10.1103/RevModPhys.73.1067; Huang DW, 2001, PHYS REV E, V63, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevE.63.022301; Huang DW, 2001, PHYS REV E, V64, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevE.64.057106; Huang DW, 1998, J PHYS A-MATH GEN, V31, P6167, DOI 10.1088/0305-4470/31/29/008; Jiang R, 2004, J PHYS A-MATH GEN, V37, P5777, DOI 10.1088/0305-4470/37/22/005; Jiang R, 2003, J PHYS A-MATH GEN, V36, P4763, DOI 10.1088/0305-4470/36/17/304; Maerivoet S, 2005, PHYS REP, V419, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.physrep.2005.08.005; Moussa N, 2005, INT J MOD PHYS C, V16, P1133, DOI 10.1142/S0129183105007790; Moussa N, 2003, PHYS REV E, V68, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevE.68.036127; Moussa N, 2003, EUR PHYS J B, V31, P413, DOI 10.1140/epjb/e2003-00049-y; Moussa N, 2008, PHYS LETT A, V372, P6701, DOI 10.1016/j.physleta.2008.08.081; Nagatani T, 2002, REP PROG PHYS, V65, P1331, DOI 10.1088/0034-4885/65/9/203; NAGEL K, 1992, J PHYS I, V2, P2221; Nagel K, 1998, PHYS REV E, V58, P1425, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevE.58.1425; RICKERT M, 1997, PHYSICA A, V235, P417; Simon PM, 1998, PHYS REV E, V57, P2441, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevE.57.2441; Wagner P, 1997, PHYSICA A, V234, P687, DOI 10.1016/S0378-4371(96)00308-1; Yang XQ, 2007, PHYSICA A, V384, P589, DOI 10.1016/j.physa.2007.05.058; Yang XQ, 2006, PHYS REV E, V73, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevE.73.016126; Yang XQ, 2004, J PHYS A-MATH GEN, V37, P4743, DOI 10.1088/0305-4470/37/17/006; Yang XQ, 2004, PHYS REV E, V70, DOI 10.1103/PhysRevE.70.046121; Yang XQ, 2002, MOD PHYS LETT B, V16, P333, DOI 10.1142/S0217984902003798; YANG XQ, 2002, J PHYS A, V35, P1; Zhang W, 2006, J PHYS A-MATH GEN, V39, P9127, DOI 10.1088/0305-4470/39/29/008	26	3	4	0	14	WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD	SINGAPORE	5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE	0129-1831			INT J MOD PHYS C	Int.

Yamauchi, J. Tanimoto, A. Hagishima, H. Sagara, Dilemma game structure observed in traffic flow at a 2-to-1 lane junction, Physical Review E 79 (2009)0361041, we find that several social dilemma structures are represented by n-person Prisoner's Dilemma (n-PD) games in certain traffic flow phases at a bottleneck caused by a lane-closing section. In this study, the stochastic Nishinari-Fukui-Schadschneider (S-NFS) model was adopted as a cellular automaton traffic model. In the system, two classes of driver-agents coexist: C-Agents (cooperative strategy) always driving in the first lane, and D-Agents (defective strategy) trying to drive in a lower-density lane, whether the first or the second lane. In relatively high-density flow phases, such as the metastable phase and the high-density phase, we found n-PD games, where D-Agents' interruption into the first lane from the second just before the lane-closing section creates a heavier traffic jam, which reduces social efficiency. This could be solved by decreasing the interruption probability, which can be realized by a provision where drivers in the first lane firmly refuse interruptions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Cellular automaton model for traffic flow based on safe driving policies and human reactions	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow models; Cellular automaton; Synchronized traffic flow	METASTABLE STATES	This paper proposes a new single-lane cellular automaton model for traffic flow. The model takes into account normal drivers' spacing policies and transportation engineering practices to guarantee that microscopic vehicle behavior is more in line with vehicular movement in the real world. As a result, drivers' reactions are based on a safety analysis that determines the most appropriate action for a vehicle to take. Hence, the model introduces a new set of simple rules to change the speed of vehicles that incorporates three important thresholds required by the follower vehicle to accelerate, slow down or maintain its speed. Thus, the space gap, relative speed and limited acceleration/deceleration capabilities are introduced into simulations. Simulation results obtained from a system with periodic conditions show that the model can smooth the speed drop when vehicles approach the upstream front of the traffic jam. Therefore, the model avoids unrealistic deceleration behavior found in most previous cellular automata models. Besides, the model is also capable of reproducing most empirical findings including the three states of traffic flow, the backward speed of the downstream front of the traffic jam, and different congested traffic patterns induced by a system with open boundary conditions with an on-ramp. Moreover, the new model preserves the computational simplicity of the cellular automata models. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Larraga, M.

Based on this microscopic model, a new macroscopic model was deduced by the relevance relation of microscopic and macroscopic scale parameters for the two-lane traffic flow. Terms related to lane change are added into the continuity equations and velocity dynamic equations to investigate the lane change rate. Numerical results verify that the proposed model can be efficiently used to reflect the effect of the probability of traffic interruption on the shock, rarefaction wave and lane change behaviour on two-lane freeways.

J	McCrea, J; Moutari, S				McCrea, Jennifer; Moutari, Salissou			A hybrid macroscopic-based model for traffic flow in road networks	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Vehicular traffic flow; Hybrid model; Continuum model; Knowledge-based model	WAVES	Recently, the unquestionable growth of interest to increase the operational efficiency and capability of transportation systems led to the development of a large number of traffic modeling theories. One of the major operational issues when developing a transportation system management model lies in the selection of the appropriate methodological approach with respect to several decisions, such as the selection of the type of input and output data as well as the qualitative representation and the computational power of the model. Despite the considerable effort in the area, there is still not an approach which per se models effectively the various dynamically evolving features of traffic in road networks. The present paper addresses this issue by introducing a new hybrid approach which combines the complementary features and capabilities of both continuum mathematical models e.g. [1,6,23,26] and knowledge-based models e.g. [7,22,28] in order to describe effectively traffic flow in road networks.

J	Chen, XQ; Li, L; Zhang, Y				Chen, Xiqun; Li, Li; Zhang, Yi			A Markov Model for Headway/Spacing Distribution of Road Traffic	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Car following; headway distribution; Markov model; psychological action point model; traffic flow	GAP-SIZE DISTRIBUTION; SEQUENTIAL ADSORPTION; HEADWAY; DYNAMICS; POPULATION; CARS	In this paper, we link two research directions of road traffic-the mesoscopic headway distribution model and the microscopic vehicle interactionmodel-together to account for the empirical headway/spacing distributions. A unified car-following model is proposed to simulate different driving scenarios, including traffic on highways and at intersections. Unlike our previous approaches, the parameters of this model are directly estimated from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) Trajectory Data. In this model, empirical headway/spacing distributions are viewed as the outcomes of stochastic car-following behaviors and the reflections of the unconscious and inaccurate perceptions of space and/or time intervals that people may have. This explanation can be viewed as a natural extension of the well-known psychological car-following model (the action point model). Furthermore, the fast simulation speed of this model will benefit transportation planning and surrogate testing of traffic signals.

J	Lin, WH; Liu, HC				Lin, Wei-Hua; Liu, Hongchao			Enhancing Realism in Modeling Merge Junctions in Analytical Models for System-Optimal Dynamic Traffic Assignment	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Dynamic traffic assignment (DTA); intelligent transportation systems; mathematical programming; system optimum; traffic control; traffic-management system	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; HIGHWAY; WAVES	The existing analytical system-optimal dynamic traffic assignment (SO-DTA) model formulated with the linear programming (LP) approach usually assumes system control over vehicles in the entire network. This property would give rise to unreasonable priorities at merge junctions that are sometimes physically impossible to realize for the given roadway configuration. In this paper, we demonstrate that models with and without considering the merge-priority ratio would exhibit very different traffic patterns and route-choice behavior. To realistically model traffic flow on a transportation network, one should properly distinguish the level of control by drivers, roadway geometry, and system providers. This paper also attempts to develop an LP module that explicitly considers the merge-priority ratio of a merge junction and can potentially be incorporated into the existing LP formulation of the SO-DTA problem based on the cell-transmission model. By more realistically modelling the behavior of vehicles at merge junctions, the obtained solution can be used as a benchmark to compare control strategies developed without explicitly considering the merge-priority ratio at merge junctions or strategies developed with heuristic approaches.

J	Ghods, AH; Fu, LP; Rahimi-Kian, A				Ghods, Amir Hosein; Fu, Liping; Rahimi-Kian, Ashkan			An Efficient Optimization Approach to Real-Time Coordinated and Integrated Freeway Traffic Control	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Distributed controllers; game theory; model predictive control (MPC); parallel optimization; ramp metering; speed limit control	MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; FICTITIOUS PLAY	This paper tackles the problem of real-time optimal control of traffic flow in a freeway network deployed with coordinated and integrated traffic controllers. One promising approach to this problem is casting the underlying dynamic control problem in a model predictive framework. The challenge is that the resulting optimization problem is computationally intractable for online applications in a network with a large number of controllers. In this paper, a game-theoretic approach with distributed controllers is proposed to address the foregoing issue. The efficiency of the proposed method is tested for a coordinated ramp metering and variable-speed limit control applied to a stretch of freeway network. The parallel nature of the optimization algorithm makes it suitable for solving large-scale problems with high accuracy. The speed and accuracy of the proposed solution approach are examined and compared with that of the conventional optimization method in a case study to demonstrate its superior performance.

Ecological driver assistance system using model-based anticipation of vehicle-road-traffic information	IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th ITS World Congress and Exhibition on Intelligent Transportation Systems and Services	SEP 21-25, 2009	Stockholm, SWEDEN					This study presents a novel concept of an ecological driver assistance system (EDAS) that may play an important role in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) in the near future. The proposed EDAS is designed to measure relevant information of instant vehicle-road-traffic utilising advanced sensing and communication technologies. Using models of vehicle dynamics and traffic flow, it anticipates future situations of the vehicle-road-traffic network, estimates fuel consumption and generates the optimal control input necessary for ecological driving. Once the optimal control input becomes available, it could be used to assist the driver through a suitable human interface. The vehicle control method is developed using model predictive control algorithm with a suitable performance index to ensure safe and fuel-efficient driving. The performance of the EDAS, in terms of speed behaviour and fuel consumption, is evaluated on the microscopic transport simulator AIMSUN NG. Comparative results are graphically illustrated and analysed to signify the prospect of the proposed EDAS in building environmentally friendly ITS.	[Kamal, M. A.

Thamizh			Effect of Gradient and Its Length on Performance of Vehicles under Heterogeneous Traffic Conditions	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article						Traffic volume; Traffic speed; Capacity of roads; Heterogeneous traffic; Simulation model; PCU	PASSENGER CAR EQUIVALENTS	Study of the basic traffic-flow characteristics and clear understanding of vehicular interaction are the prerequisites for highway capacity and level of service analyses and to formulate effective traffic regulation and control measures. Computer simulation has emerged as an effective technique for modeling traffic flow and to study the flow characteristics over a wide range of roadway and traffic conditions due to its capability to account for the randomness related to traffic. This paper is concerned with application of a simulation model of heterogeneous traffic flow, named HETEROSIM, to quantify the vehicular interaction, in terms of passenger car unit (PCU), for the different categories of vehicles, by considering the traffic flow of representative composition, on up-grades of different magnitudes for intercity roads in India. The PCU estimates, determined through microscopic simulation, for the different types of vehicles in heterogeneous traffic, for a wide range of grades and traffic volumes, indicate that the PCU value of a vehicle significantly changes with change in traffic volume and magnitude of grade and its length.

J	El-Basyouny, K; Sayed, T				El-Basyouny, Karim; Sayed, Tarek			Safety performance functions with measurement errors in traffic volume	SAFETY SCIENCE			English	Article						Measurement error; Full Bayes estimation; Generalized link; Markov Chain Monte Carlo; Poisson-gamma hierarchy	REGRESSION-MODELS; POISSON-GAMMA; DISPERSION; PREDICTION	One of the most common and important predictors in safety performance functions (SPFs) is traffic volume which is known to be measured with uncertainty. Such measurement errors (ME) can attenuate the respective predictors' effect and also increase dispersion. This paper proposes an approach which involves the use of a ME model based on traffic flow time series data. The model is used in conjunction with the negative binomial SPF to circumvent the bias in predicting the aggregate number of accidents during the time period under study. The proposed approach (denoted by MENB), was compared with the traditional negative binomial (NB) technique by way of Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, both approaches were applied to two datasets corresponding to 131 and 130 road segments in British Columbia. The full Bayes method was utilized for parameter estimation, performance evaluation and inference through the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. The simulation results showed that MENB has outperformed NB when large measurement errors are present. The goodness-of-fit statistics showed that MENB has provided a slightly better fit to the data. However, in the presence of measurement errors, the NB has underestimated the predicted number of accidents for heavy traffic on long road segments and vice versa.

Using graph concepts to assess the feasibility of a sequenced air traffic flow with low conflict rate	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Transportation; Graph theory; Air traffic management	INTERSECTION GRAPHS	In this paper, we propose to study feasibility issues of a new air traffic paradigm. In this paradigm, aircraft are following immaterial moving points in such a way that no conflict (or at most few) occurs between aircraft. We provide lower and upper bounds on the maximum density of a solution. In particular, we characterize the density of the solution according to the colorability of an auxiliary graph, modelling the potential conflicts between moving points. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Although much research has been done to explore the factors influencing crash-injury severity, few studies have investigated the association between severity and traffic characteristics collected real-time during the time the accident occurred. We apply a random parameters ordered probit model to explore the influence of speed and traffic volume on the injury level sustained by vehicle occupants involved in accidents on the A4-A86 junction in the Paris region. Results indicate that increased traffic volume has a consistently positive effect on severity, while speed has a differential effect on severity depending on flow conditions.

J	Oh, C; Kim, T				Oh, Cheol; Kim, Taejin			Estimation of rear-end crash potential using vehicle trajectory data	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Rear-end crash; Vehicle trajectory; Lane-changing model; Time-to-collision; Binary logistic regression model; Exponential decay function		Recent advancement in traffic surveillance systems has allowed for obtaining more detailed vehicular movement such as individual vehicle trajectory data. Understanding the characteristics of interactions between leading vehicle and following in the traffic flow stream is a backbone for designing and evaluating more sophisticated traffic and vehicle control strategies. This study proposes a methodology for estimating rear-end crash potential, as a probabilistic measure, in real time based on the analysis of vehicular movements. The methodology presented in this study consists of two components. The first estimates the probability that a vehicle's trajectory belonging to either 'changing lane' or 'going straight'. A binary logistic regression (BLR) is used to model the lane-changing decision of the subject vehicle. The other component derives crash probability by an exponential decay function using time-to-collision (TTC) between the subject vehicle and the front vehicle. Also, an aggregated measure, crash risk index (CRI) is used in the analysis to accumulate rear-end crash potential for each subject vehicle. The result of this study can be used in developing traffic control and information systems, in particular, for crash prevention. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, HZ; Rudy, K; Li, J; Ni, DH				Wang, Haizhong; Rudy, Kimberly; Li, Jia; Ni, Daiheng			Calculation of traffic flow breakdown probability to optimize link throughput	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Breakdown probability; Throughput optimization; Discrete time Markov chain	NUCLEATION	Traffic breakdown phenomenon is prevalent in empirical traffic system observations. Traffic flow breakdown is usually defined as an amount of sudden drop in traffic flow speed when traffic demand exceeds capacity. Modeling and calculating traffic flow breakdown probability remains an important issue when analyzing the stability and reliability of transportation system. The breakdown mechanism is still mysterious to practitioners and researchers in varying manner. Treating breakdown as a random event, this paper use discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) to model traffic state transition path, as a result, a transition probability matrix can be generated from empirical observations. From empirical analysis of breakdown, we found this formulation of breakdown probability follows the Zipf distribution. Therefore, a connection from traffic flow breakdown probability to how many vehicles are occupying a certain freeway segment (e.g. a link) will be established.

J	Oh, J; Min, J; Choi, E				Oh, Jutaek; Min, Joonyoung; Choi, Eunsoo			Development of a vehicle image-tracking system based on a long-distance detection algorithm	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								If image-processing systems are developed to track individual vehicles, and thus, trace vehicle trajectories, many existing transportation models will benefit from more detailed information on individual vehicles. Furthermore, the additional information that can be obtained from the vehicle trajectories will improve incident detection by identifying lane change maneuvers and acceleration / deceleration patterns. Unlike human vision, however, image-processing cameras have difficulty in recognizing vehicle movements within a long detection zone because the camera operators need to zoom in to recognize objects. As a result, vehicle tracking with a single camera relies on short-distance detection. This paper describes the methodology developed for monitoring individual vehicle trajectories based on image processing. To improve traffic flow surveillance, a long-distance tracking algorithm was developed with multiple closed-circuit television cameras. The algorithm can recognize individual vehicle maneuvers, and thereby increases the effectiveness of the incident detection process.

J	Sun, D; Kondyli, A				Sun, Daniel (Jian); Kondyli, Alexandra			Modeling Vehicle Interactions during Lane-Changing Behavior on Arterial Streets	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK MODEL; WORK ZONE CAPACITY; INCIDENT-DETECTION; TRAFFIC FLOW; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; ALGORITHM; URBAN; DELAY; SYSTEM	Lane-changing algorithms have attracted increased attention during recent years in traffic modeling. However, little has been done to address the competition and cooperation of vehicles when changing lanes on urban streets. The main goal of this study is to quantify the vehicle interactions during a lane-changing maneuver. Video data collected at a busy arterial street in Gainesville, Florida, were used to distinguish between free, forced, and competitive/cooperative lane changes. Models particularly for competitive/cooperative lane changes were developed, depending on whether the following vehicle cooperates with the subject vehicle or not. By referring to the "TCP/IP" protocol in computer network communications, a sequence of "hand-shaking" negotiations were designed to handle the competition and cooperation among vehicles. The developed model was implemented and validated in the CORSIM microsimulator package, with the simulation capabilities compared against the original lane-changing model in CORSIM. The results indicate that the new model better replicates the observed traffic under different levels of congestion.

J	van Lint, JWC; Hoogendoorn, SP				van Lint, J. W. C.; Hoogendoorn, Serge P.			A Robust and Efficient Method for Fusing Heterogeneous Data from Traffic Sensors on Freeways	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							KINEMATIC WAVES; TIME; MODEL; FLOW	Fusing freeway traffic data such as spot speeds and travel times from a variety of traffic sensors (loops, cameras, automated vehicle identification systems) into a coherent, consistent, and reliable picture of the prevailing traffic conditions (e.g., speeds, flows) is a critical task in any off- or online traffic management or data archival system. This task is challenging as such data differ in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, accuracy, reliability, and most importantly in terms of spatiotemporal semantics. In this article, we propose a data fusion algorithm (the extended generalized Treiber-Helbing filter [the EGTF]) which, although heuristic in nature, uses basic notions from traffic flow theory and is generic in the sense that it does not impose any restrictions on the way the data are structured in a temporal or spatial way. This implies that the data can stem from any data source, given they provide a means to distinguish between free flowing and congested traffic. On the basis of (ground truth and sensor) data from a micro-simulation tool, we demonstrate that the EGTF method results in accurate reconstructed traffic conditions and is robust to increasing degrees of data corruption. Further research should focus on validating the approach on real data. The method can be straightforwardly implemented in any traffic data archiving system or application which requires consistent and coherent traffic data from traffic sensors as inputs.	[van Lint, J.

Optimizing the use of public transit system during no-notice evacuation of urban areas	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						No-notice disasters; Emergency evacuation; Public transit system; Mixed-integer linear programming	TABU SEARCH; TRANSPORTATION; RISK	This paper proposes a methodology that can be used to design plans for evacuating transit-dependent citizens during no-notice disasters. A mixed-integer linear program is proposed to model the problem of finding optimal evacuation routes. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total evacuation time and the number of casualties, simultaneously. A traffic simulation package is used to explicitly incorporate the traffic flow dynamics into our model in order to generate solutions which are consistent with the dynamics of traffic network. Due to the long running time of CPLEX, a Tabu search algorithm is designed that finds evacuation routes for transit vehicles. Computational experiments demonstrate that the solutions found are of high-quality. Numerical experiments are conducted using the transportation network of the city of Forth Worth, TX to illustrate the modeling procedure and solution approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Moridpour, S; Rose, G; Sarvi, M				Moridpour, Sara; Rose, Geoff; Sarvi, Majid			Effect of Surrounding Traffic Characteristics on Lane Changing Behavior	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Trucks; Automobiles; Traffic analysis; Traffic congestion	MICROSCOPIC SIMULATION; HEAVY VEHICLES	Lane changing maneuvers could have a substantial influence on traffic flow characteristics as a result of their interfering effect on surrounding vehicles. The interference effect of lane changing is more pronounced when heavy vehicles change lanes compared to when passenger cars undertake the same maneuver. This is due to the physical effects that the heavy vehicles impose on surrounding traffic. This paper investigates and compares the traffic flow characteristics which influence the lane changing behavior of heavy vehicle and passenger car drivers on freeways under heavy traffic conditions. A trajectory data set comprising 28 heavy vehicle and 28 passenger car lane changing maneuvers is analyzed in this study. The results suggest a substantial difference exists between the traffic characteristics influencing the lane changing behavior of heavy vehicle and passenger car drivers. Heavy vehicles' speed changes little during a lane changing maneuver. Heavy vehicle drivers mainly move into the slower lanes to prevent obstructing the fast moving vehicles which approach from the rear. However, passenger car drivers increase their speed according to the speeds of the lead and lag vehicles in the target lane. They more commonly move into the faster lanes to gain speed advantages.

J	Zhang, HB; Khattak, A				Zhang, Hongbing; Khattak, Asad			What Is the Role of Multiple Secondary Incidents in Traffic Operations?	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Incident; Secondary incident; Queue; Ordinal logit model; Hampton Roads	SAFETY	Traffic incidents are a major source of travel uncertainty, imposing substantial costs on the transportation system. Sometimes, an incident can result in one or more secondary incidents, which can be particularly problematic. To identify roadways where multiple secondary incidents are more likely to occur and analyze primary and secondary incidents, an innovative analysis method based on a detailed incident data set from Hampton Roads, Virginia was developed. Incidents occurring on major freeways are categorized on a three-point ordinal scale as (1) an independent incident, i.e., an incident not associated with any secondary incidents; (2) one primary-secondary pair; and (3) one primary with two or more secondary incidents in the same or opposite directions. This scale captures event adversity from a traffic management perspective, with the last category capturing multiple secondary events. To quantify associations with key factors that include incident characteristics, roadway geometry and traffic flow, ordinal regression models are estimated. The results indicate that longer duration crashes, shorter segments, and heavy traffic are associated with higher propensity for secondary incidents. Furthermore, multiple-vehicle involvement and lane blockage are associated with multiple secondary incidents. The findings provide engineers and planners with valuable information on targeting service patrols in areas that are more prone to multiple secondary incidents. Overall, this research contributes by characterizing and analyzing complex events involving secondary incidents using rigorous statistical methods.

The stability condition of the model is obtained by using the linear stability theory. And numerical simulation is carried out to validate the analytic results. The property of the model is investigated, and it is found that the proposed model can describe the phase transition of traffic flow and estimate the evolution of traffic congestion. The results implied that incorporating the lane width effects in car following model not only stabilize traffic flow and suppress the traffic jam, but also lower critical headway and increase capacity. Thus, the lateral separation effects greatly enhance the realism of car following models. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Li, QL; Wang, BH; Liu, MR				Li, Qi-Lang; Wang, Bing-Hong; Liu, Mu-Ren			Phase diagrams properties of the mixed traffic flow on a crossroad	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Phase diagram; Mixed traffic flow; Crossroad; Cellular automata	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; ASYMMETRIC EXCLUSION MODEL; SELF-ORGANIZATION; DYNAMICS; STATES; TRANSITIONS; BOUNDARIES; SIMULATION; DISORDER	Based on the Ishibashi and Fukui crossroad traffic flow model [Y. Ishibashi and M. Fukui. J. Phys. Soc. Japan. 70 (2001) 2793] mixed traffic flow (i.e., the fast and slow vehicles with different maximum velocities are mixed) is investigated in this work. According to the numerical simulation results and the principle for constructing the phase diagram, phase diagrams for mixed traffic flow are constructed. It is noted that the topology of these phase diagrams is similar to that of phase diagrams for homogeneous vehicles (which refers to slow vehicles only). From the phase diagrams, it is evident that mixed traffic flow is influenced by the mixing rate f (fraction of slow and fast vehicles) in regions II and V. but not in other regions. Although a mixture of fast and slow vehicles is introduced in the crossroad traffic flow model, the separation between phases in the phase diagrams remains linear. For a given q (the vehicle density on the northbound road), one flow plateau appears in regions IIx or IVy, while two maximum flow plateaus appear in region V in each of the phase diagrams. The maximum flow values in region V reflect the maximum traffic capacity for the traffic system as defined in this work. Since mixed traffic flow is a common phenomenon in real traffic, this work may offer help in real traffic simulations and traffic management. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We discuss reasons for the existence of spatial effects in vehicle ownership, and note potential implications for policymakers. Our results point to the importance of spatial relationships in transportation research and highlight the hazards of ignoring their role in affecting transportation outcomes. For example, if vehicle type choice is affected by neighborhood spillovers, agencies that regulate traffic flow and road safety could tailor their choice projections and policy tools to account for such interdependence.

Travis			Reliable evacuation planning via demand inflation and supply deflation	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW			English	Article						Evacuation; Uncertainty; Dynamic traffic assignment; Reliability; Demand inflation; Supply deflation	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; NETWORK DESIGN PROBLEM; KINEMATIC WAVES; TRAFFIC FLOW; SYSTEM; FORMULATION	This paper presents an evacuation route planning model that both accounts for demand uncertainty (i.e. the number of evacuees) as well as capacity uncertainty (i.e. the road capacities). To ensure reliability, the model plans for more evacuees (i.e. demand inflation) and less road capacity (i.e. supply deflation). A major contribution is that we provide a framework to determine the amount of demand inflation/supply deflation necessary to ensure a user-specified reliability level. The model is shown to be a natural generalization of previously proposed evacuation models. A small numerical case study reveals the key characteristics of the model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Kerner, BS; Klenov, SL				Kerner, Boris S.; Klenov, Sergey L.			A theory of traffic congestion at moving bottlenecks	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL			English	Article							SYNCHRONIZED FLOW; ON-RAMP; PHASE; TRANSITION; PATTERNS; PHYSICS; MODEL; TIME	The physics of traffic congestion occurring at a moving bottleneck on a multi-lane road is revealed based on the numerical analyses of vehicular traffic with a discrete stochastic traffic flow model in the framework of three-phase traffic theory. We find that there is a critical speed of a moving bottleneck at which traffic breakdown, i.e. a first-order phase transition from free flow to synchronized flow, occurs spontaneously at the moving bottleneck, if the flow rate upstream of the bottleneck is great enough. The greater the flow rate, the higher the critical speed of the moving bottleneck. A diagram of congested traffic patterns at the moving bottleneck is found, which shows regions in the flow-rate-moving-bottleneck-speed plane in which congested patterns emerge spontaneously or can be induced through large enough disturbances in an initial free flow. A comparison of features of traffic breakdown and resulting congested patterns at the moving bottleneck with known ones at an on-ramp (and other motionless) bottleneck is made. Nonlinear features of complex interactions and transformations of congested traffic patterns occurring at on- and off-ramp bottlenecks due to the existence of the moving bottleneck are found. The physics of the phenomenon of traffic congestion due to 'elephant racing' on a multi-lane road is revealed.

J	Hoogendoorn, S; Hoogendoorn, R				Hoogendoorn, Serge; Hoogendoorn, Raymond			Calibration of microscopic traffic-flow models using multiple data sources	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						car-following models; calibration; traffic data		Parameter identification of microscopic driving models is a difficult task. This is caused by the fact that parameters-such as reaction time, sensitivity to stimuli, etc.-are generally not directly observable from common traffic data, but also due to the lack of reliable statistical estimation techniques. This contribution puts forward a new approach to identifying parameters of car-following models. One of the main contributions of this article is that the proposed approach allows for joint estimation of parameters using different data sources, including prior information on parameter values (or the valid range of values). This is achieved by generalizing the maximum-likelihood estimation approach proposed by the authors in previous work. The approach allows for statistical analysis of the parameter estimates, including the standard error of the parameter estimates and the correlation of the estimates. Using the likelihood-ratio test, models of different complexity (defined by the number of model parameters) can be cross-compared. A nice property of this test is that it takes into account the number of parameters of a model as well as the performance. To illustrate the workings, the approach is applied to two car-following models using vehicle trajectories of a Dutch freeway collected from a helicopter, in combination with data collected with a driving simulator.

Based upon the analysis of detailed vehicle-trajectory data, we conclude that timid and aggressive driver behaviours are the cause for this transformation. We find that stop-and-go waves arise independently of the details of these behaviours. Analytical and simulation results are presented.

J	Kesting, A; Treiber, M; Helbing, D				Kesting, Arne; Treiber, Martin; Helbing, Dirk			Enhanced intelligent driver model to access the impact of driving strategies on traffic capacity	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						adaptive cruise control; human driving behaviour; car-following model; microscopic traffic simulation; free-flow capacity; dynamic capacity	ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; STABILITY; FEATURES; FLOW	With an increasing number of vehicles equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC), the impact of such vehicles on the collective dynamics of traffic flow becomes relevant. By means of simulation, we investigate the influence of variable percentages of ACC vehicles on traffic flow characteristics. For simulating the ACC vehicles, we propose a new car-following model that also serves as the basis of an ACC implementation in real cars. The model is based on the intelligent driver model (IDM) and inherits its intuitive behavioural parameters: desired velocity, acceleration, comfortable deceleration and desired minimum time headway. It eliminates, however, the sometimes unrealistic behaviour of the IDM in cut-in situations with ensuing small gaps that regularly are caused by lane changes of other vehicles in dense or congested traffic. We simulate the influence of different ACC strategies on the maximum capacity before breakdown and the (dynamic) bottleneck capacity after breakdown. With a suitable strategy, we find sensitivities of the order of 0.3, i. e. 1 per cent more ACC vehicles will lead to an increase in the capacities by about 0.3 per cent. This sensitivity multiplies when considering travel times at actual breakdowns.

This contribution pursues a macroscopic (fluid-dynamic) simulation approach, which facilitates a simple simulation of congestion spreading in cities. First, we show that a quantization of the macroscopic turning flows into units of single vehicles is necessary to obtain realistic fluctuations in the traffic variables, and how this can be implemented in a fluid-dynamic model. Then, we propose a new method to simulate destination flows without the requirement of individual route assignments. Combining both methods allows us to study a variety of different simulation scenarios. These reveal fundamental relationships between the average flow, the average density and the variability of the vehicle densities. Considering the inhomogeneity of traffic as an independent variable can eliminate the scattering of congested flow measurements. The variability also turns out to be a key variable of urban traffic performance. Our results can be explained through the number of full links of the road network, and approximated by a simple analytical formula.

This is because these signals exhibit interesting dynamical properties such as scale invariance, volatility correlation, heavy tails and fractality. The focus of the present paper is on the intriguing power-law autocorrelations and cross-correlations in traffic series. Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis (DCCA) is used to study the traffic flow fluctuations. It is demonstrated that the time series, observed on the Anhua-Bridge highway in the Beijing Third Ring Road (BTRR), may exhibit power-law cross-correlations when they come from two adjacent sections or lanes. This indicates that a large increment in one traffic variable is more likely to be followed by large increment in the other traffic variable. However, for traffic time series derived from nonadjacent sections or lanes, we find that even though they are power-law autocorrelated, there is no cross-correlation between them with a unique exponent. Our results show that DCCA techniques based on Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) can be used to analyze and interpret the traffic flow.

The average personal exposure to PM10 was higher in autumn and winter than in spring and summer. Exposures to PM10 during heavy traffic flow in the afternoon time, were considerably higher than those in morning and evening. The numbers of passengers in the taxi, taxi model and indoor taxi temperature had a significant correlation with the exposure to PM10. Penetration of particulate matter from ambient sources and/or re-suspended particles from the surfaces because of poor maintenance, were shown to be the most probable factors for taxi drivers' personal exposure to PM10.

A risk-averse user equilibrium model for route choice problem in signal-controlled networks	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Transport and Logistics Systems	AUG 21-22, 2006	Colombo, SRI LANKA			risk-averse user equilibrium (RAUE); accident risk; signal control	LANE-BASED OPTIMIZATION; TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT	This paper proposes a new risk-averse user equilibrium (RAUE) model to estimate the distribution of traffic flows over road networks with taking account the effects of accident risks due to the conflicting traffic flows (left- and right-turning and through traffic flows) at signalized intersections. It is assumed in the proposed model that drivers consider simultaneously both the travel time and accident risk in their route choices. The accident risk of a route is measured by the potential accident rate on that route. The RAUE conditions are formulated as an equivalent path-based variational inequality problem which can be solved by a path-based solution algorithm. It is shown that the traditional user equilibrium (UE) model is in fact a special case of the proposed model. A numerical example on a grid network is used to illustrate the application of the proposed model and to compare the results with the conventional UE traffic assignment. Numerical results show that the traditional UE model may underestimate the total system travel time and overestimate the system accident rate. Sensitivity tests are also carried out to assess the effects of drivers' preferences, signal control parameters (i.e., green time proportions), and various network demand levels on the route choice problem.

Speed Prediction Models for Multilane Highways: Simultaneous Equations Approach	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article						Simultaneous equations; Regression models; Operating speed; Multilane highways	OPERATING SPEED	Past speed-related research has focused on the operational effects of roadway geometries along rural two-lane highways using ordinary least-squares regression models. More recent research has focused on the association of traffic flow characteristics on vehicle operating speeds along multilane, limited access highways using a simultaneous equations approach. Few research studies, however, have been conducted to determine the combined association between various geometric design features and traffic flow on operating speeds along multilane highways. This research considers both geometric design and traffic flow parameters, in a simultaneous equations framework, to model the mean operating speed and speed deviation on four-lane highways (two lanes in each direction). Models for both left- and right-lane mean speeds and speed deviations were estimated. The three-stage least-squares estimator was used to investigate the possible endogeneity of mean speed and speed deviation in the system of equations and to account for the contemporaneous correlation between the disturbances across the equations. The results indicate that different geometric design features are associated with mean speed and speed deviation in the left- and right-lane models. As such, it is recommended that future multilane highway speed models consider using a simultaneous equations framework.

J	Mhirech, A				Mhirech, Abdelaziz			Effect of damaged car evacuation on traffic flow behavior after perpendicular collisions in a bidirectional-lane highway with open boundaries	PHYSICA SCRIPTA			English	Article							STATISTICAL PHYSICS; OFF-RAMP; MODELS; ROAD	A new model of the perpendicular accident probability of cars in a bidirectional-lane highway with open boundaries is proposed. The numerical study is done using the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NS) model in parallel dynamics. Indeed, in addition to parallel collisions that occur in the same lane, we also take into account perpendicular accidents between cars moving in opposite directions. To be consistent with reality, we assume that those cars involved in perpendicular collision with a sufficient impact speed, V-12, get damaged and must then be removed from the road. It is found that the final density of cars in lane 1 depends strongly on the threshold value V-12. Besides, both the perpendicular, P-acper, and parallel, P-acpar, accident probabilities per car and per time step depend largely on the injecting rate alpha(1), the extracting rate beta(1) in lane 1 and the fractions r(1) and r(2) in lane 2 of the injecting and extracting rates, respectively. In fact, P-acpar and P-acper show abrupt jumps that increase with increasing alpha(1) and beta(1). Furthermore, P-acper increases with increasing fractions r(1) and/or r(2). Taking into account the braking probability P-1 of the NS model, both P-acpar and Pacper decrease.

A rolling-horizon quadratic-programming approach to the signal control problem in large-scale congested urban road networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th AATT Conference	MAY, 2008	Athens, GREECE			Traffic signal control; Traffic congestion; Store-and-forward modeling; Rolling-horizon (model-predictive) control; Fundamental diagram of networks	CONTROL STRATEGY; TRAFFIC FLOW	The paper investigates the efficiency of a recently developed signal control methodology, which offers a computationally feasible technique for real-time network-wide signal control in large-scale urban traffic networks and is applicable also under congested traffic conditions. In this methodology, the traffic flow process is modeled by use of the store-and-forward modeling paradigm, and the problem of network-wide signal control (including all constraints) is formulated as a quadratic-programming problem that aims at minimizing and balancing the link queues so as to minimize the risk of queue spillback. For the application of the proposed methodology in real time, the corresponding optimization algorithm is embedded in a rolling-horizon (model-predictive) control scheme. The control strategy's efficiency and real-time feasibility is demonstrated and compared with the Linear-Quadratic approach taken by the signal control strategy TUC (Traffic-responsive Urban Control) as well as with optimized fixed-control settings via their simulation-based application to the road network of the city centre of Chania, Greece, under a number of different demand scenarios. The comparative evaluation is based on various criteria and tools including the recently proposed fundamental diagram for urban network traffic. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Stochasticity of freeway operational capacity and chance-constrained ramp metering	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th AATT Conference	MAY, 2008	Athens, GREECE			Freeway capacity; Freeway operational capacity; Stochasticity; Chance-constrained; Ramp metering	DENSITY	The notion of capacity is essential to the planning, design, and operations of freeway systems. However, in the practice freeway capacity is commonly referred as a theoretical/design value without consideration of operational characteristics of freeways. This is evident from the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2000 in that no influence from down-stream traffic is considered in the definition of freeway capacity. In contrast to this definition, in this paper, we consider the impact of downstream traffic and define freeway operational capacity as the maximum hourly rate at which vehicles can be expected to traverse a point or a uniform section of a roadway under prevailing traffic flow conditions. Therefore freeway operational capacity is not a single value with theoretical notion. Rather, it changes under different traffic flow conditions. Specifically, this concept addresses the capacity loss during congested traffic conditions. We further study the stochasticity of freeway operational capacity by examining loop detector data at three specifically selected detector stations in the Twin Cities' area. It is found that values of freeway operational capacity under different traffic flow conditions generally fit normal distributions. In recognition of the stochastic nature of freeway capacity, we propose a new chance-constrained ramp metering strategy, in which, constant capacity value is replaced by a probabilistic one that changes dynamically depending on real-time traffic conditions and acceptable probability of risk determined by traffic engineers. We then improve the Minnesota ZONE metering algorithm by applying the stochastic chance constraints and test the improved algorithm through microscopic traffic simulation.

A brief overview based on experimental studies and modelling techniques undertaken in literature is presented, including characteristic features affecting wind flow and pollutant dispersion within street canyons. In this work, a numerical street canyon model intercomparison has been performed in a typical urban canyon in Florence, Italy. In particular, STREET, Canyon Plume Box Model (CPBM) and Operational Street Pollution Model (OSPM) have been applied to compute the street-level 1-h carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations. In addition, the CALINE4 model has been applied to test the site morphology. Input data cover a 1-year time period and include meteorological observations as well as measured traffic volumes and driving speeds. Hourly road emissions have been calculated using the COPERT methodology taking into account vehicle fleet, traffic flows and driving speed, as well as ambient temperature to account for cold overemissions. A preliminary experimental data analysis has been carried out in order to investigate the dependence of observed CO concentrations on meteorological and traffic parameters. Hourly CO concentrations observed over the full year have been used to compare the STREET, CPB and OSP models, resulting in a detailed statistical analysis carried out by wind sector as well as on a seasonal basis.

J	Zhang, J; Cao, XB; Du, WB; Cai, KQ				Zhang, Jun; Cao, Xian-Bin; Du, Wen-Bo; Cai, Kai-Quan			Evolution of Chinese airport network	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Complex network; Chinese airport network; Transportation; Evolution	TRANSPORTATION NETWORK; COMPLEX NETWORKS; CENTRALITY; MODEL	With the rapid development of the economy and the accelerated globalization process, the aviation industry plays a more and more critical role in today's world, in both developed and developing countries. As the infrastructure of aviation industry, the airport network is one of the most important indicators of economic growth. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of the Chinese airport network (CAN) via complex network theory. It is found that although the topology of CAN has remained steady during the past few years, there are many dynamic switchings inside the network, which have changed the relative importance of airports and airlines. Moreover, we investigate the evolution of traffic flow (passengers and cargoes) on CAN. It is found that the traffic continues to grow in an exponential form and has evident seasonal fluctuations. We also found that cargo traffic and passenger traffic are positively related but the correlations are quite different for different kinds of cities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Simulation results show that the boundary condition and bottlenecks affect the traffic flow at the roundabout crossing. The enter probability alpha and the out probability beta can change the systemic flux in a certain range. Three phases of the system are differentiated by the relationship between the systemic flux and the enter probability alpha, the out probability beta. The systemic phase diagram is also studied.

These emission values are suited for models addressing the noise assessments of road infrastructures and the dimensioning of acoustic protections, needing traffic noise estimations in terms of LA over a long period of time (an hour or more). The values, obtained from measurements collected in the 70s, are updated in the publication of a new guide (Methodological Guide, Vehicle noise emissions, to be published), which addresses the road surface influence on tyre/road noise. The emission values are now expressed through the contributions of a power unit component, function of traffic speed, traffic flow type and road declivity, and of a rolling noise component, function of traffic speed and road pavement. The paper outlines the procedures followed to determine the components, gives their numerical values, and illustrates some vehicle noise emissions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Gokulan, BP; Srinivasan, D				Gokulan, Balaji Parasumanna; Srinivasan, Dipti			Distributed Geometric Fuzzy Multiagent Urban Traffic Signal Control	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Geometric type-2 fuzzy set; multiagent system; PARAMICS; urban traffic signal control	NEURAL-NETWORKS; SYSTEM; ARCHITECTURE	Rapid urbanization and the growing demand for faster transportation has led to heavy congestion in road traffic networks, necessitating the need for traffic-responsive intelligent signal control systems. The developed signal control system must be capable of determining the green time that minimizes the network-wide travel time delay based on limited information of the environment. This paper adopts a distributed multiagent-based approach to develop a traffic-responsive signal control system, i.e., the geometric fuzzy multiagent system (GFMAS), which is based on a geometric type-2 fuzzy inference system. GFMAS is capable of handling the various levels of uncertainty found in the inputs and rule base of the traffic signal controller. Simulation models of the agents designed in PARAMICS were tested on virtual road network replicating a section of the central business district in Singapore. A comprehensive analysis and comparison was performed against the existing traffic-control algorithms green link determining (GLIDE) and hierarchical multiagent system (HMS). The proposed GFMAS signal control outperformed both the benchmarks when tested for typical traffic-flow scenarios. Further tests show the superior performance of the proposed GFMAS in handling unplanned and planned incidents and obstructions. The promising results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed multiagent architecture and scope for future development.

J	Gan, H				Gan, H.			Graphical route information panel for the urban freeway network in Shanghai, China	IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article							TRAVEL-TIME PREDICTION; SWITCHING BEHAVIOR; DRIVER RESPONSE; NEURAL-NETWORKS; TRAFFIC FLOW; CHOICE; ATIS	The concept of using graphical route information panel (GRIP) to improve the dynamic traffic management efficiency is becoming increasingly popular recently. Colour-coded level-of-service (LOS) map and route travel time are important information displayed by GRIP. This study addresses the graphical information provision issue and the travel time prediction issue, based on research and development of Shanghai urban freeway GRIPs. It first presents function and location of Shanghai GRIP, philosophy of GRIP panel layout and basic principle of LOS display method. Then it focuses on segmentation of LOS map and proposes three segmentation approaches: the detector-based approach, the ramp-based approach and the hybrid approach. Opinions and lessons learned regarding advantages and disadvantages of different segmentation approaches are given. Next, it proposes a macroscopic traffic flow model-based travel time prediction approach for GRIP. The traffic flow model incorporated in the prediction approach is a validated high-order continuum model. The preliminary performance test of the approach is conducted using real-traffic data of a three-lane urban freeway section of Yan-An elevated road in Shanghai. The results reveal that the travel time prediction approach performs well both under free-flowing conditions and under congested conditions. Last, it gives concluding remarks.

J	Franco, V; Garrain, D; Vidal, R				Franco, Vicente; Garrain, Daniel; Vidal, Rosario			Methodological proposals for improved assessments of the impact of traffic noise upon human health	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Annoyance; DALY (disability-adjusted life years); LCA; Noise impact assessment; Road traffic noise	ANNOYANCE	Several methodological shortcomings still hinder the inclusion of transport noise as an established impact category within life cycle assessment (LCA). Earlier attempts to quantify the health damages caused by traffic noise yielded valuable results from an academic point of view, but these were of limited use in the context of everyday LCA practice. An enhanced understanding of traffic noise emission models coupled with a straightforward choice of indicators could lead to faster, more accurate assessments of health impairment due to traffic noise whose results would fittingly serve the purposes of policy makers and the information needs of the general public alike. This article aims to propose the guidelines for such assessments. The assessment method presented takes an incremental approach in similar fashion as previous work in the field done by R. Muller-Wenk. An explanation is provided of how the assumption of linearity leads to a substantial overestimation of noise level increments attributable to additional vehicles, and subsequently to a misjudgement of overall health impacts due to traffic noise. Hence, an alternative calculation method allowing for better accuracy in the computation of noise level increments is proposed. This method can be easily applied, needless of a specific traffic noise emission model. A more detailed method, based on the state-of-the-art Improved Methods for the Assessment of the Generic Impact of Noise in the Environment (IMAGINE) traffic noise emission model, is also described. This method is to be applied to large-, medium- and small-scale assessments where variations in traffic flow or composition can be reasonably predicted or measured. In the proposed methodology, health impairment due to traffic noise is not aggregated in DALY (disability-adjusted life years). Rather, the results are given in terms of the 'number of annoyed persons', which is derived from the synthesis curves relating noise exposure to annoyance presented by Miedema and Oudshoorn. The calculation procedure and data needs to do this are explained. Moreover, the validity of taking the number of annoyed persons as a proxy for overall health impairment due to traffic noise-and the main benefits of doing so-are discussed. Performing the attribution of impacts on a per vehicle-kilometre basis can lead to impact misrepresentations whenever an incremental approach is taken. A different attribution scheme, which takes background noise into account, is thus proposed. The general framework of a method to assess the impact of traffic noise upon human health within LCA is presented. This method, which finds its basis in the work of Muller-Wenk, can be used to evaluate a large number of variations in traffic other than mere increases in overall traffic flows. An application example evaluating the impact of a generic 1,000-km trip of a heavy-duty vehicle through Spain is provided in Section 2.4. The incremental approach seems most adequate for the assessment of the impact of traffic noise upon human health within LCA, albeit the assumption of linearity can significantly distort its results. Likewise, performing the attribution of impacts through generic characterisations of additional vehicle-kilometres may mask the true responsibility of traffic for increasing noise levels, and is therefore advised against. The special characteristics of noise as a pollutant (relevance of spatial data, human perception issues) appear to justify the adoption of a distinct indicator, namely 'number of annoyed persons'. Reasonably good estimates of equivalent noise level increases due to proportional increases over pre-existing traffic can be given without using a noise emission model. Yet, the use of state-of-the-art vehicle noise emission models (e.g. IMAGINE) should allow for more accurate assessments, provided sufficient data regarding the spatial distribution of receivers and traffic characteristics (traffic flow, average speed per vehicle type and so forth) are known. Incorporating annoyance as the preferred indicator for the impact of traffic noise upon human health would make assessment results more intelligible and readily applicable to decision making in matters like infrastructure policing and urban planning, whilst placing the focus on damage prevention. In this paper, only road traffic noise is dealt with. However, annoyance curves with a comparably solid scientific background also exist for railway and aircraft noise, which would make comparisons between alternative transportation modes feasible. The use of 'number of annoyed persons' instead of DALY units is favoured because it allows for a more straightforward presentation of results, even if it excludes the possibility of aggregation with other health impacts. Nevertheless, the use of DALY is not excluded beforehand, insofar as a scientifically sound relationship between long-term exposure to environmental noise and more severe health conditions is agreed upon by medical experts.

On kinetic theory methods in vehicular flow	JOURNAL OF NON-NEWTONIAN FLUID MECHANICS			English	Article						Kinetic theory; Macroscopic traffic model; Traffic flow	MULTILANE TRAFFIC FLOW; MODEL; EQUATIONS	Similarly to the treatment of diluted gases, kinetic methods are formulated for the study of unidirectional freeway traffic. From these it is possible to construct fluid-dynamic equations which in comparison with heuristic fluid-dynamic models have the advantage of just some adjustable parameters although they have some other restrictions. In this work the comparison between two macroscopic models which are based on a kinetic traffic equation is shown. On the other hand, there will be presented some advances to attempt to generalize some restrictions of the kinetic formulation in order to study the synchronization phenomena, which is a very interesting transitory phase between free flow and traffic jams.

For many cities in Asia countries, it is desirable to detect multiple motorcycles as well as cars for urban traffic monitoring and enforcement. In this paper, a novel contour initialization and tracking algorithm is presented to track multiple motorcycles and vehicles at any position on the roadway. This method has the capability to detect moving vehicles of various sizes and to generate their initial contours for image tracking. The proposed method is not constrained by lane boundaries or vehicle size. To track vehicles on roadways, dynamic models are designed to predict the horizontal and vertical positions of vehicle contours. A Kalman filter is designed to update the prediction based on real-time image measurement. Practical experimental studies using video clips are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Traffic parameters such as traffic flow, vehicle speeds and traffic density are obtained with satisfactory accuracy.

ON SOME DIFFERENCE SCHEMES AND ENTROPY CONDITIONS FOR A CLASS OF MULTI-SPECIES KINEMATIC FLOW MODELS WITH DISCONTINUOUS FLUX	NETWORKS AND HETEROGENEOUS MEDIA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on New Trends in Model Coupling, Theory, Numerics and Applications	SEP 02-04, 2009	Paris, FRANCE			Difference schemes; entropy condition; systems of conservation laws; discontinuous flux; multi-species kinematric flow model	SCALAR CONSERVATION-LAWS; STRONG TRACES; EXISTENCE; CONVERGENCE; SEDIMENTATION; UNIQUENESS	We study a system of conservation laws that describes multispecies kinematic flows with an emphasis on models of multiclass traffic flow and of the creaming of oil-in-water dispersions. The flux can have a spatial discontinuity which models abrupt changes of road surface conditions or of the cross-sectional area in a settling vessel. For this system, an entropy inequality is proposed that singles out a relevant solution at the interface. It is shown that "piecewise smooth" limit solutions generated by the semi-discrete version of a numerical scheme the authors recently proposed [R. Burger, A. Garcia, K. H. Karlsen and J.D. Towers, J. Engrg. Math. 60:387-425, 2008] satisfy this entropy inequality. We present an improvement to this scheme by means of a special interface flux that is activated only at a few grid points where the discontinuity is located. While an entropy inequality is established for the semi-discrete versions of the scheme only, numerical experiments support that the fully discrete scheme are equally entropy-admissible.

J	Della Rossa, F; D'Angelo, C; Quarteroni, A				Della Rossa, Fabio; D'Angelo, Carlo; Quarteroni, Alfio			A distributed model of traffic flows on extended regions	NETWORKS AND HETEROGENEOUS MEDIA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on New Trends in Model Coupling, Theory, Numerics and Applications	SEP 02-04, 2009	Paris, FRANCE			Traffic flows; two-dimensonal models; macroscopic models; cellular automata; averaging		This work deals with the modelling of traffic flows in complex networks, spanning two-dimensional regions whose size (macroscale) is much greater than the characteristic size of the network arcs (microscale). A typical example is the modelling of traffic flow in large urbanzied areas with diameter of hundreds of kilometers, where standard models of traffic flows on networks resolving all the streets are computationally too expensive. Starting from a stochastic lattice gas model with simple constitutive laws, we derive a distributed two-dimensional model of traffic flow, in the form of a non-linear diffusion-advection equation for the particle density. The equation is formally equivalent to a (non-linear) Darcy's filtration law. In particular, it contains two parameters that can be seen as the porosity and the permeability tensor of the network. We provide suitable algorithms to extract these parameters starting from the geometry of the network and a given microscale model of traffic flow (for instance based on cellular automata). Finally, we compare the fully microscopic simulation with the finite element solutions of our upscaled model in realistic cases, showing that our model is able to capture the large-scale feature of the flow.

The present model includes the model of two crossing roads in the limit of maximum sized blocks and the BML model in the limit of zero sized blocks. New phases of traffic flow appear between the free flow phase and the jam phase in the BML model. The boundaries between these phases come closer as the size of the block decreases and converge into one phase boundary at a density around 0.19, which is in fair agreement with the critical density in the BML model.

Modeling U-turn traffic flow	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Land transportation; Traffic flow; Numerical simulation	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; STATES; HIGHWAY; PHYSICS	Median U-turns are sometimes installed to improve the traffic flow at busy intersections by eliminating left turns. Using a microscopic traffic model, we confirmed the presence of transitions from free flow to congested flow with increasing car inflow density. In addition, our proposed rules inside a U-turn curve, which accounted for safety issues and an asymmetric lane changing behavior (outer-to-inner vs. inner-to-outer lane transitions), predicted the speed distribution of cars after the U-turn curve. We found that U-turn curves installed for improving traffic flow at busy intersections produced their desired effects only when there is minimal interaction between cars. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	Treiber, M; Kesting, A; Helbing, D				Treiber, Martin; Kesting, Arne; Helbing, Dirk			Three-phase traffic theory and two-phase models with a fundamental diagram in the light of empirical stylized facts	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Second-order traffic models; Car-following models; Three-phase theory; Phase diagram; Synchronized traffic; Pinch effect	INDUCED PHASE-TRANSITIONS; FLOW; STATES; RESURRECTION; SIMULATION; DERIVATION; REQUIEM; WAVES; TIME	Despite the availability of large empirical data sets and the long history of traffic modeling, the theory of traffic congestion on freeways is still highly controversial. In this contribution, we compare Kerner's three-phase traffic theory with the phase diagram approach for traffic models with a fundamental diagram. We discuss the inconsistent use of the term "traffic phase" and show that patterns demanded by three-phase traffic theory can be reproduced with simple two-phase models, if the model parameters are suitably specified and factors characteristic for real traffic flows are considered, such as effects of noise or heterogeneity or the actual freeway design (e g combinations of off- and on-ramps) Conversely. we demonstrate that models created to reproduce three-phase traffic theory create similar spatiotemporal traffic states and associated phase diagrams, no matter whether the parameters imply a fundamental diagram in equilibrium or non-unique flow-density relationships In conclusion, there are different ways of reproducing the empirical stylized facts of spatiotemporal congestion patterns summarized in this contribution, and it appears possible to overcome the controversy by a more precise definition of the scientific terms and a more careful comparison of models and data, considering effects of the measurement process and the right level of detail in the traffic model used.

J	Jin, WL				Jin, Wen-Long			A kinematic wave theory of lane-changing traffic flow	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						LWR model; Fundamental diagram; Lane-changing intensity variable; Riemann problem; Kinematic waves; Supply-demand method; Bottleneck effects; NGSIM data	DENSITY; MODEL; DYNAMICS; 2-LANE	Frequent lane-changes in highway merging, diverging, and weaving areas could disrupt traffic flow and, even worse, lead to accidents In this paper, we propose a simple model for studying bottleneck effects of lane-changing traffic and aggregate traffic dynamics of a roadway with lane-changing areas. Based on the observation that, when changing its lane, a vehicle affects traffic on both its current and target lanes, we propose to capture such lateral interactions by introducing a new lane-changing intensity variable With a modified fundamental diagram, we are able to study the impacts of lane-changing traffic on overall traffic flow. In addition, the corresponding traffic dynamics can be described with a simple kinematic wave model. For a location-dependent lane-changing intensity variable, we discuss kinematic wave solutions of the Riemann problem of the new model and introduce a supply-demand method for its numerical solutions With both theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that lane-changes could have significant bottleneck effects on overall traffic flow In the future, we will be interested in studying lane-changing intensities lot different road geometries, locations, on-ramp/off-ramp flows, as well as traffic conditions The new modeling framework could be helpful for developing ramp-metering and other lane management strategies to mitigate the bottleneck effects of lane-changes.

J	Zhu, HB				Zhu, H. B.			Numerical study of urban traffic flow with dedicated bus lane and intermittent bus lane	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Public transport priority; Two-lane traffic flow model; Numerical simulation	PRIORITY	Based on the cellular automaton traffic flow model and the concept of public transport priority, a two-lane traffic model with an intermittent bus lane is proposed and the properties of urban traffic flow are studied. The cases of traffic with a dedicated bus lane (DBL), an intermittent bus lane (IBL) and an ordinary two-lane traffic are simulated, and comparisons in the form of the fundamental diagrams and the velocity-density profiles are made between them. It is shown that the DBL has the advantage of freeing buses from traffic interference and also has the disadvantage of disrupting traffic, the IBL is more efficient in improving the bus flow than ordinary two-lane traffic and maintaining the car flow at a higher level at the same time than the DBL, while the ordinary two-lane traffic suppresses public transportation and is not advantageous in easing urban traffic congestion. Also it is indicated that the DBL is only appropriate for low traffic flow in a two-lane traffic system, and this limitation can be partly overcome by opening the bus lane to general traffic intermittently when the bus lane is not in use by buses.

In this scenario, our model incorporates the effects of adaptability into the cellular automaton models of traffic flow. Simulation results adopting this optimal information feedback strategy have demonstrated high efficiency in controlling spatial distribution of traffic patterns compared with the other three information feedback strategies, i.e., vehicle number and flux.

By numerical simulation for the traffic flow with different curvature radii, arc length and friction factor, it is found that our improved model can reflect accurately the influence of special sections of a road on the running vehicles, meanwhile visualize the complex nonlinear phenomenon traffic waves of alternate running and stopping as in actual traffics. The reflecting phenomenon in actual traffics indicates that traffic accidents and congestion can be avoided by increase the curvature radii, friction factor of road turning, the capacity of road can be enhanced also.

Traffic noise spectrum analysis: Dynamic modeling vs. experimental observations	APPLIED ACOUSTICS			English	Article						Traffic representations; Noise spectrum; Urban traffic noise; Dynamic noise assessment	SOUND QUALITY; ANNOYANCE	This paper compares two traffic representations for the assessment of urban noise frequency spectrum: (i) a static one, based on mean vehicle speeds and flow rates, (ii) a dynamic one, which considers vehicle interactions along the network. The two representations are compared on their suitability to match real on-field noise levels, recorded on a three lane quite busy street. Representation (i) fails in reproducing spectra envelopes that correspond to this site. In particular, it underestimates low frequencies, what can conceal the real impact of traffic flow on urban sound quality. Representation (ii) greatly improves estimation. It guarantees accurate environmental noise assessment, since it reproduces all traffic situations that are encountered in the site. Moreover, its 1s-based structure allows for the evaluation of spectra variations, with a good accuracy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By numerical simulations, the dependences of flux on the inflow rate are investigated for various proportions of cars with ITSs. The phase diagrams as well as the spatioternporal diagrams are presented to show different traffic flow states on the main road and the on-ramp. The results show that the saturated flux on the main road increases and the free flow region is enlarged with the increase of the proportion of cars with ITS. Interestingly, the congested regions of the main road disappear completely when the proportion is larger than a critical value. Further investigation shows that the capacity of on-ramp system can be promoted by 13% by using the ITS information, and the saturated flux on the on-ramp can be kept at an appropriate value by adjusting the proportion of cars with ITS.

In a multi-route scenario, our model incorporates the effects of adaptability into the cellular automaton models of traffic flow and simulation results adopting vehicle number feedback strategy have demonstrated high efficiency in controlling spatial distribution of traffic patterns compared with the other three information feedback strategies, i.e. Travel Time Feedback Strategy (TTFS), Mean Velocity Feedback Strategy (MVFS) and Congestion Coefficient Feedback Strategy (CCFS). We also discuss the influence of expected arrival rate (V-p) at the entrance on the average flux of each route, and we find that the flux adopting VNFS is always the largest at each V-p value among these four feedback strategies.

Spontaneous symmetry breaking in a two-lane model for bidirectional overtaking traffic	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT			English	Article						exact results; interacting agent models; traffic and crowd dynamics; traffic models	SIMPLE EXCLUSION PROCESSES; DRIVEN DIFFUSIVE SYSTEM; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; FLOWS; DYNAMICS; STATES; JAMS	Firstly, we consider a unidirectional flux (omega) over bar of vehicles, each of which is characterized by its 'natural' velocity v drawn from a distribution P(v). The traffic flow is modeled as a collection of straight 'world lines' in the time space plane, with overtaking events represented by a fixed queuing time tau imposed on the overtaking vehicle. This geometrical model exhibits platoon formation and allows, among many other things, for the calculation of the effective average velocity w phi(v) of a vehicle of natural velocity v. Secondly, we extend the model to two opposite lanes, A and B. We argue that the queuing time t in one lane is determined by the traffic density in the opposite lane. On the basis of reasonable additional assumptions we establish a set of equations that couple the two lanes and can be solved numerically. It appears that above a critical value (omega) over bar (c) of the control parameter (omega) over bar the symmetry between the lanes is spontaneously broken: there is a slow lane where long platoons form behind the slowest vehicles, and a fast lane where overtaking is easy due to the wide spacing between the platoons in the opposite direction. A variant of the model is studied in which the spatial vehicle density (rho) over bar rather than the flux (omega) over bar is the control parameter. Unequal fluxes (omega) over bar (A) and (omega) over bar (B) in the two lanes are also considered. The symmetry breaking phenomenon exhibited by this model, even though no doubt hard to observe in pure form in real- life traffic, nevertheless indicates a tendency of such traffic.

Weaving Section Flow Model at the Weaving Area of Malaysian Conventional Roundabout	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article						Traffic congestion; Geometric design; Lane changing; Weaving section; Conventional roundabout	CAPACITY; GAP	Like in many other countries, Malaysian road users are facing problems with traffic congestion. In urban areas roundabouts are becoming more popular like in Shah Alam but had limitations, among others, such as a geometric design and traffic flow characteristics. The lane changing behavior due to the drivers' driving "habit" which creates problems, such as delays, because of intolerable and impatient driving while selecting and changing lanes. Due to such factors, congestion will occur and at the same time it will reduce the safety of the drivers either at entry, exit, or in weaving the section of the roundabouts. There is a lack of knowledge of Malaysian driver behavior and of corresponding methods for calculating impacts of geometric design and other factors on traffic performance at the weaving section of conventional roundabouts. A study of vehicle interactions at the weaving section of Malaysian conventional roundabouts needs to be done in order to close this knowledge gap and to enable development of model to support the design and traffic operation processes. One approach of evaluating roundabout performance based on traffic parameters is by video taping techniques. Generally, traffic parameters that are normally considered and measured are gap, entry flow, and conflicting flow at the entry of the conventional roundabout, whereas, this paper focuses on the weaving section of the conventional roundabout. Samples of data reduction and analysis taken at the weaving section of the Malaysian conventional roundabout were presented, discussed, and became an input for weaving the section flow model under stable flow condition. The model developed was then validated with other weaving section of the Malaysian conventional roundabout.	[Diah, J. Md; Rahman, M. Y. Abdul; Adnan, M.

Gueltekin; Sari, Murat; Borat, Oguz			A NEURAL NETWORK BASED TRAFFIC-FLOW PREDICTION MODEL	MATHEMATICAL & COMPUTATIONAL APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic Prediction; Artificial Neural Networks; Transportation Engineering		Prediction of traffic-flow in Istanbul has been a great concern for planners of the city. Istanbul as being one of the most crowded cities in the Europe has a rural population of more than 10 million. The related transportation agencies ill Istanbul continuously collect data through many ways thanks to improvements in sensor technology and communication systems which allow to more closely monitor the condition of the city transportation system. Since monitoring alone cannot improve the safety or efficiency of the system, those agencies actively inform the drivers continuously through various media including television broadcasts, internet, and electronic display boards on many locations on the roads. Currently, the human expertise is employed to judge traffic-flow on the roads to inform the public. There is no reliance on past data and human experts give opinions only on the present condition without much idea on what will be the likely events in the next hours. Historical events such as school-timings, holidays and other periodic events cannot be utilized for judging the future traffic-flows. This paper makes a preliminary attempt to change scenario by using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to model the past historical data. It aims at the prediction of the traffic volume based on the historical data in each major junction in the city. ANNs have given very encouraging results with the suggested approach explained in the paper.	[Cetiner, B.

An existing theory states that this behavior is dictated by a fixed ratio between the two upstream merging flows, denoted as the merge-ratio. It has been further conjectured that the merge-ratio is equal to the capacity-ratio. This paper presents an effective method to estimate merge-ratios from extensive historical traffic data. The archived traffic data in the California PEMS (Performance Measurement System) from January 2004 to June 2008 are used to estimate merge-ratios at 15 different freeway-to-freeway merge sites (via connectors). Findings show that merge-ratios can be reasonably estimated by the ratios between the numbers of lanes on the merging approaches (lane-ratio), which is typically similar to the capacity-ratio. However, residual differences between merge-ratios and lane-ratios suggest that there are probably other influencing factors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A second-order macroscopic model has been transformed into a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) model. The paper proposes two LPV descriptions for traffic modeling: the first one covers completely the non-linear macroscopic dynamics, while the second one is an approximate description. Real test field topology and measurement data are used for validating the proposed modeling methodology. Simulation examples are given to compare real detector measurements, non-linear and the parameter-dependent responses. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zheng, LA; Ma, SF; Jia, N				Zheng Liang; Ma Shou-Feng; Jia Ning			The cellular automaton model of traffic flow based on the driving behavior	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						driving behavior; cellular automaton; metastability; phase-separation	PROBABILITY	On the basis of the research of driving behavior, by analyzing the mechanism of driving behavior and using the cellular automaton (CA) model, we introduce the mechanism of driving behavior, which is associated with the vehicle's own speed, the relative speed, the vehicle spacing, and the safety vehicle spacing, into the CA model (ACA). We observe the metastability, phase-separation and hysteresis phenomena when taking advantage of ACA model to conduct the microscopic traffic simulation and compare the simulation results of ACA model with the simulation results of the CA model (BCA) which only considers the vehicle's own speed and the vehicle spacing. The results show that, in the macro level, from the maximum traffic flow, stability and the efficiency in dissolving congestions, the simulation results of ACA model exhibit a larger maximum value of flow which is also closer to the actual measured data, stronger stability and higher efficiency of dissolving jam; in the micro level, from the fluctuations of the vehicles' speed and the vehicles' headway-distance, the simulation results of ACA model exhibit that the vehicles do not accelerate or decelerate suddenly, the vehicles can be relatively and evenly distributed on the road. All these results illustrate that the relative speed and safety vehicle spacing have a significant impact on the driving behavior and also explain that the ACA model is in better consistence with the actual situation and has some practical significance.

J	Zeng, WP; Castillo, I; Hodgson, MJ				Zeng, Weiping; Castillo, Ignacio; Hodgson, Michael John			Aggregating Data for the Flow-Intercepting Location Model: A Geographic Information System, Optimization, and Heuristic Framework	GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS			English	Article							DISCRETIONARY SERVICE FACILITIES; MAXIMIZING MARKET-SIZE; INSPECTION STATIONS; ALLOCATION MODEL; NETWORK; DEMAND; ERROR; EDMONTON; CENTERS; CANADA	Flow-intercepting problems have received considerable interest, represented by about 40 academic publications, since the early 1990s. Point-based demand aggregation also has received much research interest in both industry and academia. Systematic studies of flow data aggregation for flow-intercepting problems have not, however, been reported to date. Our research highlights the importance of flow-based demand aggregation and develops a framework for aggregating such demand. This framework represents the first systematic study of aggregation for flow-intercepting location models (FILM). The standard FILM is the perfect model for our goals-its aggregation errors are easy to understand and its outputs are easy to measure and compare. Our research uses geographic information systems, optimization, and heuristic technologies to examine the special network flow structure of a real-world transportation system and to develop a comprehensive method of aggregating data for the standard FILM. We apply our method to the 2001 afternoon peak traffic data for Edmonton, Alberta (the sixth largest Canadian city) and find this application to be extremely efficient. We discover that in the Edmonton traffic flow network, a large number of paths have very small flows; major flows are concentrated in a limited number of paths; and a large number of small-flow paths and a large number of low-flow nodes on local streets have negligible effects on facility locations for FILM. We speculate that most real-world transportation systems may have similar characteristics.

J	Leitloff, J; Hinz, S; Stilla, U				Leitloff, Jens; Hinz, Stefan; Stilla, Uwe			Vehicle Detection in Very High Resolution Satellite Images of City Areas	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Adaptive boosting (AdaBoost); parameter estimation; satellite imagery; vehicle detection	CAR DETECTION; PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS; AIRBORNE; REGRESSION	Current traffic research is mostly based on data from fixed-installed sensors like induction loops, bridge sensors, and cameras. Thereby, the traffic flow on main roads can partially be acquired, while data from the major part of the entire road network are not available. Today's optical sensor systems on satellites provide large-area images with 1-m resolution and better, which can deliver complement information to traditional acquired data. In this paper, we present an approach for automatic vehicle detection from optical satellite images. Therefore, hypotheses for single vehicles are generated using adaptive boosting in combination with Haar-like features. Additionally, vehicle queues are detected using a line extraction technique since grouped vehicles are merged to either dark or bright ribbons. Utilizing robust parameter estimation, single vehicles are determined within those vehicle queues. The combination of implicit modeling and the use of a priori knowledge of typical vehicle constellation leads to an enhanced overall completeness compared to approaches which are only based on statistical classification techniques. Thus, a detection rate of over 80% is possible with very high reliability. Furthermore, an approach for movement estimation of the detected vehicle is described, which allows the distinction of moving and stationary traffic. Thus, even an estimate for vehicles' speed is possible, which gives additional information about the traffic condition at image acquisition time.

A stability criterion is given through linear stability analysis of traffic flows. The mKdV equation is derived with the reductive perturbation method for headway evolution which could be used to describe the stop-and-go traffic phenomenon. The results show a good effect of anticipation driving behavior on the stabilization of car flows and the anticipation driving behavior can improve the numerical stability of the model as well. In addition, the fluctuation of kinetic energy and the consumption of average energy in congested traffic flows are systematically analyzed. The results show that the reasonable level of anticipation driving behavior can save energy consumption in deceleration process effectively and lead to an associated relation like a "bow-tie" between the energy-saving and the value of anticipation factor.

Efficient controls for traffic flow on networks	JOURNAL OF DYNAMICAL AND CONTROL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Traffic flows; networks; vector-valued optimization; efficient controls; scalarization		We study traffic flow models for road networks in vector-valued optimization statement, where the flow is controlled at the nodes of the network. We consider the case where an objective mapping possesses a weakened property of upper semicontinuity and make no assumptions on the interior of the ordering cone. We derive sufficient conditions for the existence of efficient controls of the traffic problem and discuss the scalarization approach to its solution. We also prove the existence of the so-called generalized efficient controls.	[D'Apice, C.; Manzo, R.] Univ Salerno, Dipartimento Ingn Informaz & Matemat Applicata, Salerno, Italy; [Kogut, P.

A set of traffic lights operating in a fixed-time scheme controls the traffic flow. A closed boundary condition is applied to the streets, each of which conducts a unidirectional flow. Streets are single-lane and cars cannot turn upon reaching the intersection. Via extensive Monte Carlo simulations it is shown that the model phase diagram consists of ten phases. The flow characteristics in each phase are investigated and the types of phase transitions between phases are specified.	[Foulaadvand, M.

Marine Vessels as Substitutes for Heavy-Duty Trucks in Great Lakes Freight Transportation	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION			English	Article							EMISSIONS; ENERGY; COUNTRIES; TRADEOFFS; TRENDS	This paper applies a geospatial network optimization model to explore environmental, economic, and time-of-delivery tradeoffs associated with the application of marine vessels as substitutes for heavy-duty trucks operating in the Great Lakes region. The geospatial model integrates U.S. and Canadian highway, rail, and waterway networks to create an intermodal network and characterizes this network using temporal, economic, and environmental attributes (including emissions of carbon dioxide, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, volatile organic compounds, and nitrogen oxides). A case study evaluates tradeoffs associated with containerized traffic flow in the Great Lakes region, demonstrating how choice of freight mode affects the environmental performance of movement of goods. These results suggest opportunities to improve the environmental performance of freight transport through infrastructure development, technology implementation, and economic incentives.

J	Tsekeris, T; Stathopoulos, A				Tsekeris, Theodore; Stathopoulos, Antony			Short-Term Prediction of Urban Traffic Variability: Stochastic Volatility Modeling Approach	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Traffic models; Forecasting; Traffic flow; Intelligent transportation systems		This paper addresses the problem of modeling and predicting urban traffic flow variability, which involves considerable implications for the deployment of dynamic transportation management systems. Traffic variability is described in terms of a volatility metric, i.e., the conditional variance of traffic flow level, as a latent stochastic (low-order Markov) process. A discrete-time parametric stochastic model, referred to as stochastic volatility (SV) model is employed to provide short-term adaptive forecasts of traffic (speed) variability by using real-time detector measurements of volumes and occupancies in an urban arterial. The predictive performance of the SV model is compared to that of the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model, which has been recently used for the traffic variability forecasting, with regard to different measurement locations, forms of data input, lengths of forecasting horizon and performance measures. The results indicate the potential of the SV model to produce out-of-sample forecasts of speed variability with significantly higher accuracy, in comparison to the GARCH model.

Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA) are used to study the traffic flow fluctuations. We find that the original traffic fluctuation time series may exhibit power-law auto-correlations; however, the sign-separated traffic fluctuation signals, both the positive fluctuation signals and the negative fluctuation signals, exhibit anti-correlated behavior. Further, we show that two original traffic speed fluctuation time series derived from adjacent sections exhibit much stronger power-law cross-correlations than the two time series derived from adjacent lanes. Finally, we demonstrate that for two sign-separated traffic fluctuation signals, there exist long-range cross-correlations between the positive fluctuation signals and the negative fluctuation signals, derived from two adjacent lanes, respectively. But, for two same-sign traffic fluctuation signals derived from two adjacent lanes, there is power-law cross-anti-correlation in the variables.

Understanding the factors which affect drivers' lane changing behavior is important due to the implication of lane changing models in variety of traffic and transportation studies. This paper reviews the existing lane changing models and assesses the strengths and weaknesses of each model type. In addition, the lane changing models are classified according to their characteristics. Then, limitations of the existing lane changing models are identified. Finally, the findings and conclusions of the paper are summarized and more promising research directions are suggested.

It adopts a parameter, which can reflect different lane-changing behaviour, to represent the diversity of driving behaviour. The refined cellular automaton model is used to describe the lower acceleration rate of a vehicle. The phase diagram and the capacity of the on-ramp system are investigated. The simulation results show that in the single cell model, the capacity of the on-ramp system will stay at the highest flow of a one lane system when the driver is moderate and careful; it will be reduced when the driver is aggressive. In the refined cellular automaton model, the capacity is always reduced even when the driver is careful. It proposes that the capacity drop of the on-ramp system is caused by aggressive lane-changing behaviour and lower acceleration rate.

J	Peng, GH				Peng Guang-Han			A coupling lattice model of traffic flow on two lanes and numerical simulation	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						traffic flow; lattice model; two lanes; simulation	2-LANE FREEWAYS; DYNAMICS; HIGHWAY; TESTS; WAVES	An improved coupling lattice model of two-lane traffic flow is proposed by taking into account the effect of the two-lane coupling and lane changing. And the lane changing rate of traffic flow is modified. The analysis of the modified lane changing rate shows that it is in better accordance with the real traffic than the previous ones The linear stability condition of the extended model is obtained by using the linear stability theory Numerical simulation also shows that our model can better reproduce the lane changing of traffic flow than previous ones by considering the information of two-lane coupling interaction. And there is unavoidable effect on the two-lane traffic flow from the coupling effect between the two lanes.

An Integrated Road Construction and Resource Planning Approach to the Evacuation of Victims From Single Source to Multiple Destinations	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Evacuation; resource planning; road construction; transportation system	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; NETWORK; ALGORITHM	This paper presents our study on the emergency resource-planning problem, particularly on the development of a new approach to resource planning through contraflow techniques with consideration of the repair of damaged infrastructures. The contraflow technique is aimed at reversing traffic flows in one or more inbound lanes of a divided highway for the outbound direction. As opposed to the current literature, our approach has the following salient points: 1) simultaneous consideration of contraflow and repair of repair of roads; 2) classification of victims in terms of their problems and urgency in sending them to a safe place or place to be treated; and 3) consideration of multiple destinations for victims. A simulated experiment is also described by comparing our approach with some variations of our approach. The experimental results show that our approach can lead to a reduction in evacuation time by more than 50%, as opposed to the original resource operation on the damaged transportation network, and by about 20%, as opposed to the approach with resource replanning (only) on the damaged network. In addition, the multiobjective optimization algorithm to solve our model can be generalized to other network resource-planning problems under infrastructure damage.	[Wang, J. W.; Zhang, W.

However, there are limitations that are associated with each detector. In this paper, we propose a channel awareness vehicle detector that can overcome these limitations. It employs only one pair of transmitter-receiver antennas to simultaneously perform the multilane and multivehicle identifications. By using the characteristics of channel variations, the proposed vehicle detector can determine the vehicle location, speed, and type. Our measurement results demonstrate its capabilities.

Real-time urban traffic monitoring with global positioning system-equipped vehicles	IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article								Real-time traffic conditions are useful information based on which many adaptive traffic solutions work. In this study, the authors present a new approach for real-timely monitoring urban traffic with global positioning system (GPS)-equipped vehicles, which provides estimation of urban traffic conditions in real time. The approach first real-timely collects GPS trace data from GPS-equipped vehicles on the urban road network. Then, it periodically clusters the collected data of several minutes, calculates estimated space mean speed (eSMS) and translates eSMS to smooth indexes (denoting traffic conditions). Compared with existing work, the presented one: (i) applies an effective map matching method to cluster GPS trace data; (ii) excludes traffic signal's misleading influences on traffic condition estimation and (iii) judges traffic conditions based on an estimated critical traffic flow characteristic. Some experiments based on GPS taxi scheduling data of Shanghai, China are provided to demonstrate performance of this work.

J	Jeon, YW; Daimon, T				Jeon, Y. W.; Daimon, T.			Study of in-vehicle route guidance systems for improvement of right-side drivers in the Japanese traffic system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						In-vehicle route guidance system; Road convention; Right-side traffic; Left-side traffic		A country can adopt one of two standards for traffic flow - cars may travel on the left or right side of the road. When drivers who are accustomed to driving on the right side of the road drive on the left side, and vice versa, the mental workload is likely increased due to the driver's unfamiliarity with a new language, the position of the driver's seat, different driving directions, and other factors that differ from those of their home country. One method of doing this is to make sure that the in-vehicle route guidance information (RGI) is not overly complicated - thereby assisting drivers in improving their safety. Consequently, the aim of this study was to facilitate mobility and improve safety for natural right-side drivers driving temporarily in left-side traffic. In this study, driver behavior and workload - given various types of RGI - were evaluated in a driving simulator with a variety of prescribable test conditions. This research was composed of two experiments. In the first, various types of in-vehicle route guidance systems were tested and evaluated in terms of their characteristics and associated driver behaviors (while driving). In the second experiment, systemic factors and effectiveness were evaluated by two combined systems, arrow and map-type information, based on the results of the first experiment. In light of both experiments, the various types of route guidance systems were discussed in terms of their results. A navigation system was proposed to alleviate some of the secondary tasks such as route selection.	[Jeon, Y.

J	Wang, XP; Zhao, YL; Li, XQ; Sun, P				Wang, Xiao-Ping; Zhao, Yun-Liang; Li, Xing-Qun; Sun, Peng			A New Data-driven Approach for a Single Ship Lock Scheduling Problem	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NONLINEAR SCIENCES AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION			English	Article						data-driven; ship lock scheduling; ant colony optimization; transportation management; optimization; decision-making; traffic flow	RECURRENT NEURAL-NETWORKS; TIME-VARYING DELAYS; GLOBAL EXPONENTIAL STABILITY; PERIODIC EXTERNAL INPUTS; MULTIPERIODICITY; DESIGN	This paper investigates traffic states and queuing occurring in water transportation. A scheduling model with a single ship lock is proposed, which is a typical optimization and decision-making model. Transportation states change randomly and stochastically. The objective is to minimize the operation cost and other costs (e.g. water cost, electricity cost, and staff welfare cost) by selecting an appropriate slot number in a planning period. A data-driven approach is proposed for solving this problem based on the previous transportation data, accordingly a detailed ship scheduling plan is obtained using the ant colony optimization algorithm. Finally a numerical example is given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. This research results are helpful to transportation management.

An Inexact Transportation Planning Model for Supporting Vehicle Emissions Management	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						inter-community; inexact planning; traffic flow; traffic system; vehicle emissions	SOLID-WASTE MANAGEMENT; LAND-USE; EVACUATION MANAGEMENT; PROGRAMMING APPROACH; POLLUTANT EMISSIONS; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; UNCERTAINTY; SYSTEM; IMPACT; TOOL	An interval-parameter inter-community traffic planning model (ICTPM) is developed for supporting vehicle emissions management under uncertainty. With integrating interval-parameter and mixed-integer linear programming within a general optimization framework, the ICTPM can address uncertainties of traffic structure and vehicle emissions related to system costs and capacity expansion decisions. Another advantage of the proposed model is that decision variables can be obtained quickly, which make it applicable to complex traffic problems. The ICTPM is then applied to Wuhan City, China to demonstrate its applicability in the field of inter-community vehicle emissions management. In this study, one reference case and a scenario are provided for three planning periods. The results indicate that the ICTPM can provide strategies for authorities to deal with the issues of sustainable transportation system.	[Ma, X. F.; Huang, G.

J	Singliar, T; Hauskrecht, M				Singliar, Tomas; Hauskrecht, Milos			Learning to detect incidents from noisily labeled data	MACHINE LEARNING			English	Article						Incident detection; Road network; SVM; Dynamic Bayesian networks		Many deployed traffic incident detection systems use algorithms that require significant manual tuning. We seek machine learning incident detection solutions that reduce the need for manual adjustments by taking advantage of massive databases of traffic sensor measurements. We first examine which traffic flow features are most useful for the incident detection task. Then we show that a supervised learner based on the SVM model outperforms a fixed detection model used by state-of-the-art traffic incident detectors. However, the performance of a supervised learner suffers from temporal noise in the data labels due to imperfections of the incident logging procedure. Correcting these misaligned incident times in the training data achieves further improvements in detection performance. We propose a label realignment model based on a dynamic Bayesian network to re-estimate the correct position (time) of the incident in the data. Training on the automatically realigned data then consistently leads to improved detection performance in the low false positive region.

J	Du, LL; Ukkusuri, S				Du, Lili; Ukkusuri, Satish			The Relative Mobility of Vehicles Improves the Performance of Information Flow in Vehicle Ad Hoc Networks	NETWORKS & SPATIAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Transportation networks; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Information flow; Reachability; Simulation	WIRELESS NETWORKS; RADIO NETWORK; COMMUNICATION; CONNECTIVITY; NUMBER; RELAY	Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) are receiving significant attention due to their potential to provide a wide range of benefits. One key distinguishing feature of VANET from other ad hoc networks is their relative vehicular mobility. Therefore, to fully understand the significant benefits of these systems, it is necessary to understand the interaction between traffic flow characteristics and information propagation in VANET. This research presents an analytical model to characterize information flow in VANET incorporating macroscopic traffic characteristics, such as traffic density, relative speed between adjacent lanes, and driver composition. The information flow in VANET is characterized using an information flow network (IFN). The analytical expressions for the expected degree of the individual nodes as well as the reachability of an IFN are provided. Moreover, a state of the art simulation model is developed to validate the analytical results. The proposed analytical results not only provide us significant insights to evaluate the performance of information propagation in VANET, but also provide theoretical basis for the design of algorithms for the efficient routing of information based on average end-to-end performance.

J	Ramadurai, G; Ukkusuri, S				Ramadurai, Gitakrishnan; Ukkusuri, Satish			Dynamic User Equilibrium Model for Combined Activity-Travel Choices Using Activity-Travel Supernetwork Representation	NETWORKS & SPATIAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Integrated urban transport model; Activity-travel networks; Dynamic user equilibrium; Route-swapping algorithm	VARIATIONAL INEQUALITY FORMULATION; CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT; NETWORK; COMPUTATION; ROUTE	Integrated urban transportation models have several benefits over sequential models including consistent solutions, quicker convergence, and more realistic representation of behavior. Static models have been integrated using the concept of Supernetworks. However integrated dynamic transport models are less common. In this paper, activity location, time of participation, duration, and route choice decisions are jointly modeled in a single unified dynamic framework referred to as Activity-Travel Networks (ATNs). ATNs is a type of Supernetwork where virtual links representing activity choices are added to augment the travel network to represent additional choice dimensions. Each route in the augmented network represents a set of travel and activity arcs. Therefore, choosing a route is analogous to choosing an activity location, duration, time of participation, and travel route. A cell-based transmission model (CTM) is embedded to capture the traffic flow dynamics. The dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) behavior requires that all used routes (activity-travel sequences) provide equal and greater utility compared to unused routes. An equivalent variational inequality problem is obtained. A solution method based on route-swapping algorithm is tested on a hypothetical network under different demand levels and parameter assumptions.

J	Komada, K; Nagatani, T				Komada, Kazuhito; Nagatani, Takashi			Traffic flow through multi-lane tollbooths on a toll highway	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Vehicular dynamics; Traffic jam; Toll road; Dynamical phase transition; Queue	SIMULATION; PHYSICS; STATES; MODEL	We study the traffic states and queuing occurring in traffic flow on a toll highway with multi-lane tollgates. The traffic states change with increasing density and varying number of tollgates. When the manual-collection vehicles sort themselves into the tollgates, the queues occur just in front of the tollgates if the vehicular density is higher than a critical value. The queuing in front of tollgates is induced by the competition between the lane expansion and slowdown effects. When the lane expansion effect is superior to the slowdown effect, no queuing occurs. We derive the fundamental diagrams (current-density diagrams) for the traffic flow on the toll highway. The current saturates at the nearest tollgate at a low density and the saturation extends to the next-nearest tollgate with increasing density. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Traffic management in Konya by junction risk factor	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-MUNICIPAL ENGINEER			English	Article						risk & probability analysis; town and; city planning; traffic engineering	SPATIAL-ANALYSIS; ACCIDENT; STATISTICS; SAFETY; MODELS; GIS; REGRESSION; FLOWS; ROADS	With the growing population size and number of vehicles, traffic congestion is increasing, particularly in urban areas. Adequate junction management and control are necessary to prevent traffic accidents and jams and to provide optimal traffic flow. In this study, 103 inner city junction points in Konya province in Turkey have been evaluated in terms of their structural data, such as numerical data, intervals and related distances. The aim of the study is to eliminate traffic jams at junctions and to reduce the risk of accidents by regulating components of high-risk junctions in urban areas. Some main sources of traffic congestion have been formularised and termed ` junction risk factors' in long-term experiments. The appropriateness of the model was then compared and tested by kernel density estimation and Getis-Ord Gi statistical methods. The superiority of the new model is that the variables of the models are independent and do not affect each other. As a result, besides numerical suggestions, probable maps have been produced for the purpose of future route/ junction planning using geographic information systems.

J	Turner, S; Hughes, T; Allatt, T; Wood, G; Luo, QW				Turner, Shane; Hughes, Tim; Allatt, Tracy; Wood, Graham; Luo, Qingwei			Cycle safety - measuring the crash risk	ROAD & TRANSPORT RESEARCH			English	Article								Cycling is a sustainable mode of travel and is an alternative to private motor vehicles in urban areas, particularly for trips of less than 6 km. Although there are a number of benefits of promoting more cycling, including health benefits to cyclists, reduced emissions, reduced parking demand and less traffic congestion, the risk of having a crash while cycling is typically higher than while travelling as a driver or passenger in a motor vehicle. There is also a perception that cycling is unsafe, particularly on busy roads. This paper presents research findings from two NZ Transport Agency (formerly Land Transport NZ) studies which focused on understanding and reducing the risk of cycle crashes. Progress on a third study on this topic is also presented. The first study focuses on the relationship between motor-vehicle flow, cycle flow and crashes. The key finding of this study is that as cycle volumes increase, the risk to the individual cyclist reduces, the 'safety in numbers' effect. The second study focuses on factors and interventions influencing cycle safety, other than cycle flows. This study involved the development of crash models for on-road cycle facilities at intersections and along road links in New Zealand, and looks at factors such as kerbside parking demand and the presence of a flush (painted) island. The final study, on the effectiveness of cycle facilities at intersections, looks at the relationship between the various cycle facilities installed at traffic signals and crash savings. Data on cycle facilities and other treatments, crash occurrence and traffic flows are being collected from around New Zealand and for a number of Australian states. Early results are presented.

For the description of road surface characteristics these are road evenness (IRI(100)), road texture and visual assessment of pavement condition given by the PCI-index, as well as the traffic load including the structure of the traffic flow. When making a decision about the reconstruction, together with already included parameters, the environmental noise estimation should also be taken into consideration. In doing so, environmental noise conditions would, without altering standard procedure, become another important factor in deciding about the reconstruction of the existing roads.

Identifying critical road segments and measuring system-wide robustness in transportation networks with isolating links: A link-based capacity-reduction approach	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Network-disruption; Network modeling; Network Robustness Index (NRI); Isolating links; Link capacity reduction	PERFORMANCE; EVENTS	A wide range of relatively short-term disruptive events such as partial flooding, visibility reductions, traction hazards due to weather, and pavement deterioration occur on transportation networks on a daily basis. Despite being relatively minor when compared to catastrophes, these events still have profound impacts on traffic flow. To date there has been very little distinction drawn between different types of network-disruption studies and how the methodological approaches used in those studies differ depending on the specific research objectives and on the disruption scenarios being modeled. In this paper, we advance a methodological approach that employs different link-based capacity-disruption values for identifying and ranking the most critical links and quantifying network robustness in a transportation network. We demonstrate how an ideal capacity-disruption range can be objectively determined for a particular network and introduce a scalable system-wide performance measure, called the Network Trip Robustness (NTR) that can be used to directly compare networks of different sizes, topologies, and connectivity levels. Our approach yields results that are independent of the degree of connectivity and can be used to evaluate robustness on networks with isolating links. We show that system-wide travel-times and the rank-ordering of the most critical links in a network can vary dramatically based on both the capacity-disruption level and on the overall connectivity of the network. We further show that the relationships between network robustness, the capacity-disruption level used for modeling, and network connectivity are non-linear and not necessarily intuitive. We discuss our findings with respect to Braess' Paradox. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Novak, D. C.] Univ Vermont, Sch Business Adm, Burlington, VT 05405 USA; [Sullivan, J.

Bayesian inference for network-based models with a linear inverse structure	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Estimation; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Measurement error; Origin-destination matrix; Statistical linear inverse problem; Traffic assignment	STOCHASTIC USER EQUILIBRIUM; ORIGIN-DESTINATION MATRICES; PATH FLOW ESTIMATOR; LINK COUNT DATA; TRIP MATRICES; DISTRIBUTIONS	Network-based transport models are used for a host of purposes, from estimation of travel demand through to traffic assignment and traffic flow prediction. Before any such model can be applied in practice we must estimate its parameters and also examine its adequacy. A variety of methods have been developed to do this, but they are typically quite specific to the particular model at hand. In this paper we show that it is possible to develop a unified approach by recognizing that a statistical linear inverse structure arises when attempting to perform inference for any network-based model. This common structure provides the building blocks for the development a coherent theory for Bayesian inference for these models, which has a number of advantages of over more ad hoc methods. While calculation of the Bayesian posterior will typically be intractable, our unified framework allows us to design a generic Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling from this distribution in practice. We illustrate the operation of this algorithm on a section of the road network in the English city of Leicester. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The utilized hierarchical structure consists of three layers: the estimation/prediction layer, the optimization layer and the direct control layer. The previously designed optimal control tool AMOC (Advanced Motorway Optimal Control) is incorporated in the second layer while the local feedback control strategy ALINEA is used in the third layer. Simulation results are presented for the Amsterdam ring-road. The proposed approach outperforms uncoordinated local ramp metering and its efficiency approaches the one obtained by an optimal open-loop solution. It is demonstrated that metering of all on-ramps, including freeway-to-freeway intersections, with sufficient ramp storage space leads to the optimal utilization of the available infrastructure.

J	Ng, M; Waller, ST				Ng, ManWo; Waller, S. Travis			A static network level model for the information propagation in vehicular ad hoc networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						V2V; VANET; Inter-vehicle communication; Information propagation; Resource allocation; Heuristics	VEHICLE; ISSUES	In this paper, we present a network level model to describe the information propagation in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). The approach utilizes an existing one-dimensional propagation model to evaluate information travel times on the individual arcs of the network. Traffic flow characteristics are evaluated by a static traffic assignment model. Upper and lower bounds are developed for the time of information propagation between two nodes in a network. We show that the bounds yield good (typically within 5%) estimates of the true time lag for the lower penetration rates (< 10%), which makes them particularly useful in the initial deployment stages of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. Furthermore, our lower bound reveals that - quite surprisingly - for sufficiently low penetration rates, more equipped vehicles on the road does not necessarily promote the fast propagation of information. As an application of the bounds, we formulate a resource allocation model in which communication devices can be installed along roads to promote wireless propagation. A set of efficient heuristic algorithms is developed to solve the resource allocation problem. Numerical results are given throughout. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this Letter, we study dynamics of traffic flow with real-time information. The influence of a feedback strategy named Corresponding Angle Feedback Strategy (CAFS) is introduced, based on a two-route scenario in which dynamic information can be generated and displayed on the board to guide road users to make a choice. Our model incorporates the effects of adaptability into the cellular automaton models of traffic flow and simulation results adopting this optimal information feedback strategy have demonstrated high efficiency in controlling spatial distribution of traffic patterns compared with the other three information feedback strategies, i.e., vehicle number and flux.

J	Zheng, XS; McConkie, GW				Zheng, Xianjun Sam; McConkie, George W.			Two visual systems in monitoring of dynamic traffic: Effects of visual disruption	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Driving; Traffic monitoring; Visual systems; Situation awareness; Visual disruption; Driving simulation	SITUATION AWARENESS; CHANGE BLINDNESS; SPATIAL MEMORY; ATTENTION; PERCEPTION; OBJECT; SCENES; TASK; SEE; PERFORMANCE	Studies from neurophysiology and neuropsychology provide support for two separate object- and location-based visual systems, ventral and dorsal. In the driving context, a study was conducted using a change detection paradigm to explore drivers' ability to monitor the dynamic traffic flow, and the effects of visual disruption on these two visual systems. While driving, a discrete change, such as vehicle location, color, or identity, was occasionally made in one of the vehicles on the road ahead of the driver. Experiment results show that without visual disruption, all changes were detected very well; yet, these equally perceivable changes were disrupted differently by a brief blank display (150 ms): the detection of location changes was especially reduced. The disruption effects were also bigger for the parked vehicle compared to the moving ones. The findings support the different roles for two visual systems in monitoring the dynamic traffic: the "where", dorsal system, tracks vehicle spatiotemporal information on perceptual level, encoding information in a coarse and transient manner; whereas the "what", ventral system, monitors vehicles' featural information, encoding information more accurately and robustly. Both systems work together contributing to the driver's situation awareness of traffic. Benefits and limitations of using the driving simulation are also discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we employ the model presented by Tang et al. [2009 Communications in Theoretical Physics 51 (1) 71] to further study the effects of the number of on-ramps on the stability of traffic flow on a ring road. The numerical results show that this model can reproduce some complex traffic phenomena resulting from multi on-ramps on the ring road and the effects of the number of on-ramps on traffic flow, but the phenomena and the effects are both related to the initial density of the main road.

We characterize the epigraph of the value function solving the HJ PDE as a capture basin of a target through an auxiliary dynamical system, called "characteristic system". The properties of capture basins enable us to define components as building blocks of the solution to the HJ PDE in the Barron/Jensen-Frankowska sense. These components can encode initial conditions, boundary conditions, and internal "boundary" conditions, which are the topic of this article. A generalized Lax-Hopf formula is derived, and enables us to formulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for a mixed initial and boundary conditions problem with multiple internal boundary conditions to be well posed. We illustrate the capabilities of the method with a data assimilation problem for reconstruction of highway traffic flow using Lagrangian measurements generated from Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) traffic data.

Dynamic Performance Simulation of Long-Span Bridge under Combined Loads of Stochastic Traffic and Wind	JOURNAL OF BRIDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Long-span bridge; Probabilistic traffic; Vehicle; Wind; Cellular automaton; Integrated approach; Equivalent dynamic; wheel load.	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM; VEHICLE; MODEL	Slender long-span bridges exhibit unique features which are not present in short and medium-span bridges such as higher traffic volume, simultaneous presence of multiple vehicles, and sensitivity to wind load. For typical buffeting studies of long-span bridges under wind turbulence, no traffic load was typically considered simultaneously with wind. Recent bridge/vehicle/wind interaction studies highlighted the importance of predicting the bridge dynamic behavior by considering the bridge, the actual traffic load, and wind as a whole coupled system. Existent studies of bridge/vehicle/wind interaction analysis, however, considered only one or several vehicles distributed in an assumed (usually uniform) pattern on the bridge. For long-span bridges which have a high probability of the presence of multiple vehicles including several heavy trucks at a time, such an assumption differs significantly from reality. A new "semideterministic" bridge dynamic analytical model is proposed which considers dynamic interactions between the bridge, wind, and stochastic "real" traffic by integrating the equivalent dynamic wheel load (EDWL) approach and the cellular automaton (CA) traffic flow simulation. As a result of adopting the new analytical model, the long-span bridge dynamic behavior can be statistically predicted with a more realistic and adaptive consideration of combined loads of traffic and wind. A prototype slender cable-stayed bridge is numerically studied with the proposed model. In addition to slender long-span bridges which are sensitive to wind, the proposed model also offers a general approach for other conventional long-span bridges as well as roadway pavements to achieve a more realistic understanding of the structural performance under probabilistic traffic and dynamic interactions.

Intelligent Traffic Light Flow Control System Using Wireless Sensors Networks	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						wireless sensor networks; intelligent traffic controller; traffic congestion; dynamic traffic adaptation; traffic flow control		Vehicular traffic is continuously increasing around the world, especially in large urban areas. The resulting congestion has become a major concern to transportation specialists and decision makers. The existing methods for traffic management, surveillance and control are not adequately efficient in terms of performance, cost, maintenance, and support. In this paper, the design of a system that utilizes and efficiently manages traffic light controllers is presented. In particular, we present an adaptive traffic control system based on a new traffic infrastructure using Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and using new techniques for controlling the traffic flow sequences. These techniques are dynamically adaptive to traffic conditions on both single and multiple intersections. A WSN is used as a tool to instrument and control traffic signals roadways, while an intelligent traffic controller is developed to control the operation of the traffic infrastructure supported by the WSN. The controller embodies traffic system communication algorithm (TSCA) and the traffic signals time manipulation algorithm (TSTMA). Both algorithms are able to provide the system with adaptive and efficient traffic estimation represented by the dynamic change in the traffic signals' flow sequence and traffic variation. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed scheme in solving traffic congestion in terms of the average waiting time and average queue length on the isolated (single) intersection and efficient global traffic flow control on multiple intersections. A test bed was also developed and deployed for real measurements. The paper concludes with some future highlights and useful remarks.

Road Traffic Congestion and Crash Severity: Econometric Analysis Using Ordered Response Models	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Traffic congestion; Traffic flow; Crash severity; Ordered response models; M25 motorway	INJURY SEVERITY; HIGHWAY HYPNOSIS; HYPOTHESIS; ACCIDENTS; SAFETY; RATES; FLOW	There is an ongoing debate among transport planners and safety policy makers as to whether there is any association between the level of traffic congestion and road safety. One can expect that the increased level of traffic congestion aids road safety and this is because average traffic speed is relatively low in a congested condition relative to an uncongested condition, which may result in less severe crashes. The relationship between congestion and safety may not be so straightforward, however, as there are a number of other factors such as traffic flow, driver characteristics, road geometry, and vehicle design affecting crash severity. Previous studies have employed count data models (either Poisson or negative binomials and their extensions) while developing a relationship between the frequency of traffic crashes and traffic flow or density (as a proxy for traffic congestion). The use of aggregated crash counts at a road segment level or at an area level with the proxy for congestion may obscure the actual relationship. The objective of this study is to explore the relationship between the severity of road crashes and the level of traffic congestion using disaggregated crash records and a measure of traffic congestion while controlling for other contributory factors. Ordered response models such as ordered logit models, heterogeneous choice models, and generalized ordered logit (partially constrained) models suitable for both ordinal dependent variables and disaggregate crash data are used. Data on crashes, traffic characteristics (e.g., congestion, flow, and speed), and road geometry (e.g., curvature and gradient) were collected from the M25 London orbital motorway between 2003 and 2006. Our results suggest that the level of traffic congestion does not affect the severity of road crashes on the M25 motorway. The impact of traffic flow on the severity of crashes, however, shows an interesting result. All other factors included in the models also provide results consistent with existing studies.

Incorporation of Lagrangian measurements in freeway traffic state estimation	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Lagrangian sensing; Traffic state estimation; GPS-enabled cell-phones; Probe data collection	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; CONSERVATION-LAWS; DENSITY; ASSIMILATION; WAVES	Cell-phones equipped with a global positioning system (GPS) provide new opportunities for location-based services and traffic estimation. When traveling on-board vehicles, these phones can be used to accurately provide position and velocity of the vehicle as probe traffic sensors. This article presents a new technique to incorporate mobile probe measurements into highway traffic flow models, and compares it to a Kalman filtering approach. These two techniques are both used to reconstruct traffic density. The first technique modifies the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards partial differential equation (PDE) to incorporate a correction term which reduces the discrepancy between the measurements (from the probe vehicles) and the estimated state (from the model). This technique, called Newtonian relaxation, "nudges" the model to the measurements. The second technique is based on Kalman filtering and the framework of hybrid systems, which implements an observer equation into a linearized flow model. Both techniques assume the knowledge of the fundamental diagram and the conditions at both boundaries of the section of interest. The techniques are designed in a way in which does not require the knowledge of on- and off-ramp detector counts, which in practice are rarely available. The differences between both techniques are assessed in the context of the Next Generation Simulation program (NGSIM), which is used as a benchmark data set to compare both methods. They are finally tested with data from the Mobile Century experiment obtained from 100 Nokia N95 mobile phones on I-880 in California on February 8, 2008. The results are promising, showing that the proposed methods successfully incorporate the GPS data in the estimation of traffic. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A quantitative model of the VSL impact is proposed that allows for VSL to be incorporated in a macroscopic second-order traffic flow model as an additional control component. The integrated motorway network traffic control problem involving ramp metering and VSL control measures is formulated as a constrained discrete-time optimal control problem and is solved efficiently even for large-scale networks by a suitable feasible direction algorithm. An illustrative example of a hypothetical motorway stretch is investigated under different control scenarios, and it is shown that traffic flow efficiency can be substantially improved when VSL control measures are used, particularly in integration with coordinated ramp metering.

J	Romero, LM; Benitez, FG				Romero, Luis M.; Benitez, Francisco G.			Traffic flow continuum modeling by hypersingular boundary integral equations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						traffic flow; continuum theory; two-dimensional modeling	CONDUCTION-CONVECTION; APPROXIMATION; ASSIGNMENT; NETWORK	The quantity of data necessary in order to study traffic in dense urban areas through a traffic network, and the large volume of information that is provided as a result, causes managerial difficulties for the said model. A study of this kind is expensive and complex, with many sources of error connected to each step carried out. A simplification like the continuous medium is a reasonable approximation and, for certain dimensions of the actual problem, may be an alternative to be kept in mind. The hypotheses of the continuous model introduce errors comparable to those associated with geometric inaccuracies in the transport network, with the grouping of hundreds of streets in one same type of link and therefore having the same functional characteristics, with the centralization of all journey departure points and destinations in discrete centroids and with the uncertainty produced by a huge origin/destination matrix that is quickly phased out, etc. In the course of this work, a new model for characterizing traffic in dense network cities as a continuous medium, the diffusion-advection model, is put forward. The model is approached by means of the boundary element method, which has the fundamental characteristic of only requiring the contour of the problem to be discretized, thereby reducing the complexity and need for information into one order versus other more widespread methods, such as finite differences and the finite element method. On the other hand, the boundary elements method tends to give a more complex mathematical formulation.

The simulation results show that the boundary condition, bottlenecks and the self-organization affect the traffic flow at the roundabout crossing. Because of the effect of bottlenecks, jams easily appear on the inner roundabout lane. To improve the capacity of the roundabout system, proper values of the enter probability alpha and the out probability beta can be chosen.

Based on thorough research of traffic flow and cellular automata theory, it calibrates the cellular length and the running speed. Also, a cellular automata model for mixed traffic flow on a two-lane system under a periodic boundary condition is presented herewith, which also takes into consideration the harbour-shaped transit stop as well. By means of computer simulation, the article also studies the effects of bus parking time on the traffic volume, the transit speed and the fast lane speed at the same time. The results demonstrate that, with the increase of the bus parking time, the traffic volume of the transit stop and the transit speed decrease while the fast lane speed increases. This result could help calculate the transit delay correctly and make arrangements for transit routes reasonably and scientifically.

Applying the Hopf theorem, an analytical Hopf bifurcation calculation is performed and the critical road length is determined for arbitrary numbers of vehicles. It is found that the Hopf bifurcation critical points locate on the boundary of the linear instability region. Crossing the boundary, the uniform traffic flow loses linear stability via Hopf bifurcation and the oscillations appear.

J	Lindarte, RJP				Pena Lindarte, Ricardo Jose			Analysing adjustment factors for using lanes at traffic-light-controlled intersections in Bogota, Colombia	INGENIERIA E INVESTIGACION			Spanish	Article						traffic-light-controlled intersection; saturation flow; service capacity and level		This article was focused on analysing the lane use adjustment factor (f(w)) forming one of the eleven adjustment factors proposed in the current calculation methodology contained in the 2000 version of the Transportation Research Board's (TRB) Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) for analysing traffic-light-controlled intersection capacity in terms of saturation intensity. A methodology was established when analysing the f(w) factor that considered operational conditions regarding traffic-light-controlled intersections in Bogota. Road traffic flows were analysed, including characterising road traffic based on statistical sampling, field data collection and analysis. The project proposed equations allowing reference values to be gathered for determining adjustment factors regarding lane use on roads in Bogota in relation to existing access typologies and road traffic volume for analysing traffic-light-controlled intersections. For example, in the specific case of roads having direct double-lane access (2CCD), the basic equation was determined to be y=-3,03E-08X(2)+3,44E-05X+0,888988, having a 1.0 coefficient of correlation. The dependent variable y referred to the f(w) factor and the independent variable X was the volume of road traffic in mixed vehicles/hour. This equation was considered to be statistically relevant. A comparative analysis of the lane use adjustment factors estimated in the project is also presented and compared to the values recommended by the US Highway Capacity Manual. The project's conclusions and recommenddations were thus sustained, validating the recommended factors summarised by the HCM and recommending that the results obtained from the project should be used in traffic-light-controlled design and planning projects.

In this paper we propose a cellular automata model of the traffic on a single lane highway which considers the drivers' inertial behavior under different driving circumstances. Simulation results show that our model can capture such important features of the traffic as jam formation, phase transition and metastable states. Some of other models, like the slow-to-start model, can be derived from our model.

This paper presents the results of a study to measure and evaluate the speed and flow characteristics of reverse-flow traffic streams by comparing them under various operating conditions and locations. It was found that, contrary to some opinions, the flow characteristics of reverse-flowing lanes were generally similar to normally flowing lanes under a variety of traffic volume, time-of-day, location, and type-of-use conditions The study also revealed that drivers will readily use reversible lanes without diminished operating speeds, particularly as volumes increase Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd	[Wolshon, Brian] Louisiana State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Lambert, Laurence] ABMB Engineers Inc, Baton Rouge, LA 70801 USA	Wolshon, B (corresponding author), Louisiana State Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA.

J	Lo, SC; Hsu, CH				Lo, Shih-Ching; Hsu, Chia-Hung			Cellular automata simulation for mixed manual and automated control traffic	MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING			English	Article						Cellular automata; Traffic flow; Advanced vehicle control and safety systems; Multi-class user traffic	FLOW; MODEL; HIGHWAY; DESIGN; CARS	Complex traffic systems seem to be simulated successfully by cellular automaton (CA) models today. Various models are developed in efforts to understand single-lane traffic, multilane traffic, lane-changing behavior and network traffic flow. In this study, four cellular automata (CA) rules for advanced vehicle control and safety systems (AVCSS) are proposed and simulated. The major difference among the rules is the different settings of the gap, which is defined to be the distance between two successive vehicles. The gap of each rule is given depending upon the speed of vehicles. According to the results, CA rules with AVCSS (the H(0), H(1), H(2) and H(3) models) lead to a more stable traffic flow than rules without AVCSS. Also, the average flow and speed for CA rules with AVCSS are larger than the average flow and speed for rules without AVCSS. However, the average speeds of the H(1) and H(2) models fluctuate greatly, which is considered unsafe and unreliable, in a congested regime. The results from the H(0) and H(3) rules are more stable than the results from the H(1) and H(2) models. The H(3) rule keeps a larger gap between two successive vehicles; therefore, the H(3) rule is considered the best design of the four AVCSS CA rules. If a combinative rule is considered, the envelope of the speeddensity curves of the four models might provide an optimal design, presenting a larger speed and flow than the H(3) model. Therefore, an efficient design of AVCSS might be obtained by CA simulation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Impact of traffic oscillations on freeway crash occurrences	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Traffic oscillations; Stop-and-go driving; Crash; Matched case-control design; Conditional logistic regression	LUNG CANCER; CONGESTION; SAFETY; COORDINATION	Traffic oscillations are typical features of congested traffic flow that are characterized by recurring decelerations followed by accelerations (stop-and-go driving). The negative environmental impacts of these oscillations are widely accepted, but their impact on traffic safety has been debated. This paper describes the impact of freeway traffic oscillations on traffic safety. This study employs a matched case-control design using high-resolution traffic and crash data from a freeway segment. Traffic conditions prior to each crash were taken as cases, while traffic conditions during the same periods on days without crashes were taken as controls. These were also matched by presence of congestion, geometry and weather. A total of 82 cases and about 80,000 candidate controls were extracted from more than three years of data from 2004 to 2007. Conditional logistic regression models were developed based on the case-control samples. To verify consistency in the results, 20 different sets of controls were randomly extracted from the candidate pool for varying control-case ratios. The results reveal that the standard deviation of speed (thus, oscillations) is a significant variable, with an average odds ratio of about 1.08. This implies that the likelihood of a (rear-end) crash increases by about 8% with an additional unit increase in the standard deviation of speed. The average traffic states prior to crashes were less significant than the speed variations in congestion. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Vehicle-time headway data are obtained from two different cities: four signalized intersections and five mid-block traffic signals in Izmir and four signalized intersections in Denizli. The current methods for describing the proportion of free vehicles on a road link are investigated and an exponential relationship is suggested for modeling the proportion of free vehicles. The results are considered with respect to both the lane type and the traffic volume. The characteristics of the traffic flow and proportion of free vehicles were found to be dependent on the lane type.	[Caliskanelli, S.

J	Chen, S; Wang, W; van Zuylen, H				Chen, Shuyan; Wang, Wei; van Zuylen, Henk			A comparison of outlier detection algorithms for ITS data	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Outlier detection; Traffic data; Statistics-based; Distance-based; Density-based		In order to improve the veracity and reliability of a traffic model built, or to extract important and valuable information from collected traffic data. the technique of outlier mining has been introduced into the traffic engineering domain for detecting and analyzing the outliers in traffic data sets. Three typical outlier algorithms, respectively the statistics-based approach, the distance-based approach, and the density-based local Outlier approach. are described with respect to the principle, the characteristics and the time complexity of the algorithms. A comparison among the three algorithms is made through application to intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Two traffic data sets with different dimensions have been used in our experiments carried Out. one is travel time data, and the other is traffic flow data. We conducted a number of experiments to recognize outliers hidden in the data sets before building the travel time prediction model and the traffic flow foundation diagram. In addition, some artificial generated outliers are introduced into the traffic flow data to see flow well the different algorithms detect them. Three strategies-based on ensemble learning, partition and average LOF have been proposed to develop a better outlier recognizer The experimental results reveal that these methods Of Outlier mining are feasible and valid to detect outliers in traffic data sets. and have a good potential for use in the domain of traffic engineering. The comparison and analysis presented in this paper are expected to provide some insights to practitioners who plan to use outlier mining for ITS data.

Bagher Naghibi			A Novel Fuzzy Model and Control of Single Intersection at Urban Traffic Network	IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article						Fuzzy model; state-space equations; traffic flow; fuzzy controller	REAL-TIME	This paper presents a novel fuzzy model and a fuzzy logic controller for an isolated signalized intersection. The controller controls the traffic light timings and phase sequence to ensure smooth flow of traffic with minimal waiting time and length of queue. Usually fuzzy traffic controllers are optimized to maximize traffic flows/minimize traffic waiting time under typical traffic conditions. Consequentially, these are not the optimal traffic controllers under exceptional traffic cases such as roadblocks and road accidents. We apply state-space equations to formulate the average waiting time vehicles in traffic network at fixed time control. also, We propose a novel fuzzy model and new fuzzy traffic controller that can optimally control traffic flows under both normal and exceptional traffic conditions. Results show that the performance of the proposed traffic controller at novel fuzzy model is better that of conventional fuzzy traffic controllers under normal and abnormal traffic conditions.

J	Kesting, A; Treiber, M; Helbing, D				Kesting, Arne; Treiber, Martin; Helbing, Dirk			Connectivity Statistics of Store-and-Forward Intervehicle Communication	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Connectivity; intervehicle communication (IVC); traffic simulation; vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs)	ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; VEHICLE; DISSEMINATION; PROPAGATION; DESIGN	Intervehicle communication (IVC) enables vehicles to exchange messages within a limited broadcast range and thus self-organize into dynamical vehicular ad hoc networks. For the foreseeable future, however, a direct connectivity between equipped vehicles in one direction is rarely possible. We therefore investigate an alternative mode in which messages are stored by relay vehicles traveling in the opposite direction and forwarded to vehicles in the original direction at a later time. The wireless communication consists of two "transversal" message hops across driving directions. Since direct connectivity for transversal hops and a successful message transmission to vehicles in the destination region are only a matter of time, the quality of this IVC strategy can be described in terms of the distribution function for the total transmission time. Assuming a Poissonian distance distribution between equipped vehicles, we derive analytical probability distributions for message transmission times and related propagation speeds for a deterministic and a stochastic model of the maximum range of direct communication. By means of integrated microscopic simulations of communication and bidirectional traffic flows, we validated the theoretical expectation for multilane roadways. We found little deviation of the analytical result for multilane scenarios but significant deviations for a single lane. This can be explained by vehicle platooning. We demonstrate the efficiency of the transverse hopping mechanism for a congestion-warning application in a microscopic traffic-simulation scenario. Messages are created on an event-driven basis by equipped vehicles getting into and out of a traffic jam. This application is operative for penetration levels as low as 1%.

Self-organising congestion evasion strategies using ant-based pheromones	IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	15th World Congress on Intelligent Transport Systems	NOV 15-20, 2008	New York, NY				SIMULATION	Social insects perform complex, self-organising tasks within a collective by using pheromone-based indirect communication (swarm intelligence). Inspired by these potentials of nature, this concept is possibly also a paradigm for controlling traffic, for collectively recognising, disintegrating and avoiding traffic congestion without central control instances. Vehicles equipped with location and communication technology act like individual insects and virtually deposit digital pheromones on the road indicating the intense of traffic and enabling other vehicles to indirectly benefit from the trail. This study investigates a technical implementation of swarm intelligence applied to the traffic system and evaluates different evasion strategies for vehicles. Using a micro-simulation environment capable of simulating real city networks, various traffic experiments empirically prove the hypothesis of a self-organising effect concerning the traffic flow in pheromone-based systems.

When each road is a double lane, the model only exists in three conflict points among three directions of flows. We introduce three-phase traffic signal and two types of signal controlling strategies, i.e. fixed signal phase order as well as adaptive signal phase order strategy, to control the traffic flow at the intersection. The phase diagram, the capacity and the average travel time of the system are investigated and compared under both strategies.

J	Gruenewald, PJ; Johnson, FW				Gruenewald, Paul J.; Johnson, Fred W.			Drinking, Driving, and Crashing: A Traffic-Flow Model of Alcohol-Related Motor Vehicle Accidents	JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS			English	Article							OUTLET DENSITY; AVAILABILITY; INJURY; CONSUMPTION; LOCATIONS; SALES	Objective: This study examined the influence of on-premise alcohol-outlet densities and of drinking-driver densities on rates of alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes. A traffic-flow model is developed to represent geographic relationships between residential locations of drinking drivers, alcohol outlets, and alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes. Method: Cross-sectional and time-series cross-sectional spatial analyses were performed using data collected from 144 geographic units over 4 years. Data were obtained from archival and survey sources in six communities. Archival data were obtained within community areas and measured activities of either the resident population or persons visiting these communities. These data included local and highway traffic flow, locations of alcohol outlets, population density, network density of the local roadway system, and single-vehicle nighttime (SVN) crashes. Telephone-survey data obtained from residents of the communities were used to estimate the size of the resident drinking and driving population. Results: Cross-sectional analyses showed that effects relating on-premise densities to alcohol-related crashes were moderated by highway traffic flow. Depending on levels of highway traffic flow, 10% greater densities were related to 0% to 150% greater rates of SVN crashes. Time-series cross-sectional analyses showed that changes in the population pool of drinking drivers and on-premise densities interacted to increase SVN crash rates. Conclusions: A simple traffic-flow model can assess the effects of on-premise alcohol-outlet densities and of drinking-driver densities as they vary across communities to produce alcohol-related crashes. Analyses based on these models can usefully guide policy decisions on the siting of on-premise alcohol outlets. (J Stud.

Work zone impact on safety and mobility creates a strong need to alleviate work zone congestion and protect road users and workers, which requires a sufficient understanding of work zone impact on traffic flow. Previous studies and field observations demonstrated the importance of considering diversion phenomena when performing work zone impact analysis. To overcome the limitations of deterministic queuing approaches applied in most work zone impact analysis tools, an interactive process combining microsimulation and logistic regression was developed to imitate diversion behavior dynamically in the upstream of work zones with a number of entrance and exit ramps. Specifically, the logistic regression model based on the field observations was incorporated into a well-calibrated VISSIM model to simulate traffic flow in work zones with diversion behavior. The integration of the two models was achieved via the development of diversion calculation module using a COM interface provided by VISSIM. The comparison between simulated results and field observations suggested that the diversion calculation module using logistic regression can simulate the queue propagation process due to lane closure in an efficient and effective manner. It was demonstrated that the interactive process can improve work zone impact analysis by using real-time traffic feedback information to emulate the diversion phenomenon upstream of work zones.

Microsimulation Study of the Effect of Exclusive Bus Lanes on Heterogeneous Traffic Flow	JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article								This paper is concerned with modification and validation of a recently developed microsimulation model of heterogeneous traffic flow and application of the model to study the impact of provision of reserved bus lanes on urban roads. The impact of introduction of an exclusive bus lane is measured in terms of reduction in speed of other categories of motor vehicles, due to the consequent reduction in road space, over a wide range of traffic volume. The main finding of this paper is that if an exclusive bus lane is provided under highly heterogeneous traffic conditions (prevailing in Indian cities), then the maximum permissible volume to capacity ratio that will ensure a level of service of C for the traffic stream comprising all the motor vehicles, except the buses, in a typical eight lane divided urban road (14.5-m-wide road space per direction) is about 0.62. Through this study, a framework for justification of providing exclusive bus lane has also been defined.	[Arasan, V.

J	Mazloumi, E; Moridpour, S; Mohsenian, H				Mazloumi, Ehsan; Moridpour, Sara; Mohsenian, Hassan			Delay Function for Signalized Intersections in Traffic Assignment Models	JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article								The consideration of delay at signalized intersections improves the accuracy of equilibrium flows obtained from traffic assignment models. This delay depends not only on physical specifications of the intersection, intersection signal timing, and traffic volume and its composition but on drivers' behavior and specific traffic culture in each country. This paper proposes a delay function for traffic assignment models, which considers the special drivers' behavior in Iran. Unlike the existing models such as the Highway Capacity Manual model, the proposed delay function has modest data requirements on intersection characteristics, and this ensures the easy use of this function in a real traffic assignment model. To evaluate the proposed function in a real network, the traffic assignment model of the city of Mashhad, Iran is used. In two different scenarios, the equilibrium flows obtained when the proposed function is applied and those obtained when a simple uniform delay function is used are compared to the observed traffic flows. In a comparative sense, the results show the better performance of the proposed function in estimating the equilibrium flows.

J	Chou, CC				Chou, Chien-Chang			Application of FMCDM model to selecting the hub location in the marine transportation: A case study in southeastern Asia	MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING			English	Article						Hub port; Location selection; Fuzzy sets; Multiple criteria decision making; Container transshipment	MULTICRITERIA DECISION-MAKING; CANONICAL REPRESENTATION; MULTIPLICATION OPERATION; FUZZY NUMBERS; PORT CHOICE; RANKING	Hub location selection problems have become one of the most popular and important issues not only in the truck transportation and the air transportation, but also in the marine transportation. The main focus of this paper is on container transshipment hub locations in southeastern Asia. Transshipment is the fastest growing segment of the containerport market, resulting in significant scope to develop new transshipment terminal capacity to cater for future expected traffic flows. A shipping carrier not only calculates transport distances and operation costs, but also evaluates some qualitative conditions for existing hub locations and then selects an optimal container transshipment hub location in the region. In this paper, a fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making (FMCDM) model is proposed for evaluating and selecting the container transshipment hub port. Finally, the utilization of the proposed FMCDM model is demonstrated with a case study of hub locations in southeastern Asia. The results show that the FMCDM model proposed in this paper can be used to explain the evaluation and decision-making procedures of hub location selection well. In addition, the preferences are calculated for existing hub locations and these are then compared with a new proposed container transshipment hub location in the region, in this instance the Port of Shanghai. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is performed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Probst, W				Probst, Wolfgang			Prediction of sound radiated from tunnel openings	NOISE CONTROL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article								Road or railway tunnels are taken into account in noise prediction programs with the traffic flow ending at the tunnel mouth. The sound radiated from inside the tunnel through the tunnel mouth into the environment is calculated using an additional point or area source at the position of the tunnel opening. Some investigations have been published where the source strength of the radiating tunnel mouth has been calculated from analytically derived propagation relations inside the tunnel. In the meantime sound propagation inside rooms can be modelled more precisely even for complex environments, where the basic algorithms have been selected and improved based on measurements in more than 150 rooms and halls. These techniques have been standardized and in the meantime after about 8 years of experience with the application of these strategies they form an experimentally well established and computer based method that can be used to solve many of these special problems. The procedure is used as a part of an integral approach to calculate the noise radiated from tunnel openings. It can be used for different and even complex configurations and may help to integrate this very special noise source in environmental modelling for noise calculation.

In this Letter, we study dynamics of traffic flow with real-time information. And the influence of a feedback strategy named Weighted Congestion Coefficient Feedback Strategy (WCCFS) is introduced, based on a two-route scenario in which dynamic information can be generated and displayed on the board to guide road users to make a choice. Our model incorporates the effects of adaptability into the cellular automaton models of traffic flow and simulation results adopting this optimal information feedback strategy have demonstrated high efficiency in controlling spatial distribution of traffic patterns compared with the other three information feedback strategies, i.e., vehicle number and flux.

J	He, SY; Guan, W; Song, LY				He, Shuyan; Guan, Wei; Song, Liying			Explaining traffic patterns at on-ramp vicinity by a driver perception model in the framework of three-phase traffic theory	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow model; Driving behavior; Driver perception; Numerical simulation; Urban freeway	FLOW; STATES	In traffic system, driving behaviors change with the surrounding traffic perceived by drivers, resulting in the complex spatio-temporal traffic patterns. Accordingly, ill the majority of traffic models, vehicle accelerations are described by dynamic equations based on driving behavior, system dynamics and some underlying steady-state velocity-gap (bumper-to-bumper spacing) relation in order to guarantee the realistic human behavior. This paper proposes a deterministic car-following model based on a multi-branch fundamental diagram with each branch representing a particular category of driving style. Furthermore, an additional dynamic perception equation is introduced to reflect the driving style adaptation in response to the change in surrounding traffic situations. With simulation based on the proposed "driver perception model" (DP model), empirical findings of traffic breakdown and observed spatio-temporal patterns at on-ramp vicinity are reproduced. Furthermore, comparison results show the consistency between numerical simulation and the real traffic data of Beijing urban freeway. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hayakawa, Y				Hayakawa, Y.			Spatiotemporal dynamics of skeins of wild geese	EPL			English	Article							TRAFFIC CONGESTION; BEHAVIOR; FLOCKS; BIRDS; MODEL	We performed a spatiotemporal analysis of a one-dimensional array of airborne geese. The one-dimensional structure of individuals exhibits large fluctuations with backward propagation. In field measurements, we measured properties such as the phase velocity, the dispersion relation, and effective interactions. We also proposed a simplified model for nonlinear wave propagation, which is identical to that for highway traffic flow. Our results strongly imply that fluctuations in the array originate from the excitation of collective modes in its intrinsic dynamics.

In this paper, the use of the toll plaza queuing model SHAKER is calibrated to replicate real life toll facility traffic conditions. SHAKER is a deterministic queuing model based on classical physics equations that determines a plaza's maximum hourly throughput by assigning vehicles to lanes based on queuing conditions. An extensive field study on the Florida's Turnpike Enterprise network is conducted to determine the parameters affecting toll lane capacities. Data including traffic characteristics, vehicle characteristics, and toll plaza characteristics was collected and extracted at different toll locations, configurations, and pricing. From this data, periods of constant queuing were pinpointed and from those periods, factors such as demand, throughput, service time, etc., were extracted. Using the extracted parameters, SHAKER was then calibrated and validated to estimate the capacity of four different toll plazas along the Florida Turnpike Network.

The study elaborates the meteorologically induced effects on the transport and dispersion of air pollutants (NOx) and the propagation of sound waves from the motorway in the valley towards two receptor/receiver sites, one at the valley bottom, the other one at an elevated slope position. Due to complex transmission effects only a small portion of the observed variations in the air and noise pollution at the two sites can be explained by the varying emission at the motorway. With the help of simple models it is shown that by adding merely one or two meteorological parameters a substantially larger portion of the variation can be explained. The vertical temperature gradient turned out to be the meteorological key parameter. It controls the mixing volume (confined by the valley sides and the mixing-layer top) and the sound wave refraction which strongly determine air pollution and noise level, respectively.

We found that the probability density function calculated from the time series of variation of velocity is transformed irreversibly in the critical region, where a Gaussian distribution changes into a Levy stable symmetrical distribution. The power-law tail in the Levy distribution indicated that the time series of velocity variation exhibits the nature of the critical fluctuations generally observed in phase transitions driven far from equilibrium. Furthermore, single-vehicle data enabled us to calculate the time evolution of the local flux-density relation, which suggested that the vehicular traffic system spontaneously approaches a delicate balance between metastable states and congested-flow states. The nature of fluctuations enables us to understand mechanisms behind the spontaneous decay of the metastable branch at the phase transition. The power-law tail in the probability density function suggests that dynamical processes of vehicular traffic in the critical region are related to a time-discrete stochastic process driven by random amplification with additive external noise.

The source term represents the net inflow from ramps, postulated here as a location-dependent function of the demand for entering and exiting the corridor. Demands are assumed to be time-independent, which is appropriate for understanding the onset of congestion. Numerical and analytical results reveal the existence of four well-defined regions in time-space, two of which are transient. The conditions for the existence of congestion both in the freeway and in the on-ramps are identified, as well as the set of on-ramps that are most likely to become active bottlenecks. The results in this paper help explain the stochastic nature of bottleneck activation, and can be applied to devise effective system-wide ramp metering strategies that would prevent excessively long on-ramp queues.

With the emergence of wireless communication technology, vehicle operation can now incorporate for the first time ever beside the local driver-vehicle interaction also more significant information obtained from cars in the surrounding. With this foundation it would be possible to build collectively operating driver assistance systems, negotiating the interests of all road participants in a certain area with the final goal to improve global parameters such as road throughput or traffic fluidity, also having an effect on the individual car (driver), e. g. increased travel speed, less congestions, or a reduced level of cognitive load. The question addressed with this paper is whether or not the vehicle speed can be sustained while merging onto a motorway, leading to a more harmonious integration of the merging cars into the flowing traffic on the main road. To achieve this we propose the application of ambient intelligence (AmI) technology operating on the collective behavior of all cars in the periphery of the entrance ramp. To prove our hypothesis we applied the AmI technology to a data driven, true to scale simulation model of the Madrid motorway M30, one of the most busiest roads in Spain. The comparison of simulation runs with high volume of traffic showed that technology assistance could help to increase road throughput and minimize the variance of traffic flow, but on the other side demands solutions for one of the bigger problems of data driven simulation missing or noisy data compromising simulation results.

These differences may be caused by a different effect of external circumstances on mental workload of drivers. This effect may especially play a considerable role in case of driving under adverse conditions (e.g. evacuations, adverse weather conditions, road works and incidents on the freeway). These adverse conditions have shown to have a substantial impact on traffic flow operations. In this regard a driving simulator experiment was performed as to what extent an incident in the other driving lane influences physiological indicators as well as subjective estimates of mental workload as well as longitudinal driving behavior. Also was investigated whether current car-following models, represented by the Intelligent Driver Model and the Helly model, adequately incorporate longitudinal driving behavior under these circumstances using a calibration approach for joint estimation. From the results followed that perception of incidents in the other driving lane lead to significant changes in physiological indicators of mental workload as well as in longitudinal driving behavior. Through the estimation approach was indicated that the Intelligent Driver Model as well as the Helly model how show substantial changes in parameter values as well as that these models less adequately incorporate longitudinal driving behavior in case of incidents in the other driving lane.

Many scholars try to find new methods to fit the reality of road network. In this paper, a new method is proposed, which evaluates road network reliability based on urban resident travel behavior characteristics modeling. Based on GIS (Geographic Information System) traffic analysis method, and employed FCD (floating car data) of taxi GPS in Shenzhen city as survey sample, resident travel behavior characteristics are modeled, then DNC (dynamic nonlinear coefficient) loaded with traffic flow can also be calculated, it is an improvement to evaluate road network reliability relative to traditional method.

Due to the extremely complexity of vehicular traffic, efficient models should be constructed to do accurate simulation and prediction of real traffic, such as locally kernel models. However, locally kernel regression fails when the traffic data points are sparse, and the data distribution should be considered seriously. Moreover, the spatiotemporal features of real traffic make pure locally kernel regression inapplicable. This paper proposes a locally kernel regression mechanism adapting with data distribution for the prediction of traffic flow. This mechanism is also explained by Three-Phase Traffic Theory. Experimental studies show the feasibility and efficiency of our approach.

With the aid of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, trucks are electronically coupled keeping very short gaps (approx. 10 meters) to form truck platoons on motorways. This contributes to a couple of advantages, such as a reduction of the inter-vehicle distance, which leads to an improved vehicle occupancy and gained road space, an optimization of traffic flow, the reduction of fuel consumption advantaged by slipstream driving, a relief for professional drivers and finally an increase in safety due to the longitudinal and lateral guidance. In this paper, a brief introduction into these truck platoons is given, which have been realized within the project KONVOI. The paper focuses on the method of the Value Oriented Cost-Effectiveness Estimation. This method had been developed by the Institute for Management Cybernetics (IfU) at RWTH Aachen University and combines the classical analysis of investment in monetary terms with relevant non-monetary variable or the socalled soft factors in the profitability analysis. The approach of the Value Oriented Cost-Effectiveness Estimation will be presented in this paper. Finally the method of the Value Oriented Cost-Effectiveness Estimation will be applied in excerpts on electronically coupled trucks on German motorways.

The problem domain, a freeway integration control application considers the efficiency and equity of system, is formulated as a distributed reinforcement learning problem. The Gini coefficient is adopted in this study as an indicator of equity. The DRL approach was implemented via a multi-agent control architecture where the decision agent was assigned to each of the on-ramp or VMS. The return of each agent is simultaneously updating a single shared policy. The control strategy's effect is demonstrated through its application to the simple freeway network. Analyses of simulation results using this approach show the equity of the system have a significant improvement over traditional control, especially for the case of large traffic demand. Using the DRL approach, the Gini coefficient of the network has been reduced by 28.99% compared to traditional method.

The ability for vehicles to communicate is a promising way to alleviate traffic accidents by reducing the response time associated with human reaction to nearby drivers. In addition the limitations of standard driving can be overcome by providing drivers with instantaneous information about complications up ahead. Shockwaves, induced by vehicle speed differentials, are a typical mobility pattern that occurs with the formation and propagation of vehicle queues. These induce sudden braking and increase the occurrence of traffic incidents. In this paper, we investigate safety applications in highways with shockwave mobility and different lane configurations in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET). We evaluate the performance of multi-hop broadcast communication using the ns-2 simulator with vehicles following a shockwave mobility pattern in fully-connected traffic streams. We propose mechanism to improve broadcast reliability using dynamic transmission range that leverages our understanding of fundamental traffic flow relationships.

The traffic flow mathematical model is formulated based on optimal velocity model and safe lane-changing rules for two-lane traffic flow are given. The typical sketch of work zone is plotted and four posted speed limit signs are set in the work zone to control the traffic flow speed for fear of accident and congestion. Simulations are carried out to examine the lane-changing behavior and the influence on traffic flow in work zone with different number of the speed limit signs under periodic boundary conditions. The simulations show that lane-changing may lead to the congestion or collision while the more speed limit signs may reduce the risk of rear-end collision and the occurrence of the congestion in work zone.

This paper introduces the basic theory and features of General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) and its advantages. A forecasting model based on GRNN is built for short-term traffic flow time series at urban road section in 10-minutes interval. In order to get ideal forecasting results, the search method is used to obtain the number of input neurons and the value of smooth factor. When the number of input neuron and training samples are defined, the model can forecast the next 10-minutes traffic flow using the method of dynamic learning and single-step forecasting. Compared with the forecasting results of the traditional BP neural network (BPNN) which adopts error back-propagation learning method, this model is more accurate, and more suitable for short-term traffic flow forecasting.

Traffic flow is unbalanced on time and space. If the measure of traffic control is not right, the traffic is affected badly. In this paper, a bi-level programming model about traffic control measure is brought forward. In upper level, providing key member with high transportation service is first thought over, and then the sum of travel delay of the masses and cost of traffic control is minimized. In lower level, evacuation delay of activities personnel is designed to ensure no traffic jam emerged. Rough set genetic algorithm is employed to solving bi-level programming problem in the paper, and an example of traffic control to massive activity verifies the validity of the technique.

A variety of methods and techniques have been developed to forecast traffic flow. The traffic flow forecasting model based on neural network has been applied widely in ITS because of its high forecasting accuracy and self-learning ability. But the problems of neural network such as the difficult of designing optimal structure and weak global searching ability limit seriously its applications. So the traffic flow forecasting based on ant colony neural network is proposed. The ant colony algorithm, which has a powerful global searching ability, is applied to solve the problem of tuning both network structure and parameters of a feedforward neural network. First, the ant colony neural network algorithm is introduced in detail. Then, the presented approach is effectively applied to solve traffic flow forecasting. The simulation experiments show that the presented traffic flow forecasting based on ant colony neural network can simplify the structure of neural network greatly and improve the forecasting accuracy significantly.

For macroscopic traffic flow models several estimation methods have been investigated, including extended and unscented Kalman filters and particle filters. In this paper we propose a fuzzy observer for the continuous time version of the macroscopic traffic flow model METANET. In order to design the observer, we first derive a dynamic Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model that exactly represents the traffic model of a segment of a highway stretch. The fuzzy observer is designed based on the fuzzy model and applied to the traffic model. The simulation results are promising for the future development of fuzzy observers for a highway stretch or a whole traffic network.

Recently, it has been integrated into some commercial software, such as VISSIM and PARAMICS. In this study, we first compared the difference of LSA and lane changing algorithms in CORridor SIMulation theoretically, and then calculated three LSA scenarios based on the simulated data from CORSIM. It is found the difference between these two models is obvious, therefore analysis on the advantages and shortcomings of these two models are performed.

Red Light-Green Light: Using a Model-Eliciting Activity in a Logic Design Course	2010 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE)	Frontiers in Education Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	40th Annual Frontiers in Education Conference	OCT 27-30, 2010	Arlington, VA	IEEE		logic design; model-eliciting activities; problem solving; transportation design		This paper outlines the use of a Model-Eliciting Activity (MEA) in a logic design course that introduces students to design through an authentic client-driven problem. The MEA involved creating a model of a traffic signal controller for an intersection of a U. S. highway and a county road near the university. Students were given background information on traffic signal controllers and actual traffic flow data for the intersection and were then asked to analyze the data, transform the problem to the digital design space, and create a state diagram for a traffic signal controller that would be effective for the given intersection. The results using the MEA in the course were very encouraging. All seven groups in the class created valid traffic signal controller state diagrams and six of the seven groups were able to create working implementations in a programmable logic device. In addition, on the course's final exam, a similar modeling problem was included and the students who participated in the MEA scored higher on the problem than last year's students that did not have the MEA experience.

Influences of Vehicles on Signal Propagation in Road Tunnels	2010 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS	IEEE International Conference on Communications		English	Proceedings Paper	2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	MAY 23-27, 2010	Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA	IEEE			RADIO-WAVE PROPAGATION	It is well known that the electromagnetic (EM) waves do not propagate well in road tunnels. The channel characteristics for empty tunnels have already been well analyzed by both theoretical and numerical/experimental methods. However, any road tunnels are full with running vehicles. Currently a few works have investigated the influence of the vehicles on the signal propagation in road tunnels. However, they are all limited to experimental or numerical results. This paper provides a theoretical mode-based analysis to give the straightforward description of the wireless channel in road tunnels with traffic flow. First the effects of a single vehicle in the tunnel are investigated. The analytical expressions of the in-mode loss and the mode coupling are provided using uniform theory of diffraction (UTD), Poisson summation formula and saddle point method. Then the channel model for a L-lane road tunnel with the Poisson traffic flow is provided basing on the analysis on single vehicle's effect.

In the literature, a lot of work can be found devoted to improving the performance of the traffic flow in such systems, by means of controlling the red-to-green switching times of traffic signals. Different techniques have been proposed and commercially implemented, ranging from heuristic methods to model-based optimization. However, given the complexity of the dynamics and the scale of urban traffic networks, there is still a lot of scope for improvement. In this work, a new hybrid model for the traffic behavior at an intersection is introduced. It captures important aspects of the flow dynamics in urban networks. It is shown how this model can be used in order to obtain control strategies that improve the flow of traffic at intersections, leading to the future possibility of controlling several connected intersections in a distributed way.

The research mainly proposes a new technique for video-based traffic accident analysis by extracting abnormal event characteristics at intersections. The approach relies on learning normal traffic flow using trajectory clustering techniques, then analyzing accident events by observing partial vehicle trajectories and motion characteristics. In first phase, the model implements video preprocessing, vehicle detection and tracking in order to extract vehicle trajectories at road intersections. Second phase is to determine motion patterns by implementing trajectory analysis and then differentiating normal and abnormal events by defining descriptors, and last phase executes semantic decisions about traffic events and accident characteristics.

For this purpose, we focus on an external interaction force between the robots. This force is generated with the use of a virtual damper. In this methodology, two control scenarios are presented: a damping force acts on a moving robot as the external interaction force, (I) only when its preceding robot(s) is/are stopping or being congested and (II) when a robot exists in front of the moving robot, in order not to become involved in the congestion. This paper deals with a circuit and a robotic manufacturing-transportation system for industrial automation. Through simulation experiments, it is shown that the proposed ACC successfully solves the congestion, and finally, improves the throughput. In addition, the superiority of the two control scenarios, ACCs (I) and (II), is discussed.

The framework of systems theory helps to explain empirically observable phenomena. In this paper a systems theoretic basis for traffic modeling is set out. A generic system model explains system properties and rearranges them in order to form an explanatory model for the complex behavior observable in a road transportation system. The interrelation between nanoscopic, microscopic and macroscopic traffic variables in traffic simulation is shown using the generic system model. It demonstrates that the approach lined out in this paper is of explanatory power for complex phenomena in the traffic modeling domain. In future this approach can be applied to the calibration and validation of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).

These are valuable mines of knowledge vital for strategic decision making and motivate the highly demanding field of spatial data mining i.e., discovery of interesting, implicit knowledge from large amounts of spatial data. Most government local administrations collect and/or use geographical databases on the road accidents, on the road network and sometimes on the vehicle flow and sometimes on the mobility of inhabitants. In addition, other databases provide additional information on the geographical environment - trend layers - like administrative boundaries, buildings, census data, etc. These data contain a mine of useful information for the traffic risk analysis. There was a first study aiming identifying and at predicting the accident risk of the roads. It used a decision tree that learns from the inventoried accident data and the description of the corresponding road sections. However, this method is only based on tabular data and does not exploit geographical location. Using the accident data, combined to trend data relating to the road network, the traffic flow, population, buildings, etc., this project aims at deducing relevant risk models to help in traffic safety task The existing work provided a pragmatic approach to multi layer geo-data mining. The process behind was to prepare input data by joining each layer table using a given spatial criterion, then applying a standard method to build' a decision tree. It allows the end-user to evaluate the results without any assistance by an analyst or statistician. The existing work did no consider multi-relational data mining domain. The efficiency of risk factor evaluation requires automatic filtering of spatial relationships. The quality of a decision tree depends, on the whole, of the quality of the initial data which are incomplete, incorrect or non relevant data inevitably leads to erroneous results. The proposed model develops an ant colony algorithm for the discovery of spatial trend patterns found in a GIS traffic risk analysis database. The proposed ant colony based spatial data mining algorithm applies the emergent intelligent behavior of ant colonies to handle the huge search space encountered in the discovery of this knowledge. Genetic algorithm is deployed to evaluate the spatial risk pattern rule sets to its optimization on search phase in quick successions. The experimental results on a geographical traffic (trend layer) spatial database show that our method has higher efficiency in performance of the discovery process and in the quality of trend patterns discovered compared to other existing approaches using non-intelligent decision tree heuristics.

One promising approach to alleviate the congestion effects is the coordination of the network's traffic signals in response to the traffic flow. The recently introduced Decentralised Progressive Signal Systems approach is an adaptive coordination mechanism for traffic signals in urban road networks that relies on local traffic data only. Since the decentralised process cannot lead to optimal results in some special cases, it is extended with an optional hierarchical component introduced in this paper. Based on a broader view on the current network traffic, this Regional Manager is responsible for determining which intersections are coordinated. The efficiency of the coordination determined by the Regional Manager is demonstrated in a simulation-based evaluation that considers the decentralised mechanism and an uncoordinated system for comparison.

In regard to this, a transit signal priority strategy for isolated intersections without bus-lane was developed. Designed to give priority to buses without seriously disturbing the general traffic flow, the control strategy included three categories of phase transition rules: rules based on bus priority and green utilization, rules for phase transition between rings, rules based on bus priority for initial green phase generation. Simulation tests conducted by VISSIM and VisVAP indicate that in the case of different traffic volumes, the isolated transit signal priority strategy ensures a lower delay for the buses, and decreases weighted average delay between buses and general traffic through the intersection.

Such trajectory data are a speical kind of time series with another focus on the spatial dimension besides the temporal one. Traditional time series models, especially the ARIMA (Auto-Regression Integrated Moving Average) model, have provided sound theoretical backgrounds and promoted many successful applications for managing and forecasting time-relevant sequential data. This paper aims at extending the ARIMA model with spatial dimension, and further applying it for the network constrained trajectory data. We implement and evaluate the model for trajectory database, in the context of traffic application scenario about vehicle movement constrained under a given network infrastructure. The proposed Traj-ARIMA model has many application perspectives, such as trajectory data regression and compression, outliers detection, traffic flow and vehicle speed prediction. In this paper, the major focus is on vehicle speed forecasting.

Modeling signalized intersection safety with corridor-level spatial correlations	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Bayesian approach; Signalized intersection; Safety analysis; Corridor; Spatial model; Conditional autoregressive model	CRASH OCCURRENCE; ACCIDENT; AREA; PREDICTION	Intersections in close spatial proximity along a corridor should be considered as correlated due to interacted traffic flows as well as similar road design and environmental characteristics. It is critical to incorporate this spatial correlation for assessing the true safety impacts of risk factors. In this paper, several Bayesian models were developed to model the crash data from 170 signalized intersections in the state of Florida. The safety impacts of risk factors such as geometric design features, traffic control, and traffic flow characteristics were evaluated. The Poisson and Negative Binomial Bayesian models with non-informative priors were fitted but the focus is to incorporate spatial correlations among intersections. Two alternative models were proposed to capture this correlation: (1) a mixed effect model in which the corridor-level correlation is incorporated through a corridor-specific random effect and (2) a conditional autoregressive model in which the magnitude of correlations is determined by spatial distances among intersections. The models were compared using the Deviance Information Criterion. The results indicate that the Poisson spatial model provides the best model fitting.

In this study, a field data collection was conducted at a high-speed signalized intersection, where a video-based system with three cameras was used to record the drivers' behavior related to the onset of yellow. Observed data include drivers' stop/go decisions, red-light running violation. lane position in the highway. positions (leading/following) in the traffic flow, vehicle type, and vehicles' yellow-onset speeds and distances from the intersection. Further, classification tree models were applied to analyze how the probabilities of a stop or go decision and of red-light running are associated with the traffic parameters. The data analysis indicated that vehicle's distance from the intersection at the onset of yellow, operating speed, and position in the traffic flow are the most important predictors for both the stop/go decision and red-light running violation. This study illustrates that the tree models are helpful to recognize and predict how drivers make stop/go decisions and partake in red-light running violations corresponding to the traffic parameters.

First, the operating and functional characteristics of bus station on expressway are analyzed. As a result, the paper puts forward two basic requirements for bus station position setting on expressway: to ensure smooth-running of expressway, and convenient transfer with buses on relief road. The study on the position setting of bus station to ensure smooth running of expressway is converted into study on the minimum distance between bus station and entrance/exit. The mechanism of mutual effects between the two is resolved. And based on kinematics theory, traffic flow theory and probability theory the calculation models of minimum distance are established, using Monte Carlo methods for solving models. In the study of position setting of bus stations to ensure convenient passenger transfer, the paper points out that bus station on expressway should be set near bus station on relief road, and relating facilities should be built to make passenger transfer convenient and safe. Six typical design patterns of transfer are concluded. This paper can guide urban expressway traffic design directly and is also helpful to expressway BRT design.

According to the mechanism that traffic flow moves to the upstream of the section in the congestion duration time, queue length is considered as the significant factor in the determination of congestion influencing areas. The formula is deduced to calculate the number of ramps in the influencing areas. Due to the low adjusting speed in the single point level and wide vibration amplitude in the coordination level in the traditional methods, the density is selected as the control parameter instead of the traffic flow volume in the Bottleneck algorithm. Meanwhile, the improved on ramp coordination metering method and the adjustment rate formula are formed based on Bottleneck algorithm eliminating the limitations of traditional methods. Taken the road section from Gongyi to Luoyang on the Lianhuo expressway as the instance, coordinated ramp metering simulation analysis is conducted by using the MATLAB software. The rationality and effectiveness of the formula of calculating the number of ramps in the congestion influencing areas and the improved algorithm are demonstrated by means of the numerical simulation.

This study investigates the container movements at a metropolitan sea terminal. The operations are mapped out and a logical model of the transportation flows is constructed. A simulation is developed in Arena that describes the transportation flows in an accurate but parsimonious manner. The study addresses several research gaps by providing a highly integrated, customisable and upgradeable simulation model which describes port operations in a more holistic fashion. Several experiments focussing on different modal splits for inter-terminal transport are carried out. The model provides a practical background to study the influence of operational changes, e.g. the influence of larger sea vessels on handling operations; effects of a larger share of rail transport; effects of increasing container throughput on throughput time and storage capacity; and the evaluation of sustainability measures.

In India, it is estimated that about half a million women and children die per year due to indoor air pollution. Therefore, maintaining an acceptable IAQ is important in places such as schools, corporate office buildings, hospitals and houses. It is hypothesized that the higher indoor pollutant concentrations of the buildings located near busy traffic roads are mostly influenced by elevated outdoor vehicular pollutant concentrations. In this paper an attempt has been made to analyze the indoor air quality of a naturally ventilated school building, Kendriya Vidyalaya, located in the Central Leather Research Institute (CLRO, Chennai, India. This building is located close to an urban road with heavy traffic flow, within a range of 100 m from the busy traffic junction. The indoor pollutants, namely carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), along with meteorological parameters such as temperature and relative humidity, have been measured inside the school building. The vehicular pollutant CO has also been measured at the road side to develop the indoor and outdoor CO relationship. Further, a questionnaire survey has also been conducted to evaluate the general environmental conditions (sick building syndrome) of the school building. The result indicated that hourly the CO2 concentration inside the school room is 927 ppm during morning working hours (10.00a.m). This concentration is close to standard value of 1000 ppm specified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), USA. The measured CO concentrations inside the school building are well within the standard. During peak hour traffic flow on the adjacent road, a high level CO concentration has been observed inside the school building. The questionnaire survey at school shows that nearly 50% of students are suffering from minor health problems.	[Nagendra, S. M. Shiva; Harika, P.

With the broad application of intelligent transport systems (ITS), particularly for the most dense street sections, some of these problems can be minimized or even solved; supplementary great potential is attributed to applications based on state-of-the art technology like car-to-x communication, for instance by extending an individuals "field of vision" by observations taken from all the vehicles in front. In this work we present a simulation based approach for improving driving experience and increasing road safety in merging sections by redirecting vehicles in advance according to a negotiation of requirements and desires of the flowing traffic on the main road and cars merging from the entrance lane. The simulation experiments performed in a cellular automaton based environment were data driven and on real scale, using traffic flow data on a minute-by-minute basis from a large urban motorway in a main city of the European Union. Our results have shown that the application of AmI technology has potential to influence driver's behavior (seamlessly invoking for a lane change well before an abrupt merging point) resulting in a reduction of panic, particularly for sections with limited range of view.

Short-term variation in near-highway air pollutant gradients on a winter morning	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							AEROSOL MASS-SPECTROMETER; ULTRAFINE PARTICLES; SIZE DISTRIBUTION; SUBMICROMETER PARTICLES; URBAN; ROAD; HYDROCARBONS; EVOLUTION; EMISSIONS; EXHAUST	Quantification of exposure to traffic-related air pollutants near highways is hampered by incomplete knowledge of the scales of temporal variation of pollutant gradients. The goal of this study was to characterize short-term temporal variation of vehicular pollutant gradients within 200-400 m of a major highway (> 150 000 vehicles/d). Monitoring was done near Interstate 93 in Somerville (Massachusetts) from 06:00 to 11:00 on 16 January 2008 using a mobile monitoring platform equipped with instruments that measured ultrafine and fine particles (6-1000 nm, particle number concentration (PNC)); particle-phase (> 30 nm) NO3-, SO42-, and organic compounds; volatile organic compounds (VOCs); and CO2, NO, NO2, and O-3. We observed rapid changes in pollutant gradients due to variations in highway traffic flow rate, wind speed, and surface boundary layer height. Before sunrise and peak traffic flow rates, downwind concentrations of particles, CO2, NO, and NO2 were highest within 100-250 m of the highway. After sunrise pollutant levels declined sharply (e.g., PNC and NO were more than halved) and the gradients became less pronounced as wind speed increased and the surface boundary layer rose allowing mixing with cleaner air aloft. The levels of aromatic VOCs and NO3-, SO42- and organic aerosols were generally low throughout the morning, and their spatial and temporal variations were less pronounced compared to PNC and NO. O-3 levels increased throughout the morning due to mixing with O-3-enriched air aloft and were generally lowest near the highway reflecting reaction with NO. There was little if any evolution in the size distribution of 6-225 nm particles with distance from the highway. These results suggest that to improve the accuracy of exposure estimates to near-highway pollutants, short-term (e.g., hourly) temporal variations in pollutant gradients must be measured to reflect changes in traffic patterns and local meteorology.

Using microsimulation to estimate highway bridge traffic load	BRIDGE MAINTENANCE, SAFETY, MANAGEMENT AND LIFE-CYCLE OPTIMIZATION			English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Bridge Maintenance, Safety and Management (IABMAS)	JUL 11-15, 2010	Lehigh Univ, Adv Technol Large Struct Syst (ATLSS) Engn Res Ctr, Philadelphia, PA	Digitexx Data Syst, Inc, U S Dept Transportat, Fed Highway Adm, Penn Infrastructure Technol Alliance (PITA), T Y Lin Int, Int Assoc Bridge Maintenance & Safety (IABMAS)	Lehigh Univ, Adv Technol Large Struct Syst (ATLSS) Engn Res Ctr			In bridge traffic loading there is an often-made assumption that free-flowing traffic incorporating dynamic effects governs for spans up to about 40 m and that thereafter congested traffic governs. This study uses traffic microsimulation as a basis for the comparison of regularly-used free and congested traffic flow models. Traffic microsimulation offers a comprehensive approach to the modelling of traffic as it models individual vehicle and driver behaviour giving a more realistic picture of traffic states and their consequent load effects on bridges. For a range of bridge lengths and load effects, and for each traffic model, a dynamic ratio that would be required for free-flowing traffic to govern is determined. It is shown that this required dynamic ratio is higher than that expected for a range of spans and load effects. This work concludes that, for a range of spans, the governing form of traffic may be congested traffic, contrary to the common assumption made in bridge traffic load estimation.

Zipper merging is the merging of vehicles on two lanes by turns and achieved by only vehicle-to-vehicle interactions before merging. Non-zipper merging is the merging without any interactions before merging. In this comparison we use a cellular automaton model on multiple lanes with slow-to-start rules. Simulations and mean-field analysis show that the flux of zipper merging is larger (smaller) than that of random merging in the case of large (small) slow-to-start effect.

Moreover; under both with and without; information-based control system, we have shown that this transportation volume shows some constant value almost everywhere in the density, even though the average velocity and the number of on-board passengers per unit bus decrease in the higher density of vehicles.

J	Dai, JC; Li, X				Dai JiCai; Li Xia			Multi-agent systems for simulating traffic behaviors	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN			English	Article						microscopic traffic model; vehicle-following model; multi-agent; cellular automata; acceleration	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; PARTICLE HOPPING MODELS; FLOW; TRANSITION; COORDINATION; MANAGEMENT	Multi-agent systems allow the simulation of complex phenomena that cannot be easily described analytically. As an efficient tool, the agen t-oriented traffic models have emerged to investigate vehicular traffic behaviors. In this article, a new agent-based traffic simulation model is proposed for solving the traffic simulation problems. A vehicle with the driver is represented as a composite autonomous agent in this model. Different from the classical car-following principles, vehicle-agent moving approaches are proposed instead of particle-hopping techniques. This model defines reasonable acceleration and deceleration rates at any certain condition. In this simulation, this can offer a natural, even cognitive way to follow the leader and switch lane. The simulation results have verified that this model has achieved more realistic results without loss of accuracy than those obtained from the cellular automata traffic models. This model can provide better simulation performance than the traditional vehicle-following models which are used to investigate the nonequilibrium traffic flow. A comparison of the real flow with the simulated freeway flow and lane capacity highlights the validness of this model.

Continuum Traffic Simulation	COMPUTER GRAPHICS FORUM			English	Article							MODEL; NAVIGATION; DYNAMICS; WAVES; CROWD	We present a novel method for the synthesis and animation of realistic traffic flows on large-scale road networks. Our technique is based on a continuum model of traffic flow we extend to correctly handle lane changes and merges, as well as traffic behaviors due to changes in speed limit. We demonstrate how our method can be applied to the animation of many vehicles in a large-scale traffic network at interactive rates and show that our method can simulate believable traffic flows on publicly-available, real-world road data. We furthermore demonstrate the scalability of this technique on many-core systems.	[Sewall, J.; Wilkie, D.; Merrell, P.; Lin, M.

In order to increase road safety and optimize traffic flow, high quality prediction and sensor technologies are required as vel 1 as appropriate winter service treatments at the right time. Given the complexity of meteorological, traffic and winter service processes, winter services require a comprehensive Winter Maintenance Management System. ASFINAG (Autobahnen- und Schnellstrassen-Finanzierungs-Aktiengesellschaft) plans, finances, maintains and tolls the entire Austrian motorway and highway network covering 2,178 kilometers. This figure includes over 300 kilometers per direction in tunnels and some 300 kilometers per direction over bridges. ASFINAG is wholly owned by the Austrian Federal Government. In order to benefit from synergies and to reach common, high quality standards - particularly in winter maintenance ASFINAG has decided to launch a specific, company-wide project: the MDSS ASFINAG. The MDSS system is a common, robust, modular and scalable platform able to support the decisions of all the maintenance depots within the two service companies.. of ASFINAG. Boschung Mecatronic AG has been selected to develop and to provide the MDSS system. The objectives of the MDSS system are Road Weather Information System (RWIS), data concentration, the integration of weather forecasts and combination of RWIS and forecast data as well as the integration of operational data to devise situation maps for comprehensive decision-making support. The MDSS system brings together all of the RWIS stations distributed over the road network. This provides a common interface for all users, who will have the opportunity to access data from neighboring regions. The Austrian road network has been divided in about 230 Road Weather Segments corresponding to micro/meso-climatic regions. Specific weather forecasts for up to 72 hours will be established for each of these segments. One of the main benefits of the MDSS system will be to combine local RWIS station data with weather forecast data to develop the road surface and road weather information of the corresponding Road Weather Segment so as to aid decision-making.

DECENTRALIZED OPTIMAL ROUTING FOR PACKETS FLOW ON DATA NETWORKS	DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS-SERIES B			English	Article						conservation laws; telecommunication and data networks	TRAFFIC FLOW; TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORKS; COMMUNICATION-NETWORKS; ROAD NETWORK; MODEL; OPTIMIZATION; WAVES	This paper concerns optimization of data traffic flows on a telecommunication network, modelled using a fluid - dynamic approach. Flows can be controlled adjusting traffic distribution and priority parameters. Two cost functionals are considered, which measure average velocity and average travelling time of packets. First we address general optimal control problems, showing that existence of solutions is related to properties of packet loss probability functions. A direct solution of the general optimal control problem corresponds to a centralized policy and is hard to achieve, thus we focus on a decentralized policy and provide solutions for a single node with two entering and two exiting lines and asymptotic costs. Such solutions permit to simulate the behaviour of decentralized algorithms for complex networks. Local optimization ensures very good results also for large networks. The latter is shown by case study of a test telecommunication network.

The formulas of travel time are derived respectively for one section and multiple sections by using cumulative curve method. Then a macroscopic timing optimization model for signalized intersections is presented. Finally, some examples concerning under-saturated and over-saturated intersections are presented, which give support to the proposed model.

They are caused by traffic incidents such as accidents, disabled cars, construction activities and other unusual events. Three different major traffic conditions can be occurred: "Flow," "Dense" and "Congested". Objective of this research is to identify the current traffic condition by examining the traffic measurement parameters. The earlier researches have dealt only with speed and volume by ignoring occupancy. In our study, the occupancy is another important parameter of classification. The previous works have used multiple sensors to classify traffic condition whereas our work uses only single microwave sensor. We have extended Multiple Linear Regression classification with our new approach of Estimating with Error Prediction. We present novel algorithms of Multiclassification with One-Against-All Method and Multiclassification with Binary Comparison for multiple SVM architecture. Finaly, a non-linear model of backpropagation neural network is introduced for classification. This combination has not been reported on previous studies. Training data are obtained from the Corsim based microscopic traffic simulator TSIS 5.1. All performances are compared using this data set. Our methods are currently installed and running at traffic management center of 2. Ring Road in Istanbul.

This paper presents a brand-new and complete structure in feature combination as well as analysis for orientating and labeling moving shadows so as to extract the defined objects in foregrounds more easily in each snapshot of the original files of videos which are acquired in the real traffic situations. Moreover, we make use of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for background removal and detection of moving shadows in our tested images, and define two indices for characterizing non-shadowed regions where one indicates the characteristics of lines and the other index can be characterized by the information in gray scales of images which helps us to build a newly defined set of darkening ratios (modified darkening factors) based on Gaussian models. To prove the effectiveness of our moving shadow algorithm, we carry it out with a practical application of traffic flow detection in ITS (Intelligent Transportation System)-vehicle counting. Our algorithm shows the faster processing speed, 13.84 ms/frame, and can improve the accuracy rate in 4% similar to 10% for our three tested videos in the experimental results of vehicle counting.

OBSERVATION OF TRAVEL BEHAVIOR BY IC CARD DATA AND APPLICATION TO TRANSPORTATION PLANNING	GEOSPATIAL DATA AND GEOVISUALIZATION: ENVIRONMENT, SECURITY, AND SOCIETY	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	Joint Symposium of ISPRS Commission IV / AutoCarto Annual Conference	NOV 15-19, 2010	Orlando, FL	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing		IC Card; Travel Behavior Observation; GIS; Transportation Planning; ITS		So far, there have been many attempts to observe travel behavior of people in detail for transportation planning and ITS. One of the promising tools is IC card carried by people. The IC cards as bus tickets (bus smart cards) were introduced in March 2007 in Kanto area in Japan, and the bus smart cards have been in widespread use. The records of the bus smart card data are more than 38 million a month, and can represent the travel behavior of people. In this study, system of the bus smart card data collection in Japan is introduced, and the enormous bus smart card data is visualized for grasping the current transportation situation in the area of interest. In order to establish application of the bus smart card data to transportation planning, plausible analysis methods with the detailed travel behavior of people acquired by the bus smart card data are developed. For utilization of the bus smart card data, a method of converting bus smart card data to travel time and bus trip data is developed. The converted empirical data is applied to origin-destination analysis, and average of bus travel time estimation. By using the average bus travel time, relationship between the travel time and traffic congestion are analyzed. Additionally, an integration method of the bus smart card data with probe data is investigated. The integrated empirical data is applied to traffic monitoring, and extraction of obstructive factor for traffic flow.

To this end, a normal Bayesian network is built which is able to deal with the joint distribution of route and link flows and the flows associated with all possible combinations of scanned link flows and associated random errors. The Bayesian network provides the joint density of route flows conditioned on the observations, which alloy us not only the independent or joint predictions of route flows, but also probability intervals or regions to be obtained. A procedure is also given to select the subset of links to be observed in an optimal way. An example of application illustrate the proposed methodology and shows its practical applicability and performance.	[Sanchez-Cambronero, S.; Rivas, A.; Gallego, I.; Menendez, J.

There are usually two lanes at bus stops in China: one is the non-motor lane and the other is the motor lane. Bus stops are often located on the non-motor lanes. This paper proposes travel time model for car stream under mixed traffic condition near a bus stop. Based on the conventional BPR function, the travel time function near a bus stop under mixed traffic condition is established. Travel time for car stream near the stop in China is the function of three types of traffic streams with buses, cars and bicycles. Model parameters can be calibrated by using the SPSS statistics software. The proposed model is validated using the field data in Beijing. The results indicate that the proposed model is suitable to estimate link travel time near a bus stop in China.

We would choose model I: the single annular lane without signal control if the traffic volume varies from 0 to 1000 pcu/h.

A classical shortest path algorithm based only on road length is no longer relevant. We propose in this paper an adaptive vehicle guidance system instigated from the ants behavior, well known for its good adaptativity; this system allows adjusting intelligently and promptly the route choice according to the real-time changes in the road network situations, such as new congestions and jams. This method is implemented as a deliberative module of a vehicle ant agent in a collaborative multiagent system representing the entire road network. Series of simulations, under a multiagent platform, allow us to discuss the improvement of the global road traffic quality in terms of time, fluidity, and adaptativity.

Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control System, on the other hand, uses vehicle to vehicle communication to gather information of vehicles further in front. Thus vehicles can follow each other at a closer distance, thereby improving traffic flow characteristics. This paper presents a new control approach by combining ACC and CACC algorithms and its application on light commercial vehicles.

Using Traffic Flow for Cluster Formation in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks	IEEE LOCAL COMPUTER NETWORK CONFERENCE	Conference on Local Computer Networks		English	Proceedings Paper	35th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Network (LCN)	OCT 10-14, 2010	Denver, CO	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Comp Commun, Raytheon BBN Technologies, QQSIQ Inc			MODEL	We present a lane-based clustering algorithm designed to provide stability in cluster lifetime for vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) in urban scenarios. Stable clustering methods reduce the overhead of re-clustering and lead to an efficient hierarchical network topology. During the creation of VANET clusters, cluster members select one member to be the clusterhead. Fewer clusterhead changes result in a more stable cluster. To achieve this goal, cluster members must select a member that has the potential to be a clusterhead longer than other cluster members. Our method aims to select a clusterhead based on the lane where most of the traffic will flow.

This paper presents a novel approach to this problem, by identifying congestion as an unintentional emergent property of driver-to-driver interactions. It is described how human interaction is a constant and important intrinsic property of city driving, and how these interactions can lead to explicit phenomena. A framework is presented for the further analysis of congestion at three spatial levels, and the driver behaviours that may be of most significance at each described. Building on this model, the paper presents a case study carried out at the highly congested Blackwall Tunnel in London. In providing evidence for some of the concepts described in this paper, the case study demonstrates how human behaviour causes the emergence of road congestion. The concepts and framework presented in this paper represent a strong starting point for further understanding and eventual modelling of the occurrence and spread of road congestion.

Since Support Vector Machine (SVM)have better generalization performance and can guarantee global minima for given training data, it is believed that SVR is an effective method in traffic flow forecasting. But with the sharp increment of traffic data, traditional serial SVM can not meet the real-time requirements of traffic flow forecasting. Parallel processing has been proved to be a good method to reduce training time. In this paper, we adopt a parallel sequential minimal optimization (Parallel SMO) method to train SVM in multiple processors. Our experimental and analytical results demonstrate this model can reduce training time, enhance speed-up ratio and efficiency and better satisfy the real-time demands of traffic flow forecasting.

A multi-agent system for managing adverse weather situations on the road network	INTEGRATED COMPUTER-AIDED ENGINEERING			English	Article						Advanced traffic management systems; multiagent system; expert system; road incidents traffic management	WORK ZONE CAPACITY; MODEL; DELAY	The development of traffic management and control strategies to improve traffic flows and road safety is necessary due to the high dynamism of traffic flows. The use of distributed intelligent systems can help the traffic organizations and the road operators to cope with possible incidents on the road network, especially when the incidents are related to adverse meteorological conditions. In that case, the probability of road accidents is increased due to the difficulty of driving under bad weather conditions. So, if the operators detect any meteorological incident, they must decide how to deal with it in order to improve traffic safety. In this paper we introduce a new multiagent system (MAS) to support traffic management when there appear meteorological problems in the road network. MAS technology helps to deal with the specific characteristics of traffic domain. The proposed MAS is able to work in two ways: a) coordinately, where all the agents work to solve weather problems in large networks and b) locally, where due to communications breakdown small groups of agents work together to inform road users about weather problems. The MAS has a rule-based system to deal with the meteorological data and decide the actions to take in front of any meteorological issue. This expert system also controls the quality of the data, improving the road operator confidence in the decisions taken by the expert system. However, weather sensors can provide wrong data, due to several factors ( hardware failure, climate factors, etc.) so the rule based system controls these provided data by applying specific coherence and correlation rules to improve the quality of the taken decisions.

Air pollutant concentrations, meteorological parameters and traffic flow continuously measured in Gottinger Strasse (Hannover, Germany) were used in calculations. Parameters included in the inverse proportionality between concentration and a dispersive velocity scale were evaluated using statistical methods, for windward and leeward conditions. For leeward conditions, a 'critical wind speed' is defined as the roof-level wind speed at which traffic and wind induced turbulences inside the street canyon are equal. It varies with traffic density between 2 m s(-1) and 4.5 m s(-1).

ANALYSING STREET TRAFFIC NOISE POLLUTION IN THE CITY OF YAZD	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE & ENGINEERING			English	Article						Street traffic; Noise pollution; Sound level; Modelling; Yazd	AIR-POLLUTION; EXPOSURE; POPULATION; ANNOYANCE; SPACE	A model is demonstrated that describes street traffic-induced noise pollution in 2008 in Yazd, Iran. Sound levels were measured using a Bruel and Kjaer-2260 sound level meter on 10 streets across the city over this period during the morning rush hour and different vehicle types were counted simultaneously at various sampling points. Geographical Information System was used to generate, store and retrieve the spatial data and map the sound levels using an interpolation technique. The minimum and maximum sound levels appeared to be 70.9 dBA and 80.7 dBA, respectively and these values were above the national legislated norm. Cars and motorcycles were the most commonly used vehicle type in the city, comprising 61.2% and 23.7 % of the total traffic volume, respectively. These data were followed by trucks, buses and bicycles. A number of parameters which were assumed to impact on noise pollution were collected and considered, including geographical position, elevation, the distance to the nearest intersection, street geometry and the numbers of vehicles according to class. The modelling demonstrated that there is a significant relationship between the average sound level and traffic flow (R(2) = 0.5). The results showed that although street traffichas increased between 2002 and 2008, the sound levels in the city decreased slightly and this has been attributed to advances in vehicle design.

Especially, the extreme values in a service period can not be predicted. In this paper, a model is first developed for a better estimation of the actual traffic flow, as well as the service load effect level of a bridge. Based on a five-day collection data of the vehicle samples passing through the exit of Guangyuan to Shahe of the North-Ring Highway in Guangzhou, The Qiaole Bridge of the highway is taken as an example to illustrate the assessment model. Then, a threshold model is applied to estimate the tail distribution of the maximum load effect of a fleet. And threshold point process is used to infer the maximum value distribution for prediction of the load effect level of the bridge in a future time period. Finally, a 0.95 quantile is obtained to compare with the result given by specification[1]. The results show that the assessment method proposed in this paper is valid and feasible.

Tool for evaluating the impact of changes in land transport is a multi-modal transport model that allows for the planned objectives to predict traffic flows in the future. The monitoring of changes in land-use pattern, together with socio-demographic data is the main factor of production and the attractiveness of different transport zones in the transport model. These characteristics are used as input data for the model in the program EMME/3 based on peak-hours traffic. The results of model are used for evaluation of current and predicted land-use changes impacts on the traffic flows. The travel time factor of individual, as well as public, transport is taken into account as the key transportation indicator for description of suburbanization processes.

The model emphasizes the conflict between human behaviors, normal drivers spacing policies, and limited acceleration and deceleration capabilities of vehicles as the origin of congested traffic states. A new set of simple rules that incorporates implicit anticipation effects, mechanical restrictions of vehicles and safe driving practices, to guarantee that microscopic vehicle behavior follows capabilities of real ones, is introduced. Simulation results show that the present model reproduces most empirical findings including the three states of traffic flow and the branch to wide jams. Moreover, the improved model preserves the simplicity of cellular automata models.	[Larraga, M.

G.; Van Arem, Bart			The Impact of a Congestion Assistant on Traffic Flow Efficiency and Safety in Congested Traffic Caused by a Lane Drop	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Traffic Flow System; Lane Drop; Stop-and-Go System; Traffic Flow Efficiency; Active Accelerator Pedal	ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; SYSTEMS	This article presents the results of a microscopic traffic simulation study conducted to investigate the impact of a Congestion Assistant on traffic efficiency and traffic safety. The Congestion Assistant is an in-vehicle system in which an active pedal supports the driver when approaching congestion and a stop-and-go function when driving in congestion. The authors used an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) Modeller traffic flow simulation tool to study the effect of the Congestion Assistantin congestion caused by a lane drop. This article describes (a) how the Congestion Assistant operates and (b) the main features of the ITS Modeller. Furthermore, it examines the calibration and validation of the ITS Modeller for congestion caused by a lane drop using traffic flow measurements on a segment of the Dutch A12 highway. Simulation experiments of different penetration rates and system settings show that the stop and go leads to a 30% decrease in travel-time delay at a 10% penetration rate, while the active pedal leads to small reductions in travel-time delay. Compared with the stop-and-go function, the active pedal has fewer sharp accelerations and decelerations, which implies better traffic safety and driver comfort. The effect of the stop-and-go active pedal combination is similar to that of the stop-and-go function on its own. The authors further discuss the implications of the results.	[Van Driel, Cornelie J.

J	Li, J; Xu, YP				Li, Jia; Xu, Yue-ping			Dependence patterns associated with the fundamental diagram: a copula function approach	JOURNAL OF ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY-SCIENCE A			English	Article						Nonparametric copula; Dependence patterns; Traffic flow; Loop detector	RISK	Randomness plays a major role in the interpretation of many interesting traffic flow phenomena, such as hysteresis, capacity drop and spontaneous breakdown. The analysis of the uncertainty and reliability of traffic systems is directly associated with their random characteristics. Therefore, it is beneficial to understand the distributional properties of traffic variables. This paper focuses on the dependence relation between traffic flow density and traffic speed, which constitute the fundamental diagram (FD). The traditional model of the FD is obtained essentially through curve fitting. We use the copula function as the basic toolkit and provide a novel approach for identifying the distributional patterns associated with the FD. In particular, we construct a rule-of-thumb nonparametric copula function, which in general avoids the mis-specification risk of parametric approaches and is more efficient in practice. By applying our construction to loop detector data on a freeway, we identify the dependence patterns existing in traffic data. We find that similar modes exist among traffic states of low, moderate or high traffic densities. Our findings also suggest that highway traffic speed and traffic flow density as a bivariate distribution is skewed and highly heterogeneous.

J	Lv, NC; Yan, XP; Xu, K; Wu, CZ				Lv, Nengchao; Yan, Xinping; Xu, Kun; Wu, Chaozhong			Bi-level programming based contra flow optimization for evacuation events	KYBERNETES			English	Article						Cybernetics; Programming algorithm theory; Transport management; Disaster management; Traffic flow		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a bi-level programming optimization model to reduce traffic congestion of transportation network while evacuating people to safe shelters during disasters or special events. Design/methodology/approach - The previous optimization model for contra flow configuration only considered the character of the manager. However, the traffic condition is not only controlled by managers, but also depended on the root choice of travelers. A hi-level programming optimization model, which considered managers and evacuees' character, is proposed to optimize the contra flow of transportation network in evacuation during special events. The upper level model aims to minimize the total evacuation time, while the lower level based on user equilibrium assignment. A solution method based on discrete particle swarm optimization and Frank-Wolfe algorithm is employed to solve the hi-level programming problem. Findings - It is found that the bi-level programming based contra flow optimization model can improve evacuation efficiency and decrease evacuation time 30 per cent or more. With the increase of traffic demand, the evacuation time will decrease significantly by contra flow configuration. Research limitations/implications - In the optimization model, the background traffic is ignored for simplification and the contra flow is configured absolutely as 0 or 1, which ensures vehicles do not go back into the evacuation area. Practical implications - An efficient optimization model for traffic managers to reduce congestion and evacuation time of evacuation network. Originality/value - The new hi-level programming model not only considers managers' character, but also considers evacuees' reaction. The paper is aimed to optimize contra flow for transportation network.

The existing basic concepts are briefly reviewed. Original 2D macro- and microscopic models of multilane traffic are developed to predict flows for the real road geometry. The macroscopic model of synchronized traffic flow uses the continuum approach, it is similar to the quasi-gas-dynamic (QGD) system of equations. The microscopic model is based on the cellular automata theory. Test predictions demonstrate good agreement of the models in both qualitative and quantitative sense.

Exposure to pollutants such as carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and ozone has been found to be associated with increases in hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory disease and mortality in many cities in Europe and other continents. The transit traffic in the historical center of this city produces big concentrations of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone and volatile organic compounds. In order to realize a prediction model for the main air pollutants, it is necessary to analyze all the intersections from this area. It is necessary to find the optimal way for reduce the pollution in Brasov and one solution is to determine the actual stage of chemical pollution and accomplishment of an approximation model for chemical pollutants in function of traffic flows. In this study is presented the methodology (8 steps) for a chemical pollutants approximation model. The all eight steps of approximation model methodology are presented in the paper.

For releasing this congestion, the effect of "zipper" merging is discussed in this paper. This is the merging of vehicles on two lanes alternatively, and is achieved by only the local communication of vehicles between two lanes before merging. This "zipper" merging is compared with the "non-zipper" merging, which is the merging without interactions of vehicles before merging, in terms of flux rate. This comparison is performed by using simulations with a new multiple-lane cellular automaton model which has slow-to-start effect. Numerical results show that the inverse flux rate is observed between "zipper", and "non-zipper" merging as the change of slow-to-start effect. Moreover, theoretical flux rate of the "non-zipper" merging is constructed. It is shown that these theoretical results coincide with the simulation results very well.

The flow capturing location problem (FCLP), originally proposed by Hodgson (1990), aims to locate a given number of facilities on a network to maximize the total flow that can obtain service at facilities along their pre-planned routes. For railway users, facilities located at the origin station and the destination station are more easily accessible than facilities located midway along the path. Therefore, we differentiate these two cases by introducing two levels of coverage; a given flow is fully captured when captured at the origin station or the destination station, or partially captured when captured at a midway station along the path. We provide an integer programming formulation of the proposed problem. We apply the model to analyze the optimal locations of flow capturing facilities on Keio Line using commuter traffic flow data, which is extracted from transportation census data of Tokyo Metropolitan area.

TRAFFIC CLASSIFICATION AND SPEED ESTIMATION IN TIME SERIES OF AIRBORNE OPTICAL REMOTE SENSING IMAGES	PCV 2010 - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE ANALYSIS, PT I	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	ISPRS-Technical-Commission III Symposium on Photogrammetric Computer Vision and Image Analysis (PCV)	SEP 01-03, 2010	Saint Mande, FRANCE	ISPRS Tech Commiss		Classification; estimation; modelling; change detection; sequences; aerial; optical; imagery		In this paper we propose a new two level traffic parameter estimation approach based on traffic classification into three classes: free flow, congested and stopped traffic in image time series of airborne optical remote sensing data. The proposed method is based on the combination of various techniques: change detection in two images, image processing such as binarization and filtering and incorporation of a priori information such as road network, information about vehicles and roads and finally usage of traffic models. The change detection in two images with a short time lag of several seconds is implemented using the multivariate alteration detection method resulting in a change image where the moving vehicles on the roads are highlighted. Further, image processing techniques are applied to derive the vehicle density in the binarized and denoised change image. Finally, this estimated vehicle density is related to the vehicle density, acquired by modelling the traffic flow for a road segment. The model is derived from traffic classification, a priori information about the vehicle sizes and road parameters, the road network and the spacing between the vehicles. Then, the modelled vehicle density is directly related to the average vehicle speed on the road segment and thus the information about the traffic situation can be derived. To confirm our idea and to validate the method several flight campaigns with the DLR airborne experimental wide angle optical 3K digital camera system operated on a Do-228 aircraft were conducted. Experiments are carried out to analyse the performance of the proposed traffic parameter estimation method for highways and main streets in the cities. The estimated speed profiles coincide qualitatively and quantitatively well with the reference measurements.

The control algorithm is based on model predictive control (MPC) involving Jacobi iteration algorithm to solve constrained and nonlinear programming problem. The signal controllers of traffic network constitute a network of computers. They can distribute their computation realizing an efficient traffic control without any central management. However the optimal control inputs can be also calculated by a single traffic controller if the traffic network contains few intersections. The control aim is to relieve traffic congestion, reduce travel time and improve homogenous traffic flow in urban traffic area using distributed control architecture. The MPC based control strategy can be implemented in any urban transportation network but adequate measurement system and modern traffic controllers are needed Theory, realization possibilities and simulation of the control method are also presented. The simulation results show that the system is able to ameliorate the network efficiency and reduce travel time. The distributed MPC based traffic control strategy proves the effectiveness by realizing a dependable control operation and creating optimal flow in the network subjected to control input constraints.

Influences of signal cycle time (t(s)) and vehicular density (rho)) on the mean velocity (upsilon) and mean overtaking times (c) of the traffic flow are discussed. The effects of slow vehicles and road barricades on the traffic flow are also studied. simulation results Shows that the Vehicular density and the signal cycle time have significant influences on the traffic flow. The mean velocity of the traffic flow could keep a comparatively large Value when rho <= 0.45. for a certain value of rho, (upsilon) displays a serrated fluctuation with t(s). Therefore, there may exist a certain combination of p and t(s) which optimizes the traffic flow efficiency. As compared with the results in Nagatani (2009) [7], the model proposed here and the Simulation results which took into account the effects of signal cycle time, slow vehicles, and road barricades oil the traffic flow with overtaking allowed, call reflect the situation of traffic flow in a more realistic way (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we suppose that the car involved in collision is evacuated from the road, with an exit probability P-exit. It is found that the behaviors of density, current, and (alpha, beta) phase diagram topology depend strongly on the values of P-exit and P-col. Indeed, the high-density region shrinks when increasing P-exit. Moreover, the critical value alpha(c)(beta), at which the low-density-high-density transition occurs, increases when increasing P-col and/or P-exit. Furthermore, the critical value at which the transition high-density-low-density occurs decreases when increasing beta and increases with alpha.

In this framework, particle filter is utilized to estimate the statistic distribution of traffic flow of links without detection sensors based on the position and speed information of navigated vehicles on those links and the prior information of traffic flow of links with detection sensors. The chance constrains and Bayes-based route prediction are incorporated into the optimization model so that the stochastic characteristics of traffic needs, propagation and driver's decision-making behavior can be compensated in the route optimization. To check the chance constraints, the min-max characteristic points are used to fit the curve of stochastic traffic propagation process with stochastic needs to avoid the exponential increase of combination calculation. The genetic algorithm is utilized for the optimization with feasible-direction-search crossover and mutation to improve the evolution efficiency, combined with the traffic simulation in the mean sense with the compensation of stochastic parts of traffic flow data to evaluate the performance of real-time traffic assignment. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of traffic navigation predictive control.

On the one hand, it becomes more and more difficult to build accurate mathematical optimal models; on the other hand, the basic demand data needed by dynamic traffic flow optimality is very difficult to get entirely and accurately. While in the actual traffic management system, there an abundant historical and real-time traffic flow data from kinds of detectors. The traffic demand information and the traffic flow state information are hidden in them and can be extracted by methods with rational traffic flow detector layout. So, it is necessary to explore innovative theories and methodologies of data-based dynamic optimality problem. In this paper, based on a brief survey of the usual dynamic traffic flow optimality methods, a data-based optimal framework is proposed. Related theories for this optimal framework are discussed as well.

When traffic in each approach is small, individual vehicles will not affect others on the same intersection. Once the traffic flow exceeds the critical point, intersection's non-competitive character would disappear and exclusionary becomes conspicuous, showing all levels of traffic jams. This article first combined the transportation evaluation methods with basic models of external integration to analyze the causes of congestion. Then it took intersections for example to introduce quantitative indicators of service level to the external analysis model, which helped to determine the threshold of the normal average delay time. Finally, measures to relief congestion were also proposed.

The deceleration risk and unsafe density parameter as traffic risk assessment index were put forward, then the traffic risk quantitative assessment models were established. According to the safety risk management theory, the risk classification description and assessment were built up. Applying the microscopic traffic simulation technique, the suggested values of the traffic control standard of on-ramp and off-ramp areas were also proposed. At last, the examples were made a risk analysis through simulating the traffic flows. The results suggested that the traffic risk assessment index and the assessment method are accurate and effective, which can supply the theoretical basis for the establishment of the dynamical traffic control and management measures.

At intersections, vehicles are forced to reduce speed, change direction, and most likely, stop for a long period of time. Carbon monoxide (CO) emission rate as a result of incomplete combustion of fuel has the most changes in intersections because of dramatic speed change. In the present study, concentration of CO in one of most populated and residential intersections of Iran's capital have been modeled using HYROAD model. Modeling practice has been done considering several parameters including traffic flow, meteorological and weather characteristics, site specific characteristics and realistic characteristics of vehicles traffic. Amount of CO concentration obtained from model has been compared to observed concentrations of CO for specific period of data available. Results showed that predicted amounts are less than actual site amounts but there is some apparent similarity associated with the change patterns of concentration, i.e. the highest and lowest concentration levels occur in the same time but with higher amounts for predicted amounts in all times.

Microscopic traffic simulation models have been playing an important role in traffic engineering and particularly in cases, in which field studies, involving extensive data collection, over a wide range, is difficult or expensive to conduct. As the available simulation models can only replicate homogeneous traffic flow, a model of heterogeneous traffic flow, named, HETEROSIM was developed to simulate heterogeneous traffic flow. In this model, a dynamic stochastic type discrete event simulation is adopted in which the aspects of interest are analysed numerically with the aid of a computer program. The model was validated using field observed data of traffic flow. Then, the model was applied to measure one of the fundamental charactertistics of traffic flow, namely concentration. It is a broader term encompassing both density and occupancy. Occupancy takes into account the traffic composition and speed, and hence, occupancy is more meaningful than density. The concept of occupancy can not be directly applied under heterogeneous traffic conditions, as the traffic has no lane discipline. In this paper, a new concept named, 'area-occupancy' is proposed to measure traffic concentration.	[Arasan, V.

As it is hard to get the optimal solution in a limited time through analysis, a greedy algorithm and a simulated annealing (SA) based algorithm are presented to solve the model. Some traffic flow data detected by remote microwave sensors in some road links in Beijing urban expressway are employed to compare the two algorithms. The results show that SA based algorithm has achieved better result even its running time is little longer than the greedy algorithm. Therefore the proposed SA based algorithms can be used to improve the pertinency, validity and automation of releasing traffic guidance information.

The highlight of the algorithm is that the controller design only depends on the I/O data of the dynamical system without using any priori knowledge of the system. The monotonic convergence and effectiveness of the AILPC algorithm are proven and verified through rigorous analyses, numerical example and freeway traffic flow control application.

The system which is made from three main components; low profile steel rail, elastomeric pad and prestressed concrete trough is developed for light rail transits in cities streets, which can significantly help in improving the traffic flow, reducing the traffic congestion and thus providing opportunities for minimising serious environmental problems such as level of noise, vibration and air pollutions and in this regards it can be considered as environmentally friendly means of transport. A mathematical model was developed where the LR55 track system was treated as multilayer beams on elastic foundations, and the model was then validate experimentally through a series of non-destructive tests on full scale model subjected to a full scale service load specified by the current BS codes of practises.

The model is specified by fundamental diagram parameters- determined from mainline data, and on-ramp and off-ramp flows. The mainline flow/density data are efficiently archived and readily available, but the ramp flow data are generally found missing. This paper presents an imputation technique based on iterative learning control to determine these flows. The imputation technique is applied sequentially on all the segments of the freeway, and the ramp flows, which minimize the error between the model calculated densities/flows and measurements are investigated. The stability and convergence of the density and flow errors using the imputation updates is also presented. Finally an example is shown to illustrate its use in a practical scenario.

It has been widely used for road generalization and traffic flow prediction. However, most of current researches only focus on applying the stroke for a certain application rather than discussing the way to build good strokes. This paper aims to give a comparative analysis of different approaches to build stroke for road generalization application. Geometric approach (by considering the deflection angle and with three different critera: self-fit, self-best-fit and every-best-fit), thematic approach (by considering road class or road name of road segments) and hybrid of thematic and geometric approaches are involved in this discussion. Two road networks are used to test these approaches and results are evaluated by comparing with corresponding small scale datasets. From the comparison, it is found that: (1) if only geometric criterion is considered, every-best-fit performs better than self-fit and self-best-fit; (2) if also thematic criterion is added, road class can improve the performance, and road name can also be used as a complement.

FUNDAMENTAL FINDINGS OF DYNAMIC BEHAVIOUR OF PAVEMENT SUBGRADE MATERIAL IN HONG KONG	PROCEEDINGS OF THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL POSTGRADUATE CONFERENCE ON INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENVIRONMENT, VOL 2			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Postgraduate Conference on Infrastructure and Environment	JUN 01-02, 2010	Hong Kong Polytechn Univ, Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	Hong Kong Polytechn Univ, Fac Construct & Land Use	Hong Kong Polytechn Univ	Resilient modulus; permanent deformation; completely decomposed granite; CBR; subgrade soil	RESILIENT MODULUS; SOILS	The design of road pavement thickness in Hong Kong has been traditionally based on anticipated traffic flow and the elasticity of the subgrade soil. The guidance document for pavement design in Hong Kong suggests that the elasticity of subgrade soil shall be determined by empirical correlations based on California Bearing Ratio (CBR) for granular soils or Plasticity Index (PI) for clayey soils. However in the last couple of decades, overseas researchers realised that static tests such as CBR were inappropriate to make a true simulation for traffic loadings. Hence, other approaches like the resilient modulus test were subsequently developed. The current research is to study the dynamic behaviour of subgrade soils in Hong Kong, aiming to assess the need for upgrading the conventional design approach to a performance based design approach for pavement foundation. In view of a better pavement design and maintenance system that may be developed, it is anticipated that materials, plants and workforces can be utilized in a more effective manner during road construction, which in turn would lead to a more sustainable society as a whole. This paper aims to present some key findings on the performance of a very typical soil type in Hong Kong, namely Completely Decomposed Granite (CDG), under resilient modulus testing. Owing to this research project is still in an early stage, hence only preliminary results are presented.	[Leung, Gordon L. M.; Wong, W.

The existing basic concepts are briefly reviewed. Original 2D macro-and microscopic models of multilane traffic are developed to predict flows for the real road geometry. The macroscopic model of synchronized traffic flow uses the continuum approach, it is similar to the quasi-gas-dynamic (QGD) system of equations. The microscopic model is based on the cellular automata theory. Test predictions demonstrate good agreement of the models in both qualitative and quantitative sense.	[Chetverushkin, B.

Analysis of the Traffic Induced Vibrations on a 19th Century Heritage Chapel using Finite Element Modelling	PROCEEDINGS OF THE TENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL STRUCTURES TECHNOLOGY	Civil-Comp Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Computational Structures Technology	SEP 14-17, 2010	Valencia, SPAIN			traffic vibrations of patrimony chapel; masonry historic constructions; finite element method modeling; ANSYS; serviceability limit conditions; peak sway ratio; peak accelerations		Because of traffic flow a 19th century chapel started exhibiting small cracks that have increased significantly in recently, due to the circulation of heavy vehicles to nearby construction sites. To study the influence of the different load-speed combinations of the vehicles on the damage mechanism, a finite element (FE) model of the chapel, soil and road was developed using commercial FE software. The model was calibrated with the help of field tests to indentify dynamic properties. With the FE model, the dynamic loads corresponding to vehicles moving along the road were simulated and the correspondent maximum accelerations of some chapel key points were obtained. The computed maximum accelerations of the chapel, using the model, were compared with the recommend and determined values that the building could endure without being affected.

To date, implemented traffic responsive motorway access control systems have been of local or regulatory type and not truly adaptive in the real sense of the meaning. Hence, traffic flow can be influenced positively by numerous intelligent transportation system (ITS) techniques. In this paper a contemporary approach is presented. It considers the design philosophy of an optimal and adaptive closed-loop multiple motorway access control strategy. The methodology proposed uses the artificial intelligence technique - known as reinforcement learning (RL) with multiple agents, and applies the Q-learning algorithm. One segment of the motorway network with three lanes in each direction and three motorway entries was designed. The detectors and traffic signals were placed at the entries (ramps). Traffic flows and traffic occupancy on the main line as well as the traffic demand on the motorway entries were taken as input model variables. The output variables referred to the travel speed on the corridor, the total travel time, and the total stop time. VISSIM micro-simulator and direct programming of the simulator functions were used in order to implement the RL technique. The peak hour was chosen for the time of simulation. The model was tested in two phases. Its effectiveness was compared to ALINEA. It was observed that the proposed strategy was capable of responding both to dynamic sensory inputs from the environment and to dynamically changing environment. The model of the environment and supervision were not required. The control policy changed as response to the inherent system characteristic changes. It was confirmed that the strategy was truly adaptive and real-time responsive to the traffic demand on the corridor.

Each of the entities, with their different properties, sets different requirements to road traffic system, including also other entities. Due to the large number of entities and their characteristic requirements, their interaction results in extremely complex relations which determine the behaviour of the road traffic system. The entities are combined according to their common features into certain groups, the movements of which usually result in conflicts. In such situations it is necessary to ensure the movement of a group of entities. This method of insurance necessarily creates negative consequences for all the entities that participate in road traffic system. In order to mitigate as much as possible these consequences, it is necessary to find an adequate method of optimising road traffic system according to a given criterion. The paper uses the results of the analysis of more than 100 road traffic system models and presents the methodology of determining the level of their interconnection. The level of influence of the basic traffic values on the final effect, i.e. the possibility of optimising signal-controlled intersections has been found and described.

Optimization of traffic flow through city arteries depends highly on the way traffic lights are coordinated, and making them sort of intelligent in some way seems to be an excellent natural ground for the application of the autonomous agents metaphor. This paper reports on our preliminary work using reactive agents to test such an approach. Our main contribution relies on integrating an agent-based API layer to enhance an open-source simulator (SUMO, in this paper) to support a MAS-based traffic control platform to devise and test intelligent control in urban network scenarios. Some results are presented and discussed, as well as are some future work suggested.

Dyson's gas is represented by particles located on a line or a circle. As the time is passing, the particles interact with each other and change their positions in order to lower the total potential energy of the gas. Development of the gas with a certain temperature can be simulated by the Metropolis algorithm based on the Monte Carlo method. Particles, which the gas contains of, can be statistically described by headway distribution and number variance. This allows us to check any particular implementation of the Metropolis algorithm because the analytical predictions of these characteristics are known. By choosing the right potential (the way particles interact with each other) and temperature we can make the particles behave the same way as vehicles on a road.

Risk assessment of transportation systems with network functionality losses	STRUCTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article						risk assessment; network systems; spatially distributed systems; direct loss; functional loss		The objective of this paper is to present a seismic risk assessment model for transportation network systems that includes the hazard exposure from ground shaking, liquefaction and landslides. Previous studies consider the risk from physical damage and loss of functionality of the network system due to a single scenario earthquake. The current paper extends these methods to include all possible events for complete risk curve estimation. Functionality loss is presented in terms of lack of connectivity, reduction in traffic flow and increase in travel time or length. The risk is provided in terms of the annual rate of exceeding monetary loss. The model is applied to the transportation network of five counties in the San Francisco Bay Area. The annual risk curve is generated based on the rate of occurrence of possible events and their corresponding loss. The loss due to commuter traffic delay is found to be higher than that from bridges damage.

Method: Drawing on Barcelona's local police census database on casualties (2002-2008), we use a parametric estimation based on an ordered multinomial logistic regression in order to identify factors affecting injury severity. We control for demographic characteristics, environment and traffic conditions, primary causes of accidents, and regulatory measures. Regressions distinguish PTW casualties from the rest of vehicles and present results for motorcycles and mopeds separately. Results: We confirm the higher vulnerability of PTW casualtiesespecially motorcycle casualties (OR 2.30)and show that factors such as gender, excess speed, road width, and alcohol consumption do affect casualty severity. Regarding traffic conditions, we find that congestion diminishes the probability of suffering severe injuries, although its statistical significance only appears for motorcycle casualties (odds ratio [OR] 0.80), which are also more severe due to speed violations (OR 6.29). Conclusions: We confirm the negative relationship between traffic flow (congestion) and injury severity of PTWs casualties. This is clearly identified, at least for motorcycle casualties, although moped casualties present similar impacts as well. As a result, alleviating congestion through PTWs promotion turns out to be a trade-off between congestion and safety that public officers must consider. The article also highlights the need of awareness campaigns and safety policies focused on specific groups of drivers. Attention should also be given to the enforcement of speed limits and alcohol restrictions in Barcelona.

J	Arasan, VT; Arkatkar, SS				Arasan, Venkatachalam Thamizh; Arkatkar, Shriniwas Shrikant			MODELLING HETEROGENEOUS TRAFFIC FLOW ON UPGRADES OF INTERCITY ROADS	TRANSPORT			English	Article						upgrade; power-to-weight ratio; acceleration rates; heterogeneous traffic; simulation; speed-volume relationships; speed-distance profiles	VARIABLE ANALYSIS PERIODS; SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS; RANKING	The effect of an upgrade and its length is very significant for traffic flow characteristics. Road traffic in developing countries like India is highly heterogeneous comprising vehicles of wide ranging physical dimensions, weight and dynamic characteristics such as engine power, acceleration rate, etc. Due to these variations, the effect of grade on vehicles in heterogeneous traffic may vary significantly among vehicle categories. Variation in the level of the interaction between vehicles on upgrades may result in different sets of traffic flow characteristics. Hence, it is necessary to model traffic flow on upgrades and study, in depth, changes in traffic flow characteristics with alteration in the magnitude of an upgrade and its length. Computer simulation has emerged as an effective technique for modelling traffic flow due to its capability to account for randomness related to traffic. This study is concerned with applying a simulation model of heterogeneous traffic flow, named HETEROSIM, to study the traffic flow characteristics and performance of different vehicle types on upgrades of different magnitudes.

Vilnius is a centre of business, industry and tourism, and therefore traffic intensity remains the highest in this part of the country. The intensity of vehicle traffic is not only generally calculated but also simultaneously classified which means is divided predefining vehicles into beforehand established categories. Data on traffic flows are used in a road maintenance program for calculating and assessing air pollution, ensuring traffic safety, regulating traffic flows etc. The article presents the methods for measuring traffic intensity which are and were used for calculating traffic intensity not only in the streets of Vilnius but also across Lithuania. Data on vehicle intensity and classification are collected either using technologies (loop and tube detectors, counters and video detectors) or expressing them visually. The article presents the dynamics of changes in the traffic volume on the roads of Lithuania for the period 2000-2009. Also, this article examines traffic intensity of all transport means, including trucks in the permanent traffic volume measuring stations that were installed near the roads in Vilnius zone (data on traffic for the period 2005-2009) and the streets of Vilnius city (data on traffic for the period 2007-2009). Data on traffic intensity were obtained by the Road Research Laboratory of the Road Department of Vilnius Gediminas Technical University in cooperation with the State Enterprise Transport and Road Research Institute (TRRI).

Based on the analysis of a variety of factors influencing the public transit network, quantitative research has been conducted with reference to the attribute recognition theory in order to make scientific decision-making. On the basis of defining attribute measure, this paper presents the attribute recognition model suggesting the attribute recognition theory that can be used to evaluate the public transit network. The reliability of the new method can be explained using real data of the survey on the public transit network in China. The applied results offer scientific reference for instructing and controlling urban traffic by the Government. The main advantages of the new model are in contexts where internal linkage and shared inputs between activities can be considered. The structure of this mode is more realistic than that of the conventional one.

Managing network mobility with tradable credits. Transportation Research Part B (in press)" by considering heterogeneous users in terms of their different value of time (VOT). As travelers are observationally indistinguishable in their VOT, the tradable credit scheme is anonymous: the social planner initially distributes a certain (O-D specific or uniform) number of credits to all eligible travelers, charges a link-specific number of credits from travelers using that link, and allows for free trading of the credits among travelers. Unlike the homogeneous user case, no equivalent convex program is identified whose KKT conditions yield the traffic and market equilibrium conditions in the presence of user heterogeneity. Instead, the traffic equilibrium and credit market equilibrium conditions are formulated into a variational inequalities (VI) problem. The existence and uniqueness of traffic flow and credit price at equilibrium are investigated.

The applications in Advanced Traveler Information System (ATIS) and Advanced Traffic Management Aystem (ATMS) require the forecasting of traffic pattern to the near future. In contrast to the strategic models which predict over a period of month or year for long-term planning purposes, short-term models forecast traffic conditions within a day or a few hours that capture the dynamics of traffic, and are suitable for traffic management and information systems. A wide variety of short-term traffic forecasting problems have been investigated during past decades. An earlier comprehensive overview was given by Vlahogianni et al. (2004). Usage of input data would separate the forecasting techniques into univariate and multivariate approaches (Makridakis and Wheelwright, 1978). Univariate methods assumed that utilizing the historical time series data of a single variable is sufficient to detect the basic pattern for forecasting. Among the univariate models, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model has been successfully applied in many areas and proved for its advantages over some other forecasting methods (Williams et al., 1998; Smith et al., 2002). Multivariate methods assumed there exists some relationships between two or more variables, and this pattern or trend can be extrapolated into the future (Stathopoulos and Karlaftis, 2003). This approach enables the modeling of the relationship of traffic measurements at different locations. The modelling of spatial-temporal domain of traffic data in urban area has been receiving attention in the recent years. Yang (2006) developed a spatial-temporal Kalman filter (STKF) forecasting model to compare with ARIMA and neural network (NN). An adaptive forecasting model selection strategy was proposed, which selects STKF with real-time data, but switch to use historical average method if real-time data was not available. Ghosh et al. (2009) proposed a structural time-series model methodology, which considers explicitly the trend, seasonal, cyclical, and calendar variations of traffic pattern, with the model flexibility that the immediate upstream junctions can be incorporated in the model as explanatory variables for the downstream predictions. In this paper, the space-time ARIMA (STARIMA) is used to investigate the spatial-temporal relationship and forecasting of urban traffic flow. Following the successful implements of ARIMA in the single location traffic prediction, a natural extension is to develop the multivariate version of the model with spatial-temporal domain. The space-time ARIMA model was firstly proposed by Pfeifer and Deutsch (1980), and is characterized by the autoregressive and moving average forms of several univariate time series lagged in both space and time. As compared to the ARIMA model, the calibrated model of STARIMA has the advantage with its small number of parameters, requiring fulfillment of rigorous statistical tests. A case study using the traffic data from 24 vehicle detectors in Taipei city, Taiwan are used to illustrate the performance of the model, and it is shown that STARIMA model are suitable for traffic flows forecasting in urban area.

Roadway crashes are used as a proxy measure for road safety. Traffic safety is impacted not only by the road geometry but also by weather and traffic flow characteristics. Most of the studies till now have investigated the impact of these factors on the road safety individually but a comprehensive study which investigates the combined effects is needed. A crash risk probability model linking physical, weather and traffic flow factors is developed. Data used to develop the model include the road geometry information, historical crash records and traffic detector data from Tokyo Metropolitan Expressway, weather data from Japan Meteorological Agency. Developed model can be used to conduct scenario analysis to develop a highway operations management plan which can minimise the crash risks under varying weather and traffic conditions.

This study explores both vehicle delay and emissions near signalized intersections by using the cell transmission model (CTM). CTM is a kind of mesoscopic traffic simulation model that offers the advantage of simplicity and computation speed compared with microscopic models and accuracy compared with macroscopic models. To validate the effectiveness of CTM in modeling delay and emissions, comparisons with a microscopic car following model and macroscopic models, are carried out on a real road network in Hong Kong.

J	Chiu, YC; Zhou, L; Song, HB				Chiu, Yi-Chang; Zhou, Liang; Song, Houbing			Development and calibration of the Anisotropic Mesoscopic Simulation model for uninterrupted flow facilities	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Mesoscopic; Traffic simulation; Anisotropic; Dynamic traffic assignment; Speed Influencing Region	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; WAVES	This paper presents the development, analysis, and calibration of the Anisotropic Mesoscopic Simulation (AMS) model for uninterrupted flow facilities, such as freeways. The proposed AMS model is a vehicle-based mesoscopic traffic simulation approach that explicitly considers the anisotropic property of traffic flow into the vehicle state update at each simulation step. The advantage of AMS is its ability to address a variety of uninterrupted flow conditions in a relatively simple, unified and computationally efficient manner. The discussions focus on the key modeling concepts, the analytical properties and numerical analysis, and the calibration process and results. The addressed analytical properties are the overtaking conditions, acceleration and deceleration rate bounds, and shock-waves. The numerical analysis includes both freeway segments as well as merging junctions. Considerable efforts were devoted to employ the Next-Generation Simulation (NGSIM) program datasets to calibrate the AMS model parameters. The high traffic fidelity and satisfactory computational efficiency make AMS a promising simulation approach for large-scale regional dynamic traffic simulation and assignment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ko, J; Guensler, R; Hunter, M				Ko, Joonho; Guensler, Randall; Hunter, Michael			Analysis of effects of driver/vehicle characteristics on acceleration noise using GPS-equipped vehicles	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						Driver behavior; Vehicle effect; Traffic conditions; Acceleration noise; Global positioning system; Instrumented vehicles	STABILITY	Researchers have used acceleration noise, defined by the standard deviation of accelerations of a vehicle, as an attempt to measure the quality of traffic flow. As a potential indicator of traffic flow quality, acceleration noise has been considered to be capable of reflecting vehicle/driver-roadway-traffic interactions within a traffic stream. However, this proposition, in particular for the driver/vehicle, has seldom been investigated, mainly due to the difficulty of data collection. This paper reports the results of an analysis of the effects of driver/vehicle characteristics on acceleration noise using global positioning system (GPS)-equipped instrumented vehicle data obtained from four freeway segments. In the analysis, speed models were developed and compared with acceleration noise models. In addition, the effects were investigated by traffic condition levels defined by the density-based level of service. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Exploring the 'who' and the 'how' of social influences on speeding from a qualitative perspective	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						Speeding; Akers' social learning theory; Deterrence; Road safety; Normative influence; Self-presentation; Impression management	PLANNED BEHAVIOR; LEGAL SANCTIONS; DRIVERS; EMBARRASSMENT; PASSENGERS; INTENTION; VIOLATIONS; DRINKING; BELIEFS; ALCOHOL	Using only legal sanctions to manage the speed at which people drive ignores the potential benefits of harnessing social factors such as the influence of others. Social influences on driving speeds were explored in this qualitative examination of 67 Australian drivers. Focus group interviews with 8 driver types (young, mid-age and older males and females, and self-identified Excessive and Rare speeders) were guided by Akers' social learning theory (Akers, 1998). Findings revealed two types of influential others: people known to the driver (passengers and parents), and unknown other drivers. Passengers were generally described as having a slowing influence on drivers: responsibility for the safety of people in the car and consideration for passenger comfort were key themes. In contrast, all but the Rare speeders reported increasing their speed when driving alone. Parental role modelling was also described. In relation to other drivers, key themes included speeding to keep up with traffic flow and perceived pressure to drive faster. This 'pressure' from others to 'speed up' was expressed in all groups and reported strategies for managing this varied. Encouragingly, examples of actual or anticipated social rewards for speeding were less common than examples of social punishments. Three main themes relating to social punishments were embarrassment, breaching the trust of others, and presenting an image of a responsible driver. Impression management and self-presentation are discussed in light of these findings. Overall, our findings indicate scope to exploit the use of social sanctions for speeding and social praise for speed limit compliance to enhance speed management strategies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Moridpour, S; Sarvi, M; Rose, G				Moridpour, Sara; Sarvi, Majid; Rose, Geoff			Modeling the Lane-Changing Execution of Multiclass Vehicles Under Heavy Traffic Conditions	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								In general, existing lane-changing behavior models focus on drivers' lane-changing decisions and neglect lane-changing execution. However, a lane-changing maneuver is likely to require several seconds for execution. Excluding lane-changing execution may have a significant effect on estimated traffic flow characteristics, particularly under heavy traffic conditions (level of service E). Acceleration and deceleration behaviors of heavy vehicle and passenger car drivers during the execution of a lane-changing maneuver are compared and contrasted. In addition, separate acceleration and deceleration models are developed for heavy vehicles and passenger cars during the lane change. The vehicle trajectory data set used in this research reflects heavy traffic conditions. Analysis of heavy vehicle drivers' lane-changing execution reveals that drivers maintained an almost constant speed during the maneuver; this suggests that they did not accelerate or decelerate to adjust their speeds according to the speed of surrounding traffic in the target lane. However, passenger car drivers do accelerate to adjust their speeds according to the speeds of the lead and lag vehicles in the target lane. The results highlight differences in the behavior of heavy vehicle and passenger car drivers during lane-changing execution.

This report documents accelerated bridge construction (ABC) techniques used to remove and replace the 4500 South Bridge on State Route 266 over Interstate 215 in Salt Lake City during a weekend. It includes construction details of the bridge superstructure built offsite on temporary abutments and prefabricated and cast-in-place bridge components and substructure built under the existing bridge without interfering with traffic flow. It also discusses use of a self-propelled modular transporter (SPMT) to remove the old bridge and to replace it with a new one. With conventional construction, the impact of this project on the traveling public was estimated at 120 days, but with accelerated construction techniques the impact was reduced to a single weekend for I-215 and 10 days for State Route 266. Using an SPMT and other ABC techniques added about $0.81 million to the initial construction cost of the project. However, a more comprehensive economic analysis including user cost savings shows that the project saved road users about $3.24 million (or about 36% of the total project costs). Because of the success of this project, the Utah DOT has decided to use ABC techniques more routinely in future projects and has set a goal of making ABC standard practice for all bridges by 2010.

Truck Acceleration Speeds and Distances at Weigh Stations	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Tractor-trailer trucks accelerating on freeway entry ramps and entering the main traffic lanes require greater lengths to accelerate than do passenger vehicles. As freeway volumes have grown over the decades, entry ramp junction designs that were once adequate now experience congestion at weigh stations and other locations where higher volumes of trucks enter the freeway. The acceleration lengths and speeds of tractor-trailers accelerating onto freeways were measured at five vehicle weigh stations. Other data obtained and analyzed included truck weights, freeway volumes, and freeway grades. Models were developed to predict tractor-trailer speed over given acceleration lengths. From the analysis, it was concluded that longer acceleration lanes were needed for heavy vehicles leaving weigh stations to accelerate to speeds closer to the speeds on the main lanes and to be less disruptive to freeway traffic flow as the heavy vehicles merge into the main lanes. The findings also have implications for establishing the location of weigh stations, the spacing of freeway interchanges, and the setting of freeway speed limits.	[Gattis, J.

J	Idewu, WIA; Wolshon, B				Idewu, Wakeel I. A.; Wolshon, Brian			Joint Merge and Its Impact on Merging Speeds in Lane Reduction Areas of Construction Zone	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								To increase the efficiency and safety of traffic flow in the vicinity of lane reduction transition areas, engineers have begun to use innovative techniques to facilitate traffic flow through these bottleneck areas. One technique, alternating merging, encourages drivers to take turns when merging in freeway lanes and ramps. This paper discusses the development of the joint merge, a new traffic control design that facilitates alternating merge patterns, along with the results of a field experiment to examine its effects on traffic flow. The key feature of the joint merge design is its two-sided taper in which both approach lanes are reduced simultaneously into a single lane, thereby eliminating an assigned lane priority. To evaluate its effect on traffic, a field study was conducted in which a joint merge configuration was erected in a live, work intensity controlled work zone in Louisiana. Lane-specific volume and vehicle speeds in the joint merge were compared with those observed in a conventional merge design at the same site. Overall, merging speeds were found to be relatively similar at volumes ranging from 600 to 1,200 vehicles per hour and did not affect the discharge rate at the merge outflow point. However, the experimental results did suggest that drivers were more cautious in their merging maneuvers. This was thought to be attributable to the joint merge, which produced a more evenly balanced lane volume at the transition zone entrance.	[Idewu, Wakeel I.

J	Brilon, W; Estel, A				Brilon, Werner; Estel, Anja			Differentiated Analysis of Level of Service F Within the German Highway Capacity Manual	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								In the American as well as the German Highway Capacity Manual, the quality of service that is determined by different measures of effectiveness can be described by six levels of service. While there are five levels (A to E) to distinguish undersaturated flow conditions, only one level of service (LOS) describes congestion. A differentiation of oversaturated traffic flow conditions (LOS F) is not possible so far. As traffic networks have become more and more congested this is insufficient, and instruments are needed to identify the worst bottlenecks. The paper presents approaches for a division of LOS F into differentiated sublevels of saturated flow (F1 to F4) and proposes corresponding calculation methods. Different traffic flow models and queuing equations are considered for the estimation of travel times as a function of traffic demand. Four potential methods for standardization are discussed that differ in the performance measures used. They are described by using freeway sections as an example, but they can be applied for all types of road facilities. The methods are analyzed and compared in terms of their significance, their sensitivity, and the availability of input data. On that basis, a 24-h analysis of traffic performance is recommended for implementation within the guidelines because it is able to evaluate congestion in a multidimensional way. The evaluation methods developed within this research can be used to access the quality of service on existing congested facilities depending on traffic demand. They can help decision making and ensure that funds are spent efficiently.

J	Jin, WL				Jin, Wen-Long			Macroscopic Characteristics of Lane-Changing Traffic	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							WEAVING SECTIONS; FLOW; DENSITY; MODEL; FREEWAYS; HIGHWAY; 2-LANE; WAVES; ROADS	On a multilane roadway, systematic lane changes can seriously disrupt traffic flow and cause capacity reductions. Therefore it is important to understand the characteristics of lane-changing traffic flow. In a previous study, a new variable, lane-changing intensity, was theoretically derived by doubling the contribution to the total density of a lane-changing vehicle during its lane-changing period, and an intensity density relation was incorporated into the fundamental diagram to capture such bottleneck effects at the aggregate level. In this study, a new interpretation of lane-changing intensity is proposed by following Edie's definition of traffic density. Detailed studies of macroscopic characteristics of lane-changing traffic with 75 min of vehicle trajectories collected for a freeway section on I-80 near San Francisco, California, by FHWA's next-generation simulation project are presented. About 10% misindentified lane changes are excluded. For different time intervals, cell sizes, and locations, the well-definedness of the lane-changing intensity variable and the intensity density relation are verified.

Freeway Sensor Spacing and Probe Vehicle Penetration Impacts on Travel Time Prediction and Estimation Accuracy	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Accurate travel time prediction-estimation is important for advanced traveler information systems and advanced traffic management systems. Traffic managers and operators are interested in estimating optimal sensor density for new construction and retrofits. In addition, with the development of vehicle-tracking technologies, they may be interested in estimating optimal probe vehicle percentage. Unlike most studies focusing on data-driven models, this paper extends some limited previous work and describes a concept developed from first principles of traffic flow. The goal is to establish analytical relationships between travel time prediction-estimation accuracy and sensor spacing by means of two basic travel time prediction-estimation algorithms, as well as to probe vehicle penetration rate. The methods are based on computing the magnitude of under- and overprediction-estimation of total travel time (TTT) during shock passages in a time-space plane by using the midpoint method for online travel time prediction and the Coifman method for offline travel time estimation. Three shock wave configurations are assessed with each method so as to consider representative traffic dynamics situations. TTT prediction-estimation errors are calculated and expressed as a function of sensor spacing and probe vehicle percentage. Optimal sensor spacing is calculated with consideration of the tradeoff between TTT estimation error and sensor deployment cost. The results from this study can provide simple and effective support for detector placement and probe vehicle deployment, especially along a freeway corridor with existing detectors. Optimal sensor spacing results are analyzed and compared for various methods of travel time estimation during different types of shock waves.

Many forecasting models have been developed for this purpose since the 1970s. Recently kernel-based machine learning methods such as support vector machines (SVMs) have gained special attention in traffic flow modeling and other time series analyses because of their outstanding generalization capability and superior nonlinear approximation. In this study, a novel kernel-based machine learning method, the Gaussian processes (GPs) model, was proposed to perform short-term traffic flow forecasting. This GP model was evaluated and compared with SVMs and autoregressive integrated moving average (AMNIA) models based on four sets of traffic volume data collected from three interstate highways in Seattle, Washington. The comparative results showed that the GP and SVM models consistently outperformed the ARIMA model. This study also showed that because the GP model is formulated in a full Bayesian framework, it can allow for explicit probabilistic interpretation of forecasting outputs. This capacity gives the GP an advantage over SVMs to model and forecast traffic flow.

For the estimation of capacity distribution functions based on empirical traffic data, different methodologies were developed and applied. The consistency of these estimation methods for different types of capacity distributions is analyzed. A macroscopic simulation model is used to assess to what extent a given capacity distribution function can be reproduced with the estimation methods. It is found that consistent capacity estimations are obtained only by applying methods based on statistical models for censored data.

J	Wei, T; Jarboe, P				Wei, Ting; Jarboe, Paul			Integration of Traffic Simulation into Design Visualization Case Study	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Traditionally, design visualization for transportation projects has focused on the transportation facility's appearance. Traffic elements (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians) generally have not been important. With the increasing popularity of three-dimensional (3-D) animation, however, realistic traffic movements are becoming a critical part in design visualization because they effectively illustrate to the public how a transportation facility operates from the perspectives of the driver and the overall system. The public is interested not only in how a system "looks" but also in how it "works." One challenge facing transportation professionals is how to incorporate realistic traffic movements into a photorealistic visualization. On the one hand, 3-D modeling software that produces photorealistic visualization generally cannot produce realistic traffic movements. On the other hand, traffic simulation software that produces realistic traffic movements generally cannot produce photorealistic visualization. This paper describes a case study in which VISSIM, a microscopic simulation program for multimodal traffic flow, and 3ds Max, a modeling, animation, and rendering package, were used to integrate traffic simulation into a design visualization for the Keystone Avenue Project in Carmel, Indiana. This project involved the upgrade of six at-grade, signalized intersections along Keystone Avenue to six teardrop roundabout interchanges. The case study successfully incorporated realistic traffic movements into a photorealislic visualization through a four-step process. The integration of traffic simulation into design visualization has proved beneficial in combining the strength of 3-D modeling software and traffic simulation software and is likely to be applied further to transportation projects. A few points of guidance are provided to assist future applications.

J	Bella, F; D'Agostini, G				Bella, Francesco; D'Agostini, Giulia			Combined Effect of Traffic and Geometrics on Rear-End Collision Risk Driving Simulator Study	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							VEHICLES; DRIVERS	This paper presents the results of a laboratory experiment that sought to analyze rear-end collision risk under various traffic conditions and given various road geometric configurations. The CRISS (Inter-University Research Center for Road Safety) interactive fixed-base driving simulator was used. An 8-km, two-lane, rural road that incorporated 15 tangents and curves was designed and implemented in the driving simulator. Four distinct traffic conditions were simulated, and 32 drivers drove in four traffic scenarios. The differences in speed and position between each driver's vehicle and other vehicles on the road were collected to calculate two safety indicators, which the scientific literature has suggested to evaluate rear-end collision risk on the basis of the time-to-collision (TTC) notion. The maximum values of these indicators were given for an average traffic-flow condition, which is therefore the most critical condition for rear-end collision risk. In scenarios that entailed lower traffic volumes, significant models of TTC-based indicators were found for tangents with lengths that ranged from 400 m to 1,000 m. The independent significant variables were volume-to-capacity ratio, length of the tangent, and length of the curve approaching the tangent. In traffic scenarios characterized by higher traffic volumes, no significant models were found for any kind of geometric element. This outcome seems to prove that the influence of the geometric features on the rear-end collision risk tends to become negligible whenever the volume-to-capacity ratio reaches high levels. In these conditions driver behavior is exclusively affected by interactions among vehicles.

J	Wang, MH; Benekohal, RF				Wang, Ming-Heng; Benekohal, Rahim (Ray) F.			Analysis of Left-Turn Saturation Flow Rates and Capacity at Signalized Intersections	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								This study investigated and developed left-turn saturation flow rate models by considering the operation characteristics of left-turn traffic and the arrival and departure types of the opposing traffic. Methodologies for measuring left-turn saturation flow rates and capacity were proposed for the protected-then-permitted phasing with an exclusive left-turn lane at signalized intersections. The permitted left-turn saturation flow rate was developed on the basis of the opposing nonplatoon flow rate during the unblocked (unsaturated) time instead of using average opposing flow rates during the entire green time. The results of simulation show that the protected left-turn saturation flow rate is about 0.97, 0.96, or 0.95 of the saturated through traffic flow rate when opposed by one, two, or three lanes, respectively. The permitted left-turn saturation flow rate depends not only on the opposing flow rate but also on the number of opposing lanes. For facing multiple opposing lanes, the left-turn saturation flow rate decreased by 8% to 57% compared to facing only a single opposing lane. Even for multiple opposing lanes, additional reductions in the left-turn saturation flow rate, when facing three versus two opposing lanes, ranged from 8% to 18%. The estimation of the left-turn capacity using the proposed models was validated by comparing the capacity from the simulation.

TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							COLLISION; TIME	A microsimulation model and its calculations are described, and the results that are subsequently used to determine indicators for traffic safety are presented The method demonstrates which changes occur at the level of traffic flow (number of vehicles per section of road) and at the vehicle level (vehicles choosing different routes) The best known safety indicator in this type of model is the conflict situation, in which two vehicles approach each other and, if no action is taken, a crash will occur These conflict situations are detected in the simulation model This method does not necessarily relate directly to any actual observed conflicts or recorded crashes The quantitative relationship is examined between detected conflicts at junctions in the model and recorded crashes at the same locations in the real world The methods chosen for detecting conflicts and for selecting crashes are explained A microsimulation model was constructed for a regional road network The conflicts in this network were detected, and the recorded crashes were selected The results show a quantitative relationship between the number of conflicts at priority junctions and the number of passing motor vehicles on one hand and the number of observed crashes on the other hand When crashes and conflicts are divided into crash categories, junctions with signals clearly show substantial differences between the relative numbers of frontal crashes and frontal conflicts.

There is a dearth of research on urban arterials with mixed-traffic patterns in China, however, because of the large traffic flow volume of bicyclists and pedestrians in most Chinese cities. This study investigates the risk factors associated with severe crash occurrences on arterial roads in Beijing. Through use of the generalized estimating equations modeling technique with a negative binomial link function, statistical relationships were established to relate severe crashes to a variety of factors related to geometric design, traffic control, and other traffic-related characteristics. Crash records from 2004 to 2007 for 108 signalized intersections and 123.5 km of road segments were used to estimate the models. Results showed that arterial roads with heavier traffic volumes, more road lanes, and higher speed limits tended to have more severe crashes. Medians were helpful in reducing severe crash risk. Higher risks of severe crashes were generally associated with intersections having small angles and countdown signals and road segments having higher side-access densities and the presence of bus stops. With regard to nonmotorist protection facilities, results revealed that a combined use of crosswalks and overpasses was the most desired pedestrian-crossing facility for safety, especially at sites with heavy traffic or sites located in primarily residential areas. Barriers that separated bikeways from roadways on minor roads were found effective in significantly reducing severe crash risk at intersections.

J	Datla, S; Sharma, S				Datla, Sandeep; Sharma, Satish			Variation of Impact of Cold Temperature and Snowfall and Their Interaction on Traffic Volume	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							WEATHER	This paper presents a detailed investigation of highway traffic variations with severity of cold, the amount of snow, and various combinations of cold and snow intensities. Separate analyses for starting, middle, and ending months of winter seasons are conducted to study the variations in traffic-weather relationships within the winter season. The study is based on hourly traffic flow data from 350 permanent traffic counter sites located on the provincial highway system of Alberta, Canada, and weather data obtained from nearby Environment Canada weather stations, from 1995 to 2005. Multiple regression analysis is used in the modeling process. The model parameters include three sets of variables: the amount of snowfall as a quantitative variable, categorized cold as a dummy variable, and an interaction variable formed by the product of these two variables. The study results indicate that the association of highway traffic flow with cold and snow varies with day of week, hour of day, and severity of weather conditions. A reduction of 1% to 2% in traffic volume for each centimeter of snowfall is observed when the mean temperature is above 0 degrees C. For the days with zero precipitation, reductions in traffic volume due to mild and severe cold are 1% and 31%, respectively. An additional reduction of 0.5% to 3% per centimeter of snowfall results when snowfall occurs during severe cold conditions. Study results show lesser impact of adverse weather conditions on traffic during severe winter months (mid-November to mid-March) and the months thereafter compared with early (starting) winter months.

The requirements of a large amount of data and unstable traffic flow are the biggest challenges to such a system. The models and software framework thus should be effective enough to face these problems. The core of such a system is the short-term traffic flow forecast model. Rapid urbanization and transportation development in Beijing have led to traffic flow patterns with some unstable characteristics. The short-term forecast model for an online system thus was designed with the fast-paced trend in mind. The model considers historical data, real-time data, and space data, and it can be updated online. Thus a combined model was developed with three submodels: discrete Fourier transform model, autoregressive model, and neighborhood regression model. Weights of each submodel were based on forecast error. Both the historical forecast error and real-time forecast error were considered. The system was built on a browser server structure to support combined forecast models. The framework, modules, and interface of this system are introduced in this paper.

Several approaches, methodologies, and techniques have been presented for analyzing and forecasting traffic counts because such information has been identified as vital for the deployment of advanced transportation management and information systems. In this paper, a meta-analysis framework is presented for improving forecasted information of traffic counts, based on an adaptive data processing scheme. In particular, a framework for combining traffic count forecasts within a Mamdani-type fuzzy adaptive optimal control scheme is presented and analyzed. The proposed methodology treats the uncertainty pertaining to such circumstances by augmenting qualitative information of future traffic flow states (and values) with a knowledge base and a heuristic optimization routine that provides dynamic training capabilities, resulting in an efficient real-time forecasting mechanism. Results from the application of the proposed framework on data acquired from realistic signalized urban network data (of Athens, Greece) and for a diversity of locations exhibit its potential.

Roundabouts in Signalized Corridors Evaluation of Traffic Flow Impacts	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Typically, roundabouts in the United States are installed at isolated intersections to address location-specific safety or operational needs. The use of roundabouts in signalized corridors, however, has not been well evaluated. It is commonly believed that roundabouts can improve traffic flow and travel speeds along an urban corridor by reducing delay caused by idling at intersections. Concern exists, however, that a roundabout in a coordinated signalized corridor will disrupt continuous traffic flow: downstream signals can more efficiently process vehicles in a platoon, and roundabouts disperse rather than form platoons. Roundabouts also can discharge vehicles more efficiently when traffic arrives randomly. Thus unnecessary queuing may result when roundabouts are downstream of signalized intersections. Since little research was available to compare the traffic flow impacts of roundabouts within a signalized corridor, two case studies were evaluated with the microscopic traffic simulation package, VISSIM. A roundabout and two signalized alternatives, as well as a roundabout and a four-way, stop-controlled alternative, were compared at intersections along signalized corridors in Ames, Iowa, and Woodbury, Minnesota, respectively. The traffic data and corridor geometry were coded into VISSIM, and traditional intersection traffic control within the corridors was compared with a scenario that had a two-lane roundabout. With the microsimulation software, average travel time, stopped delay, and average delay for the entire corridor were compared.

Modeling Vehicular Merging Behavior Under Heterogeneous Traffic Conditions	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							SIMULATION; FLOW	In developing countries such as India, the traffic on roads is highly heterogeneous in nature, with vehicles of widely varying static and dynamic characteristics. This type of traffic is characterized by lack of lane discipline and free movement over the entire width of the roadway (laneless movement) based on availability of space. In such a regime of traffic flow, the phenomenon of merging of vehicles at junctions of two roads is complex and warrants further study. Merging maneuvers at T-junctions under congested traffic conditions were studied microscopically through video recordings. On the basis of these observations, models for normal and forced merging have been developed. Video data of merging maneuvers were employed to calibrate and validate the models. Such models can be used to simulate highly congested traffic flow in a realistic manner under heterogeneous traffic conditions. They can also give insight on devising better traffic control measures at such junctions.

J	Miwa, T; Okada, Y; Morikawa, T				Miwa, Tomio; Okada, Yoshiyuki; Morikawa, Takayuki			Applying a Structured Dispersion Parameter to Multiclass Stochastic User Equilibrium Assignment Model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT; MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; SYSTEMS	In recent practical transportation planning in Japan, the adoption of stochastic user equilibrium assignment models for traffic assessment has been discussed. Such models include a dispersion parameter that accounts for drivers' errors in perception of travel time at the time of route choice decision. In practice, setting a rational value for this parameter is an issue. Generally, the dispersion parameter is exogenously set to the same value for all origin destination (O-D) pairs. However, it is not guaranteed that errors in drivers' perception of travel costs are equal for all O-D pairs. This study examines how the parameter is set and applies a multiclass stochastic user equilibrium assignment model to consider differences in drivers' errors in perception of travel costs in using an existing general-purpose road network. Results show that changes in the dispersion parameter affect the user class flows that make up the link flows rather than the link flows themselves. Setting a dispersion parameter according to the travel cost of an O-D pair rather than setting a constant parameter improves the reproducibility of the user class flows on each link. These findings encourage practical transportation planners to evaluate qualitative measures of traffic flows in the road network, such as the utilization of road links.

J	Robinson, RM; Khattak, A				Robinson, R. Michael; Khattak, Asad			Route Change Decision Making by Hurricane Evacuees Facing Congestion	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Successful evacuations of metropolitan areas require overcoming unexpected congestion that reduces traffic flows. Congestion may result from accidents, incidents, or other events that reduce road capacity. Traffic professionals and emergency managers may promote deviations from planned routes to bypass an area of congestion and speed mass exit. However, some route changes may actually reduce traffic flow rates, and in these cases decision makers may want to discourage use of alternate routes. By using results of a behavioral survey of potential hurricane evacuees, this study identifies variables associated with the decision to alter routes and also identifies frequently used information sources. A dynamic traffic simulation with a decision-making model using this information is proposed as a means for evacuation decision makers to assess impacts of driver decisions. Results from more than 800 responses showed the potentially strong influence of effective advanced traveler information systems to support decisions made by hurricane evacuees on whether to use an alternate route when faced with congestion. Results of this study are a timely contribution to those seeking a better understanding of driver behavior during evacuations and improvement of emergency management efficiency and efficacy.

The data methodology centers on the notion that it is better to sample a varied group of real drivers when the subjects are unaware that an experiment is being conducted. This contrasts with the methods used to calibrate most conventional models. The analysis focuses on determining possible causal factors, beyond the kinematic variables most often used, that could play a role in real traffic. These factors include various human characteristics (e.g., gender and distractions related to in-vehicle conditions like telephoning and vehicle occupancy); traffic and road characteristics (e.g., type of vehicle, congestion level, and location of driving lane); and environmental characteristics (e.g., time of day and weather conditions).

J	Wu, WX; Huang, HJ				Wu, Wen-Xiang; Huang, Hai-Jun			A new model for studying the SO-based pre-trip information release strategy and route choice behaviour	TRANSPORTMETRICA			English	Article						information release strategy; travel time adjustment; logit-based route choice; system optimum	URBAN FREEWAY CONGESTION; TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS; STOCHASTIC EQUILIBRIUM; TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT; MARKET PENETRATION; DYNAMICAL-SYSTEMS; USER ADOPTION; STABILITY; DEMAND	In reality, the predictive traffic information is rarely perfect. It is thus a rational assumption that travellers would not be completely in compliance with the guidance by advanced traveller information systems (ATIS). This article presents a Markovian decision programming (MDP) model for investigating the day-to-day receiving and adjusting process to the pre-trip information released by ATIS at route level. The goal is to seek an optimal information release strategy (IRS) for minimising the overall disutility under the assumption that travellers' route choice is governed by a logit model on the base of adopted travel times. The properties of the model solution are analysed. It is found that there exists an optimal IRS that can drive the flow pattern to a system optimum (SO) if the behaviour adjustment parameter satisfies a condition as 0 <= alpha < 1. The predictive information provided to drivers results in the oscillation of traffic flow among alternative routes when alpha >= 1. The solution of the MDP model is obtained by solving a series of sequential minimisation programs. The model and algorithm are numerically verified on a test network.

The electronic and manual collection vehicles sort themselves into their respective lanes at low density, while they mix at each tollgate at high density. We derive the fundamental diagrams (flow-density diagrams) for the electronic and manual collection vehicles. The traffic states change with increasing density and varying the ratio. Dynamical phase transitions occur. It is shown that the fundamental diagrams for the two tollgates depend greatly on the density and fraction of both vehicles. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Song, YK; Zhao, XM				Song Yu-Kun; Zhao Xiao-Mei			Combined bottleneck effect of on-ramp and bus stop in a cellular automaton model	CHINESE PHYSICS B			English	Article						cellular automaton model; combined bottleneck; bus stop; on-ramp	TRAFFIC-FLOW; PHASE-TRANSITION; INTERSECTION; CAPACITY; SYSTEMS; LANE	The combined bottleneck effect is investigated by modeling traffic systems with an on-ramp and a nearby bus stop in a two-lane cellular automaton model. Two cases, i.e. the bus stop locates in the downstream section of the on-ramp and the bus stop locates in the upstream section of the on-ramp, are considered separately. The upstream flux and downstream flux of the main road, as well as the on-ramp flux are analysed in detail, with respect to the entering probabilities and the distance between the on-ramp and the bus stop. It is found that the combination of the two bottlenecks causes the capacity to drop off, because the vehicles entering the main road from the on-ramp would interweave with the stopping (pulling-out) buses in the downstream (upstream) case. The traffic conflict in the former case is much heavier than that in the latter, causing the downstream main road to be utilized inefficiently. This suggests that the bus stop should be set in the upstream section of the on-ramp to enhance the capacity. The fluxes both on the main road and on the on-ramp vary with the distance between the two bottlenecks in both cases. However, the effects of distance disappear gradually at large distances. These findings might give some guidance to traffic optimization and management.

RVCs perform the information communication service offer from road to vehicle whereas the IVCs perform the information communication through vehicles. This work proposes quality of service (QoS)-aware roadside base station assisted routing mechanisms to establish a routing path in IVC with the assistance of roadside base station. A link failure prevention mechanism is employed to effectively construct alternative routing path required by the volatile network topology in vehicular Ad hoc networks. Besides, a bandwidth consumption predictor is presented to avoid dropping packets owing to inadequate bandwidth during handoffs. A neural network with fast learning algorithm is adopted as the core module for estimating the parameters used in the proposed schemes.

A novel self-organizing fuzzy rule-based system for modelling traffic flow behaviour	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow modelling; Fuzzy rule-based system; Self-organizing network; Automatic knowledge extraction	GENSOFNN	The study and development of transportation systems have been a focus of attention in recent years, with many research efforts directed in particular at modelling traffic behaviour from both macroscopic and microscopic points of views. Although many statistical regression models of road traffic relationships have been formulated, they have proven to be unsuitable due to multiple and ill-defined traffic characteristics. Alternative methods Such as neural networks have thus been sought but, despite some promising results, their design remains problematic and implementation is equally difficult. Another salient issue is that the opaqueness of trained networks prevents understanding the underlying models. Hybrid neuro-fuzzy rule-based systems, which combine the complementary capabilities of both neural networks and fuzzy logic, constitute a more promising technique for modelling traffic flow. This paper describes the application of a specific class of neuro-fuzzy system known as the Pseudo Outer-Product Fuzzy-Neural Network using Truth-Value-Restriction method (POPFNN-TVR) for modelling traffic behaviour. This approach has been shown to perform better on such problems than similar architectures. The results obtained highlight the capability of POPFNN-TVR in fuzzy knowledge extraction for modelling inter-lane relationships in a highway traffic stream, as well as in generalizing from sample data, as compared to traditional feed-forward neural networks using back-propagation learning. The model thus obtained automatically can be understood, analysed, and readily applied for transportation planning. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Vaqar, SA; Basir, O				Vaqar, Sayyid A.; Basir, Otman			TRAFFIC PATTERN DETECTION IN A PARTIALLY DEPLOYED VEHICULAR AD HOC NETWORK OF VEHICLES	IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article								Knowledge about traffic conditions on the road play an important role in route planning and avoiding traffic jams. With recent developments in technology, it is possible for vehicles to be equipped with communication and GPS systems. Equipped vehicles on the road can act as nodes to form a vehicular ad hoc network. These nodes can collect information regarding traffic conditions such as position, speed, and direction from other participating nodes. Depending on the number of participating nodes in the ad hoc network, this collected information can provide useful information on driving conditions to the node collecting this information. With proper analysis this information can be used in detecting and/or predicting traffic jam conditions on freeways. In this article the traffic information gathered by a node in an ad hoc network is viewed as a snapshot in time of the current traffic conditions on the road segment. This snapshot is considered as a pattern in time of the current traffic conditions. The pattern. is analyzed using pattern recognition techniques. A weight-of-evidence-based classification algorithm is presented to identify different road traffic conditions. The algorithm is tested using data generated by microscopic modeling of traffic flow for simulation of vehicle or node mobility in ad hoc networks. Test results are presented depicting different percentage levels of vehicles equipped with communication capability.

Simulating Heterogeneous Traffic Flow on Roads with and without Bus Lanes	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	11th World Conference on Transport Research	JUN 24-28, 2007	Univ Calif, Berkely, Berkeley, CA	World Conf Transport Res Soc	Univ Calif, Berkely	Traffic engineering; Traffic flow; Simulation; Traffic management; Buses		Exclusive bus lanes are intended to enhance the level of service of bus transport in terms of speed, reliability, safety, etc. This paper is concerned with application of a newly developed microsimulation technique to study the effect of provision of reserved bus lanes on the flow of nonlane-based heterogeneous traffic on urban roads in India. The aim of the study reported here is to modify and validate a newly developed simulation model of heterogeneous traffic flow using field observed data and to apply the validated model to study the effect of exclusive bus lanes on traffic flow. The effect is measured in terms of the reduction in the speeds of other categories of vehicles due to the possible reduction in the available road space for these vehicles. The results of the study indicate that it is possible to introduce exclusive bus lanes on carefully selected urban roads to enhance the level of service of bus, simultaneously ensuring a satisfactory level of service to the other vehicles on the road.

J	Zheng, JY; Che, WW; Wang, XM; Louie, P; Zhong, LJ				Zheng, Junyu; Che, Wenwei; Wang, Xuemei; Louie, Peter; Zhong, Liuju			Road-Network-Based Spatial Allocation of On-Road Mobile Source Emissions in the Pearl River Delta Region, China, and Comparisons with Population-Based Approach	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION			English	Article							SYSTEM; PREDICTIONS; PERFORMANCE; MODEL; AREA	Gridded air pollutant emission inventories are prerequisites for using air quality models to assess air pollution control strategies and predict air quality. A precise gridded emission inventory will help improve the accuracy of air quality Simulation. Mobile source emissions are one of the major contributors to volatile organic compound (VOC) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) Pollutants, the precursors of ozone formation. However, because of the complexity of road networks and variations in traffic flows at different road types and locations, spatial allocation of emissions from mobile sources into grid cells is challenging. This paper proposes a new methodological framework, named as "the road-network-based approach," for spatially allocating regional mobile source emission inventories. The new approach utilizes the Geographic Information System (GIS)-based road network information and road-types-based traffic flow data to provide spatial surrogates for allocating Pearl River Delta (PRD) regional mobile source emission inventories. The results show that the new approach provides reasonable spatial distributions of mobile source emissions, and the distributions are in good agreement with PRD regional on-road emission line sources. Comparisons between using the population-based and the new road-network-based approaches are made. The air quality modeling results indicate that the new approach can obviously improve model predictions with increasing accuracy in mobile source emission allocations. Means of choosing appropriate approaches for spatially allocating regional mobile source emissions are discussed.

This scheme is based on high-order reconstruction for spatial discretization and an implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta method for time integration. The resulting method retains the simplicity of the relaxation schemes. There is no need to involve Riemann solvers and characteristic decomposition. Even the computation of the eigenvalues is not required. This makes the scheme particularly well suited for the MCLWR model in which the analytical expressions of the eigenvalues are difficult to obtain for more than four classes of road users. The numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the presented method.

We present a straightforward reformulation of recent intersections' models, introduced in [19] and [4], using a description in terms of supply and demand functions [22, 6]. This formulation is used to state the new model which takes into account a possible storage capacity of an intersection as seen in round-abouts or highway on-ramps.

This influence is due to the physical effects that the heavy vehicles impose on surrounding traffic. This paper presents an exclusive fuzzy logic lane changing decision model for heavy vehicle drivers on freeways. The trajectory data which is applied in this study is under heavy traffic conditions. Then, the efficiency of the calibrated lane changing decision model is examined. The validation results show that the new fuzzy logic lane changing decision model could closely replicate the observed lane changing decisions of the heavy vehicle drivers.

Yushimito; Kalyanaraman, Shivkumar			Optimization models to characterize the broadcast capacity of vehicular ad hoc networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Vehicular ad hoc networks; ATIS; Broadcast capacity; Information flow; Optimization; Integer program	INCREASES	Broadcast capacity of the entire network is one of the fundamental properties of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). It measures how efficiently the information can be transmitted in the network and usually it is limited by the interference between the concurrent transmissions in the physical layer of the network. This study defines the broadcast capacity of vehicular ad hoc network as the maximum successful concurrent transmissions. In other words, we measure the maximum number of packets which can be transmitted in a VANET simultaneously, which characterizes how fast a new message such as a traffic incident can be transmitted in a VANET. Integer programming (IP) models are first developed to explore the maximum number of successful receiving nodes as well as the maximum number of transmitting nodes in a VANET. The models embed an traffic flow model in the optimization problem. Since IP model cannot be efficiently solved as the network size increases, this study develops a statistical model to predict the network capacity based on the significant parameters in the transportation and communication networks. MITSIMLab is used to generate the necessary traffic flow data. Response surface method and linear regression technologies are applied to build the statistical models. Thus, this paper brings together an array of tools to solve the broadcast capacity problem in VANETs. The proposed methodology provides an efficient approach to estimate the performance of a VANET in real-time, which will impact the efficacy of travel decision making. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

For on-line and off-line bus stops, a two-lane cellular automaton model is proposed to simulate the traffic bottleneck induced by bus stopping under the open boundary condition. The phase diagram in the phase plane of injection probability and bus fraction is provided and two phases, i.e. the free flow phase and congested flow phase, are distinguished. The distributions of the mean density and velocity near the bus stop in different traffic phases are given and the comparison of dynamical characteristics of traffic flows is made for different types of bus stops. It is found that using the off-line bus stop can significantly improve the traffic flow in its neighboring region, compared with the on-line bus stop in the case of small fraction of buses.

On the basis of Nagel-Schreckenberg model, this paper presents a modified cellular automaton model in which the randomization probability evolves with the driver's remembering to historic experience and with the traffic condition around. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed model can reveal the influence of driver's remembering on the traffic and generate higher average velocity and flux.

Distribution sensitivity in a highway flow model	APPLIED STOCHASTIC MODELS IN BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY			English	Article						random environment; Markov modulated; sensitivity; insensitivity; highway traffic; collision; queueing	STOCHASTIC DECOMPOSITION; M/M/INFINITY QUEUES; TRAFFIC FLOW; M/G/INFINITY	We examine a model of traffic flow on a highway segment, where traffic can be impaired by random incidents (usually, collisions). Using analytical and numerical methods, we show the degree of sensitivity that the model exhibits to the distributions of service times (in the queueing model) and incident clearance times. Its sensitivity to the distribution of time until an incident is much less pronounced. Our analytical methods include an M/G(t)/infinity analysis (G(t) denotes a service process whose distribution changes with time) and a fluid approximation for an M/M/c queue with general distributions for the incident clearance times. Our numerical methods include M/PH2/c/K models with many servers and with phase-type distributions for the time until in incident occurs or is cleared. We also investigate different time scalings for the rate of incident occurrence and clearance. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Wang, T; Xie, SD				Wang, Ting; Xie, Shaodong			Assessment of traffic-related air pollution in the urban streets before and during the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games traffic control period	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Air pollution; Traffic pollution; Street canyon; OSPM; 2008 Olympic Games	EMISSION FACTORS; QUALITY; MODEL; DISPERSION; CANYONS; OSPM; PREDICTIONS	In order to investigate the air quality and the abatement of traffic-related pollution during the 2008 Olympic Games. we select 12 avenues in the urban area of Beijing to calculate the concentrations of PM10, CO. NO2 and O-3 before and during the Olympic traffic controlling days, with the OSPM model. Through comparing the modeled results with the measurement results on a representative street, the OSPM model is validated as sufficient to predict the average concentrations of these pollutants at street level, and also reflects their daily variations well, i.e. CO presents the similar double peaks as the traffic flow, PM10 concentration is influenced by other sources. Meanwhile, the model predicts O-3 to stay less during the daytime and ascend in the night, just opposite to NO2, which reveals the impact of photochemical reactions. In addition, the predicted concentrations on the windward side often exceed the leeward side, indicating the impact of the special street shape, as well as the wind. The comparison between the predicted street concentrations before and during the Olympic traffic control period shows that the overall on-road air quality was improved effectively, due to the 32.3% traffic flow reduction. The concentrations of PM10, CO and NO2 have reduced from 142.6 mu g m(-3), 3.02 mg m(-3) and 118.7 mu g m(-3) to 102.0 mu g m(-3), 2.43 mg m(-3) and 104.1 mu g m(-3). However, the different pollutants show diverse changes after the traffic control. PM10 decreases most, and the reduction effect focusing on the first half-day even clears the morning peak, whereas CO and NO2 have even reductions to minify the daily fluctuations on the whole. Opposite to the other pollutants, ozone shows an increase of concentration. The average reduction rate of PM10. CO, NO2 and O-3 are respectively 28%, 19.3%, 12.3% and -25.2%. Furthermore, the streets in east, west, south and north areas present different air quality improvements, probably induced by the varied background pollution in different regions around Beijing, along with the impact of wind force. This finding suggests the pollution control in the surrounding regions, not only in the urban area. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the inhomogeneous zone, the hopping probability is less than 1. Two typical lattice geometries are investigated here. In case A, the lattice includes two equal segments. The hopping probability in the left segment is equal to 1, and in the right segment it is equal to p, which is less than 1. In case B, there are three equal segments in the system; the hopping probabilities in the left and right segments are equal to 1, and in the middle segment it is equal to p, which is less than 1. Through theoretical analysis, we can discover the effect on these systems when p is changed.

Vehicles are classified into a few groups and the probability distributions of axle weight and length associated with each group are estimated. The vehicle arriving at an instant is determined through Monte Carlo simulation, which uses a vehicle group density function derived from measurement data on the relative contribution of each group in total vehicles. The weight and length of the arriving vehicle is also simulated by Monte Carlo using the distribution function for the corresponding group. Vehicle arrivals are modeled by the Poisson distribution. The vehicle velocities are realized through spectral simulation based on decaying power spectra of the velocity time series. The simulations are performed for a sufficient time interval in several lanes, thus the ensemble sampling of load is obtained. Fourier transform based windowing is used to characterize the power spectra of mechanical load on the bridge. The study shows the white noise nature of the load spectral density, which is in agreement with the assumptions of previous investigators. Parametric sensitivity of the spectra is also performed and recommendations are made to include site-specific parameters in the model. Finally, applications are illustrated for frequency domain random vibration analysis of a simple model of bridge structures.

Gen. 38, 4069 (2005)] to study the density wave of traffic flow. The GK model guarantees the characteristic speeds are always less than or equal to the macroscopic flow speed and overcomes the wrong way travel problem which exists in many high-order continuum models. The stability condition of the GK model is obtained. Applying nonlinear analysis to the GK model, we can obtain the soliton, one type of local density wave, which is induced by the density fluctuation in traffic flow. The soliton wave, which is determined near the neutral stability line by the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, is discussed in great detail. The numerical results show that local cluster effects which are consistent with the diverse nonlinear phenomena observed in realistic traffic flow can be induced from the GK model.

J	Chen, J; Tan, E; Li, ZD				Chen, Jing; Tan, Evan; Li, Zhidong			A MACHINE LEARNING FRAMEWORK FOR REAL-TIME TRAFFIC DENSITY DETECTION	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PATTERN RECOGNITION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Machine learning; pattern recognition; feature extraction; unsupervised clustering; HMM	FLOW	Traffic flow information can be employed in an intelligent transportation system to detect and manage traffic congestion. One of the key elements in determining the traffic flow information is traffic density estimation. The goal of traffic density estimation is to determine the density of vehicles on a given road from loop detectors, traffic radars, or surveillance cameras. However, due to the inflexibility of deploying loop detectors and traffic radars, there is a growing trend of using video-content-understanding technique to determine the traffic flow from a surveillance camera. But difficulties arise when attempting to do this in real-time under changing illumination and weather conditions as well as heavy traffic congestions. In this paper, we attempt to address the problem of real-time traffic density estimation by using a stochastic model called Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to probabilistically determine the traffic density state. Choosing a good set of model parameters for HMMs has a significant impact on the accuracy of traffic density estimation. Thus, we propose a novel feature extraction scheme to represent traffic density, and a novel approach to initialize and construct the HMMs by using an unsupervised clustering technique called AutoClass. We show through extensive experiments that our proposed real-time algorithm achieves an average traffic density estimation accuracy of 96.6% over various different illumination and weather conditions.

Engineering modeling of traffic noise in shielded areas in cities	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article							FDTD-PE MODEL; SOUND-PROPAGATION; URBAN CANYONS; CITY CANYONS; EXPOSURE; REDUCTION; ANNOYANCE; BARRIERS; DENL	A computational study of road traffic noise in cities is presented. Based on numerical boundary-element calculations of canyon-to-canyon propagation, an efficient engineering algorithm is developed to calculate the effect of multiple reflections in street canyons. The algorithm is supported by a room-acoustical analysis of the reverberant sound fields in the source and receiver canyons. Using the algorithm, a simple model for traffic noise in cities is developed. Noise maps and exposure distributions of the city of Amsterdam are calculated with the model, and for comparison also with an engineering model that is currently used for traffic noise impact assessments in cities. Considerable differences between the two model predictions are found for shielded buildings with day-evening-night levels of 40-60 dB at the facades. Further, an analysis is presented of level differences between the most and the least exposed facades of buildings. Large level differences are found for buildings directly exposed to traffic noise from nearby roads. It is shown that by a redistribution of traffic flow around these buildings, one can achieve low sound levels at quiet sides and a corresponding reduction in the percentage of highly annoyed inhabitants from typically 23% to 18%.

J	Meng, Q; Khoo, HL				Meng, Qiang; Khoo, Hooi Ling			Self-Similar Characteristics of Vehicle Arrival Pattern on Highways	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article								This paper investigates the quantitative characteristics of the vehicle arrival pattern on highways. Inspired from a remarkable finding on data network traffic that most data packet arrival patterns follow the self-similar process as opposed to the classical Poisson process, this paper aims to explore whether the vehicle arrival pattern on highways exhibit the self-similarity property and the corresponding time headway distribution it obeys. By using real highway traffic data provided by the Texas Department of Transportation, United States, this paper examines the existence of self-similarity characteristics on these vehicle arrival data. This is done by estimating the Hurst parameter, which is an index for self-similarity testing. Hypothesis testing for the Hurst parameter estimation shows that the highway vehicle arrival pattern under moderate to heavy traffic conditions exhibit the self-similarity behavior. Then, using the headway data recorded from the Federal Highway situated in Kuala Lumpur of Malaysia, this paper further demonstrates that the time headway of vehicles on the highways follows the heavy-tailed distribution rather than the classical exponential distribution. These two novel findings not only shed some light on the existence of a new distribution to describe the vehicle arrival pattern but also enrich the studies on traffic flow theory.

In this paper, we Studied dynamics of traffic flow with real-time information provided and the influence of a feedback strategy named prediction feedback strategy is introduced, based on a two-route scenario in which dynamic information can be generated and displayed on the board to guide road users to make a choice. Our model incorporates the effects of adaptability into the cellular automaton models of traffic flow and simulation results adopting this optimal information feedback strategy have demonstrated high efficiency in controlling spatial distribution of traffic patterns compared with the other three information feedback strategies, i.e., vehicle number and flux.

Phase transitions in traffic flow on multilane roads	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article						nonlinear dynamical systems; nucleation; phase transformations; road traffic	SYNCHRONIZED FLOW; MICROSCOPIC MODEL; PHYSICS; PATTERNS; FEATURES; STATES	Based on empirical and numerical analyses of vehicular traffic, the physics of spatiotemporal phase transitions in traffic flow on multilane roads is revealed. The complex dynamics of moving jams observed in single vehicle data measured by video cameras on American highways is explained by the nucleation-interruption effect in synchronized flow, i.e., the spontaneous nucleation of a narrow moving jam with the subsequent jam dissolution. We find that (i) lane changing, vehicle merging from on-ramps, and vehicle leaving to off-ramps result in different traffic phases-free flow, synchronized flow, and wide moving jams-occurring and coexisting in different road lanes as well as in diverse phase transitions between the traffic phases; (ii) in synchronized flow, the phase transitions are responsible for a non-regular moving jam dynamics that explains measured single vehicle data: moving jams emerge and dissolve randomly at various road locations in different lanes; (iii) the phase transitions result also in diverse expanded general congested patterns occurring at closely located bottlenecks.

The existence and uniqueness of entropy solutions for such conservation laws with discontinuous fluxes are not known mathematically. We have used the approach of explicitly constructing the entropy solutions to a sequence of approximate problems in which the flow-density relationship is continuous but tends to the discontinuous flux when a small parameter in this sequence tends to zero. The limit of the entropy solutions for this sequence is explicitly constructed and is considered to be the entropy solution associated with the discontinuous flux. We apply this entropy solution construction procedure to solve four representative traffic flow cases, compare them with numerical solutions obtained by a high order weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) scheme, and discuss the results from traffic flow perspectives.

J	Davis, LC				Davis, L. C.			Realizing Wardrop equilibria with real-time traffic information	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow; Decision dynamics; Congestion reduction; Traffic diversion	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; STOCHASTIC EQUILIBRIUM; ASSIGNMENT; STABILITY; DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; FLOWS	A Wardrop equilibrium for multiple routes from the same origin to the same destination requires equal travel time on each path used. With the advent of real-time traffic data regarding travel times on alternative routes, it becomes important to analyze how best to use the information provided to drivers. In particular, can a Wardrop equilibrium, which is a desired state, be realized? Simulations using a realistic traffic model (the three-phase model) on a two-route example are presented to answer this question. One route (the main line) is a two-lane highway with a stalled vehicle in the right lane and the other route is a low-speed bypass. For a critical incoming flow of vehicles, a phase transition between free flow and congested flow near the stalled vehicle is observed, making this a challenging example. In the first scenario, drivers choose routes selfishly on the basis of current travel times. The result is strong oscillations in travel time because of the inherent delay in the information provided. The second scenario involves a hypothetical control system that limits the number of vehicles on the main line to prevent the free-flow to congested-flow phase transition by diverting sufficient flow to the bypass. The resulting steady state is neither a Wardrop equilibrium nor a system Optimum, but an intermediate state in which the main-line travel time is less than on the bypass but the average for all vehicles is close to a minimum. In a third scenario, anticipation is used as a driver-advice system to provide a fair indicator of which route to take. Prediction is based on real-time data comparing the number of vehicles on the main line at the time a vehicle leaves the origin to the actual travel time when it reaches the destination. Steady states that approximate Wardrop equilibria, or at least as close to them as can be expected, are obtained. This approach is also applied to an example with a low-speed boundary condition imposed at the destination in place of a stalled vehicle. The steady state flow approaches a Wardrop equilibrium because there is no abrupt change in travel time due to a phase transition. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two types of bus stops, non-harbor shaped and harbor shaped, are considered. The properties of traffic flow are investigated by analyzing the fundamental diagram and the spatial-temporal diagram. The influences of bus ratio and length of bus stop are analyzed in detail. The simulation results show that the non-harbor shaped bus stop has more influence on the traffic flow, and the flux cannot be effectively increased by extending the bus stop length; the harbor shaped bus stop has less influence on the traffic flow and the flux can be improved by extending the bus stop length.

In this type of traffic, vehicles do not follow lane discipline and they move freely over the entire width of roadway based on availability of space, To study this type of complex traffic flow and associated vehicular interactions, simulation is considered as an effective tool. An object-oriented methodology (OOM) for heterogeneous traffic simulation is proposed in this paper with focus on mid-block and intersection flow modeling. The paper presents the basics and advanced features of object-oriented programming (OOP) in detail in the context of traffic flow. The sample C++ code is discussed in detail to demonstrate the implementation of OOP features, such as encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. The contribution of this research work is the development of software objects for various components such as vehicle, traffic, link and node. This software can be adopted for heterogeneous traffic simulation programs, in general. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A field study of factors influencing the concentrations of a traffic-related pollutant in the vicinity of a complex urban junction	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Dispersion; Intersection; Street canyon; Traffic pollution; Turbulence; DAPPLE field campaign	2 STREET CANYONS; WIND-TUNNEL; DISPERSION CHARACTERISTICS; TURBULENCE STATISTICS; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; CENTRAL LONDON; AIR-POLLUTION; FLOW; INTERSECTION; SIMULATIONS	The paper describes a field study focused on the dispersion of a traffic-related pollutant within an area close to a busy intersection between two street canyons in Central London. Simultaneous measurements of airflow, traffic flow and carbon monoxide concentrations ([CO]) are used to explore the causes of spatial variability in [CO] over a full range of background wind directions. Depending on the roof-top wind direction, evidence of both flow channelling and recirculation regimes were identified from data collected within the main canyon and the intersection. However, at the intersection, the merging of channelled flows from the canyons increased the flow complexity and turbulence intensity. These features, coupled with the close proximity of nearby queuing traffic in several directions, led to the highest overall time-average measured [CO] occurring at the intersection. Within the main street canyon, the data supported the presence of a helical flow regime for oblique roof-top flows, leading to increased [CO] on the canyon leeward side. Predominant wind directions led to some locations having significantly higher diurnal average [CO] due to being mostly on the canyon leeward side during the study period. For all locations, small changes in the background wind direction could cause large changes in the in-street mean wind angle and local turbulence intensity, implying that dispersion mechanisms would be highly sensitive to small changes in above roof flows. During peak traffic flow periods, concentrations within parallel side streets were approximately four times lower than within the main canyon and intersection which has implications for controlling personal exposure. Overall, the results illustrate that pollutant concentrations can be highly spatially variable over even short distances within complex urban geometries, and that synoptic wind patterns, traffic queue location and building topologies all play a role in determining where pollutant hot spots occur.

It is found that the magnitude of right-turning traffic flow and the linking position of the special right-turning lane can greatly influence the capacity of the signalized road intersection. The relation between traffic flow and entering probability for different distances between the entrance (exit) of the special right-turning lane and the road intersection is simulated and analysed. The corresponding spatiotemporal pattern and phase diagram on different sections of the main road are given under the condition of close proximity to the signalized road intersection, stop-and-go traffic occur and obstruct the intersection. On the contrary, unchanged flux is maintained as the distance exceeds a critical values. All the studies indicate that setting a special right-turning lane by choosing a suitable location near a signalized road intersection can relieve the load of current traffic on the main road and maintain traffic flow.

Management of air quality in the vicinity of congested area in Kuwait	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Pollutants; Statistical analysis; CALINE4; CO concentrations; Congestion	MODELS	An assessment of air quality in the vicinity of a selected school has been carried out by monitoring the concentrations of primary pollutants. The results has shown that during the school hours, the measured pollutants emitted from the cars next to the selected school, such as CO and NO2, are always under the allowable limits for Kuwaiti air quality standards. On the other hand, the concentrations of non methane hydrocarbon pollutant (nm-HC), some of which are considered to be cancergenic, are found to be above the Kuwaiti standard most of the times. A traffic counter is used to record the number of cars in the main road next to the school in 15 min intervals for 10 days during the monitoring period for air quality. Statistical analysis is performed to develop a relation for prediction of the necessary reduction in traffic, based on CO concentrations, during morning and afternoon periods on working days. A computer dispersion model (CALINE4) is also used to assess the CO concentrations based on recorded flow of traffic and emission inventory with the prevailing meteorological conditions existed at the specified time. After the validation of model, different scenarios have been evaluated to provide an acceptable solution to resolve the traffic congestion problem near the schools in the early morning hours with substantial reduction in pollution levels. The optimal solution for CO concentration reduction by managing smooth traffic flow is to reduce the traffic intensity by half in early morning and afternoon rush hours. The results of the predicted CO concentration in the vicinity of the school for the model and the statistical analysis has shown reduction of 30% and 42% respectively, for approximately 50% decrease in the car use. On the other hand the predicted CO concentration for the model and the statistics reached 24% and 33% respectively when 50% of students opted for buses instead of using private cars.

The object of this paper is to use action-dependent heuristic dynamic programming based on eligibility traces (ADHDP(lambda)) method to implement coordinated ramp metering. The traffic flow plant is a second order macroscopic traffic flow model. The whole coordinated ramp metering problem is considered as art approximate optimal control problem. A valid coordination performance index is proposed. ADHDP(lambda) method is art effective and fast learning control method to solve such problems. With the help of eligibility traces, the learning rate is highly improved. Simulation studies on, a hypothetical freeway are reported to show that the proposed control scheme is efficient.

Tang et al. pointed out that the traffic flow model [Chin. Phys. 18, 975 (2009)] can be used to directly describe various micro phenomena resulted by traffic interruption on the single-lane system, if we properly define the traffic interruption probability, so in this paper we adopt this model to study the micro phenomena resulted by taxi on the single-lane system. The numerical results show that this model can describe the effects that taxi has on the trails of each vehicle's motion and the evolutions of the flow and the density on the single-lane system, but that these effects are relevant to the initial conditions of the whole system.

Automated Traffic and the Finite Size Resonance	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						Traffic; Flocks; Finite size resonance	MODEL	We investigate in detail what one might call the canonical (automated) traffic problem: A long string of N + 1 cars (numbered from 0 to N) moves along a one-lane road "in formation" at a constant velocity and with a unit distance between successive cars. Each car monitors the relative velocity and position of only its neighboring cars. This information is then fed back to its own engine which decelerates (brakes) or accelerates according to the information it receives. The question is: What happens when due to an external influencea traffic light turning green-the 'zero'th' car (the "leader") accelerates? As a first approximation, we analyze linear(ized) equations and show that in this scenario the traffic flow has a tendency to be stop-and-go. We give approximate solutions for the global traffic as function of all the relevant parameters (the feed back parameters as well as cruise velocity and so on). We discuss general design principles for these algorithms, that is: how does the choice of parameters influence the performance.	[Veerman, J. J.

J	Dey, PP; Chandra, S				Dey, Partha Pratim; Chandra, Satish			Desired Time Gap and Time Headway in Steady-State Car-Following on Two-Lane Roads	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article							SIMULATION	Two continuous statistical distribution models, gamma and lognormal, are proposed for desired time gap (T-X) and time headway (T) of drivers in a steady car-following state on two-lane roads under mixed traffic conditions. A simulation program was developed for traffic movement on two-lane roads incorporating actual behavior of mixed traffic in terms of speed, placement, arrival pattern, and overtaking behavior. The program was run at 50/50 directional distribution with varying traffic composition and volume level. Headway data obtained from simulation runs are analyzed to develop a relationship between the desired time gap (T-X) and the speed of the vehicles for five categories of vehicles, namely, car, heavy vehicle, motorized two-wheeler, three-wheeler, and tractor. It is observed that the desired time gap of a two-wheeler is the minimum of all other categories of vehicles. It is due to their better maneuverability, which allows them to maintain shorter gaps. The desired time gap for tractors is the maximum of all vehicles, which is due to their low acceleration capability and poor braking efficiency. These relationships will be extremely useful in developing the microsimulation models of traffic flow on two-lane highways.

J	Agarwal, S; Swami, BL; Gupta, AB				Agarwal, Sheetal; Swami, Bajrang L.; Gupta, Akhilendra Bhushan			Development of a noise prediction model under interrupted traffic flow conditions: A case study for Jaipur city	NOISE & HEALTH			English	Article						Ambient noise levels; average difference; capacity ratio; horn; interrupted traffic flow condition; tendency to blow		The objective of this study is to develop an empirical noise prediction model for the evaluation of equivalent noise levels (Leq) under interrupted traffic flow conditions. A new factor tendency to blow horn (A(H)) was introduced in the conventional federal highway administrative noise prediction (FHWA) model and a comparative study was made between FHWA and modified FHWA models to evaluate the best suitability of the model. Monitoring and modeling of Leq were carried out at four selected intersections of Jaipur city. After comparison of the results, it was found that the modified FHWA model could be satisfactorily applied for Indian conditions as it gives acceptable results with a deviation of +/- 3 dB (A). In addition, statistical analysis of the data comprising measured and estimated values shows a good agreement. Hence, the modified FHWA traffic noise prediction model can be applied to the cities having similar traffic conditions as in Jaipur city.

These allow us to unveil the detailed microscopic dynamics as well as to extract macroscopic properties of traffic flow. Parameter domains are determined where the uniform flow equilibrium is stable but sufficiently large excitations may trigger traffic jams. This behavior becomes more robust as the reaction time delay is increased.	[Orosz, Gabor] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Mech Engn, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Wilson, R.

J	Lan, LW; Chiou, YC; Lin, ZS; Hsu, CC				Lan, Lawrence W.; Chiou, Yu-Chiun; Lin, Zih-Shin; Hsu, Chih-Cheng			A refined cellular automaton model to rectify impractical vehicular movement behavior	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow; Cellular automaton; Refined cell; Limited deceleration; Piecewise-linear movement	TRAFFIC FLOW; MICROSCOPIC MODEL; RULES	When implementing cellular automata (CA) into a traffic simulation, one common defect yet to be rectified is the abrupt deceleration when vehicles encounter stationary obstacles or traffic jams. To be more in line with real world vehicular movement, this paper proposes a piecewise-linear movement to replace the conventional particle-hopping movement adopted in most previous CA models. Upon this adjustment and coupled with refined cell system, a new CA model is developed using the rationale of Forbes' et al. car-following concept. The proposed CA model is validated on a two-lane freeway mainline context. It shows that this model can fix the unrealistic deceleration behaviors, and thus call reflect genuine driver behavior in the real world. The model is also capable of revealing Kerner's three-phase traffic patterns and phase transitions among them. Furthermore, the proposed CA model is applied to simulate a highway work zone wherein traffic efficiency (maximum flow rates) and safety (speed deviations) impacted by various control schemes are tested.

We investigate how to improve the system capacity by assigning traffic flow to the two ramps. The system phase diagram is presented and different regions are classified. It is shown that in region 1, in which both ramps are in free flow and the main road upstream of the ramps is in congestion, assigning a higher proportion of the demand to the upstream on-ramp could improve the overall flow, which is consistent with previous studies. This is explained through Studying the spatiotemporal patterns and analytical investigations. In contrast, optimal assignment has not been observed in other regions. We point out that our result is robust and model independent under certain conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As a practical application of a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model, a Coupled mesoscale-CFD model was applied to the Ikegamicho area of Kawasaki City, Japan. For this study, the effects of traffic-produced flow and turbulence (TPFT) on the dispersion of the pollutants near the heavy traffic road were mainly investigated in an actual urban area. First, a series of preliminary CFD calculations was conducted for a road tunnel field experiment to obtain a fitting parameter for the traffic-produced flow. The calculation was then performed for 24 h in December 2005 around Ikegamicho, and the results were compared with the data at a roadside monitoring post in the area, located 10 m from the boundary of the ground road. In general, the effect of traffic-produced flow and turbulence was limited at the downstream side of the roads. The maximum concentration of NOx was reduced and smoothed out along the traffic flow by the traffic-produced flow and turbulence on the road. The effects of traffic-produced turbulence on the dispersion of pollutants were greater than those of traffic-produced flow; however, the effects of traffic-produced flow were not negligible. The concentration of pollutants was not particularly dependent on the turbulent Schmidt number because most of the emission sources were introduced as volume sources in the present calculations, and the effect caused by differences in the material diffusion coefficient was not particularly significant at the outside of the road.

J	Sun, DH; Peng, GH				Sun Di-Hua; Peng Guang-Han			A viscous continuum traffic flow model with consideration of the coupling effect for two-lane freeways	CHINESE PHYSICS B			English	Article						two-lane traffic; viscous continuum traffic flow model; numerical simulation	CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; VELOCITY-DIFFERENCE; PHASE-TRANSITION; MAIN-ROAD; SPEED; WAVES; DYNAMICS; SYSTEM; AGGREGATION; PROPAGATION	In this paper, the viscous continuum traffic flow model for a single lane is extended to the traffic flow for two-lane freeways. The proposed model is a higher-order continuum model considering the coupling and lane changing effects of the vehicles on two adjacent lanes. It results from integrating the Taylor series expansion of the viscous continuum traffic flow model proposed by Cc (2006 Physica A 371 667) into the multi-lane model presented by Daganzo (1997 Transpn. Res. B 31 83). Our proposed model may be used to describe non-anisotropic behaviour because of lane changing in multi-lane traffic. A linear stability analysis is given and the neutral stability condition is obtained. Also, issues related to lane changing, shock waves and rarefaction waves, local clustering and phase transition are investigated through a simulation experiment. The simulation results show that the proposed model is capable of explaining some particular traffic phenomena commonly observable in real world traffic flow.

Parameters such as length of cellular automaton, operation speed and random slow mechanism are re-demarcated. A harbour-shaped bus stop is set up and the vehicle changing lane regulation is changed. Through computer simulation, the influence of occupation rate of public transit vehicles on mixed traffic flow and traffic capacity is analysed. The results show that a public transport system can ease urban traffic congestion but creates new jams at the same time, and that the influence of occupation rate of public transit vehicles on traffic capacity is considerable.

In this paper, we investigate an asymmetrical two-route scenario in which dynamic information can be generated and displayed on the board to guide drivers. Two improved feedbacks (i.e. improved mean velocity feedback and improved congestion coefficient feedback) are introduced. Simulations show that the average cost is dependent on the vehicle arrival rate and there exists a critical the dynamic vehicles ratio corresponding to the maximum flux. We find that improved con-gestion coefficient can better enhance the system capacity than that of improved mean velocity feedback.

J	Yao, J; Teng, HL; Hoel, LA; Wang, N				Yao, Jun; (Harry) Teng, Hualiang; Hoel, Lester A.; Wang, Ning			Modeling the Deterioration of Inductive Loops	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article								Inductive loop detectors have been widely used in transportation system, particularly to monitor the performance of highway systems such as traffic flow, speed, and vehicle classification. Accurate data are dependent on the quality of the detector mechanism and the level of maintenance of these devices. Yet, this aspect of maintenance has been neglected both in the field and in research studies. A review of the lifetime data of loops revealed the following features: (1) lifetime data for a specified loop was not available from existing maintenance records; (2) lifetime data were censored; and (3) the lifetimes of loops located in different stations were dissimilar. For these reasons, a censored random-effect panel data duration model was used in this study that can deal with heterogeneity and censored duration data. A formula was developed to estimate the lifetimes for individual loops, despite the unavailability of lifetime data in the original maintenance database. Because vehicles of different classifications were distributed differently in adjoining right lanes, different models were adopted for two different traveling lanes. The models indicate that the lifetimes of loops are highly determined by the volumes of truck traffic; a finding that can be used to assist loop detection maintenance scheduling.

In addition to the efficiency objectives dealt with in most of the literature where the subject is addressed, the approach takes into account robustness and equity objectives. For achieving the objectives, two types of action can be performed: the construction of a new road of a given level; and the upgrading of an existing road to a higher level. The approach is consistent with the planning framework of the highway capacity manual, using the concept of level of service to assess traffic flow conditions. The application of the approach is illustrated for a case study involving the main road network of Poland.

J	Marigo, A				Marigo, Alessia			ROBUSTNESS OF SQUARE NETWORKS	NETWORKS AND HETEROGENEOUS MEDIA			English	Article						Flows on Networks; Equilibria; Security	SUPPLY CHAINS; TRAFFIC FLOW; TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORKS; ROAD NETWORK; OPEN CANALS; MODEL; WAVES	The topic of security often enters in many real world situations. In this paper we focus on security of networks on which it is based the delivery of services and goods (e.g. water and electric supply networks) the transfer of data (e.g. web and telecommunication networks), the movement of transport means (e.g. road networks), etc... We use a fluid dynamic framework, networks are described by nodes and lines and our analysis starts from an equilibrium status: the flows are constant in time and along the lines. When a failure occurs in the network a shunt changes the topology of the network and the flows adapt to it reaching a new equilibrium status. The question we consider is the following: is the new equilibrium satisfactory in terms of achieved quality standards? We essentially individuate, for regular square networks, the nodes whose breakage compromises the quality of the flows. It comes out that networks which allow circular flows are the most robust with respect to damages.

J	Venuti, F; Bruno, L				Venuti, Fiammetta; Bruno, Luca			Crowd-structure interaction in lively footbridges under synchronous lateral excitation: A literature review	PHYSICS OF LIFE REVIEWS			English	Review						Crowd-structure interaction; Complex system; Synchronisation; Crowd dynamics; Footbridges; Lateral vibrations	GROUND REACTION FORCES; WALKING SPEED; TRAFFIC FLOW; VIBRATION; MODEL; DYNAMICS; PERFORMANCE; EVACUATION; BEHAVIOR; DENSITY	This paper aims to provide a review and critical analysis of the state of the art concerning crowd-structure interaction phenomena on footbridges. The problem of lateral vibrations induced by synchronised pedestrians, namely the Synchronous Lateral Excitation, is specifically addressed. Due to the multi-physic and multi-scale nature of the complex phenomenon, several research fields can contribute to its study, from structural engineering to biomechanics, from transportation engineering to physics and applied mathematics. The different components of the overall coupled dynamical system - the structure, the crowd and their interactions are separately analysed from both a phenomenological and modelling point of view. A special attention is devoted to those models, which explicitly account for the interaction between mechanical and living systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Guo, RY; Huang, HJ				Guo, Ren-Yong; Huang, Hai-Jun			Chaos and bifurcation in dynamical evolution process of traffic assignment with flow "mutation"	CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS			English	Article							TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS; USER EQUILIBRIUM; MODEL; SYSTEM	Considering such a fact that the traffic demands freshly entering a network do not have perfect information about traffic condition and may then choose routes randomly, in this paper, we present an improved network traffic flow evolution model. The model's properties and fixed points are investigated. Numerical results obtained from a grid network show that the system can converge to one or more fixed points without requiring of positive route flows at initial time, and can be used to approximately simulate the process of realizing user equilibrium state. It is found that oscillations and such apparently irregular behaviors as chaos occur when the model parameter representing intensity of adjusting route flow and OD demand exceeds some values. Bifurcation diagrams of some route flows and OD demands with respect to this model parameter are presented. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The traffic flow is numerically simulated under the open boundary condition and the control of red and green lights. It is found from the results that the capacity of the arterial road is determined by the capacity of the intersection. For small densities, the flow has no relation with the number of intersections. Moreover, the rule of variation of the maximum point of average velocity with the green-light period is obtained with the mean-field method. On the contrary, the number of intersections plays a crucial role in the flow at larger densities. The arterial road can achieve optimal traffic state via regulating the period of traffic lights.
