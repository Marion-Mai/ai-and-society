We propose the nonlinear-map model for the dynamics of the speed-controlled bus with the periodic inflow. The bus schedule is closely connected to the motion. The motion of the speed-controlled bus is affected by the periodic inflow. The motion of the shuttle bus depends highly on both speed control and periodic inflow. The shuttle bus displays the periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic motions by varying both periodic inflow and speed control. We clarify the dependence of the bus motion on both speed control and periodic inflow. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The small-world network is introduced to construct the multi-agent model of passengers' travel mode choice. The cumulative prospect theory is adopted to depict passengers' bounded rationality, the heterogeneity of passengers' reference point is depicted using the idea of group emotion computing. The conceptions of "Langton parameter" and "evolution entropy" in the theory of "edge of chaos" are introduced to create passengers' "decision coefficient" and "evolution entropy of travel mode choice" which are used to quantify passengers' group behavior, The numerical simulation and the analysis of passengers' behavior show that (1) the new model inherits the features of traditional model well and the idea of self-organizing traffic flow evolution fully embodies passengers' bounded rationality, (2) compared with the traditional model (logit model), when passengers are in the "edge of chaos" state, the total profit of the transportation system is higher.

It also helps to evaluate the quality of traffic control systems in urban areas. Traffic control systems that use traffic models to predict changes and disruptions in vehicle flows have to use vehicle speed-prediction models. Travel time estimation studies the effects of traffic volumes on a street section at an average speed. The TRISTAR Integrated Transport Management System, currently being deployed across the Tri-City (Gdansk, Sopot, Gdynia), is almost completed and data obtained from the System can be useful for the development of prediction models. A procedure for travel speed model selection for the Tri-City street network is presented in this paper. Matching of chosen volume-delay functions to the data obtained from the TRISTAR has been tested. Analyses have shown insufficient matching of functions that does not justify the possibility of their use in traffic control due to variability in different conditions of traffic, weather and, in the case of an incident, which justifies the need for further research aimed at satisfying matching of functions depending on the above-mentioned factors.

J	Li, L; Chen, X				Li, Li; Chen, Xiqun (Michael)			Vehicle headway modeling and its inferences in macroscopic/microscopic traffic flow theory: A survey	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Review						Headway distribution; Car-following models; Departure headway; Stochastic fundamental diagram	GAP-SIZE DISTRIBUTION; SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS; TIME HEADWAY; CAR; DISTRIBUTIONS; CONNECTIVITY; INFORMATION; DENSITY; SPEED; FLUCTUATIONS	Vehicle headway distribution models are widely used in traffic engineering fields, since they reflect the fundamental uncertainty in drivers' car-following maneuvers and meanwhile provide a concise way to describe the stochastic feature of traffic flows. This paper presents a systematic review of vehicle headway distribution studies in the last few decades. Since it is impossible to enumerate the merits and drawbacks of all of existing distribution models, we emphasize four advances of headway distribution modeling in this paper. First, we highlight the chronicle of key assumptions on the existing distribution models and explain why this evolution occurs. Second, we show that departure headways measured for interrupted flows on urban streets and headways measured for uninterrupted flows on freeways have common features and can be simulated by a unified microscopic car-following model. The interesting finding helps gather two kinds of headway distribution models under one umbrella. Third, we review different approaches that aim to link microscopic car-following models and mesoscopic vehicle headway distribution models. Fourth, we show that both the point scattering on the density-flow plot and the shape of traffic flow breakdown curve implicitly depend on the vehicular headway distribution. These findings reveal pervasive connections between macroscopic traffic flow models and mesoscopic headway distribution. All these new insights bring new vigor into vehicle headway studies and open research frontiers in this field. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Markovic, N; Ryzhov, IO; Schonfeld, P				Markovic, Nikola; Ryzhov, Ilya O.; Schonfeld, Paul			Evasive flow capture: A multi-period stochastic facility location problem with independent demand	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Location; Flow capture; Multi-period planning; Stochastic flows; Network model	DISCRETIONARY SERVICE FACILITIES; MAXIMIZING MARKET-SIZE; INSPECTION STATIONS; WAREHOUSE LOCATION; ALLOCATION MODEL; NETWORK; TRANSPORTATION; OPTIMIZATION; HEURISTICS; SHORTEST	We introduce the problem of locating facilities over a finite time horizon with the goal of intercepting stochastic traffic flows that exhibit evasive behavior, which arises when locating weigh-in-motion systems, tollbooths, vehicle inspection stations, or other fixed flow-capturing facilities used for law enforcement. The problem can be formulated as a multi-stage, mixed-integer stochastic program: however, under certain independence assumptions, this can be reformulated as a large two-stage stochastic program, enabling us to solve much larger instances. We additionally propose an algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation that separates the reformulated stochastic program into a variant of a deterministic knapsack problem and a sum of time-decoupled single-period stochastic programs that can be solved independently. The model and algorithm are tested on instances involving road networks of Nevada and Vermont. A comparison with the previously studied single-period stochastic programming approach shows that the newly proposed multi-period model substantially reduces the expected cost. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It plays an important role in improving traffic management quality. The aim of this research is to examine the space-time correlation of road networks to determine likely requirements for building a suitable space-time traffic model. In this paper, it is carried out using traffic flow data collected on Beijing's road network. In the framework, the space-time autocorrelation function (ST-ACF) is introduced as global measure, and cross-correlation function (CCF) as local measure to reveal the change mechanism of space-time correlation. Through the use of both measures, the correlation is found to be dynamic and heterogeneous in space and time. The finding of seasonal pattern present in space-time correlation provides a theoretical assumption for traffic forecasting. Besides, combined with Simpson's rule, the CCF is also applied to finding the critical sections in the road network, and the experiments prove that it is feasible in computability, rationality and practicality.

The linear stability condition is derived in the frequency-domain with control theory. Then, different feedback gains under the periodic boundary scenery and on-ramp scenery are simulated. The periodic boundary scenery provides an initial small disturbance situation on the circle road, while the on-ramp scenery reproduces the disturbance triggered by the on-ramp on the open road. Both the theoretical analysis and simulations show that this new control signal has a positive effect to suppress traffic jams. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Fei, WP; Song, GH; Zhang, F; Gao, Y; Yu, L				Fei Wen-peng; Song Guo-hua; Zhang Fan; Gao Yong; Yu Lei			Practical approach to determining traffic congestion propagation boundary due to traffic incidents	JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY			English	Article						kinematic wave model; Van Aerde model; traffic incident; congestion propagation on network		A practical approach for predicting the congestion boundary due to traffic incidents was proposed. Based on the kinematic wave theory and Van Aerde single-regime flow model, a model for estimating the congestion propagation speed for the basic road segment was developed. Historical traffic flow data were used to analyze the time variant characteristics of the urban traffic flow for each road type. Then, the saturation flow rate was used for analyzing the impact of the traffic incident on the traversing traffic flow at the congestion area. The base congestion propagation speed for each road type was calculated based on field data, which were provided by the remote traffic microwave sensors (RTMS), floating car data (FCD) system and screen line survey. According to a comparative analysis of the congestion propagation speed, it is found that the expressway, major arterial, minor arterial and collector are decreasingly influenced by the traffic incident. Subsequently, the impact of turning movements at intersections on the congestion propagation was considered. The turning ratio was adopted to represent the impact of turning movements, and afterward the corresponding propagation pattern at intersections was analyzed. Finally, an implementation system was designed on a geographic information system (GIS) platform to display the characteristics of the congestion propagation over the network.

The original urban traffic signal control problem is first formulated into an output regulating and disturbance rejection problem, and the ILC approach is applied to deal with this class of control problem using the repeatability feature of traffic flow. Then, the ILC strategy is further integrated with the traffic-responsive urban control framework to cope with the random disturbances of traffic conditions in iteration cycle. Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed ILC-based traffic signal control methods can guarantee the asymptotic convergence of the link occupancies to the desired ones. The main advantage of the proposed approaches is that they require less prior modelling knowledge in the control system design. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is further verified by extensive simulations.

An initial analysis demonstrated that the traffic demand and facility supply determine the propagation speed and boundary. The outflow at the incident section was considered, which is affected by the number of closed lanes, the proportion of buses, and the number of lane-changing vehicles. Additionally, the background demand varies with the time of day and the location due to a high density of ramps. The entry and exit flows of on-ramps and off-ramps under the traffic incident were shown to have a considerable impact on the congestion propagation. Consequently, the framework model was developed and parameters were estimated based on the field data of ring-road expressways in Beijing. For practical purpose, the data inputs were provided by the floating car system and remote traffic microwave sensor system. Three incidents on expressways were adopted to evaluate the capability of the model. Results showed that the proposed model is able to practically model the time-variant characteristics of the propagation speed and congestion boundary of traffic incidents.

Waiting time will be unstable and unpredictable in estimation because of inconsistencies of bus arrival times at stops. These can result an unreliable of bus service. This paper examines the waiting time due to three factors; delay resulting from inaccuracies of bus departure time, delay during the process of boarding and alighting passengers and delay when the bus unable to maintain constant velocity because of saturated traffic flow. The research used the combination of mathematical model and Design Expert Research Methodology Surface (RSM) applications which has pivotal role in acquire optimum waiting time based on constraints delay between two arrival times at stop. The optimum waiting time obtained from the output design target in range 0-15 minutes were 4 minutes for route L01 and 5.87 minutes for L05. The estimated waiting time obtained from this research can be used as a key feature in the design of buses operating to minimize the delay and at the same time get the reliability of passengers.

In this study, a 3D Markov random field (MRF) is used to model the temporal dynamics of the traffic flow measured by VDS sensor network. Then, the spatial and temporal relations between roads at a given location are represented by the 3D graph using cliques, then its structure is determined by clique parameters. Here, a support vector regression is adopted for estimating the correlation parameters. The technique is applied to actual traffic flow data from Gyeongbu expressway, South Korea. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can predict the traffic flow with an accuracy of 85.6%, which improves 17.3% of the existing state-of-the-art method.	[Kim, E.

J	Sainct, R; Louis, X; Forestier, A				Sainct, Remi; Louis, Xavier; Forestier, Alain			Application of averaging techniques to traffic flow theory	MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN THE APPLIED SCIENCES			English	Article						highway traffic simulation; hyperbolic system; fundamental diagram; traffic entropy	2ND-ORDER MODELS; WAVES	Real traffic data are very versatile and are hard to explain with the so-called standard fundamental diagram. A simple microscopic model can show that the heterogeneity of traffic results in a reduced mean flow and that the reduction is proportional to the density variance. Standard averaging techniques allow us to evaluate this reduction without having to describe the complex microscopic interactions. Using a second equation for the variance results in a two-dimensional hyperbolic system that can be put in conservative form. The Riemann problem is completely solved in the case of a parabolic fundamental diagram, and the solutions are compared with the famous second-order Aw-Rascle-Zhang model in a simulation of lane reduction. Adding a diffusion term results in entropy production, and the diffusive model is studied as well. Finally, a numerical scheme is used and converges to the analytical solution.

Citywide Traffic Volume Estimation Using Trajectory Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING			English	Article						Urban computing; traffic volume estimation; trajectories; traffic flow theory		Traffic volume estimation at the city scale is an important problem useful to many transportation operations and urban applications. This paper proposes a hybrid framework that integrates both state-of-art machine learning techniques and well-established traffic flow theory to estimate citywide traffic volume. In addition to typical urban context features extracted from multiple sources, we extract a special set of features from GPS trajectories based on the implications of traffic flow theory, which provide extra information on the speed-flow relationship. Using the network-wide speed information estimated from a travel speed estimation model, a volume related high level feature is first learned using an unsupervised graphical model. A volume re-interpretation model is then introduced to map the volume related high level feature to the predicted volume using a small amount of ground truth data for training. The framework is evaluated using a GPS trajectory dataset from 33,000 Beijing taxis and volume ground truth data obtained from 4,980 video clips. The results demonstrate effectiveness and potential of the proposed framework in citywide traffic volume estimation.

Traffic modeling flows in a developing urban infrastructure with a software suite for creating interactive virtual environments	AUTOMATION AND REMOTE CONTROL			English	Article						traffic equilibrium; elastic demand; variational inequality; ontology; cloud-based service; virtual worlds; 3D graphics	EQUILIBRIUM PROBLEM; COSTS	We present a design paradigm for a cloud-based service for interactive modeling of traffic flows in a developing urban infrastructure. The mathematical forecasting model for the load of a transportation network is constructed as a result of synthesizing a gravitational model that describes origin-destination trips and a multimodal traffic equilibrium problem with elastic demand. The search for traffic equilibrium reduces to solving a variational inequality. Three-dimensional visualization of the transportation network and adjacent infrastructure is implemented with the virtual environment's declarative model.	[Gribova, V.

J	Florin, R; Olariu, S				Florin, Ryan; Olariu, Stephan			On a Variant of the Mobile Observer Method	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Floating car data; mobile observer; traffic flow; traffic parameters		The mobile observer method has been used by traffic engineers since the middle of the last century to estimate traffic velocity, flow and density. Although simple and intuitive, the method suffers from two major issues. First, the vehicle must traverse a given road segment both in the direction of the traffic whose parameters are of interest and also in the opposite direction, essentially driving in a loop. Second, to get accurate results, several runs must be taken and the results aggregated. Our variant utilizes the communication capabilities in present-day vehicles to mitigate both these issues, thus enabling faster and more accurate traffic maps and traffic routing applications. Extensive simulation results have confirmed that our variant of the mobile observer method is comparable in accuracy with the stationary observer method even at lower flow rates.

For this purpose, the traffic data for a freeway in Iran (the Tehran-Qom freeway) were investigated. The results showed that by choosing the lane closer to the median, driving cautiousness will be reduced. This finding can not only be attributed to increasing speed, which is the characteristic of a lane closer to the median, but also occurs with time headway reduction. In other words, closer lanes to the median have higher speed and lower headway that will increase the capacity of these lanes. These results suggest that driving behaviour can be categorised based on the lane that the drivers select. Results also indicate that the capacity difference between inner and outer lanes is from about 7% up to 24%.

J	Liu, S; Hellendoorn, H; De Schutter, B				Liu, Shuai; Hellendoorn, Hans; De Schutter, Bart			Model Predictive Control for Freeway Networks Based on Multi-Class Traffic Flow and Emission Models	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Multi-class traffic flow models; multi-class emission models; online traffic control; model predictive control; end-point penalties	RECEDING HORIZON CONTROL; COUNTS; WAVES	The main aim of this paper is to use multi-class macroscopic traffic flow and emission models for Model Predictive Control (MPC) for traffic networks. In particular, we use and compare extended versions of multi-class METANET, FASTLANE, multi-class VT-macro, and multi-class VERSIT+. In addition, end-point penalties based on these multi-class traffic flow and emission models are also included in the objective function of MPC to account for the behavior of the traffic system beyond the prediction horizon. A simulation experiment is implemented to evaluate the multi-class models. The results show that the approaches based on multi-class METANET and the extended emission models multi-class VT-macro or multi-class VERSIT+) can improve the control performance for the total time spent and the total emissions with respect to the non-control case, and they are more capable of dealing with the queue length constraints than the approaches based on FASTLANE. Including end-point penalties can further improve the control performance with a small sacrifice in the computational efficiency for the approaches based on multi-class METANET but not for the approaches based on FASTLANE.

Increased Traffic Flow Through Node-Based Bottleneck Prediction and V2X Communication	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Congestion prediction; road traffic simulation; intelligent traffic management; rerouting; vehicular communication	MULTIVARIATE; NETWORK; MODELS; ASSIGNMENT	Transport delays due to traffic jams are manifested in many urban areas worldwide. To make road traffic networks more efficient, intelligent transport services are currently being developed and deployed. In order to mitigate (or even avoid) congestion, vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications provide a means for cooperation and intelligent route management in transport networks. This paper introduces the novel predictive congestion minimization in combination with an A*-based router (PCMA*) algorithm, which provides a comprehensive framework for detection, prediction, and avoidance of traffic congestion. It assumes utilization of vehicle-to-X communication for transmission of contemporary vehicle data such as route source and destination or current position, as well as for provision of the routing advice for vehicles. PCMA* further contains a component for intelligent selection of vehicles to be rerouted in case of a congestion, as well as an A*-based routing algorithm, taking into consideration the current road conditions and predicted future congestion. We prove the performance by dynamic microscopic traffic simulations in a real-world and an artificial road network scenario. Due to the well-performing prediction, the results reveal substantial advantages in terms of time and fuel consumption compared not only with situations with no active rerouting system but also with simple rerouting algorithms and more sophisticated approaches from literature.

Effect of time-of-day and day-of-the-week on congestion duration and breakdown: A case study at a bottleneck in Salem, NH	JOURNAL OF TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ENGLISH EDITION			English	Article						Stochastic models; Ordinary least squares regression; Binary logistic regression; Congestion duration; Breakdown	FREEWAY CAPACITY; INCIDENT DELAYS; PROBABILITY; FREQUENCY	This work uses regression models to analyze two characteristics of recurrent congestion: breakdown, the transition from freely flowing conditions to a congested state, and duration, the time between the onset and clearance of recurrent congestion. First, we apply a binary logistic regression model where a continuous measurement for traffic flow and a dichotomous categorical variable for time-of-day (AM- or PM-rush hours) is used to predict the probability of breakdown. Second, we apply an ordinary least squares regression model where categorical variables for time-of-day (AM- or PM-rush hours) and day-of-the-week (Monday-Thursday or Friday) are used to predict recurrent congestion duration. Models are fitted to data collected from a bottleneck on I-93 in Salem, NH, over a period of 9 months. Results from the breakdown model, predict probabilities of recurrent congestion, are consistent with observed traffic and illustrate an upshift in breakdown probabilities between the AM-and PM-rush periods. Results from the regression model for congestion duration reveal the presences of significant interaction between time-of-day and day-of-the-week. Thus, the effect of time-of-day on congestion duration depends on the day-of-the-week. This work provides a simplification of recurrent congestion and recovery, very noisy processes. Simplification, conveying complex relationships with simple statistical summaries-facts, is a practical and powerful tool for traffic administrators to use in the decision-making process.

Motor vehicles' higher speed, weight and volume, compared to cyclists, represent a serious safety concern when overtaking a bicycle. Spanish traffic rules determine a minimum 1.5 m lateral distance. This research characterised 2928 overtaking manoeuvres in the overtaking lateral clearance between motor vehicle and bicycle, as well as in the motor vehicle speed, in contrast with previous research. Two instrumented bicycles were equipped with laser rangefinders, a GPS tracker and three video cameras. They rode along seven rural road segments at a speed between 15 and 25 km/h, centred on the paved shoulder, or as close as possible to the outer edge. Besides, this methodology allowed the characterisation of the overtaken vehicle type, its left lane occupation as well as its interaction with opposing traffic flow. For each session, rider's general risk perception was also registered. The analysis suggested that lateral clearance is not the only factor that influenced rider's risk perception, although current standards are only related to it. On the contrary, a combined factor of lateral clearance, vehicle type and vehicle speed had a more significant correlation with the perceived risk. This agreed with literature models of transient aerodynamic forces between overtaking and overtaken vehicles. Results showed that effect of heavy vehicles on bicyclists was also strong. In addition to this, the combined factor of clearance and speed was higher on tangent sections where overtaking was permitted. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This issue has been widely investigated in recent years in the open literature. The current research studies mainly emphasize the effects of bridge span and vehicle; however, the driving effects, such as the driving speed, vehicle model parameters, and driving conditions, have rarely been investigated. In this study, researches on the driving effects of vehicle-induced vibration on long-span suspension bridges were conducted. First, a typical three-dimensional vehicle model with multi-axils was proposed, and three different road roughness models rated as excellent, good, and normal were generated with a power spectral density, and a random traffic flow with 16 vehicle types was simulated using the proposed random traffic flows model generation program. Next, an effective finite element model with Ishikawa beams stiffening girder was established to investigate the driving effects of the vehicle-induced vibration. The calculations of the effects on the vehicle body parameters, road roughness, driving direction, and speed were performed. Possible reasons for the driving effects of vehicle-induced vibration on long-span suspension bridges were also discussed. In addition, conclusions and recommendations for future bridge analysis and design were provided based on the results of the study. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Existing Emissions Model (EM) methodologies range from aggregate to disaggregate approaches, with more detail normally entailing more resources. However, it is not clear which approaches LGAs actually utilise. This article reports results of a survey designed to discover the level of detail considered practical by British LGAs (n=34). Results show that resource scarcity is important, with particular importance attached to EM reusability and convenient input data sources. Most LGA EMs use traffic variable inputs (predominantly traffic flow and traffic average speed), with this approach being the best-fit for LGA resources. Link-by-link sources of data rated highly for convenience are Road Traffic Models and Urban traffic control systems.

Its four driving behavior related parameters, i.e., reaction time, calmness parameter, speed-and spacing-related sensitivities, have an apparent effect in shaping the fundamental diagram. Its boundary conditions and homogenous case are also analyzed in detail and compared with other two models (i.e., Longitudinal Control Model and Intelligent Driver Model). Especially, these model formulations and properties under Lagrangian coordinates provide a new perspective to revisit the traffic flow and complement with those under Eulerian coordinate. One calibration methodology that incorporates the monkey algorithm with dynamic adaptation is employed to calibrate this model, based on real-field data from a wide range of locations. Results show that this model exhibits the well flexibility to fit these traffic data and performs better than other nine models. Finally, a concrete example of transportation application is designed, in which the impact of three critical parameters on vehicle trajectories and shock waves with three representations (i.e., respectively defined in x-t, n-t and x-n coordinates) is tested, and macro-and micro-solutions on shock waves well agree with each other. In summary, this traffic stream model with the advantages of flexibility and efficiency has the good potential in level of service analysis and transportation planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this frame, we collect the traffic flow time series data with different granularity at first. Then, using the modified rescaled range analysis method, we analyze the long memory property of the traffic flow time series by computing the Hurst exponent. We calculate the long-term memory cycle and test its significance. We also compare it with the maximum Lyapunov exponent method result. Our results show that both of the freeway traffic flow time series and the ground way traffic flow time series demonstrate positively correlated trend (have long-term memory property), both of their memory cycle are about 30 h. We think this study is useful for the short-term or long-term traffic flow prediction and management. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Mohan, R; Ramadurai, G				Mohan, Ranju; Ramadurai, Gitakrishnan			Heterogeneous traffic flow modelling using second-order macroscopic continuum model	PHYSICS LETTERS A			English	Article						Heterogeneous; Macroscopic; Area occupancy; Gap filling behaviour	SPEED GRADIENT MODEL; WAVES; SIMULATION; EXISTENCE	Modelling heterogeneous traffic flow lacking in lane discipline is one of the emerging research areas in the past few years. The two main challenges in modelling are: capturing the effect of varying size of vehicles, and the lack in lane discipline, both of which together lead to the 'gap filling' behaviour of vehicles. The same section length of the road can be occupied by different types of vehicles at the same time, and the conventional measure of traffic concentration, density (vehicles per lane per unit length), is not a good measure for heterogeneous traffic modelling. First aim of this paper is to have a parsimonious model of heterogeneous traffic that can capture the unique phenomena of gap filling. Second aim is to emphasize the suitability of higher-order models for modelling heterogeneous traffic. Third, the paper aims to suggest area occupancy as concentration measure of heterogeneous traffic lacking in lane discipline. The above mentioned two main challenges of heterogeneous traffic flow are addressed by extending an existing second-order continuum model of traffic flow, using area occupancy for traffic concentration instead of density. The extended model is calibrated and validated with field data from an arterial road in Chennai city, and the results are compared with those from few existing generalized multi-class models.

One of its most significant properties is its quiet electric engine which can be a good tool for decreasing noise pollution in cities. In this respect, the electric vehicle can be acoustically assessed from different points of view; on the one hand, as a moving point source, its detectability or annoyance for pedestrians can be studied, and, on the other hand, as part of the traffic flow in a road its effect on the whole noise map. In this paper the effect of introducing a flow of electric vehicles into real urban traffic has been studied and quantified. For this purpose, experimental procedures were used to add to the NMPB ROUTES noise prediction model of the electric vehicle as a potential noise source in the traffic flow. Several conditions have been analysed and was evaluated the change in the number of citizens exposed to diverse ranges of noise levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The results of the comparative analysis of road network classification systems in different countries are given, on the basis of which we have proposed a list of criteria that make a basis of road network classification; the peculiarities of the design of the proposed street classes are discovered. Using the example of the central part of Irkutsk, we conducted an audit of street space. In view of the proposed streets classes, we proposed measures to reform the road network of the study area. In the new network we estimated the traffic demand and the redistribution of traffic flows. The simulation results show a significant decrease in inter-regional transit flows of individual transport in the central part of the city. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, many current methods only deal with distance variables and do not handle angle variables between two segments. In this paper, we propose a new road network map matching algorithm, considering not only the distance between two sample points but also taking into account the angle between two candidate segments using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) which is a popular solution for map matching. Subsequently, to solve the HMM problem, we make use of dynamic programming Viterbi algorithm to find the maximum probability road segments. The experiments are implemented on BEIJING CITY map real dataset and display that our map matching algorithm significantly improve the accuracy compared with ST-Matching global algorithm.

Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) is applied to detect the real time traffic flow. Based on the traffic flow at the current traffic light cycle and the historical data, we use machine learning technique to predict the variation of the traffic flow at the next traffic light cycle. With the purpose of reducing the road network's average waiting time and balancing the traffic pressure between different intersections, the traffic light control system adjusts the timing plan cooperatively. The genetic algorithm is used to calculate the optimum traffic light timing plan. In addition, a novel state transition model of the road network for dynamic numerical simulation is utilized to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. According to a 4-nodes road network simulation result, the vehicles in the traffic flow with congestion problems will have a shorter waiting time while the vehicle in the other traffic flows will have an increased waiting time. More importantly, the average waiting time of the road network declines.

It is mainly used to increase the individual's benefit such as decreasing travel time. However, the selfish decision on the lane-changing behavior can sometimes make a negative impact on the overall traffic flow. As autonomous vehicle technology develops, modeling lane changing action as well as lane changing decision making falls within the control category of autonomous vehicles. In this study, we focused on decision making of lane change for autonomous vehicles considering traffic flow, and accordingly, we propose a lane change control system considering whole traffic flow. The lane change control system predicts the future traffic situation using Cell Transmission Model and determines the lane change probability for each lane that minimizes the total time delay through the genetic algorithm. The lane change control system then provides the lane change probability to the vehicles. Performance evaluation of the proposed system in macroscopic simulation shows reduction in the overall travel time delay. The performance of proposed system is also evaluated in microscopic traffic simulation, evaluating the potential performance when it is applied to the actual traffic system: The maximum traffic flow was increased, and the congestion area was greatly reduced and the time required for individual vehicles was reduced.

In this paper, a centralized cooperative intersection control (CCIC) approach is proposed for the non-signalized intersections under automated vehicle environment. The cooperative intersection control problem is converted to a nonlinear constrained programming problem considering vehicle delay, fuel consumption, emission and driver comfort level. Furthermore, a simulation-based case study is carried out on a four-legged, two-lane non-signalized intersection under different traffic volume scenarios to compare CCIC with the actuated intersection control (AIC) system. The results indicate that the CCIC approach shows significant potential improvements on the traffic efficiency (i.e., nearly 14% of traffic flow increase, nearly 90% of travelling time saving), emission (nearly 60% of CO2 reduction) and driver comfort level (nearly 2% of comfort level increase).

At present, the inter-city traffic network is composed of highway, railway, air, water and rail mass transit. There are a lot traffic flow is overlay on the intercity freeway. It is very important to construct high capacity inter-city rail mass transit transportation system, especially the distance about 120 km to 150 km between cities. As a high-capacity inter-city traffic, reasonable speed, energy consumption, the distance between stations, and rail ticket fare to reflect the rail transit construction investment and passenger flow size, especially, reasonable traffic demand rate among rail transit and other modes in the intercity. To form an optimal travel mode proportion both for the traffic planner and residents. This paper made simulation and bi-level model. And we discuss on the index relation of inter-city rail transit. Those calibrated results are given for parameters range of the inter-city rail operation management in china.

The regional freeway network traffic safety evaluation index system is established, and the nine specific evaluation indicators are quantitatively analyzed, including the traffic flow parameters, security parameters and meteorological parameters of three criterion levels. Combining with the fuzzy interval theory, this paper has adopted [0, 1] interval theory to build the regional freeway network traffic safety performance interval assessment model. Finally, Jilin Province freeway network is taking as an example to apply the proposed model and the effectiveness and practicality of the model is demonstrated. This research can provide a reference for regional freeway multi-source data fusion and improve freeway traffic safety in China.

This paper presents a methodology for determining the critical point leading to congestion in urban traffic, based on analyyszing the network topology and flow using an innovative mixture of complex network metrics and state of the art traffic simulation. To validate the concepts and methodology we conducted a case study over the city of Timisoara. At around 0.5 million inhabitants we believe it provides, which provides a suitable benchmark for deriving empirical, results and qualitative interpretations.

Distributed communication systems have come up recently as a very important mechanism in modern road networks in order to deal with this issue. Also, traffic delay problems due to jams are manifesting in many of the urban centers worldwide. With the objective of decreasing and in the best case avoiding congestion, V2X communication is exploited in order to counteract traffic jams by intelligent rerouting. Notwithstanding, the transition from very low penetration rates of vehicles that are equipped with communication functionality to a situation where basically all vehicles have the capability to send and receive information will not be made overnight. To a greater degree, the penetration of connected vehicles will increase more and more, which further will result in a very long period of mixed composition. This paper focuses on the analysis of a variable ratio of vehicles with routing and communication capabilities to those who are not. It analyzes the performance of a predictive rerouting algorithm when a distinct percentage of vehicles is unable to communicate for distinct traffic densities, and proves by simulations that even penetration rates far from a hundred percent lead to an improvement of the average time and fuel consumption as well as CO2 emissions per vehicle.

Towards an accurate road traffic control, the short-term traffic forecasting which predicts the road traffic at the particular site in a short period is often useful and important. In existing works, Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model is a popular approach. The scheme however encounters two challenges: 1) the analysis on related data is insufficient whereas some important features of data may be neglected; and 2) with data presenting different features, it is unlikely to have one predictive model that can fit all situations. To tackle above issues, in this work, we develop a hybrid model to improve accuracy of SARIMA. In specific, we first explore the autocorrelation and distribution features existed in traffic flow to amend structure of the time series model. Based on the Gaussian distribution of traffic flow, a hybrid model with a Bayesian learning algorithm is developed which can effectively expand the application scenarios of SARIMA. We show the efficiency and accuracy of our proposal using both analysis and experimental studies. Using the real-world trace data, we show that the proposed predicting approach can achieve satisfactory performance in practice.

While existing solutions like smart vehicles and autonomous driving are inapplicable for Indian cities, transport surveys in India have provided offline solutions through GPS data. Without analytical formulations, they are prone to failure in ever- changing Indian urban landscape. This paper addresses this contemporary problem and provides an analytical model that serves as the backbone for developing ITS in India. Contribution of this paper is the formulation of objective function using road networks that reduces congestion by minimizing vehicular density under constraints of feasible paths and traffic flows. Novelty of this work is further established by exhaustive studies that determine important traffic metrics and further establish relationships among critical congestion- queue parameters. Additionally, indepth studies of Indian cities under this model justify our motivation for ITS- enabled India. Finally, validation with theoretical model establishes the credibility of this work.

The issues of congestion stem from the lack of street capacity, facilities to accommodate the increase in means of transport, absence of proper management based on modern transport and technical development, lack of efficient and convenient public transportation services and, dependence on private cars. This leading to increased traffic density, and changes in speed of traffic flow which causes an increase in energy consumption and gas emissions such as carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, soot, and particulate pollutants. This research studies the pollution rates caused by congestion in the streets connected to the intersection of Jadriya, which is located near Baghdad University. The proportion of gases emitted by vehicles was calculated using regression equations and this calculation has depended on the traffic volume. In addition, other factors that contributed to the calculation some of this equations include: speed of traffic flow, street capacity, the height of neighbouring buildings, and forestation intensity. The final results demonstrate the types and proportion of gases that pollute the environment as compared with the international health standards to determine the percentage of the encroachment of polluting gases in the area. The possibility of applying ITS was discussed, by reusing regression equations to estimate emissions depending on the variation of future traffic volume and speed. Future traffic volume was estimated by a percentage of views of a group of experts in the field of transportation. The results indicate a significant decrease in emissions if ITS applied.

In this contest, one of the crucial points for road safety are weaving lanes where different flow can perform different maneuver merging and diverging, producing some conflict points. Bearing in mind this facet, this particular elements, have to be designed with a specific geometry, in order to ensure both maneuver, deceleration for exit and acceleration for entrance in the main flow. The main goal of this paper is the analyze the exchange maneuver of vehicles by means of a real time driving simulator, which allows to evaluate the performance of car users when approaching the exchange of lanes under the same boundary conditions. More specifically, the present paper deals with the extension of previously performed research on this type of element. Therefore, same indicators, same analysis technique and virtual reality scenarios were adopted, in order to establish a comparison between two different conditions of approach to the weaving lane: the first with same speed between the main and the secondary flow, the second one, with a significant speed difference between the flows. The analysis of the maneuvers has been addressed at first under a geometrical point of view and then estimating the related risk parameters in line with the same indicators presented in the previous research (deceleration and risk area evaluated as longitudinal ant transversal distance between vehicles). The main results highlight that, under a geometrical point of view, in different speed condition between the two flows, car users tend to reduce the length of the maneuver, performing the weaving earlier and then occupying a reduced length of the lane in comparison at same speed condition. Under the point of view of risk analysis, results are more significant in terms of traffic flow management rather than in terms of lengths of the lanes. In case of flows with different speed, car users tend to use brakes more often, probably because they are calibrating the speed of the vehicle approaching the weaving lane.

By analyzing the relationship between the severity of freeway traffic incidents and the number of lanes, flow, speed and duration of traffic events in the event lane, the following conclusions are drawn:(1)The traffic flow of traffic incident lane and non-traffic incident lane has multi-mode, sudden jump and other abrupt theoretical features When a traffic incident occurs; (2) The severity of traffic accidents controls the degree of sudden and sudden jump of traffic incident lane and non traffic incident lane. Based on catastrophe theory, this paper proposes a discriminant model of traffic accident severity based on traffic flow velocity and flow rate as independent variables. The measured data of expressway traffic events verifies the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Due to the operational characteristics (e.g. acceleration/deceleration, manoeuvrability) and physical specifications (e.g. length, size) of heavy vehicles, they impose negative impacts on surrounding traffic. These negative impacts include increasing traffic congestion, reducing traffic safety and increasing air and noise pollution. The negative impacts imposed by heavy vehicles would be intensified at arterial roads due to the presence of traffic lights when heavy vehicles have to decelerate at the red light, stop and then accelerate again. Considering the negative impacts of heavy vehicles on their surrounding traffic, suitable management strategies should be implemented to accommodate the increase in number of heavy vehicles. A typical method of managing heavy vehicle movements is through implementing alternative heavy vehicle restriction strategies. The main focus of this paper is to address the influence of heavy vehicle space restriction strategies for different classes of heavy vehicles on traffic congestion. In this research heavy vehicles have been classified into three classes including Rigid, Heavy Combination and Multi Combination. The road section that is used in this research is a section of Princes Highway in Melbourne, Australia. This section is 8.8 km long and 13 signalised intersections exist within that distance. To ensure accurate evaluation of the restriction strategies, VISSIM traffic simulation software is used. The study area is modelled in VISSIM. Afterwards, the restriction strategies are applied to the VISSIM model where certain classes of the heavy vehicles will be banned to use the road during the peak period. Four different heavy vehicle restriction strategies are applied in this research. The first strategy is having no restriction for heavy vehicles. The second strategy will apply restrictions on the multi combination class only. The third strategy will apply restrictions on both multi combination and heavy combination classes. The fourth strategy will restrict all classes of heavy vehicles. The effects of each restriction strategy on different traffic measurements will be evaluated at different heavy vehicle compositions. Restricting all heavy vehicles was deemed the most efficient restriction strategy in terms of the traffic performance measures used in this study. Copyright (C) 2017 The Authors.

Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel is one of the most popular ways to construct a kernel. The key observation is that in real-world data, besides the data attribute information, data label information also exists, which indicates the data class. In order to make use of both data attribute information and data label information, in this work, we propose a supervised kernel construction method. Supervised information from training data is integrated into standard kernel construction process to improve the discriminative property of resulting kernel. A supervised Laplacian embedding cellular automaton model is another key application developed for two-lane heterogeneous traffic flow with the safe distance and large-scale truck. Based on the properties of traffic flow in China, we re-calibrate the cell length, velocity, random slowing mechanism and lane-change conditions and use simulation tests to study the relationships among the speed, density and flux. The numerical results show that the large-scale trucks will have great effects on the traffic flow, which are relevant to the proportion of the large-scale trucks, random slowing rate and the times of the lane space change.

To appropriately distribute power between the engine and the energy buffer (normally battery) without sacrificing fuel economy, optimal control strategies of varies kinds have been proposed in recent years. Some strategies, however, cannot be applied in real time environment for the tightly independent on the future driving information. Some others could identify the different road condition but the identification accuracy is questionable, making their real-world effectiveness could suffer significantly. Moreover, the proposed energy management method seldom consider the effect from the driver behavior, which is an essential factor that can determine the vehicle energy consumption. For such reasons, this paper proposes a novel energy management strategy, the instantaneous optimization method-Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) is chosen as the foundation solution to the PHEV energy management problem. Then the paper studies the effect from different driver behavior and uses fuzzy logic method to identify different drive behavior. Combined with the pre-knowledge provide by Intelligent Transport System (ITS), the equivalent factor, which is the core of ECMS, is adjusted, making the real instantaneous application of ECMS. Then the simulation is performed to prove its viability and effectiveness.

Improving the drivers' lane selection process is not only the most fundamental reason for transforming vehicle aggregating but also the basic component of traffic flow research. However, the effects of factors such as the characteristics of individual vehicles and drivers, the types of manipulators used in complex vehicle aggregation situations, and the influence of vehicle conflict on lane selection have not been addressed in previous studies. This paper assesses the characteristics of various traffic manipulators, vehicles, and drivers to develop a lane selection model of basic urban expressway segments based on mixed fuzzy many-person, multi-objective, non-cooperative games. By analyzing drivers' profits under different combinations of lane selection behavior, Nash equilibrium was confirmed in a single game process and optimal lane selection behavior was obtained in a dynamic game. The results show that the model's prediction accuracy of lane changing is 85.2%.

However, those traditional traffic flow models where driving behaviors are driven only by the preceding vehicle information are no longer suited to describing this situation. Therefore, a bidirectional cellular automaton model is proposed under active bidirectional looking (ABDL) context, which involves the actively obtained succeeding vehicle information and includes two special cases (i.e., the forward-looking only (FLO) and backward-looking only (BLO)). Meanwhile, a methodology of giving the sensitivity coefficients in the randomization probability of braking is introduced, which helps categorize drivers into three different sensitivity types (i.e., aggressive, normal, and conservative). Subsequently, various kinds of homogeneous and heterogeneous vehicle fleets are generated depending on the combinations of stimulation type (i.e., ABDL, FLO, and BLO) and the sensitivity types, whose safety performance can be evaluated by the average danger coefficients. Finally, through numerical experiments, it is concluded that considering both the preceding and succeeding vehicle information under V2V while driving is conducive to improving the safety performance, and the vehicular flow state, stimulation type, sensitivity type, and orders between different stimulation or sensitivity types have an important effect on the safety performance.

In this extensive field of technologies, vehicular communications will constitute the core of a large set of advanced driving assistance systems for improving road safety as well as helping to reduce the environmental impact of transport. These communication technologies are currently under deployment, but their mandatory installation in newly manufactured cars is foreseen in the next 5years. This equipment will enable the new Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) system to be installed in these vehicles. Many of these safety applications are currently under development. However, there are some road users who are not commonly included in this vehicular communication ecosystem, specifically, vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists. Current assistance systems focused on reducing crashes with this user group are based on sensors installed in the vehicles but do not include vehicular communications. In this article, we present a novel Vulnerable Road User (VRU) warning system based on Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications, which is capable of detecting a motorcycle circulating in the vicinity of the connected vehicles, launching sound and visual warnings, and using a smartphone as human-machine interface. The system has been designed, implemented, and tested in the laboratory as well as on real roads in real traffic flow.

The structure of our review is based on the ripple effect concept, which represents the implications of automated vehicles at three different stages: first-order (traffic, travel cost, and travel choices), second-order (vehicle ownership and sharing, location choices and land use, and transport infrastructure), and third-order (energy consumption, air pollution, safety, social equity, economy, and public health). Our review shows that first-order impacts on road capacity, fuel efficiency, emissions, and accidents risk are expected to be beneficial. The magnitude of these benefits will likely increase with the level of automation and cooperation and with the penetration rate of these systems. The synergistic effects between vehicle automation, sharing, and electrification can multiply these benefits. However, studies confirm that automated vehicles can induce additional travel demand because of more and longer vehicle trips. Potential land use changes have not been included in these estimations about excessive travel demand. Other third-order benefits on safety, economy, public health and social equity still remain unclear. Therefore, the balance between the short-term benefits and long-term impacts of vehicle automation remains an open question.

The quality of outsourced probe data on freeways has led many departments of transportation to consider such data for arterial performance monitoring. From April 2013 through June of 2014, the University of Maryland Center for Advanced Transportation Technology gathered travel times from several arterial corridors within the mid-Atlantic region using Bluetooth traffic monitoring (BTM) equipment, and compared these travel times with the data reported to the I95 Vehicle Probe Project (VPP) from an outsourced probe data vendor. The analysis consisted of several methodologies: (1) a traditional analysis that used precision and bias speed metrics; (2) a slowdown analysis that quantified the percentage of significant traffic disruptions accurately captured in the VPP data; (3) a sampled distribution method that uses overlay methods to enhance and analyze recurring congestion patterns. (4) Last, the BTM and VPP data from each 24-hour period of data collection were reviewed by the research team to assess the extent to which VPP captured the nature of the traffic flow. Based on the analysis, probe data is recommended only on arterial roadways with signal densities (measured in signals per mile) up to one, and it should be tested and used with caution for signal densities between one and two, and is not recommended when signal density exceeds two.

With a focus on highways, existing literatures studied the feasibility of autonomous vehicle in continuous traffic flows and the controllability of cooperative driving. However, rare efforts have been made to investigate the traffic control strategies in autonomous vehicle environment on urban roads, especially in urban intersections. In autonomous vehicle environment, it is possible to achieve cooperative driving with V2V and V2I wireless communication. Without signal control, conflicted traffic flows could pass intersections through mutual cooperative, which is a remarkable improvement to existing traffic control methods. This paper established a cellular automata model with greedy algorithm for the traffic control of intersections in autonomous vehicle environment, with autonomous vehicle platoon as the optimization object. NetLogo multiagent simulation platform model was employed to simulate the proposed model. The simulation results are compared with the traffic control programs in conventional Synchro optimization. The findings suggest that, on the premises of ensuring traffic safety, the control strategy of the proposed model significantly reduces average delays and number of stops as well as increasing traffic capacity.

We will also discuss visibility, traffic flow, safety, and environmental and economic aspects. The use of an optimum level of road lighting maximizes the contrast between the background and the object to be seen. This suggests that the combined effect of road lighting and car headlights should be taken into account. Solutions for future measurement need to include 3D modeling of the lighting environment and mesopic photometry. The life cycle environmental impacts of high-pressure sodium (HPS) and light emitting diode (LED) luminaires were found to be on a similar level, but it is expected that LED luminaires will surpass HPS luminaires in environmental friendliness across the whole life cycle in the future. The energy-saving potential is based on new energy-efficient technology, reduced burning hours with smart control, and new lighting dimensioning. The energy saving potential when replacing HPS lamps with LED luminaires is 31% with current technology and 66% with improved technology in the future. Further energy savings are achievable with reduced burning hours enabled with smart lighting. Altogether, the energy-saving potential of the future LED luminaire is 83% compared to current HPS luminaires.

It is a concept which is frequently involved in the research of traffic flow theory, especially the active vehicle security. Studying vehicle group situation in depth is of great significance for traffic safety. Three-lane condition was taken as an example; the characteristics of target vehicle and its neighboring vehicles were synthetically considered to restructure the vehicle group situation in this paper. The Gamma distribution theory was used to identify the vehicle group situation when target vehicle arrived at the end of the study area. From the perspective of driver-vehicle feature evolution, the reverse reconstruction method of vehicle group situation in the urban road network was proposed. Results of actual driving, virtual driving, and simulation experiments showed that the model established in this paper was reasonable and feasible.

First, we analyze and visualize accident occurrences and key features in both temporal and spatial view. Second, we propose our context-aware methodology. Finally, we illustrate spatio-temporal visualization results through two case studies. These findings would not only help traffic police department implement instant personnel assignments among simultaneous accidents, but also inform individual drivers about accident-prone sections and most dangerous time spans, which would require their most attention.

The growing number of taxi trips and the increasing contribution of taxis to traffic congestion are cause for concern when vacant taxis are not distributed optimally within the city and are unable to find unserved passengers effectively. A way of improving taxi operations is to deploy a taxi dispatch system that matches the vacant taxis and waiting passengers while considering the search friction dynamics. This paper presents a network-scale taxi dispatch model that takes into account the interrelated impact of normal traffic flows and taxi dynamics while optimizing for an effective dispatching system. The proposed model builds on the concept of the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) to represent the dynamic evolution of traffic conditions. The model considers multiple taxi service firms operating in a heterogeneously congested city, where the city is assumed to be partitioned into multiple regions each represented with a well-defined MFD. A model predictive control approach is devised to control the taxi dispatch system. The results show that lack of the taxi dispatching system leads to severe accumulation of unserved taxi passengers and vacant taxis in different regions whereas the dispatch system improves the taxi service performance and reduces traffic congestion by regulating the network towards the undersaturated condition.

Real-timely capturing traffic video data through the UAV is a new way to get road condition. In this paper, we set the statistics of road traffic flow as the starting point. After analyzing the characteristics of videos shot by the UAV, we choose to use the deep learning framework based on Faster-RCNN to train a vehicle detection model to detect vehicle targets in videos. The motion track of vehicles in the shooting scene were drawn according to the result of object detection. In the end, analyzing the track and calculating the traffic flow. From the experimental results, it can be seen that deep learning method can achieve a high detection accuracy and based on this, we can calculate the traffic flow well.

The use of time series analysis techniques such as Box-Jenldns Autoregressive Integrated Moving average (ARIMA) as attempted in mans studies generally requires large quantity of data for model development. In case if sufficient data are not available, it may not be possible to use ARIMA for traffic volume prediction. To overcome this problem, other time series methods such as multiplicative decomposition can be used as they arc easier to understand as well as implement when compared to ARIMA models and the present study is an attempt in this direction. A midblock section in a busy arterial road in Vellore, Tamilnadu was considered and limited traffic volume data from two consecutive days collected between 7 am and 11 am was used for model development using multiplicative decomposition technique. The results are promising and it was found that the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between observed and predicted volume falls between 9 and 16, which is acceptable in many ITS applications.

A site-specific traffic load model for long-span multi-pylon cable-stayed bridges	STRUCTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Long-span bridges; multi-pylon bridges; structural effect; influence line; surface; random traffic flow; site-specific; traffic load model	LIVE LOAD; SIMULATION; AMERICAN	This paper proposes a site-specific traffic load model for long-span multi-pylon cable-stayed bridge. Structural effects are primarily investigated based on influence lines, which are identified as either global effect (GE) or partial effect (PE) depending on the effective influenced region. GEs are further categorised as sensitive effect (SE), insensitive effect (ISE) or less sensitive effect (LSE), considering sensitivity to unbalanced traffic loading. Three on-bridge traffic states are simulated, and Weibull extrapolations are utilised to predict the extreme responses. These responses are analysed and compared with several design codes. Results indicate the maximum response is only 75% of the value calculated based on the design code of China (D60), and even lower than other codes. The responses show strong positive correlation with traffic parameters of annual average daily traffic volume and heavy vehicle proportion, and the on-bridge traffic states have significant influence on the responses. Further, the identified effects of ISE, SE and LSE present different responses, which indicate specific load models are needed accordingly. Finally, a site-specific traffic load model consisting of load form, loading pattern, multi-lane factor and load value is recommended, which gives an accurate illustration on the structural effects and traffic responses.

Simulation of the alternative scenarios for the traffic flows distribution allows evaluating the impact of various schemes of the road traffic organization and changes of the road infrastructure on the state of atmospheric air. It is necessary to consolidate the application of the legislative, economic and management mechanisms, orienting parties responsible for the negative consequences of the car operation to implement the optimal technological solutions. Possible economic incentives for the manufacturers of the vehicles, fuel producers, and the car owners are discussed, which enable to improve the environmental safety of the motor vehicles operation. The proposed model of an environmental fuel tax has been tested in the evaluating of the annual value of the possible additional tax revenues from a number of Russian refineries. The introduction of the proposed tax model can significantly reduce the negative consequences of vehicles operation.

The increasing popularity of e-bikes raised some safety concerns regarding urban transport systems. The primary objective of this study was to identify whether and how the generalized linear regression model (GLM) could be used to relate cyclists' safety with various contributing factors when riding in a mid-block bike lane. The types of 2-wheeled vehicles in the study included bicycle-style electric bicycles (BSEBs), scooter-style electric bicycles (SSEBs), and regular bicycles (RBs).Methods: Traffic conflict technology was applied as a surrogate measure to evaluate the safety of 2-wheeled vehicles. The safety performance model was developed by adopting a generalized linear regression model for relating the frequency of rear-end conflicts between e-bikes and regular bikes to the operating speeds of BSEBs, SSEBs, and RBs in mid-block bike lanes.Results: The frequency of rear-end conflicts between e-bikes and bikes increased with an increase in the operating speeds of e-bikes and the volume of e-bikes and bikes and decreased with an increase in the width of bike lanes. The large speed difference between e-bikes and bikes increased the frequency of rear-end conflicts between e-bikes and bikes in mid-block bike lanes. A 1% increase in the average operating speed of e-bikes would increase the expected number of rear-end conflicts between e-bikes and bikes by 1.48%. A 1% increase in the speed difference between e-bikes and bikes would increase the expected number of rear-end conflicts between e-bikes/bikes by 0.16%.Conclusions: The conflict frequency in mid-block bike lanes can be modeled using generalized linear regression models. The factors that significantly affected the frequency of rear-end conflicts included the operating speeds of e-bikes, the speed difference between e-bikes and regular bikes, the volume of e-bikes, the volume of bikes, and the width of bike lanes. The safety performance model can help better understand the causes of crash occurrences in mid-block bike lanes.

The locations within a network that satisfy specific goals need to be carefully selected, based on predefined goals related to the effective collection of data and the subsequent estimation of traffic related information. The detection of traffic volumes is mainly associated with two purposes, the travel time and the Origin-Destination (O-D) trip matrix estimation. In this context, this paper presents a quadratic programing model, able to determine the optimal location of tracking sensors. The model is implemented in the urban road network of the city of Thessaloniki (Greece) in which specific number of sensors is installed and utilized for real-time travel time information provision. The proposed methodology models the sensor location problem under the general framework of a set covering problem, which is one of the most popular optimization problems and has been applied in many industrial problems. The results of the case study in Thessaloniki reveal that the proposed model defines the optimal location of the limited number of sensors in such a way that the network, which is created having all sensors as origin or destination of all possible paths, represents to great extent (87% of the traffic flow along the major paths) the traffic volumes of the whole road network of the city.

However, streetcars have been criticized for causing traffic congestion since large trams must operate in mixed traffic on narrow, congested streets. At the same time, streetcars reduce congestion by encouraging automobile drivers to use trams. So what is the net effect of streetcars on congestion? This paper presents a new method for assessing the net traffic congestion effects associated with streetcar operations in Melbourne, Australia, which has the largest streetcar network in the world. Impacts were determined with the use of a traffic network model to compare congestion with trams and without trams. The positive impacts of trams were estimated using mode shift from tram to automobile when tram services were removed. Negative impacts were explored by considering streetcar traffic operations, the impact of curbside tram stops, and the effect of exclusive priority tram lanes on traffic flow. Findings show that the streetcar network in inner Melbourne results in a net congestion benefit to traffic; a 3.4% decrease in vehicle time traveled and total delay on the road network was established. The streetcar network also contributes to reducing the number of moderately congested links by 16%. Areas for future research are suggested, such as exploring the spatial distribution of the mode shift to automobile and the long-term effect of trams on traffic.

Modeling Choices of Control Transitions in Full-Range Adaptive Cruise Control	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							TRAFFIC FLOW EFFICIENCY	Automated vehicles and driving assistance systems such as adaptive cruise control (ACC) are expected to reduce traffic congestion, accidents, and levels of emissions. Field operational tests have found that drivers may prefer to deactivate ACC in dense traffic flow conditions and before changing lanes. Despite the potential effects of these control transitions on traffic flow efficiency and safety, most mathematical models evaluating the impact of ACC do not adequately represent that process. This research aimed to identify the main factors influencing drivers' choice to resume manual control. A mixed logit model that predicted the choice to deactivate the system or overrule it by pressing the gas pedal was estimated. The data set was collected in an on-road experiment in which 23 participants drove a research vehicle equipped with full-range ACC on a 35.5-km freeway in Munich, Germany, during peak hours. The results reveal that drivers were more likely to deactivate the ACC and resume manual control when approaching a slower leader, when expecting vehicles cutting in, when driving above the ACC target speed, and before exiting the freeway. Drivers were more likely to overrule the ACC system by pressing the gas pedal a few seconds after the system had been activated and when the vehicle decelerated. Everything else being equal, some drivers had higher probabilities to resume manual control. This study concludes that a novel conceptual framework linking ACC system settings, driver behavior characteristics, driver characteristics, and environmental factors is needed to model driver behavior in control transitions between ACC and manual driving.

Novel Area Occupancy-Based Method for Passenger Car Unit Estimation on Multilane Urban Roads Under Heterogeneous Traffic Scenario	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							VEHICLES; CAPACITY; FLOW; EXPRESSWAYS; EQUIVALENTS; SIMULATION; WIDTH; INDIA	This research was aimed at developing an area occupancy-based method for estimating passenger car unit (PCU) values for vehicle categories under heterogeneous traffic conditions on multilane urban roads for a wide range of traffic flow levels. First, PCU values of vehicle categories were determined according to the Transport and Road Research Laboratory definition and replaced the commonly considered measure of performance speed with area occupancy using simulation. The PCU values obtained were found to be significantly different for different volume-to-capacity ratios; this result shows that the PCU value is dynamic in nature. While the dynamic nature of PCU values is well appreciated, practitioners may prefer a single set of optimized PCU values (unique for each vehicle category). Hence, a new method with a matrix solution was proposed to estimate the optimized or unique set of PCU values with area occupancy as the performance measure. To check the credibility of the proposed method, the estimated PCU values were compared from existing guidelines regulated by the Indian Roads Congress (IRC) and values estimated with the widely accepted dynamic PCU concept of speed-area ratio. Results show that the PCU values suggested by IRC and the dynamic PCU concept using the speed-area ratio underestimate and overestimate the flows, respectively, at different traffic volumes. However, the values obtained with the area-occupancy concept were found to be consistent with the traffic flow in a cars-only traffic situation at different flow conditions. The derived set of optimized PCU values proposed can be useful for traffic engineers, researchers, and practitioners for capacity and level-of-service analysis under heterogeneous traffic conditions.

Advice on lane changing can therefore be beneficial to both individual drivers and traffic in the network. The many variations in the content and objectives of advice, however, may affect the effectiveness of the advice. This paper focuses on the optimization of traffic flow through the performance of specific lane changes. Traffic flow is modeled on a two-lane stretch, and lane change time instants of a subset of vehicles are considered as decision variables. Optimizations with three objectives are constructed: a collective optimum, a group optimum, and a user optimum. These optima are found through the minimization of the total travel delay of different vehicle groups. To solve the problems, a genetic algorithm is implemented as a heuristic method. Each optimum leads to different lane changes. Specifically, through the proposed algorithm, vehicles receive suggestions to change lanes in bigger gaps to improve collective or group efficiency and are supposed to overtake as many vehicles as they can by changing lanes for their own benefit. The algorithm can be further extended to a more effective in-car advice system, which can improve traffic efficiency through communication with partly automated vehicles.

J	Ou, JS; Xia, JX; Wu, YJ; Rao, WM				Ou, Jishun; Xia, Jingxin; Wu, Yao-Jan; Rao, Wenming			Short-Term Traffic Flow Forecasting for Urban Roads Using Data-Driven Feature Selection Strategy and Bias-Corrected Random Forests	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							PREDICTION; MULTIVARIATE; VOLUME; REGRESSION; NETWORK	Urban traffic flow forecasting is essential to proactive traffic control and management. Most existing forecasting methods depend on proper and reliable input features, for example, weather conditions and spatio-temporal lagged variables of traffic flow. However, the feature selection process is often done manually without comprehensive evaluation and leads to inaccurate results. For that challenge, this paper presents an approach combining the bias-corrected random forests algorithm with a data-driven feature selection strategy for short-term urban traffic flow forecasting. First, several input features were extracted from traffic flow time series data. Then the importance of these features was quantified with the permutation importance measure. Next, a data-driven feature selection strategy was introduced to identify the most important features. Finally, the forecasting model was built on the bias-corrected random forests algorithm and the selected features. The proposed approach was validated with data collected from three types of urban roads (expressway, major arterial, and minor arterial) in Kunshan City, China. The proposed approach was also compared with 10 existing approaches to verify its effectiveness. The results of the validation and comparison show that even without further model tuning, the proposed approach achieves the lowest average mean absolute error and root mean square error on six stations while it achieves the second-best average performance in mean absolute percentage error. Meanwhile, the training efficiency is improved compared with the original random forests method owing to the use of the feature selection strategy.

J	Kim, S; Yeo, H				Kim, Sunghoon; Yeo, Hwasoo			Evaluating link criticality of road network based on the concept of macroscopic fundamental diagram	TRANSPORTMETRICA A-TRANSPORT SCIENCE			English	Article						Link criticality; macroscopic fundamental diagram; network performance; traffic flow; urban road network	DEGRADABLE TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS; VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS; URBAN; ACCESSIBILITY; ROBUSTNESS; CAPACITY; METHODOLOGY; RELIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; PERIMETER	A measure related to resilience and vulnerability can be useful in supporting decision-making process for maintenance and repair strategies. The existing measures have been focusing on large-scale road networks like highways between cities, although urban-scale networks are equally important. This study proposes a new methodology for evaluating link criticality of urban road network based on the concept of macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD). Such operational measure is derived by comparing the MFD behaviour in normal condition and the behaviour in event condition, in which a link of a road network is disabled by an extreme event. A simulation study for testing the proposed measure is practiced on the road network of Gangnam district, Seoul, South Korea. The results show that the measure can help us observe the different patterns of network flow reduction by different traffic states.

This study encapsulated travellers' sequential path adjustment mechanism into a day-to-day dynamical system, to capture travellers' en-route switching effect without actually building a complicated within-day model to go with. According to different path choice behaviours and traffic information sources, three traveller groups were contained in the dynamical system, including the conservative travellers, the adventurous travellers unequipped with advanced traveller information systems (ATISs) and the ATIS-assisted adventurous travellers. In the proposed day-to-day dynamical model, a fixed point problem was established for achieving the heterogeneous traffic flow caused by travellers' en-route path switching. Some stability analysis of the proposed dynamical system was accomplished in the numerical experiment. The effect of en-route path switching behaviour was investigated and it was found to influence both the stability of the dynamical system and the average travel time of adventurous travellers.

Traffic flow sensitivity to parameters in viscoelastic modelling	TRANSPORTMETRICA B-TRANSPORT DYNAMICS			English	Article						Viscoelasticity; average vehicular length; braking distance; traffic flow sensitivity	VARIATIONAL FORMULATION; WAVES; APPROXIMATIONS; RELAXATION; SCHEMES; HIGHWAY; SYSTEMS; ROADS	This paper presents viscoelastic modelling of traffic flows briefly first and then shows numerical simulation results of ring traffic flow sensitivity to model parameters, such as viscoelasticity, average vehicle length, braking distance, and characteristic length used to define relaxation time. It was found that traffic flow pattern formation is dramatically sensitive to viscoelasticity and fundamental diagram which is explicitly impacted by average vehicle length and braking distance, implying that drivers' self-organisation ability is significant in determining the intensity of traffic wave interaction. Since the decrease of characteristic length can lead to a relevant change of traffic relaxation time, the length can play a sensitive role in changing traffic wave structures. Optimisation of traffic regulations is necessary for the well operation of a segmental or ring road.	[Smirnova, M. N.; Bogdanova, A.; Zhu, Zuojin; Smirnov, N.

With the increasing use of intelligent vehicles, traffic flow control methods have been improved as compared to the traditional methods, such as traffic light management. Among new possible methods, the one we want to explore in this paper is to combine several relative intelligent vehicles into one platoon with a reduced distance and allowing an increase of the road capacity. However, the use of platoons brings some issues at system level, for instance when several platoons encounter with each other at road nodes. In order to give answers to these issues, we define one organization strategies including defined interactions between vehicles and between platoons. In this paper, one multi-agent model is proposed to tackle with this issue. The proposed algorithm is implemented based on multi-level control method and is experimented in the scenario where one vehiclestrain composed by three vehicles is reconfigured in two lane road.

Traditionally, people monitors traffic flows by GPS devices installed on buses or cars and traces hit-and-run incidents by road cameras, which turns out to be inefficient in that the data are sparse to represent a massive of people traces. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called mobile sequence to describe urban roads and moving object trajectories. Firstly, we use real urban roads information and base stations location information to generate urban roads mobile sequence. Then we extract people's mobile sequence from massive mobile network logs. Finally, we match roads' mobile sequence with people's mobile sequence to obtain human traces. As a validation, we use application installed on mobile phone to gather some real urban roads and base stations' information and then calculate their real mobile sequences to match the theoretical mobile sequences and gain 94.8% covering rate. Also, we use people's mobile sequences extracted from mobile network logs with theoretical mobile sequences and gain 90.6% matching accuracy.

The system covered in this article, called PetGyn, falls into this category. It is powerful enough to represent scenarios of changes in the structure of road networks and/or in the behavior of their elements (pathways, traffic lights, possible conversions, etc.) and for predicting road usage levels (volume and traffic speed). In addition, PetGyn's flexibility allows the employment of different traffic allocation models (system optimization, user equilibrium, etc.), various types of cost functions (from the classic BPR - Bureau of Public Roads - arc cost functions to non-separable and asymmetric functions) and the simulation of different behaviors for the road network components (blocking routes according to schedules/days, reversing the direction of traffic flows, allowing/forbidden parking along the lanes, among others). Since its conception, it was built in a modular way so that it can be easily adapted to the urban traffic particularities of any country. Unlike commercial systems in this area, PetGyn was developed under a free software philosophy and as a web-based system in order to favor collaborative work. Its usage allows the study of intervention projects for medium-sized metropolitan regions, contributing to identify possible improvements in urban mobility.

This paper aims to construct an open data test platform for updated traffic data accumulation and traffic simulation model verification by analyzing real time aerial video. Common calibration boards were used to calibrate internal camera parameters and image distortion correction was performed using a high-precision distortion model. To solve external parameters calibration problems, an existing algorithm was improved by adding two sets of orthogonal equations, achieving higher accuracy with only four calibrated points. A simplified algorithm is proposed to calibrate cameras by calculating the relationship between pixel and true length under the camera optical axis perpendicular to road conditions. Aerial video (160 min) from the Shanghai inner ring expressway was collected and real time traffic parameter values were obtained from analyzing and processing the aerial visual data containing spatial, time, velocity, and acceleration data. The results verify that the proposed platform provides a reasonable and objective approach to traffic simulation model verification and improvement. The proposed data platform also offers significant advantages over conventional methods that use historical and outdated data to run poorly calibrated traffic simulation models.

Due to the reduction of shock wave travelling upstream there will be decrease in pollution caused by traffic jams in-turn fuel efficiency of the vehicle will increase. This also reduce fatigue level of the driver as an added benefit. The system consists of Raspberry Pi 3 Model B kit with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enabled. Serial GPS receiver to get the current location of the vehicle. For demo purpose a dummy vehicle has been created, it is controlled via Bluetooth LE enabled smart phone. It has Hall Effect sensor to calculate the speed, Optoisolator and motor driver circuit to drive the demo vehicle. This system will recommend the driver a speed range which he needs to maintain so that he does not faces traffic jam ahead. This speed recommendation is generated based on the traffic scenario ahead that is communicated by vehicles equipped with such systems ahead of it. The system uses Macroscopic and Microscopic traffic models to calculate the speed recommendations based on the density gradient between the two communicating vehicles as derived in the paper[1].

In this paper we propose a Knowledge Discovery System that first gathers information from car sharing sites and applications, and then processes it to estimate interesting metrics such as travel time and vehicle flows in the urban areas at different times and in different days. We further argue that the information gathered can be processed in real-time, to estimate instant traffic, and can be exploited to perform deeper analysis, using historical data. Finally, we analyze vehicle availability as a function of time in different zones and show how the results can be applied to travel time estimation, car stockout forecast and multimodal travel planning.

Dynamic Traffic Rule Violation Monitoring System Using Automatic Number Plate Recognition with SMS Feedback	2017 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TELECOMMUNICATION AND NETWORKS (TEL-NET)			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Telecommunication and Networks (TEL-NET)	AUG 10-11, 2017	Amity Univ, Noida, INDIA	Amity Univ, Amity Inst Telecom Engn & Management, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, UP Sect, Facebook, Elect Corp India Ltd, Sci& Engn Res Board	Amity Univ	ANPR; License Plate Recognition; Matlab; GSM modem		In the last couple of decades, number of vehicles has been increased drastically. Hence it has become very difficult to keep track of each and every vehicle for the purpose of traffic management and the law enforcement. Use of Automation number Plate Recognition is increasingly now days for maintaining traffic activities and as similar to the method of automatic electronic toll collection. In the past, from the survey many techniques and algorithms have been proposed for number plate detection and recognition, each technique having its own advantages and disadvantages. The fundamental step in number plate detection is localization of a number plate. The proposed Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System is based on an image processing technology. The proposed system can be mainly used to monitor road traffic activities such as the identification of vehicle during traffic violations such as speed of vehicle and to detect at the street traffic signals lane violation. And thereby can be traced every vehicle for traffic rule violation and can provide the information to the concern authority to take further effective action, so we can have smooth traffic flow and also we can avoid accidents occurring on the traffic junction. This system can also be used to assist the authorities in identifying for any stolen vehicle. The proposed system first detects for any vehicle which violates traffic rule and then captures the vehicle image. From the captured image using image segmentation technique the vehicle number plate region will be extracted. And the technique used for the character recognition on number plate is Optical character recognition. The system is implemented and simulated using Matlab. Next we have feedback system i.e., the vehicle number which is extracted using the proposed ANPR algorithm from PC which is then given to GSM modem for further SMS feedback system to the user and concern authority. The system design also involves the design and development of GUI using Matlab, to ease the user in step by step recognizing the characters and numbers from the vehicle license plate and displaying on the desktop GUI screen.

Using PVs has a lower cost and a broader coverage, but cannot measure the traffic flow like using VDs. Most studies on PVs used Fundamental Diagram (FD) models to investigate the speed-density-flow relationship. However, they didn't notice that the driving speed is varied with the traffic signal. Accordingly, we propose an approach, Flow Estimation with Traffic Signal (FETS), to estimate the traffic flow in urban roads by considering the traffic signal. The speed is calculated at green light and the density is acquired by the queue length at red light. The experiment results show that the mean relative error of FETS is 44.4% while the best one of the FD models is 117.3%, representing that FETS has better accuracy than FD models in urban roads.

Some indicators of transport sustainability are accessibility measurement of origin/destination, the operating costs of transport (vehicle operating cost or VOC) and external transportation costs (emission cost). The indicators could be combined into accessibility measurement model. In other case, almost traffic congestion occurred on the condition of mixed traffic. This paper aimed to analyse the indicator of transport sustainability through simulation under condition of various traffic composition. Various composition of truck to total traffic flow are 0%, 10% and 20%. Speed and V/C are calculated from traffic flow to estimate the VOC and emission cost. 5 VOC components and 3 types of emission cost (CO2, CH4 and N2O) are counted to be a travel cost. Accessibility measurement was calculated using travel cost and gravity model approaches. Result of the research shows that the total traffic flow has indirect impact on accessibility measurement if using travel cost approach.

This study investigates the proper index of flow and density in the mixed traffic. There are eight pairs of indices of traffic flow and density that will be compared, in which it was varied by the concept and the measurement interval. The concept was distinguished according to the respond to the variance of vehicles in the traffic analysis, and the measurement interval was differentiated over time and time-space. The traffic was observed over a short section of a road which set as the detection zone. All pairs of indices will be applied and evaluated on the Fundamental Diagram to describe the actual traffic state in the density-flow plane. Then, the R-square of each density-flow curve will be compared. The result shows that the existence of vehicle variance in the share of traffic can be described more properly by considering the projected area of vehicles. The index of flow and density which considers the projected area of vehicles can explain the actual traffic state more appropriately by increasing the R-square of the model. In addition, the result does not provide a significant difference between the measurement over time and time-space in a short section of the road.

In order to improve the overall operational efficiency of the urban expressway network, this paper proposes a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) based prediction method to estimate the short period travel time on urban road. Compared with the approaches based on neural network and support vector machine regression model, GPR is easier to be implemented. Moreover, the proposed method is able to adapt to the urban road environment and has the advantages of hyper-parameter self-adaptive acquisition. Based on people's regular travel habits, this method considers the number of vehicles passing through the road section, the average vehicle speed, and the travel time jointly to predict the travel time of the next time period. We then predict the traveling time on the workdays and the weekends with the proposed method respectively. Results show that the prediction made by the proposed method is consistent with the actual result with 2.8% mean absolute percentage error and 97.2% prediction accuracy.

Road network - land use interaction model: Malang City in Indonesian case	3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF PLANNING IN THE ERA OF UNCERTAINTY	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference of Planning in the Era of Uncertainty (ICPEU)	MAR 03-07, 2017	Univ Brawijaya, Malang, INDONESIA		Univ Brawijaya		COMPACT CITY	Urban population in Indonesia is significantly increasing from 44% of total population in 2002 to approximately 60% in 2015. Rapid population growth has resulted in rapid urban land use changes. The problems became more complicated since the changes created mixed use development along the main urban corridors that resulted in higher trip generation and attraction while urban land very limited that made road widening and creation of new road less possible. This led to an accumulation of movement, worse road's level of service and congestion in the main urban corridor. The aims of the research are to analyse trip generation/attraction of the mixed-land uses of the main corridors Malang City; and to formulate road network - land use interaction model in the case of Malang (a nearly 1 million population city in 2015). The selected corridors in Malang City a main road in the west district of Malang City - Indonesia. Correlational method (Pearson Product Moment) and regression method (stepwise, anova for land use's trip generation/attraction), and analysis of road's level of service (LOS), using Indonesian Road Capacity Manual, are employed in this research. The research formulated the interaction model as: V-total = Sigma V-internal + Sigma V-external Where Sigma V-internal = e(residential)Y(residential) + e(schools)Y(schools) + e(units)Y(units) + e(offices)Y(offices) + e(hospital)Y(hospital) + e(chemists)Y(chemists) + e(commercials)Y(commercials) + e(market)Y(market) + e(fuel station)Y(fuel station) + e(bus station)Y(bus station) and Sigma V-external = V-local roads + V-continuous traffic flow The research showed that V_total=23,033 car unit/day (internal) + 32,746 car unit/day (external) = 55,779 car unit/day. The trip higher than the road's capacity (C) which 40.695 car unit/day. The levels of services of road's segments dominantly F (congested). The simulation of the model showed that traffic engineering can be used to increase road's capacity while land use changes (reduction of the variety of mixed land uses), particularly mix land uses at frontage area, can improve level of services (from F to C).

J	Yang, XX; Bian, MJ; Chen, LJ; Gao, ZG				Yang, Xiaoxian; Bian, Minjie; Chen, Lujing; Gao, Zenggui			A numerical-analysis-based optimization method for location selection for planning residential areas in grid transportation networks	AUTOMATIKA			English	Article						Residential Area; shortest routes; quantitative evaluation; evaluation indices; analytic hierarchy process; location planning and optimization	WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS; TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT; URBAN; MODEL; CITIES	China's economy has been rapidly growing over the past few decades; however, increasingly more modern cities are facing problems caused by poor city planning, such as traffic networks, resource distribution and routine management. Optimization methods are urgently needed during city development. From location planning perspective, the residential area issue is discussed in this paper. Based on this issue, a numerical-analysis-based method is proposed for selecting proper residential areas in grid transportation networks. First, a grid layout is introduced to formalize a real traffic network. Furthermore, to guarantee its approximation, a considerable amount of data are obtained from real-world scenarios based on the shortest routes to demonstrate the problem of traffic jams. Then, a quantitative evaluation system is proposed, which quantitatively evaluates the specified location with the traffic flow distribution index, traffic congestion index and infrastructure convenience index. Each index reflects the attitude of citizens from a unique perspective, which affects the final location planning and selection. Finally, an analytic hierarchy process is designed to analyse all these indices together for a comprehensive analysis, and case studies and experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The generated residential location can be considered as a technical reference for further city planning and development decisions.y	[Yang, Xiaoxian] Shanghai Polytech Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Bian, Minjie] Shanghai Univ, Informat Off, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China; [Chen, Lujing] Shanghai Univ, Dept Math, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Gao, Zenggui] Shanghai Key Lab Intelligent Mfg & Robot, Shanghai, Peoples R China	Bian, MJ (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ, Informat Off, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China.	bianmj0302@aliyun.com			Youth Foundation of Shanghai Polytechnic University [EGD18XQD01]; CERNET Innovation Project [NGII20160210, NGII20160614, NGII20160325, NGII2017 0513]; IIOT Innovation and Development Special Foundation of Shanghai [2017-GYHLW-01037]	This paper is supported by the Youth Foundation of Shanghai Polytechnic University under Grant No. EGD18XQD01; the CERNET Innovation Project under Grant No. NGII20160210, No. NGII20160614, No. NGII20160325 and No. NGII2017 0513; and the IIOT Innovation and Development Special Foundation of Shanghai under Grant No. 2017-GYHLW-01037.

For this reason, an improved LSTM Network is proposed. Firstly, the concept and calculation method of time singularity ratio of traffic data stream is proposed to predict long-term traffic flow. The singular point probability LSTM (SPP-LSTM) is presented. Namely, the algorithm discard the LSTM network unit form the network temporarily according to the singular point probability during the training process of the depth learning network, so as to get SPP-LSTM model. Finally, the paper amends the SPP-LSTM by ARIMA to realize the accurate prediction of 24-hour traffic flow data. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the SPP-LSTM has a high accuracy rate, stability and wide application prospect in the long-time traffic flow forecast with hourly period.

According to Statistics of The Number of Road Motor Vehicles published by Turkish Statistical Institute, the number of vehicles registered increased by 72% during the period of last 10 years in Turkey. In the same period, the increase in the number of vehicles registered was 103% in Trabzon, the city in Turkey. This increase causes serious traffic congestion in the city center of Trabzon located in a restricted geographical area, and has a road problem. It is quite costly to assess solutions in the city where construction activities are making life difficult while applying various methods to solve the traffic intensity. Simulation models should be considered in such situations due to their non-cost. In this study, the traffic of the Macka intersection located at one of the most central and active points of the city was analyzed. The data collected from intersection was modeled by Arena Simulation software according to traffic flow. Various scenarios were produced according to traffic light periods, and trials were carried out to improve current traffic flow by evaluating the outputs obtained by modeling of these scenarios. Two different time periods that have heavy traffic, morning and evening, were examined. The scenario in which the best outputs were obtained was presented as a solution. According to results of this scenario, a 13% improvement in average waiting time can be achieved.

We propose that our novel method, VDZ with CCTV snap shots, when combined as a system, can replace the traditional system using inductive loop detector sensor. The latter is in disadvantage because inductive loop detectors need to be physically embedded in to a highway-surface. Our previous works have shown that our system can provide the empirical data to construct Fundamental Diagrams and to calibrate a chosen model of the target highway, by using only seven VDZ agents which have carried GPS enabled smartphones, together with snapshots from fifteen existing CCTV, on Tangerang to Jakarta highway (21 km distance) over a period of three months. Our system is better than the traditional system, because it: can show zero speeds at totally jammed density, uses only one GPS coordinate to form a speed aware zone, costs less to build and is more practical to implement, especially for developing countries like Indonesia. By adopting and modifying Cell Transmission Model or CTM, a variant Macro model, our system can give short term predictions for travel time, and travel distance. Graphical and tabular comparisons are presented to highlight the worsening or improvement effects on traffic conditions when certain highway topology parameters have been changed for our target road. For example, simulated on our already calibrated model on our target highway, an addition of 3 off ramps at km 13, 15 and 17, would cause a reduction of vehicle travel time by up to 17.6% between minutes 75 to 230, which also mean a reduction of traffic jam. These results show that this system is potentially beneficial not only for commuters, but also for highway designers and government road authority.

This information may be received from other vehicles (Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication - V2V) or the infrastructure (Infrastructure-to-Vehicle communication - I2V). Since infrastructure-side equipment (Road Side Units - RSUs) are costly and not extensively deployed on the road network yet, localized approaches can contribute to sustain relevant and useful information exchange between vehicles. In this paper, we propose and simulate a local traffic regulation protocol that aims to reduce traffic congestion especially in areas which are not covered by RSUs. Our approach is based on V2V communication only: connected vehicles exchange data collected from their sensing devices e.g. speed and position. The purpose of this protocol is to allow vehicles to participate in the election of a Local Leader, by choosing one vehicle among their neighborhood. The choice of a Local Leader will be based on predefined rules in order to guarantee a smoother traffic. The Local Leader will make his decisions, i.e. speed recommendation after a negotiation phase with all surrounding vehicles within a configurable diameter. Thus, the proposed approach will establish a traffic regulation scheme that is not dependent on the network infrastructure. Microscopic simulations results, applied to a traffic flow composed of connected and non-connected vehicles show the benefits of such an approach.

Predicting the traffic flow in highways especially, is demanded to solve this congestion problem. Predictions on time-series multivariate data, such as in the traffic flow dataset, have been largely accomplished through various approaches. The approach with conventional prediction algorithms, such as with Support Vector Machine (SVM), is only capable of accommodating predictions that are independent in each time unit. Hence, the sequential relationships in this time series data is hardly explored. Continuous Conditional Random Field (CCRF) is one of Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) algorithms which can accommodate this problem. The neighboring aspects of sequential data such as in the time series data can be expressed by CCRF so that its predictions are more reliable. In this article, CCRF is implemented to increase the prediction ability of different baseline regressors, i.e. SVM and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Both algorithms are examined in two different datasets. The result shows that CCRF is superior in performance when examined using high-dimensional dataset. This is validated by the increasing of the coefficient of correlation of the baseline up to 7.3% of significance.	[Purbarani, Sumarsih Condroayu; Sanabila, H.

In recent years, many methods based on deep learning have been used in the prediction of short-term traffic flows, LSTM is also used in short-term traffic flow forecasts because of its powerful ability to process timing data. As the traffic flow data has different short-term characteristics and periodic characteristics, different characteristics may interact with each other. In this paper, we propose a parallel long and short memory neural network model, which is used to obtain the short-time characteristics and periodic characteristics of traffic flow, the experimental results on the real data set show that the model can achieve better prediction results; Finally, in order to evaluate the performance of our model, we compared the prediction effect between the model and the other different models, and explore the reason of proposing parallel network.

The traditional short-term traffic flow forecasting methods have the disadvantages of lower prediction accuracy, harder parameter determination and poorer adaptability Aiming at above problems, we proposed a short term traffic flow forecasting algorithm based on the wavelet function and the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to optimize the short-term traffic flow forecasting method. Firstly, the activation function of hidden layer neurons in the prediction model of the ELM is optimized according to the denoising principle of the wavelet function. Secondly, the short-term traffic volume prediction model of the ELM is established, and the traffic volume during the evening peak hours of the Canadian Whitemud Drive highway is forecasted. Finally, the results of this paper are compared with ones that predicted by BP neural network model Compared the R-2 value of 0.7 in this method with the one of 0.5331 in BP neural network, the results show that the proposed method in this paper has better generalization ability and more proper stability than BP neural network has. The prediction results are in good agreement with the desired short term traffic volume, and the short-term traffic flow can be predicted more efficiently.

Geographic information is stored in a graph database and AGADE-TRAFFIC communicates with that database through a NetLogo extension. Routing capabilities of the database are used while respecting the current traffic situation that is continuously reflected into the database. Different models of congestion effects are available and can be investigated in flexible traffic assignment models. Real world networks can be imported from Open Street Map.

To address this need, we propose an algorithm for real-time automatic congestion identification that uses speed probe data and the corresponding weather and visibility to build a unified model. Based on traffic flow theory, the algorithm assumes three traffic states: congestion, speed-at-capacity, and free-flow. Our algorithm assumes that speed is drawn from a mixture of three components, whose means are functions of weather and visibility and defined using a linear regression of their predictors. The parameters of the model were estimated using three empirical datasets from Virginia, California, and Texas. The fitted model was used to calculate the speed cut-off between congestion and speed-at-capacity by minimizing either the Bayesian classification error or the false positive (congestion) rate. The test results showed promising congestion identification performance.

Most of the previous approaches rely on static or dynamic OD matrices. The proposed data-driven approach tackles the problem of link flow estimation as a local network propagation problem between cross-section measurement sites. Distinct propagation rules consider time-dependent travel speeds, turning fractions at intersections and vehicle gain-loss ratios between links. The rules are derived from recorded vehicle paths originating from a probe vehicle data (PVD) system including data from thousands of vehicles from several different fleets. The proposed approach introduces a algorithm with dedicated propagation rules and measures for evaluating propagation quality. Our approach is evaluated using Austria's nation-wide road network (including freeways, urban and rural roads) with approximately 224,443 links and 16,566 intersections as well as traffic count data from 664 cross-section measurement sites.

Specifically the trade-off between safety and mobility performance is quantified for a VSL control algorithm designed to homogenize vehicle speeds within a freeway incident region. A microscopic driver model for VSL traffic previously developed by the authors is implemented in VISSIM's API module and simulation is controlled via a MATLAB COM interface. Results indicate an inverse relationship between safety and mobility performance, forcing jurisdictions designing VSL systems to either conduct multi-objective optimization or set a dominant policy objective (safety versus mobility). Control algorithm parameters that invoke VSL adjustment more frequently produce greater safety benefits but also greater mobility impairments. Freeway volume had no significant effect on VSL performance in this study.

Among these events, not only the initiation of calls and data sessions can be used in analyses, but also handovers between different locations that reflect mobility. In this work, we investigate if handovers can be used as a proxy metric for flows in the underlying road network, especially in urban environments. More precisely, we show that characteristic profiles of handovers within and between clusters of mobile network cells exist. We base these profiles on models from road traffic flow theory, and show that they can be used for traffic state estimation using floating-car data as ground truth. The presented model can be beneficial in areas with good mobile network coverage but low road traffic counting infrastructure, e.g. in developing countries, but also serve as an additional predictor for existing traffic state monitoring systems.

Moreover, the accuracy of the probe vehicle data is expected to be sub-meter level or even more precise for the lane-level traffic analysis. However, the performance of GNSS positioning technique is severely degraded in urban canyons, because the multipath effect and Non-Line-Of-Sight propagation. We proposed to rectify the positioning result of the commercial GNSS single frequency receiver using the three-dimensional building map, which is named 3D-GNSS. This paper proposes to employ the 3D-GNSS positioning method for the acquisition of the precise probe vehicle data. With the benefit of the proposed method, the global lane-level position, speed and stop state of vehicles are expected to be recognized from the 3D-GNSS based probe data. Finally, the accuracy of the 3D-GNSS based probe technology is evaluated in one of the most challenging urban city, Tokyo. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve 87% correct lane rate in the localization, and has sub-meter accuracy with respect to position and speed error mean. The accurate position and speed estimation provided by 3D-GNSS, result 92% correct rate in detecting stop vehicles.

Firstly, the urban freeway network is modeled in the way of distributed systems by combining the cell transmission model (CTM) with the dynamic graph hybrid automata (DGHA), and a Piece Affine Linear System (PWALS) is deduced. Furthermore, based on the PWALS model, a switched and distributed state observer is designed to estimate traffic densities of the freeway network, where a set of gain matrices for the observer are computed by using LMI technique with the help of the S-procedure theory. Finally, the PWALS model and the corresponding distributed observer are utilized to Beijing second ring freeway, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach.

The proposed scheme consists of a nominal feedback law in conjunction with a nonlinear observer which aims to estimate some unknown system variables. A distinguishing novelty of the proposed approach is that it can inherently be applied both at local and coordinated levels. The control scheme is tested for realistic traffic scenarios using a macroscopic traffic flow simulator as a surrogate for potential field application.

Probe vehicle data are one of the most widely used passive datasets that can potentially observe wide ranges in the network, as they do not require fixed sensors. Such datasets potentially observe various phenomena which are caused by various reasons. However, it is not easy to detect significant incidents from such phenomenon due to the multi-dimensional form of the dataset and the large size required to scan the entire dataset. Incident detection is one of the significant approaches for monitoring of traffic flow and data cleansing to acquire "typical traffic situation" for analysis of measures and calibrations of models. Several previous studies have attempted to determine the local changes in the traffic flow. However, a few studies investigated a method to explore the significant incidents influencing wide-ranges of the spatio-temporal dimension which are possibly caused by the changes on either or both the service and demand side. This study proposes a data mining method to detect unusual situations in large-scale road network from a large volume of probe vehicle dataset. The method employs a nonparametric probabilistic function and the Markov random field to consider the spatio-temporal correlations in the probe vehicle dataset. The method is applied to an actual dataset provided by 40000 commercial vehicles all over Japan.

Based on data collected by loop detectors, typical segments with two, three and four lanes in one direction are selected from the South-North Expressway in Shanghai. Rain intensity is classified into light, moderate, heavy and torrential in this study. Firstly, an exponential speed-density model is used to describe the relationship of speed and density under both clear weather and rainfall. Based on the results of model fitting, the effects of rainfall on free flow speed and operating speed are studied. Results show that free flow speed decreases most on segments with two lanes, with 0.3-5%, 5.1-7.4%, 4.6-8.2% and 9.8-13.3% reductions under light, moderate, heavy and torrential rain, respectively. This suggests that drivers' sight and judgement are easy to be affected on segments with only two lanes. In addition, a reduction factor is introduced to study the influence of rainfall on operating speed, and traffic flow is divided into congested and uncongested flow with the optimum density. The reduction of operating speed under congested conditions is larger than that under uncongested conditions, especially for segments with three and four lanes. So it is essential to make sure the traffic operation of segments with more than two lanes in each direction of urban expressways on rainy days.

The proposed control scheme includes a supervisor, acting at a higher level, which receives measurements from the network and periodically makes a prediction on the system evolution. At the lower level, local feedback controllers compute the control action on the basis of measurements in a neighbourhood of the on-ramp. The neighbourhood is communicated by the supervisor in real time, according to an event-triggered logic. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is assessed through simulation results, properly discussed in the paper.

Traffic congestion forecasts estimate an increase of about 60% in 2030. At present, poor choice of signal timings by isolated intersection controllers cause traffic delays that have enormous negative impacts on the economy and environment. Signal timings can be improved by using vehicles' GPS information to overcome the control action deficit at isolated intersections. This new signal control algorithm is beneficial for traffic engineers and governmental agencies, as traffic flow can be optimised and, hence, fuel consumption and emissions decreased. Under the open European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM) framework, a traffic responsive GPS based vehicle actuation algorithm (GPS-VA) is proposed. GPS-VA uses position and heading data from vehicle status broadcasts, and inferred velocity information to determine vehicle queue lengths and detect vehicles passing through the intersection. The gathered information is then used to actuate intersection signal timings. Microscopic simulations comparing GPS-VA to fixed-time control and inductive loop based vehicle actuation (Loop-VA) on four urban road networks were performed to see how the proposed GPS-VA algorithm performs compared to existing control strategies. The results show that GPS-VA is an effective alternative to traditional intersection control strategies, offering delay reductions of up to 50% for connected vehicle fleet penetrations above 30%.

In this framework, we use optimal control to simulate the behavior of CAVs and the Gipps car following model to capture the behavior of human-driven vehicles. The simulation results show that CAVs can contribute to significant fuel consumption and travel time reduction for diverse traffic conditions under average and high congestion scenarios. Furthermore, we show that CAVs allow for more stable traffic patterns even for high density traffic.

Traffic State Estimation Method with Efficient Data Fusion Based on the Aw-Rascle-Zhang Model	2017 IEEE 20TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITSC)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	20th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	OCT 16-19, 2017	Yokohama, JAPAN	IEEE			2ND-ORDER MODELS; FLOW; HIGHWAY; DENSITY; WAVES	Higher-order traffic flow models describe the dynamics of non-equilibrium traffic (e.g., capacity drop, traffic oscillation). Therefore, a traffic state estimation (TSE) method based on higher-order models could have notable advantages over conventional method based on an equilibrium (first-order) model. First, they can encompass non-equilibrium traffic phenomena inherent to the nonlinearity of traffic flow. Second, they can directly fuse heterogeneous traffic data, such as flow measured by detectors and speed measured by probe vehicles. These features would be useful for large volumes of data. This article proposes a data-assimilation-based TSE method for capturing non-equilibrium traffic dynamics based on the Aw-Rascle-Zhang model, which is known as a physically-consistent higher-order model but not received as much attention as other models. The proposed method can efficiently and simply fuse heterogeneous data. Additionally, it is computationally efficient because it uses the extended Kalman filter with an analytical derivative. The features of the proposed method were investigated empirically and quantitatively using experimental dataset collected from actual traffic. We investigate the empirical relationship between the accuracy and amount of available data, and compare the proposed method with a conventional TSE method.

Their precise effects are understudied. The primary aim of this article is to present a model for lane changing that is tractable for system-level analysis and yet captures qualities of microscopic vehicle dynamics. We present a stochastic lane changing model, which permits a two-stage reduction: 1) of the (microscopic) multi-lane problem into a stochastic single-lane problem, and 2) of the stochastic single-lane model into a Markov chain macroscopic model which captures system-level lane-changing characteristics. The first reduction contributes the first model of lane changing as a single-lane process, which permits the simplification of theoretical analysis. The Markov chain macroscopic model permits the computation of statistics on the traffic parameters, such as expected velocity and headway, thus permitting the quantification of the effect of lane changes on traffic flow. We validate the proposed model on NGSIM and confirm the accuracy of the Markov chain for computing headway statistics. Finally, counter to a common view of lane changes as perturbations which contribute to shockwave formation, we observe that lane changes reduce the variance of the velocity by 10% on a 230-meter ring road benchmark, which suggests that discretionary lane changes may serve to reduce stop and go waves rather than increase them.

Many existing approaches for the lightless intersection control depend on near 100% market penetration of the autonomous vehicles, which could be the bottleneck for the real world implementations in the near future. Our proposal is based on a set of algorithms modelling a simple form of vehicle-to-vehicle interaction, that only requires a majority of vehicles on the road to be minimally guided by the adaptive cruise control. For vehicles approaching the intersection from different directions, their dynamics are regulated by interactions that institute pre-emptive deceleration, to ensure smooth passage across the intersection. We also discuss the conceptual relationship between the traffic flow stability and the efficiency of the lightless intersection control, as well as some aspects of the traffic policies complementing our control algorithm to minimise the impact on the conventional driving behaviours.

With the rapid development of the big data, Smart card data of bus which is provided by millions of passengers traveling by bus across several days plays a more and more important role in our daily life. The issue that we address is whether the data mining algorithm and the intelligent optimization algorithm can be applied to forecast the traffic flow from big data of bus. In this paper, a novel algorithm which called mixed support vector regression with sub-space orthogonal pigeon-Inspired Optimization (SOPIO-MSVR) is used to predict the traffic flow and optimize the algorithm progress. Results show the SOPIO-MSVR algorithm outperforms other algorithms by a margin and is a competitive algorithm.

Apparently, considering such behaviors in the scope of microscopic traffic simulations is inevitable in order to accomplish simulations close to reality. In recent years, considerable efforts have been put into modeling longitudinal and lateral movements of vehicles or their lane-change behavior, respectively. However, sometimes it is necessary to deviate from the standard behavior prescribed by these models in order to study the effects of exceptional situations in road traffic such as sudden braking maneuvers. This paper addresses this specific use case by introducing a generic behavior injection model, allowing for the integration of predefined driver behaviors into microscopic traffic simulations. Furthermore, it enables the reconstruction of real traffic scenarios by incorporating data gathered from vehicular measurement campaigns. The result is a simple, yet flexible model applicable to a wide range of microscopic traffic simulators.

It is important to optimize it to reached the best balance between the waiting time and safety perfounance. Based on this, the simulation experiments based on traffic flow cellular automata is established, which are suitable for two cases of car-following and lane-changing. The optimization design problem could be simplified as how to design the toll plaza to minimize the waiting time of vehicles in the front of the toll station associated with the lowest possibility of accidents near the toll station, considering what exert the greatest impact on the toll station performance are service time and safety. The L-B relationships which meet the minimum waiting time and the best merging mode which meet the minimum collision probability are found through the simplified ideas and simulation experiments above. Further, the formula for calculating the length of the fan-in area is obtained. Finally, perfounance analysis are put forward regarding throughput capacity, cost and accident prevention.

In this paper, the impact on the problem of the opening and the passage of the road is studied. By establishing the maximum flow model of traffic network and the model of the "flow - density" models to explore the influence of community opening on the surrounding road traffic, it is found that the open area can improve the traffic situation of the surrounding area to a certain extent. In addition, using the maximum flow model of the traffic network and the "traffic flow-speed" bubbles model to analyze the open impact on different types of community, it is possible to selectively open the community. Finally, the relevant optimization recommendations are presented.

Analysis of traffic systems through modeling and simulation is an essential tool for city planners to optimize traffic flow. Microscopic discrete-event simulation is a natural and powerful method for such analysis. Characteristics of traffic systems that need to be modeled include inter-arrival times, car-following behavior, lane-changing, turning, road structure, intersection structure, and traffic light timing. There are many challenges that must be confronted as well, including the calibration and validation of traffic models, scaling models to larger traffic systems, modeling the continuous nature of traffic in a discrete-event environment, and optimization of traffic system characteristics. An emerging challenge for traffic simulation is the incorporation of autonomous vehicles into traffic systems as not only traditional vehicles, but also as cooperative agents as well.

To reduce traffic congestion, vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication have been explored and implemented. This paper focuses on integrating features of gap acceptance behavior proposed in V2V and road segment occupancy & intelligent traffic light phasing of V2I. Three separate simulation models have been presented in this study. A design of experiment generated thirty scenarios to capture the overall traffic flow performance in terms of total time and waiting time in the system, WIP and system efficiency. Results revealed that the proposed V2I simulation model in which routing was based on traffic light availability decreased the waiting time, total time and WIP significantly compared to baseline and smart traffic light vehicle flow model. The routing principle in the latter two models was based on space availability approach.

PTV Vissim, the worlds leading microscopic traffic simulation tool, provides a virtual testbed to evaluate the coexistence of autonomous and conventional vehicles either in the transition phase or when vehicle fleets are fully autonomous. Vissim traffic simulation is increasingly being employed to address the evidence gap around the potential impacts of disruptive technologies, such as connected autonomous vehicles, on traffic flow and capacity. Incorporating hardware in the loop testing allows detailed representation of autonomous vehicle control algorithms, sensor and communication protocols to be simulated within a realistic virtual traffic environment. Simulating varying penetration rates of autonomous vehicles, and different behavioral characteristics such as as platooning, vehicle to vehicle communication and vehicle to infrastructure communication, has demonstrated the opportunity to reduce travel times by 11% and delays by more than 40%.

Various applications supported by VANTEs include transport efficiency, safety, infotainment, etc. The IVC performance analysis is useful for the evaluation of vehicular network deployment. IVC mainly focuses on V2V, V2I communication network performance analysis. The VANET framework for V2V, V2I communication networks depends on stochastic network calculus. Then Poisson distribution models describe the stochastic arrival and stochastic service curves to derive end to end delay bound. On the basis of proposed traffic models of stochastic network calculus (SNC) and time domain modelling, the analysis is provided for stochastic arrival and stochastic service curves of guaranteed communication. In addition, the analytical model of traffic flow theory by using the queueing theory of end to end delay bounds are compared and verified by the queueing theory model results in an M/M/c model.

While only depending on the trajectory and speed data from probe vehicles cannot estimate the traffic states (vehicle densities etc.) in real-time with the classical filtering methods, such as particular filtering (PF) and extended Kalman filtering (EKF), because the boundary fluxes of the considered road network are not available in advance. In this paper, we firstly build the traffic flow dynamics of freeway traffic as the discrete-time state-space models including unknown input variables (boundary fluxes). Then a novel simultaneous state and input estimation technique is developed by using the decentralized heterogeneous data of vehicle speed as measurement. A freeway link of Interstate 80 East (I-80E) in Emeryville, Northern California, is chosen to investigate the performance of the developed filtering approach. Traffic data are obtained from the Performance Measurement System (PeMS) and the Mobile Century experiment.

In order to alleviate the traffic congestion and improve the travel efficiency, a feedback control strategy for an traffic zone based on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram is designed in this paper. According to the degree of intersections and other basis, the road network is divided into a number of traffic zones, and then extract MFD characteristics through conducting traffic surveys or simulation experiments and other means alike. By analyzing the relationship bebveen the total number of vehicles and average flow in the zone, the vehicle conservation equation is established. By setting the feedback controller at the boundary, feedback access control of the vehicle is carried out, and the number of vehicles in the zone is within the optimum range, so that the traffic volume of the zone is maximized. Taking several roads of Jinan as examples, the corresponding experiment simulation is carried out by using VISSIM simulation software. The experimental results show that the proposed feedback control strategy not only can effectively ensure the maximum traffic volume but also improve the road utilization and travel efficiency.

In this paper, a composite control method based on credit assignment cerebellar model articulation controller (CACMAC) and proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is applied to highway density control. Firstly, a macroscopic traffic model is established to describe the evolution process of highway traffic flow accurately. Secondly, the principle and algorithm of CACMAC-PID compound control are studied in detail. Thirdly, road density controllers based on CACMAC-PID compound control are designed by combining the highway traffic model and a nonlinear feedback technology. In fact, vehicular density monitoring in the motorway mainlines is an output tracking control. Finally, simulation experiments are conducted to prove the validity and superiority of this composite control. Compared to CMAC-PID control, CACMAC-PID control has decreased the time to reach the steady-state value and improved the tracking effect. CACMAC-PID compound controllers can remove highway traffic congestion and stabilize mainline traffic flow.

In order to play the ARIMA model with good linear fitting ability and artificial neural network model with strong nonlinear relation mapping ability, this study aimed to develop a simple and effective hybrid model for forecasting traffic volume that combines the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and the Radial Basis Function Artificial Neural Networks (RBF-ANN) models. By combining different models, different aspects of the underlying patterns of traffic flow could be captured. The ARIMA model was used to model the linear component of the traffic flow time series. Then the RBF-ANN model was applied to capture the nonlinear component by modelling the residuals from the ARIMA model. The hybrid models were fitted for five minutes time-aggregations. The validations of the proposed hybrid methodology were performed by using traffic data from Shinan Avenue in Nansha District, Guangzhou, China. The results indicated that the hybrid models had better predictive performance than utilizing only ARIMA model as well as RBF-ANN model. The combination method played the advantages of the two models is an effective method for short-term traffic flow forecasting.

By comparing the influence of vehicle cluster driving behavior with Vehicle Free Driving (VFD) behavior on average vehicle speed and Lane Changing (LC) frequency, the result shows us that the average vehicle speed of VCD behavior is higher than VFD behavior with the increasing of traffic flow, at the same time the change rate of average vehicle speed of VCD behavior is less than VFD behavior. The lane changing frequency presents a single peak distribution which is increasing first and then decreasing with the increasing of traffic flow both in VCD behavior and VFD behavior. The simulation result shows that the lane changing frequency of VCD behavior reached the peak value when the traffic flow near 1000veh/h and the lane changing frequency of VFD behavior reached the peak value when the traffic flow near 2200veh/h.

Especially, a car would encounter a great number of signalized and unsigned intersections in the regionalized road network. In this paper, we illustrate the control theory of the unsigned intersection and that in the CVIS. Based on it, the library of the traffic rule is developed for the MS. The regionalized and unsigned intersection control method is analyzed in the real-time information interaction mode. By using the Q-paramics and VS2013, we have constructed a regionalized and unsigned intersection control test platform based on the CVIS. And based on it, two simulations have been performed. The first simulation is used to compare the performance of the CVIS based regionalized and unsigned intersection control and the traditional unsigned intersection control for different traffic loads in the case where the road network is with different scales and relative equilibrium traffic flow distribution. The second simulation is designed to compare the performance of the CVIS based regionalized and unsigned intersection control and the traditional unsigned intersection for three different travel demands in the case where the road network is with a middle scale and two different disequilibrium traffic flow distribution.

Furthermore, we use a hybrid optimization approach to adjust the PID parameters. This hybrid approach in use is the combination of a genetic algorithm (GA) and an ant colony algorithm (ACA). First, a macroscopic and dynamic freeway traffic flow model called a finite-difference model is built. Second, the control objective of ramp metering is fully set forth. Third, a coordinated control system of multiple ramps based on a genetic ant colony algorithm is designed. This control system is divided into an adaptation layer, a coordination layer, and a direct control layer. In the direct control layer, we employ PID control to determine the ramp metering rates and use a hybrid algorithm of GA and ACA to optimize the PID parameters. Finally, simulation research and result comparison are carried out. Simulation results show that the method of multilayer decentralized control, as well as the hybrid optimization algorithm, has an excellent density tracking performance. This control technology, as well as the optimization process, finds a new way for freeway traffic control.

Accurate estimation of traffic retention can provide support for the dynamic allocation of the traffic signal, thus alleviating the problem of urban traffic congestion. The traditional method can only estimate the long-term or red light traffic retention according to the variation law of the vehicle, and can not realize the short-term real-time estimation. In order to realize the real-time estimation of traffic retention, combined with traffic flow data, this paper presents the real-time estimation method based on M/G/n/0 queuing model. First, M/G/n/0 queuing model was established by analyzing the practical situation of road and traffic data, and this model was computed. Second, the simulation scheme of the road system was designed by VISSIM software, and used the COM interface of the software to realize real-time input of traffic data during simulation process. Finally, the proposed estimation method is verified. Simulation results showed that the M/G/n/0 queuing model can effectively and quantitatively describe the real-time state of the road, convenient for engineering practice, and it can provide theoretical basis for the urban traffic induction and control.

It is important to select reasonable location for intelligent road light in the construction of smart city and Internet of things. In this model, many influence factors such as the rate of road traffic incidents, road traffic flow, the rate of valid information, the rate of access to information and information redundancy are considered. The main contribution of our proposed model is not only to determine the location, but also to determine the display area of LED traffic-induced screen according to real-world traffic data by a heuristic method. The main steps of our proposed approach are to convert road network into directed graph and to quantify the information utility of LED traffic induced screen. At the end, a location scheme is simulated by VISSIM, and the average travel time is used as the evaluation index.

The goal of this project is to develop an efficient system that can meet dynamic content based video analysis needs and scale to large scale traffic camera video data. The proposed system utilizes deep learning methods to recognize objects in the video data. That information can then be processed and analyzed through an analysis layer implemented using Spark and Hive. The analysis layer supports HiveQL, which enables end users to conduct sophisticated analysis with customized queries. In this paper, we present the implementation of this prototype application in details. The application can utilize both GPU and multiple CPUs to accelerate its computation. We evaluated its performance and scalability with different hardware and parameter settings, including Intel Knights Landing, Intel Skylake, Nvidia K40 GPU, and Nvidia P100 GPU, for object recognition. To demonstrate its versatile, we show two practical use case examples: counting moving vehicles and identifying scenes including pedestrians and vehicles. We show the accuracy of the system by comparing vehicular counts produced by the analysis with manually annotated results. The comparison shows our methods can achieve over eighty percent accuracy comparing to manual results.

Characterizing the diffusion process is of great importance both in congestion relief and traffic condition prediction. Traffic congestion diffusion (TCD) in road networks can be observed, but literature lacks accurate models for characterizing the process. In this paper, we define a concept of Traffic Flow Influence (TFI) as a base for congestion diffusion. A TCD model is designed to characterize not only the traffic flow evolving process in time domain but also the propagation process of TFI through road networks in space domain. The model is for traffic networks in a city, which is divided into grids and each grid is modeled by traffic status of congested or smooth. Different from other diffusion models, the grid status depends on not only its current condition, but also the relative traffic flow from and to its neighbors. We use a gradient descent approach to quantify the traffic flow and TFI intensity of road networks. To the best of our knowledge, this should be the first model for a metro-city scale. The TCD model with TFI is able to predict grid status with an accuracy as high as 89%. Experimental results based on real-world taxi trajectory data in a metro-city show that the TCD approach performs best in comparison with its competitors.

Techniques for Efficient Detection of Rapid Weather Changes and Analysis of their Impacts on a Highway Network	2017 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BIG DATA (BIG DATA)	IEEE International Conference on Big Data		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE Big Data)	DEC 11-14, 2017	Boston, MA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, ELSEVIER, CISCO			MODELS	Adverse weather conditions have a significant impact on the safety, mobility, and efficiency of highway networks. Annually, 24 percent of all crashes, more than 7,400 roadway fatalities, and over 673,000 crash related injuries were caused by adverse weather conditions between 1995 and 2005 [1]. In addition, weather contributed to 23 percent of all non-reoccurring delay and approximately 544 million vehicle hours of delay each year [2]. Nearly 2.3 billion dollars each year are spent by transportation agencies for winter maintenance that contribute to close to 20 percent of most DOTs yearly budgets [2]. These safety and mobility factors make it important to develop new and more effective methods to address road conditions during adverse weather conditions. This paper develops techniques for efficiently detecting rapid weather change events and analyzing their impacts on the traffic flow characteristics of a highway network. It is composed of three components, including 1) detection of rapid weather change events in a highway network using the streaming weather information from a sensor network of weather stations; 2) detection of rapid traffic change events on the traffic flow characteristics (e.g., travel time) of the highway network; and 3) analysis of correlations between the detected weather and traffic change events in space and time. The proposed approach was applied to a weather dataset provided by New York State Mesonet and a traffic flow dataset the National Performance Management Research Data Set (NPMRDS) provided by NYSDOT. The empirical results provide potential evidence about the significant impacts of rapid weather change events on traffic flow characteristics of the Interstate 90 (I-90) Highway in the state of New York. The limitations of the proposed approach and the empirical study are also discussed.

Time-series models based on historical data can hardly reflect non-recurrent events and the impact of multiple factors. This paper proposes Internet search engine data and environmental data as supplemental data sources for capturing the latest changes in multiple factors of transportation. The time series model and extreme learning machine are built for San Francisco traffic flow prediction based on real heterogeneous data sources. First, the time series model based on historical traffic data is used as a benchmark to predict traffic flow. Then, we integrate heterogeneous data with the time series model and extreme learning machine for comparison. We find that the ELM with heterogeneous data improves on the linear model in both level and directional accuracy. These results emphasize that the heterogeneous data is more informative than the original traffic data used by other researchers and demonstrate the utility of the nonlinear approach for addressing this data selection problem in the context of prediction using search trend data, leading to an improvement in traffic flow prediction accuracy.

In our work, we fuse incident records with traffic speed data from the expressways of Singapore for computing the queue length. Moreover, we propose a hybrid classification-regression model to predict the queue length of the incidents in real-time. At first, the model acts as a binary classifier. If the queue length of an incident is predicted to be higher than a predetermined threshold value, then the congestion is assumed to be impactful. Therefore, in the second step, the model performs regression analysis to predict the queue length of these incidents for fine-tuning. We also analyze the performance of different classification and regression methods in our work. In the classification step, all the methods perform almost equally well, and we can achieve 80% - 96% classification accuracy for different threshold values. However, in the regression step, Neural Network outperforms other methods. For the threshold value alpha = 250 m, the mean absolute percentage error is 65.78%, whereas for alpha = 1000 m the error value is 18.76%. Furthermore, we cluster the incidents to understand the underlying pattern of the external features and build separate regression models for each cluster of incidents.

Previous research mostly focuses on how to use historical data of camera-equipped intersections to infer their future traffic statuses. However, as far as we know, there does not exist an effective algorithm to infer the real-time traffic statuses of those camera-free intersections by using the traffic information from some other road video cameras in urban road system. In this paper, we first study the spatial-temporal variation characteristics of urban traffic flows from a macroscopic view, including turning ratio models and traveling time models of individual road segments. And then we build a novel traffic impact tree model to calculate the real-time traffic volume for specific camera-free intersections. We evaluate our solutions on real-world taxicab and road surveillance system data-set. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms alternative solutions in terms of the accuracy of the reckoned future traffic flow.

AVs may evolve more like a service than a product. To provide best user experience of such service, three primary factors including waiting time, travel time, and supply of AVs are taken into consideration for multi-objective optimization facilitated in three steps. With the queueing network model and traffic flow analysis, optimal operation of service could be achieved with minimum average travel time. The optimal number of available AVs could be identified while guaranteeing the waiting time of customers. To manage the supply and demand of the service in each geographical area, bipartite graph matching is adopted to accomplish optimal resource allocation. It is further shown that the optimization of operation of autonomous vehicle fleet can be successfully achieved, to outperform what human-driving vehicles can possibly do. A new intelligent transportation paradigm of great energy saving emerges.

In this paper, a 3-Level Buffer (TLB) based Virtual Traffic Light (VTL) scheme, named TLB-VTL, is proposed for intelligent collaborative intersections. The intersection is divided into three adaptive areas according to the traffic flow of each lane, and the sequence of each timing cycle is calculated in realtime according to the flow in TLB around an intersection. To ensure fairness, the difference in probability of each lane to pass an intersection is restricted to a lower level. The VTL is realized based on communications of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-roadside (V2R), and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), which could improve the safety and fairness without involving traffic lights. Moreover, a Cooperative Collision Avoidance Predictive control (CCAP) algorithm is proposed, which can assist vehicles to go across the next intersection without stopping through predicting the time conflict and generating an efficient traffic schedule for the entire road network. The simulation results indicate that the proposed TLB-VTL algorithm improves the fairness by 331%, decreases the average delay by 88%, and improves the ability to solve congestion by 12% compared with the traditional traffic light algorithm. Besides, the CCAP algorithm increases the traffic fluency by 45% at the intersection.

Truck platooning is a promising technology that allows heavy vehicles to save fuel by driving with small automatically controlled inter vehicle distances. In order to leverage the full potential of platooning, platoons can be formed dynamically en route by small adjustments to their speeds. However, in heavily used parts of the road network, travel times are subject to random disturbances originating from traffic, weather and other sources. We formulate this problem as a stochastic dynamic programming problem over a finite horizon, for which solutions can be computed using a backwards recursion. By exploiting the characteristics of the problem, we derive bounds on the set of states that have to be explored at every stage, which in turn reduces the complexity of computing the solution. Simulations suggest that the approach is applicable to realistic problem instances. (C) 2017, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recently, coordinated distributed perimeter control of interconnected urban road regions has been developed in Haddad and Mirkin (2015). A Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD)-based model was utilized to describe the aggregate traffic flow dynamics, and model reference adaptive control was implemented to control the distributed perimeter controllers. Previous works, including Haddad and Mirkin (2015), implicitly postulated that during the control process, all needed information for computing are obtained in real time and processed instantly. However, collecting, processing, and uploading traffic data in a large-scale urban road networks impose time delays. Towards developing realistic aggregate models and improving perimeter control algorithms, the current paper aims at addressing the existence of such time delays. Hence, delayed state interconnections are incorporated in the dynamic equations to model data processing and communication delays between surrounding interconnected regions. Based on developed model, distributed perimeter control scheme in presence of time delays in interconnections is implemented.

Our recent results showed that variable speed limit control alone cannot eliminate capacity drops in many incident cases, where one or more lanes are closed due to microscopic phenomena such as forced lane changes and merging dynamics. In this paper, we developed a coordinated variable speed limit, ramp metering and lane change control which guarantees stability of the traffic flow and improves traffic mobility, safety and the environment. In the proposed control strategy, while the lane change control avoids the capacity drop, a feedback linearization variable speed limit controller coordinates with the ramp metering and stabilizes the bottleneck flow at the maximum level. Microscopic Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate significant improvement on traffic mobility, safety and environment by using the proposed controller.

The stability criterion of the DSM car-following model is obtained by the linear system stability theory. Numerical simulations are in good agreement with the analytical results, which reveals that the response time would significantly influence the stability of traffic flow on a straight road. The numerical results also indicate that intelligent driving can help to reduce traffic congestion because the unstable flow can be stabilized by adopting the response time.

The proposed charging station planning framework considers the impact of the operation strategies of the electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) on both the power distribution system and transportation system. In the proposed framework, the pricing strategies of the EVCSs can affect the traffic flow by attracting electric vehicles (EVs) to charge and consequently change the load demand pattern in the power distribution network. On the contrary, the electricity market can affect the traffic flow though affecting the pricing strategies of the EVCSs. Thus, the two systems are able to be connected through the optimal placement of EVCSs. The lower operational level of the proposed approach considers the competitions among the EVCSs in a competitive charging market environment through a non-cooperative game. The upper planning level optimize the placement of EVCSs based the operation results in the lower level with cross-entropy optimization. According to the simulation results, the proposed bi-level planning approach benefits the two systems by reducing the peak load and improving the traffic conditions effectively.

Aiming at the limits of the current research on routing protocols for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks, a novel routing protocol is presented in this paper, which considered the influence caused by both vehicle density and traffic lights on road sections network connectivity. The protocol uses the unicast packets to gather the traffic flow information then selects the next forwarding section according to the macroscopic greedy selection strategy. The simulation result shows that the routing protocol can improve the effective data transfer rate under the influence of traffic lights in the premise of the same end-to-end time delay.

Along with reducing the travel time, freeway traffic control strategies are also considered as key players in improving the traffic safety and decreasing the vehicle emissions. Traffic simulation tools overtook the real world implementations, for testing traffic control strategies, with less time consumption, and economical and more flexible traffic analysis environment. This paper presents a micro simulation based case-study on Istanbul freeways, where it discusses: the microscopic model calibration, the impact of ramp metering strategy Asservissement Lineaire&Entree Autoroutiere (ALINEA) on the traffic characteristics and traffic oscillations, and the impact of driver's behavior at merges on ALINEA's performance.

This paper proposes a two stage stochastic joint planning model of PEV fast-charging stations and distributed photovoltaic (PV) generation on coupled transportation and power networks, considering stochastic characteristics of base load, traffic flow and PV power. We use origin-destination (OD) traffic flow to estimate PEV charging demands and propose a second order cone programming (SOCP) model for PV power generation with reactive power control. A modified capacitated flow refueling location model (CFRLM) is used to describe the transportation network and explicitly capture time-varying PEV charging demands under driving range constraints. AC power flow with SOCP relaxation is adopted to incorporate power network constraints. The joint planning model is a mixed-integer SOCP model and can be solved by an off-the-shelf solver.

The infancy stage of infrastructure is one of the major challenge facing the development of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFVs). To address this challenge, this paper presents and evaluates optimal planning of hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) considering the interactions between the transportation and the power networks. We first develop models of 1) HFV traffic flows on a highway network with driving range constraints, 2) operations of on-site hydrogen production and storage. Then, we formulates a mixed-integer second order cone program (MISOCP) to determine 1) the sites and the sizes of HRSs, 2) hourly HRS operations and 3) grid reinforcement. The AC power flow with SOCP relaxation is incorporated to consider electrical constraints. Numerical case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Volvo Car Group has planned to start the world's first large-scale test of autonomous vehicles in a project called Drive Me, in which customers use autonomous vehicles on the streets around Gothenburg in 2017. In this paper, measured data from semi-autonomous vehicles equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC) on the Drive Me route are used to analyze the vehicle's driving behavior. The data, including signals from vehicles' on-board diagnostics and GPS locations, are analyzed to estimate the effect of ACC on the fuel consumption of vehicles. The results show that semiautonomous vehicles can reduce the mean fuel consumption up to 5.3% depending on driving situation and speed. Comparing acceleration profiles of human drivers with the ones from the ACC function it can be observed that the ACC function accelerates milder and less often. The results show that vehicles can improve fuel consumption even with a low level of automation.

With the idea of congestion effects, we can derive a stationary flow distribution solution analytically under any given network structure which is solved by a numeric iterative approach approximately. Based on that, simulations are made to compare the cumulative the difference of load distribution under shortest path law and our LOGIT law. Meanwhile, four different classes of networks are tested to uncover the relationship between traffic flow and topological structures under LOGIT law. The results indicated that random network and scale-free network outperform than the others two in the measurement of TSC.

In order to implement the control method on the large-scale urban freeway network, we apply the Dynamic Graph Hybrid Automata (DGHA) and Modified Cell Transmission Model (MCTM) to describe the evolution laws of traffic flow. Based on the DGHA macroscopic traffic model, we design a complete ramp metering system for the freeway network. The local ramp metering control strategy is proposed to reduce the freeway congestion, in addition, the queue constraint scheme is employed to prevent the queue from exceeding the ramp storage space. At last, this approach is applied to the Beijing third ring road by Modelica language on the OpenModelica. Experimental results validate the DGHA modeling method and demonstrate the effectiveness of the ramp metering strategy.

In this paper, we study the rapid transit strategy of the intelligent control system and the optimal planning problem under three different conditions. The macroscopic optimization method of road traffic network is designed under the intelligent control system. In the case of road traffic speed limit, the simulation of comfort index (LOS), traffic volume and safety index is carried out. The results show that compared with the traditional traffic control, the characteristics of intelligent traffic control can overcome the negative factors such as delay response time, asymmetry of human body and visual restriction. In addition, the intelligent network can perform the best general guidance.

The travel path node network model is established according to the starting position and the destination, and then the shortest time or shortest path planning initial program can be obtained. The optimal travel path is calculated quickly by ACO with the real time traffic flow statistics and positioning data of auxiliary vehicle global position system (GPS) in the driving process, which can provide the traffic reference to the driver. Meanwhile, the past path nodes remove from the travel path node network mode in time to reduce the computational complexity. The proposed method can realize the function of real time planning and forecasting of the travel path with low computation complexity by the deletion of the past nodes. Computer simulation results show that the proposed method has a significant effect on the application of urban and inter-city roads.

Firstly, the traffic flow sequence is decomposed into different frequency components by EMD. Then the crossover and mutation factors of the genetic algorithm are introduced into PSO to optimize the parameters of SVM, and the optimal SVM is obtained. Finally, the traffic flow components of different frequencies are input to the optimized SVM to realize the short time traffic flow prediction. A practical example is given based on the measured data of the road network in Changchun City.

ATCS (Area Traffic Control System) data in Bandung city with traffic volume are used in congestion detection process. Traffic flow data is collected by vehicles detector located at crossroads within 15 minutes. To compute spatial correlation, graph modelling are used in the adjacency matrix. Assuming the location of the detector as the vertices and the direction of the vehicle as the edge, the graph modeled with vehicle's detector location and the flow direction at nine locations on road nework. The adjacency matrix used consists of 3 matrices in each period of time, which describes the order of spatial distances traveled by vehicle at the intersection location. To calculate spatial correlation, the autocorrelation function and the cross-correlation function which are derived from Pearson's simple correlation is used to looking influence at each location on road network. The result of calculation of spatial correlation, shows the existence of seasonal pattern on the autocorrelation results even though the value scale is getting smaller as it increases time lags. This provides that the process of calculating cross-correlation functions and it can be concluded that the volume of vehicles at each location that are connected in the road network can be known by making observations in the time series of previous seasonal periods. The conclusion that can be formulated that graph modeling is needed to simplify the spatial correlation calculation process by performing the graph representation into a matrix. The Simpson rules on cross-correlation results, can be detected congestion at intersection locations on the road network to find the most critically locations causing congestion on the road network at time periods.

So limited road resource is often occupied during the road construction, which makes road capacity of construction affected area greatly decrease. Then the contradiction of city original transport supply becomes more prominent. Therefore, it is very important to make a reasonable traffic organization plan. At first According to the present traffic investigation and construction site management program, combining with the OD (Origin - Destination) distribution principle, the traffic impact of construction section is analyzed, the scope of influence is determined. The Taihangshan Road of Qingdao No. 1 subway line is taken as an example, three evaluation indicators, such as: average delays, queue length, number of vehicles between OD points are selected combined with current traffic flow. The available traffic guiding schemes include temporary widening of roads, traffic management measures and construction safety guarantee measures, and so on. Then VISSIM is used for the guidance measures simulation. Finally, According to the simulation results, quantitative guidance measures are evaluated. The choice of reasonable conduct measures is based on relevant data.

This paper presents a collaborative method for collision avoidance between autonomous vehicles at an unsignalized intersection. The collision conditions are expressed in terms of the vehicles' speed ratios. The problem is then formulated and solved as an optimization problem with the safety constraints represented by the speed ratios. The cost function is defined in terms of the deviation from the current speeds. Both pairwise and three vehicle formulations are discussed. The proposed formulation allows to easily scale the solution to higher number of vehicles. The method is highly effective in resolving conflicts and achieving smooth flow. The results are formally proven and illustrated using simulation.

The purpose of the coordination is to improve the energy efficiency of the vehicles, while the stability and the performance of the traffic system are guaranteed. The impact of the look-ahead cruise control on the traffic flow is analyzed. A new model concerning a polynomial form of the nonlinearity of the traffic flow is proposed, in which the look-ahead cruise control is constructed by a parameter-dependent model. Since the minimization of the energy demand of the traffic flow and the reduction of the queue length in the controlled lanes of the network lead to different solutions, a balance between these requirements must be achieved by an optimization procedure. In the optimal control of the traffic system the maximum Controlled Invariant Set based on the Sum-of-Squares (SOS) programming method is applied. The resulting set uses a selection of the intervention possibilities such as the input flow on the controlled gates and the optimization parameters of the look-ahead controlled vehicles. The high-fidelity VISSIM traffic simulator is applied to illustrate the results.

The development of an approach for estimating the traffic densities is motivated by the fact that traffic flow measurements at some locations are in many cases the only available information obtained by sensors, whereas the knowledge of the traffic density is necessary for determining suitable ramp metering actions. A piecewise-affine version of the Asymmetric Cell Transmission Model is adopted and, on the basis of its operating mode and observability properties, a density estimation mechanism based on switched Luenberger observers is realized. The problem is formulated and solved resorting to Linear Matrix Inequalities. The ramp metering control action is then computed by applying a Model Predictive Control approach that uses state estimates in place of measurements.

Based on a first order partial differentiation (PDE) method via a "continuum" approach this study develops a mathematical model which will capture the behavior traffic flow during the time of congestion downstream. Using simulation, the density of traffic on freeways can be estimated by calculating the number of smart connected vehicles escaping through the nearest off ramp during the time of congestion. Again saved travel time can be calculated. Besides ultimately it can be determined where to construct exits in particular aiming to understand traffic phenomena in order to eventually make decisions which may alleviate congestion, maximize flow of traffic, eliminate accidents, minimize automobile exhaust pollution, and other desirable ends. The model validation will be carried out using a simulation of cascading scenarios with traffic data for I-405 freeway (with exit ramps) and its surrounding roadway network in the corridor at Southern California region.

For the complexity and the nonlinear characteristics of traffic incidents, this paper proposes a novel fuzzy deep learning based TID method which considers the spatial and temporal correlations of traffic flow inherently. Parameters of the deep network are initialized using a Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE) model following a layer by layer pre-training procedure. To conduct the fine tuning step, the back-propagation algorithm is used to precisely adjust the parameters in the deep network. Fuzzy logic is employed to control the learning parameters where the objective is to reduce the possibility of overshooting during the learning process, increase the convergence speed and minimize the error. To find the best architecture of the deep network, we used a separate validation set to evaluate different architectures generated randomly based on the Mean Squared Error (MSE). Simulation results show that the proposed incident detection method has many advantages such as higher detection rate and lower false alarm rate.

Understanding how the traffic flows and short-term prediction of congestion occurrence due to rush-hour or incidents can be beneficial to such systems to effectively manage and direct the traffic to the most appropriate detours. Many of the current traffic flow prediction systems are designed by utilizing a central processing component where the prediction is carried out through aggregation of the information gathered from all measuring stations. However, centralized systems are not scalable and fail provide real-time feedback to the system whereas in a decentralized scheme, each node is responsible to predict its own short-term congestion based on the local current measurements in neighboring nodes. We propose a decentralized deep learning-based method where each node accurately predicts its own congestion state in real-time based on the congestion state of the neighboring stations. Moreover, historical data from the deployment site is not required, which makes the proposed method more suitable for newly installed stations. In order to achieve higher performance, we introduce a regularized euclidean loss function that favors high congestion samples over low congestion samples to avoid the impact of the unbalanced training dataset. A novel dataset for this purpose is designed based on the traffic data obtained from traffic control stations in northern California. Extensive experiments conducted on the designed benchmark reflect a successful congestion prediction.

A reasonable design of toll plazas is to determine the shape, size, and merging pattern. We mainly consider designing the area following the toll barrier. we make evaluations about the performance of our new solution and normal solutions, considering the traffic capacity, construction cost and loss.

In particular, we propose an autonomous lane-change maneuver to improve traffic flow. The key technique of the proposed maneuver is to consider not only selfish conditions to track individual velocity tracking performance but also altruistic conditions to improve the driving performance of the succeeding vehicles by using vehicle-to-vehicle communications. To realize the conditions, this paper presents cost functions and criteria mathematically. We also demonstrate through simulation that the proposed algorithm enhances heterogeneous traffic flow efficiency while avoiding collisions and wasteful traffic congestion in dense traffic. As a result, each vehicle with the proposed maneuver can travel about 1 minute per 10 km faster than only the conventionally selfish condition on average.

IT strategy with reactive compensation has predictive and pre-emptive capabilities by using prevailing traffic flows online and historical traffic patterns offline. To obtain the expected performance, several assumptions have been made to guarantee the convergence of offline signal controllers. In this paper, the assumptions are investigated and proved to be fulfilled elaborately with real traffic conditions. Meanwhile, the convergence still holds with consideration of control input constraints. Heavy traffic conditions in a real urban network are simulated and validate the convergence with control constraints.

A platooning application forms road trains of vehicles that autonomously follow a common leader, separated by a small inter-vehicle gap. In terms of traffic efficiency, platooning should improve the vehicular flow and reduce shock waves. The latter are the cause of start-and-stop dynamics which, besides disrupting traffic flow, can lead to accidents. The aim of this poster is to analyze, by means of simulations, the impact of platoons on both the traffic flow and the formation of shock waves.

It has been observed that some drivers are not aware of speed decrease due to grade resistance at sags, and as a result congestion occurs. For velocity control to mitigate the congestion, the theory of Jam Absorption Driving (JAD) has been attracting attentions which encourages vehicles running behind the congested platoon to reduce their speed and to delay arrival to the platoon. The authors have presented velocity control system that utilizes inter-vehicle communication with long range wireless system such as 700MHz ARIB-T109 for quickly sharing congestion information among cars and leads cars approaching the congested platoon to perform JAD. This paper evaluates the proposed scheme by focusing the effect on the communication range of wireless system on the congestion alleviation performance. The simulation results show that using communication range of 1km has substantially reduce the travel time of the vehicles compared to using small communication range such as 300m and information is relayed among cars with multihop broadcast. Also, this configuration is effective for the case where only low ratio of vehicles are equipped with communication systems. The findings of the paper show that the proposed scheme is beneficial to improve traffic flow at sags.

One widely used method for short-term traffic prediction is k-nearest neighbours (kNN). However, choosing the right parameter values for kNN is problematic. Although many studies have investigated this problem, they did not consider all parameters of kNN at the same time. This paper aims to improve kNN prediction accuracy by tuning all parameters simultaneously concerning dynamic traffic characteristics. We propose weighted parameter tuples (WPT) to calculate weighted average dynamically according to flow rate. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on one-year real-world data. The results show that flow-aware WPT kNN performs better than manually tuned kNN as well as benchmark methods such as extreme gradient boosting (XGB) and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA). Thus, it is recommended to use dynamic parameters regarding traffic flow and to consider all parameters at the same time.

Phase space reconstruction based on the chaos is the necessary steps to analyze the nonlinear characteristics of complex systems. The C-C algorithm that using the correlation integral is an effective way to estimate the parameters of delay time tau and delay time window tau(w) of phase space reconstruction. Due to the length limited and noise of traffic flow time series, the tau and tau(w) estimated by C-C method is with volatility. To reduce value deviation, the C - C average algorithm is used in this paper to reconstruct the phase space, and to get the optimal delay time of short-term traffic flow parameters. Then the maximal Lyapunov exponent is calculated by the small-data method, to determine whether the traffic flow time series is chaotic system or not.

One form is demand uncertainty which is mainly due to the root cause of aircraft departing in deviated time slots. This can lead to severe consequences, including capacity violation in air routes. The current Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) literature does not consider demand uncertainty in flight scheduling. However, in reality, most of the flights do not take off at the designated time slots, thus can lead to an unexpected number of aircraft to appear in some links. This creates several difficulties in air transportation systems, including higher workloads for air traffic controllers and higher delays and travel costs. In this study, we propose a novel flight routing and scheduling scheme while considering the demand uncertainty present in the system. Our objective is to route and schedule flights to minimize the overall network delay while satisfying all link capacity constraints even under demand uncertainty. To this end, when estimating the flight parameters such as location and time, we consider a range of values that the flight can take due to its departure uncertainty rather than a discrete single value. The problem is formulated as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) problem. With the help of simulation, we show that the proposed approach helps to eliminate the capacity violation completely from the system while ensuring a low amount of overall flight delay.

This project is concerned with urban road systems and traffic signal control. The work presents the algorithms employed by experimental traffic signals used in a simulated road network The network is a grid system that is specifically contrived to exhibit highly interactive tidal congestion The available forward road capacity (AFRC) algorithm is presented as an extension of existing MOVA control algorithms. The objective of providing maximum junction utilisation under congested conditions is explained along with the proposed solution AFRC automatically determines the temporal and geographic boundaries of congestion and attempts to resolve the problem across multiple junctions without the need for prior knowledge of traffic flows. The system is therefore self-organising and, as a result, is able to respond to dynamic and unanticipated flow changes without manual reconfiguration. Simulation results are presented which compare the action of MOVA and AFRC detection in managing high density congestion across the multiple junction network The results obtained show that delays can be significantly reduced in periods of congestion and that the performance improvement increases as the road becomes more congested. Reducing overall congestion duration generates time savings for individuals and a reduction in the negative effects on the environment and public health, increased fuel efficiency and reduced fuel waste. The main benefits of the system are equally applicable to all powered transport systems regardless of fuel source or control method including autonomous vehicles and vehicles equipped with V2X communication The controller is an ongoing development and is capable of directly and accurately measuring the degree of congestion providing metrics that may be used for other controls including gating and active traffic guidance.

Most of the advanced route guidance strategies have been developed for homogeneous traffic flows, to reduce traffic congestion and enhance the road capacity in a symmetric multi-route scenario. Information guidance strategies have rarely been considered for heterogeneous traffic flows, including different types of vehicles with variable velocities and sizes in an asymmetric multi-route traffic system. In this study, we propose a weighted road occupancy feedback strategy (WROFS) for heterogeneous traffic flows including large vehicles and small vehicles, which considers the characteristics of different types of vehicles, such as, maximum speed, sizes and position, using real-time information feedback technology to guide traffic flow. Based on comparisons with the two previously proposed advanced strategies, the simulation results obtained in an asymmetric two-route traffic scenarios demonstrate that the proposed strategy improves the road capacity, balances traffic states on two routes, achieves better spatial distribution of traffic flow and enhances the stability of traffic flow about flux, average speed and the number of vehicles.

The proposed scheme determines optimally distributed input flows (or feasible entrance link green times) for a number of gates located at the periphery of a protected network area. A macroscopic model is employed to describe the traffic dynamics of the protected network. To describe traffic dynamics outside of the protected area, we augment the basic state-space model with additional state variables to account for the queues at store-and-forward origin links at the periphery. We aim to equalise the relative queues at origin links and maintain the vehicle accumulation in the protected network around a desired point, while the system's throughput is maximised. The perimeter traffic flow control problem is formulated as a convex optimal control problem with constrained control and state variables. For real-time control, the optimal control problem is embedded in a rolling-horizon scheme using the current state of the whole system as the initial state as well as predicted demand flows at entrance links. A meticulous simulation study is carried out for a 2.5 square mile protected network area of San Francisco, CA, including fifteen gates of different geometric characteristics. Results demonstrate the efficiency and equity properties of the proposed approach to better manage excessive queues outside of the protected network area and optimally distribute the input flows.

These systems are envisaged to handle a large volume of manually driven and autonomous vehicles, ensuring smooth traffic flow. A reliable model capturing the dynamics of a vehicle is essential for developing techniques for model-based adaptive cruise control. The existing literature presents detailed models for individual subsystems are such as engine, brake, wheel etc. However, for analysing longitudinal motion, it is desirable to have a novel model capturing all aspects of the vehicle behaviour. In this work, we propose such a unified model of vehicle powertrain describing the dynamics of different components and interaction between them affecting the longitudinal motion. Lastly, using simulation studies, it is shown that the developed model can emulate the vehicle dynamics in the real-life scenarios such as maneuvering through congestion, stop and go, and sudden braking.

The proposed approach makes smarter use of transport networks to achieve objectives related to performance of transport system. This requires efficient traffic planning measures which relate to the actions designed to adjust the demand and capacity of the network in time and space by use of IoT technologies. The adoption of sensors and IoT devices in Smart Traffic System helps to capture the user's preferences and context information which can be in the form of travel time, weather conditions or real-life driving patterns. We have employed multimedia ontology to derive higher level descriptions of traffic conditions and vehicles from perceptual observation of traffic information which provides important grounds for our proposed IoT framework. The multimedia ontology encoded in Multimedia Web Ontology Language(MOWL) helps to define classes, properties, and structure of a possible traffic environment to provide insights across the transportation network. MOWL supports Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) to deal with time-series data and uncertainties linked with context observations which fits the definition of an intelligent IoT system. Thus, our proposed smart traffic framework aggregates information corresponding to traffic domain such as traffic videos captured using CCTV cameras and allows automatic prediction of dynamically changing situations which helps to make traffic authorities more responsive. We have illustrated use of our approach by utilizing contextual information, to assess real-time congestion situation on roads thus allowing to visualize planning services.

J	Franz, ML; Pack, ML; Lund, D; Plaisant, C				Franz, Mark L.; Pack, Michael L.; Lund, Drew; Plaisant, Catherine			Visualization Tools for Traffic Bottleneck Analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						Traffic Congestion; Data Visualization for Decision Support; Traffic Operations	FREEWAY BOTTLENECKS; MASS EVACUATIONS; VISUAL ANALYTICS; IDENTIFICATION; PERFORMANCE	Traffic bottlenecks are a major source of highway user delay. Therefore, identifying bottlenecks and estimating their impacts is critical for making effective and efficient congestion management decisions. While traditional automated traffic recorders (ATR) provide valuable measurements of traffic flow characteristics, their network coverage is inherently limited. However, increased percentages of vehicles and travelers equipped with global positioning systems (GPS) have enabled transportation analysts to collect continuous and wide spread speed and travel time information from probe vehicles, thus allowing for comprehensive monitoring and analysis of the highway network. This paper presents the development and sample application of novel online bottleneck analysis and visualization tool to assist transportation professionals in identifying bottlenecks, and understanding their impacts using innovative data visualizations based on vehicle probe data analysis. The interactive visualizations include 1) maps illustrating the segments impacted by a given bottleneck(s), 2) timelines displaying the evolution of congestion over one or multiple days, as well as incidents occurring during congestion, 3) charts showing the spatial and temporal impacts of a given bottleneck, and 4) tables summarizing the impacts and rankings of each bottleneck. These visualizations can be used to provide both planning and operational congestion management decision support.

This paper applies the method of the queuing theory for analyzing traffic conditions at intersections, especially waiting times. The flow of vehicles on the multi-lane road is described by Poisson process, while the intersection is modeled as server with/without group service. Using radar data collected at the intersection in the city of Zagreb, a queuing model is tested. The results show the application of queuing theory in study of traffic flows and waiting times on intersections.

The effectiveness of VMSs largely depends on the numbers and locations of VMSs in a transportation network. Although a few optimization models have been proposed to find candidate roads for locating VMSs, few have been devoted to developing algorithms that can be used in a real transportation network. A large amount of traffic data, such as traffic flow data, is widely available, collected by various means. Based on those traffic data, a sorting algorithm for a VMS location problem is presented in this paper. The algorithm gave a VMS location order rather than a location set. The proposed method divided roads into categories according to multilevel attributes and preferentially selected roads of a higher class with larger flows and more information and the minimal effect of existing VMS in a certain order to locate VMS. The proposed algorithm was analyzed and verified through a practical case on the Beijing, China, urban road network.

J	Bae, J; Choi, K; Oh, JH				Bae, Junseo; Choi, Kunhee; Oh, Jeong Ho			Multicontextual Machine-Learning Approach to Modeling Traffic Impact of Urban Highway Work Zones	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK; FLOW PREDICTION; CAPACITY; COST	Impact assessments of highway construction work zones (CWZs) are mandated for all federally funded highway infrastructure improvement projects. However, most existing approaches are ad hoc or project specific, so they are incapable of being benchmarked for any particular spatial region. A novel multicontextual approach to modeling the traffic impact of urban highway CWZs is proposed and tested in this paper. The proposed approach is unique because it models the impact of CWZ operations through a multicontextual quantitative method using big data for improved accuracy. In this study, a machine-learning technique was adopted to predict long-term traffic flow rates and the corresponding truck percentages. With the use of these predicted values, stereotypical patterns of traffic volume-to-capacity ratios were created for typical urban nighttime closures. Third-order curve-fitting models to achieve potential work zone travel time delays in heavily trafficked large urban cores were then developed and validated. This study will greatly help state and local governments and the general traveling public in major cities know the potential traffic flow resulting from construction and thereby facilitate progress on highway improvement projects with the better-informed work zone traffic flow and thus improve safety and mobility in and between CWZs.

In this paper, we introduce a protocol that exploits this phenomenon by considering the formations of shock waves and opportunities in adjacent lanes. The objective of this protocol is to reduce the impact of a shock wave by using event-driven messages between vehicles that provide drivers with velocity or lane switching recommendations. We show how our protocol uniformly distributes vehicle densities across multiple lanes while maintaining lane fairness, and reduces the number of vehicles entering a shock wave point. Simulation results show we are able to further reduce the overall travel times and increase the average velocity.	[Rabsatt, R.

However, there is little related work to consider safety assistant driving system in microscopic traffic flow to further study its influences. This paper introduces a safety assistant driving strategy into a car-following model to explore the impacts of the assistant driving strategy on microscopic traffic characteristics. The numerical results indicate that the join of safety assistant driving strategy will inhibit the emergence of congestion and reduce the amplitude of the oscillating phenomena, while it will also reduce the maximum traffic flow which affects the capacity of the road.

When we study the influence of open area on the surrounding roads, we use the theory of traffic flow to study the TOPSIS model. We select the appropriate evaluation index system(traffic flow, vehicle average speed and traffic density) to evaluate the impact of open area on the surrounding roads. Then, the relationship between vehicle average velocity and traffic volume and traffic density is obtained by referring to the relationship of traffic flow parameters. In order to study the influence of open area on the surrounding road traffic, this paper establishes the TOPSIS model. The three indexes(traffic flow, vehicle average speed and traffic density) are the index layer of the model. Using the analytic hierarchy process to determine the weight of each index, and finally build a weighted standard decision matrix. By the TOPSIS model, we get the positive and negative ideal schemes, and measure the merits and demerits of the schemes by calculating the relative proximity of the schemes and the positive and negative ideal schemes. When the relative proximity is closer to 1, the closer the program is to the positive ideal solution, the better the scheme. Taking the Yibin City Rhine River area of Sichuan Province as an example, combined with the real real-time travel speed data of the traffic website, by TOPSIS model we analyze the effect of the area before and after the opening on the surrounding road capacity, using MATLAB software to solve.

The procedure is based on the communication between connected vehicles and signal controller (Vehicle to Infrastructure communications). Thus, the optimisation procedure is characterised by two steps: the first refers to the adaptive traffic signal optimisation, whilst the second refers to the optimisation of routes and departure times of connected vehicles. In particular, as regards the adaptive traffic signal control, stage durations and sequences, as well as the node offsets, are considered as decision variables optimised with a scheduled synchronisation method based on a meta-heuristic algorithm. On the contrary, the optimisation of connected vehicle paths and departure times were considered as decision variables through a Mixed Integer Mathematical Program. Finally, as regards the traffic flow model, a further development of the Cell Transmission Model was considered. The whole framework was tested on a toy network.

These developments have a direct impact on road traffic characteristics, as AV can also be used as sensors, actuators, and generally as effective components of an online traffic management system. In this work, we explore through microsimulation how AV can affect the network performance on urban networks. It is demonstrated through simulation experiments, that for mixed traffic (i.e. AV and conventional vehicles), different penetration rates of AV can reduce the density (i.e. congestion) and increase the capacity (i.e. throughput) of the network. Furthermore, new emerging capabilities for perimeter control in urban regions are explored, by utilizing new sources of data that can become available. A new feedback-based regulator is developed, which uses AV speed measurements as the state-feedback variables. The regulator is demonstrated to work equivalently well with a well fine-tuned regulator that uses loop detectors occupancy measurements (i.e. accumulation estimates) from all the links of the network. The speed-based feedback perimeter flow regulator performs significantly well even for very low penetration rates of AV (e.g. 5%), resulting in reduced delays for the users and less congestion in the urban region. Although the regulator has sparse measurements only from AV it can achieve the same improvement with the accumulation-based regulator that has the whole picture of the network.

The potential benefits obtained by applying the proposed control concept are demonstrated for different ACC penetration rates by use of validated microscopic simulation applied to a real motorway stretch where recurrent traffic congestion is created due to an on-ramp bottleneck. The simulation results demonstrate that, even for low penetration rates of ACC vehicles, the proposed control concept improves the average vehicle delay and fuel consumption by reducing the space-time extent of congestion compared to the case of only manually driven or regular ACC vehicles.

The proposed model aims at understanding the fundamental properties of mixed flow of human-driven (N) and autonomous vehicles (AV) such as headway, capacity, and delay at signalized intersections. This is challenging because of intrinsic differences between longitudinal driving characteristics of these two types of vehicles and the convoluted dynamics of car following situation within various combinations of AV and human-driven vehicles. The expected headway of the mixed flow is determined based on the penetration rate of AV and the headways between two successive AV-AV, AV-N, N-AV, and N-N. Furthermore, the upper and lower bounds of mixed flow headway is presented. The theoretical headway is validated by microsimulation data. The estimated headways are then incorporated to derive the delay of a mixed flow at a signalized 2-lane link. Four combination of (i) mixed lanes, (ii) dedicated lanes for AV and human-driven vehicles, (iii) one mixed lane and one AV dedicated lane, and (iv) one mixed lane and one human-driven vehicle dedicated lane are considered. The results demonstrate the performance of the four lane configurations for various stages of AV deployment penetration rate.

As a solution approach for these diverse problems, many cities have already decided to install a toll, which is often designed as a congestion-pricing area. With that, they aim to reduce, if not completely prohibit, traffic in the inner cities, and to provide a source of additional income for the city budget. In order to get the maximum traffic benefits out of such a tolling area and to avoid traffic jams within the tolled area, it is necessary to control the system with an efficient algorithm. However, at the moment there are no dynamic, traffic responsive city tolling systems. The major reason is that such controlling mechanisms, especially if they have to represent a whole network, would require a lot of data. This data is not only difficult to collect and manage, particularly if most of the roads inside the network have to be measured, it also makes it hard to design and calibrate the control algorithm. With the help of a network fundamental diagram (NFD), representing the traffic state of the whole network, this data collection and management problem can be solved. This motivates the idea of using an NFD as a basis for controlling the pricing scheme of a city tolling system. To examine the feasibility of this approach, a microscopically simulated test network was created and a NFD for this network was developed. Using this NFD, a desired occupancy value for the whole network is set, and the toll height is calculated from different control functions of the occupancy inside the tolled network compared to the desired occupancy value. This toll height is subsequently included into the route choice algorithm of the microsimulation, shifting the traffic onto the non-tolled roads. In order to assess the different control approaches, evaluation criteria including a comparison of the resulting network occupancy with the desired one, the stability of the price, and the reaction speed are set. Several approaches to determine the prizing based on the fundamental diagram are developed and tested in the simulated network. The development of the traffic flow and network occupation over time inside the tolled network is compared between the various tolling functions in order to identify the best performing one.

However, most research has traditionally focused on either traffic models which do not scale very well to large networks, computationally or on data-driven methods for freeways, leaving out urban arterials completely. Urban arterials complicate traffic predictions, compared to freeways, because the non-linear effects of traffic are more pronounced on short links and with the presence of more crossings, more modalities and non-necessarily conservation of flow (parking). In this paper we consider several data-driven methods and their prediction performance for various situations, including both freeways and urban arterials, for prediction horizons from five minutes up to one week. The focus lies on predicting the traffic flow and speed given available measured data on a certain location. Thus challenges regarding data fusion, state estimation, and other methods providing complete temporal and spatial data is not addressed. The methods evaluated include several naive, parametric and non-parametric methods. For the evaluation of the prediction performance several weeks of data of various locations were used. Performance indicators contained the Root Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Percentage Error and Mean Absolute Error. Because evaluating average performance might ignore the performance for non-regular traffic conditions, the evaluation also focused on non-regular traffic conditions. Especially these conditions are important in practice, because in these situations the need for accurate information is the highest. Real-world applicability of traffic prediction requires not only accurate results, but also an indication of the accuracy for each prediction. Earlier research has mostly ignored this, leaving this up to the intuition of users of these predictions. This paper introduces a simple way to calculate confidence intervals, applicable to any traffic prediction method. For comparing these confidence intervals between different prediction horizons, an error measure for the accuracy of a confidence interval is defined. Two methods, SARIMA (Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) and NLM (Neighborhood Link Method), proved to be the best. The results also indicate key features necessary for accurate traffic prediction with data-driven methods. The results also show reasonably accurate confidence intervals, with those intervals able to adapt well to different traffic situations.	[Friso, K.; Wismans, L. J.

That determines systematicity and actuality of the development of detailed models and transport process management technologies using the network-centric principles. That models and technologies make it possible to compensate the heterogeneity of information space. The paper objective was to increase the efficiency of transport process management through the development of detailed geospatial models of transport infrastructure and process management technologies that provided multi-level interaction between pluralities of intelligent transport subsystems. Domain data was decomposed basing on the principles of uniformity inherent properties of objects classes, taking into account attribute, topological, functional components. A multi-layer architecture of transport process management system based on geographic information system using electronic map of urban territory are described. Algorithms and software based on detailed models and technologies of distributed geographic information systems are developed. The results of intelligent transport system software development were used in traffic organization works in the cities of Surgut, Trehgornyi and Oktyabrsk (Russia). The using of detailed models, geographic information system, and network-centric technologies was reasonable due to their effectiveness in the synthesis of control systems.

At present within the context of the upcoming 2018 FIFA World Cup, municipal authorities are planning to build some new streets and modify road junctions in the city of Samara. The study aims to investigate the effect of these improvements on the transport situation in the city. To achieve this goal the agent based simulation and analysis tools based on free software MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation) were used. We have developed a framework for transforming available data into a form acceptable for the simulation system. A spatial distribution of trips via time frames was described as origin-destination (OD) matrices. The OD matrices were converted to destination chains by a special-purpose method of traffic flows distribution. We have run simulation for the whole city of Samara with its current road network to check the feasibility of the model to reflect the real transport situation. The model was used for checking the impact of building roads to the new stadium: Arena and Dalnaya streets. Using this model we detected possible problems and proposed the ways to omit them.

Our research focuses on reproducing anticipated traffic conditions by means of statistical methods traditionally applied in artificial intelligence problems. Although we strongly believe that the effects of specific traffic events can only be predicted through transportation model based simulations in real-time, yet the fluctuations affecting the ordinary traffic conditions of a day-type can well be forecasted without.

Data availability varies considerably between different cities and regions. While some publish comprehensive open datasets, others either do not provide their data or do not even posses any traffic data. This paper proposes a solution to the problem of missing vehicle speed data. Our approach is to train a prediction model in an area where data is available and then transfer this model to areas where data is lacking. The proposed method requires only readily available static road network data in the target area. We improve upon previously published prediction models by incorporating local network centrality measures. Our approach reduces errors in vehicle speed prediction by as much as 24%.

The growth of urban environments, as well as the use of ICT in enabling applications and services, has encouraged several works on the modeling of transportation. High mobility of vehicles in such a context consists of a significant challenge in modeling traffic. Several microscopic and macroscopic models have been designed aiming to represent the movement of vehicles accurately in road segments, involving different levels of complexity, precision, and realism. Out of these models, Free-flow models have shown useful due to being light and reasonably accurate for estimating load in short-time predictions. A recent free-flow traffic flow modeled using queues assumed constant vehicle speed along the road segment; this assumption may lead to a lack of realism and accuracy. Therefore, we propose a free-flow model based on this previous work where the road segment is split into several intervals, representing the oscillations of the speed of vehicles. The proposed model has shown correctness comparable to the previous free-flow model, considering that it has included speed varying behavior of vehicles.

At the same time, the highly uncertain and nonlinear of short-term traffic flow has been presented due to the complicated factors such as road construction, traffic accident, complex weather and trip distribution. et. So the short-term traffic flow prediction is more difficult than the long-term forecast. First of all, aiming at the uncertain and time-varying characteristics of the short-term traffic flow, the main single-model prediction methods and the combination forecast models are summarized and analyzed. Finally, a combined forecasting method based on Markov chain theory and grey Verhuls model with less data demand and parameter is proposed. The experimental results show that the combined model can obtain a high prediction accuracy.

Based on the analysis of the traffic flow characteristic of urban freeway and streets system, the macroscopic traffic flow model integrated urban freeway with streets system is established, by using store-and-forward model to describe the evolution law of states for the two systems. Then on this basis, the green ratio adaptive control method based on linear quadratic optimal control is put forward.

Besides, the safety codes and standard of accident prevention and throughout capacity must be met while the development and operating costs should be kept as low as possible. Six major factors impacting the toll plaza performance were discussed, including the corresponding relationship between the amount of main lanes in single direction and tollbooth, the critical length of toll plaza meeting safety codes and standards, the critical width of toll plaza, the critical size of transition region, the development cost of toll plaza and its throughput capacity. We set up a multiple index analysis system after calculating those six factors to analyze the pros and cons of the existing toll plaza, which could provide scientific basis for the new design. Moreover, difference motivated principle was applied to determine the weight vector, to comprehensively evaluate the impact of each parameter. To determine the optimal design, we designed and compared three control schemes. The evaluation system was applied to compare the pros and cons of each scheme based on the actual situations, and the optimal scheme was designed through combining the strengths of all three. By investigating the adjustment strategy and corresponding performance of the toll plaza of the different scheme in the case of light and heavy traffic flow, the case when the proportion of automatic driving vehicles increases, and the case under different charging modes, the feasibility and rationality of the optimal scheme was tested. In the process of inspection, we used the queuing theory model to determine the maximum capacity of the toll plaza under the manual toll mode, and used the integer programming model to solve the optimal proportional relation of the three tolling models.

This model can be efficiently used in case of failure or temporary loss of connection with any of the navigational subsystems, as the model allows conducting virtual monitoring of the surrounding moving objects. The system provides the modeling of the road scene in real time mode based on the data from the technical vision subsystem, as well as provides opportunity to do virtual positioning on the system's electronic maps. The information from the electronic maps helps to improve the recognition of the road scene structure thanks to additional 'a priori' information. The suggested approach can be used for describing other types of moving objects with various structures of the navigation environment.	[Senchenko, R. V.; Krapukhina, N.

This paper aims to present a traffic model based on NaSchr model, but with a revised rule for randomisation. User can trigger a manual braking on certain cars and its effect on traffic flow can be observed and analysed. The traffic cellular automata model with manual braking mode is applied to a single lane with open boundary conditions. A new variable 'bad-agent' is introduced to represent the tailgater on road that cause the inevitable brake-tapping on drivers behind them, thus the emergence of traffic waves. The simulation results show that when cars come too close to each other at high speed, certainly it creates noise. This noise is the traffic waves that propagate backward.

The running speed calculation is based on the technical parameters of the road (geometry, gradient, curves, etc.) and valid Czech legislation for road designing. In this article, road factors influencing the final heavy freight vehicle's running speed are presented as well. The main assumption is the fact that every heavy vehicle moves on the road by speed allowed by the geometry of this road, road signs and traffic flow characteristics (intensity, density or road capacity).

During this transition, the critical traffic bottleneck plays an important role in maintaining the global functional connectivity of the whole system. However, little attention has been paid to how the traffic percolation will be benefited from the improvements of traffic percolation bottlenecks. Here, we study the improvement of traffic bottlenecks in a traffic model and find that the traffic bottlenecks can greatly affect the organization efficiency of traffic flow. We propose a method of traffic bottlenecks load-reducing, which shows a significant improvement of traffic percolation on the network scale under different traffic conditions. Comparing with different methods, we demonstrate the advantage of the method of traffic bottlenecks load-reducing in the improvement of traffic percolation. Our findings may provide new insights for the research of bottlenecks and develop effective measures to improve the traffic reliability in real traffic.

To assess the effectiveness of these regulations, available traffic data were used to understand their effect on the level of service. The results show that if HGV traffic was to be banned during specific hours and provided with alternative routes, the risk of difficult traffic conditions will be reduced. Forecasted traffic increase until 2030 was also considered. The solutions were put in the broader context of urban freight transport management with reference to the need for reliable data and cooperation with the private sector.

In order to improve the applicability of CTM model and make the prediction result more accurate, improved CTM was proposed. In the improved CTM, the length of the cell cannot be equal, so it is more suitable for the prediction of different length sections on the highway. The simulation results show that the improved CTM model meets the requirements of freeway traffic flow forecasting.

It would be valuable if an FD could be calibrated by using GPS-equipped probe vehicles; since they can continuously collect data from wide spatiotemporal area, compared to traditional fixed sensors. This paper proposes methods for calibrating an FD from trajectories of sampled vehicles. We formulate a method that identifies values of a free-flow speed and a critical density of a tri-angular FD, while it relies on exogenous assumptions on FD's functional form and a value of its jam density. Then, a heuristic algorithm for FD calibration in actual traffic environment is developed based on the proposed method. It was validated using traffic data generated by microscopic traffic simulator. The results suggested that the proposed methods can calibrate an FD precisely and robustly. It implies that FDs in road sections on which congestion happens frequently can be calibrated using probe vehicles, if probe vehicle data were collected for a long period. Therefore, the proposed methods would contribute to significant improvement of applicability of probe vehicle-based traffic management methods. Copyright (C) 2017 The Authors.

Empirical studies have observed a lane-changing concentration problem, as traffic flow increases, which can cause flow break down and congestion. This paper focuses on the lane-changing concentration problem in weaving segments. A Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) advisory has been shown to alleviate such a lane-changing concentration problem. The advisory aims to distribute the lane-changing along the weaving segment. Unlike previous methods in the literature, where weaving vehicles are assigned according to fixed distributions, this paper proposes an algorithm to optimize the lane-changing distribution. The proposed optimization algorithm was developed based on particle swarm optimization. The optimized lane-changing distribution for a one-sided motorway weaving segment using microscopic simulation has been evaluated. The initial results show that the proposed algorithm could be used as a successful optimization technique for the lane- changing concentration problem. Copyright (C) 2017 The Authors.

Temporal patterns of traffic flow can dynamically change over time as a result of traffic management measures such as the construction of new roads. Given this possibility, it is sensible to use only recent data, instead of all past data. In this study, by incorporating the latent factor model into a conventional approach, we construct a novel traffic prediction method for multiple inter-city roads based on the most recent training data. This formulation leads to a reduction in the number of model parameters, since it assumes that there is a set of patterns underlying the data (in our case, the periodic patterns shared across roads in traffic flow data), which inherently offers robustness against sparse observations. In addition, we adopt stochastic variational Bayes method to solve the optimization problem, which allows us to update model parameters online. By continually updating the model based on the most recent training data, we can instantly provide accurate predictions of inter-city traffic flow that have intermittently changing patterns. Using a real-world traffic flow dataset collected in the Greater Tokyo Area via GPS-equipped mobile phones, we evaluate the predictive performance of the proposed method, and confirm that it performs better than existing methods in the sparse domain.

Existing approaches for traffic flow forecast such as ARIMA, SVR, and neural network perform well in modeling and predicting each OD pair separately, but they cause inefficiency when dealing with multidimensional OD demand data. In this paper, to solve the problemgiven OD trip matrices for T moments, how can we predict the overall OD trip matrices at time T+1, T+2, or even T+L, we model temporal vehicle-based OD trip matrix as a four-order tensor consisting of four attributes: origin, destination, vehicle type and time. By resorting to CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor decomposition, we show how a prediction method can be used to forecast future traffic demand in time factor matrix. Experiments based on a real highway tolling dataset demonstrate that our method effectively reduces the time for prediction and meanwhile makes the prediction accuracy competitive with those of other methods.

A Delay-Based Spacing Policy for Vehicle Platooning: Analysis and Control	TIME DELAY SYSTEMS: THEORY, NUMERICS, APPLICATIONS, AND EXPERIMENTS	Advances in Delays and Dynamics		English	Proceedings Paper	12th IFAC Workshop on Time Delay Systems	JUN 28-30, 2015	Ann Arbor, MI	IFAC			STRING STABILITY; CRUISE CONTROL; SYSTEMS	Reducing inter-vehicular distances and the formation of groups of closely spaced vehicles have the potential to increase traffic flow, reduce congestion, and reduce fuel consumption. In this chapter, such vehicle platoons subject to a delaybased spacing policy are considered and the design of distributed controllers is pursued. Specifically, it is shown that the use of the delay-based spacing policy ensures that all vehicles in the platoon track the same velocity profile in the spatial domain, which offers advantages as road properties such as hills, bends, or road speed limits are specified in this domain. The proposed controller exploits delayed information about the preceding vehicle to achieve string-stable platoon behavior. In addition, a relaxation of the delay-based spacing policy is presented that exploits more information about the preceding vehicle. This extended delay-based spacing policy is shown to lead to improved platoon behavior. The results are illustrated by means of simulations.

LIDAR produces point clouds which have important information about surrounding environment. In this paper, we collected trajectory data on a two lane urban road using a Velodyne VLP-16 Lidar. Due to dynamic nature of data collection and limited range of the sensor, some of these trajectories have missing points or gaps. In this paper, we propose a novel method for recovery of missing vehicle trajectory data points using microscopic traffic flow models. While short gaps (less than 5 seconds) can be recovered with simple linear regression, and longer gaps are recovered with the proposed method that makes use of car following models calibrated by assigning weights to known points based on proximity to the gaps. Newell's, Pipes, IDM and Gipps' car following models are calibrated and tested with the ground truth trajectory data from LIDAR and NGSIM I-80 dataset. Gipps' calibrated model yielded the best result.

Accommodating High Value-of-Time Drivers in Market-Driven Traffic Signal Control	2017 28TH IEEE INTELLIGENT VEHICLES SYMPOSIUM (IV 2017)	IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	28th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)	JUN 11-14, 2017	Redondo Beach, CA	IEEE, Visteon, Intel, IEEE Intelligent Transportat Syst Soc				In this paper, we propose a market-driven approach to traffic signal control. In contrast to traditional traffic engineering approaches, our approach gives agency and decision-making influence to individual drivers and exploits auction mechanisms to make traffic control decisions. Drivers make payments to their corresponding movement managers ( each responsible for a particular directional flow through the intersection), and movement managers then compete for control of the signal. These financial transactions, if treated literally provide an alternate source of funding transportation infrastructure. Previous work with this model has demonstrated the ability to achieve better overall traffic flow performance than actuated control, a simple adaptive traffic signal control strategy based on detection and monitoring of waiting vehicles. Here we consider the design and analysis of bidding strategies capable of factoring in a given driver's value of time (VOT), as indicated by the amount of voluntary contributions that are made on top of the fixed fee that every driver is charged. We analyze the potential for expediting high VOT drivers without undue disruption of overall traffic flows.

The system uses real-time traffic information to determine the state of the traffic flows at a signalized intersection in order to schedule the traffic lights efficiently. A vehicle, modeled as automaton, securely disseminate and exchange its internal state with a trusted traffic authority in a wireless communication. A roadside unit, installed at the road intersection, collects the traffic information, verifies the information, and uses a phase-based control algorithm to optimize the amount of the vehicles entering the intersection. The new approach has been evaluated through simulation under light and heavy traffic conditions, and the results compared with fixed-time traffic signal control and Webster's method.

The instability that leads to this less fuel-efficient unsteady flow results from the collective behavior of all human drivers. This work studies under which circumstances the presence of a single autonomous vehicle (AV) can locally stabilize the flow, without changing the way the humans drive. If possible, this can enable traffic flow control via very few AVs serving as mobile actuators. First, the analysis of car-following models reveals that in idealized conditions (no system noise), the flow can in fact be made linearly stable by means of a low fraction of control vehicles. Second, we highlight the fundamental limitations of this sparse control when considering models with noise.

This work suggests an approach to virtual monitoring of the objects in a current road scene via a system with a multitude of cooperating smart vehicles exchanging information. It also describes the intellectual agent model, and provides methods and algorithms of identifying and evaluating various characteristics of moving objects in video flow. Authors also suggest ways for integrating the information from the technical vision system into the model with further expansion of virtual monitoring for the system's objects. Implementation of this approach can help to expand the virtual field of view for a technical vision system.

An Artificial Potential Field Approach to Simulate Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Controlled Vehicles	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 10TH ANNUAL DYNAMIC SYSTEMS AND CONTROL CONFERENCE, 2017, VOL 1			English	Proceedings Paper	10th ASME Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference	OCT 11-13, 2017	Tysons, VA	ASME, Div Syst & Control Div		ACC; CACC; platoon simulation; traffic flow; microscopic traffic simulation		This paper presents artificial potential field functions to assist adaptive cruise control and cooperative adaptive cruise control vehicles in a multi-lane highway in two dimensions. The artificial field functions consist of three potential fields: road potential, car potential, and velocity potential. The artificial potential field is constructed in a way to assist the vehicles in lane-keeping, speed preference, platoon forming, and obstacle avoidance. The artificial roadway barriers are constructed to keep the car on the highway, and lane boundaries are constructed so that vehicles can overcome the boundary in case lane changing is needed. Also, the shape of the velocity potential is to allow vehicles to either slow down or speed up depending on the surroundings. Static and dynamic obstacles detected by vehicle sensors are superimposed onto these potential fields. Hierarchical control schemes are introduced on top of these inherently reactive potential fields, resulting in stable platoons with short following times. A MATLAB code was generatEed to show that under our simulated parameters a platoon of vehicles demonstrates good throughput and traffic safety.	[McCrone, D.

Proposing a method of dynamic priority algorithm (DPA) based on the idea of multiple attribute decision making (MADM) to analyze intersection delay. The VAP module based on MATLAB in Vissim is used to simulate the induction control of the modern tram through the concrete intersection, mainly analyzing delay of the intersection with different lane layout types of modern trams. Taking the intersection of Middle Jiangdong Road and Hexi Avenue in Nanjing as an example, the traffic delay caused by different lane layout of modern tram is analyzed by using absolute priority and dynamic priority algorithm (DPA) respectively.

In this paper, a new road traffic accident prediction model (TAP-CNN) is established by using traffic accident influencing factors, such as traffic flow, weather, light to build a state matrix to describe the traffic state and CNN model. This paper uses samples to test the accuracy of the new model. The experimental results show that the TAP-CNN model is more effective than the traditional neural network model to predict the traffic accident. It provides a reference for the forecast of the traffic accident.

The expected travel time in making a trip is modelled against sectional traffic characteristics (flow and speed) at origin and destination points of road segments, and roadway and segment traffic characteristics such as diversion routes are also tried in accounting for travel time. Predicted travel time is then used along with free flow time to determine the state of congestion on the segments using a congestion index (CI). A development of this kind may help in understanding traffic and congestion behaviour practically using easily accessible inputs, limited only to the nodes, and help in improving road network planning and management.

A variety of short-time traffic flow forecasting methods have been developed in the last two decades but most of the literatures focus on predicting traffic flow on a single road, not on junctions. However, Junctions are responsible for 80-90% of congestion and 40-60% of accidents on traffic systems. In this paper, Recurrent Multilayer Perceptron (RMLP) trained with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is used to forecast traffic flow at a junction found in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; locally known as Teklehaimanot junction fifteen minute in to the future. The result is then compared with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) trained with gradient descent back-propagation algorithm. Forecasting results show that RMLP trained with Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm on the junction has approximately three times better training Mean Square Error (MSE). In addition to this, the RMLP has a correlation value of 93.48% for a completely new set of validation data but the MLP's correlation value for the same new set of validation data is 82.9% when used to predict traffic flow on the junction.

The use of a real time dynamic traffic management system to intelligently navigate the vehicles can optimize the traffic flow on the roads, thus utilizing the infrastructure efficiently and providing an environment conducive to solving gridlock in cities. The authors propose a real time traffic management system (RTMS) consisting of real time traffic monitoring system formed by small network of road side units, junction units and mobile units to dynamically decide the time of traffic lights to discourage formation of gridlock, coupled with a web based application for vehicle drivers that will derive the data from real time traffic analysis to indicate the local traffic flow and suggest the incoming vehicles to make use of alternative routes in order to further alleviate growth of the gridlock.

The perimeter control can be realized based on a set of traffic signals on the border between the urban regions that manipulates transferring flows between the regions to regulate the overall urban traffic system states towards a desirable condition considering disturbances and uncertainties in the modeling and state observability. This paper presents robust control of the two-region MFD system with perimeter control addressing different sources of uncertainties. In this paper two types of controller, sliding mode control (SMC) and linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control, are designed based on nonlinear and linearized system dynamics, respectively.

Increasing transportation move and decreasing the average waiting time of each vehicle are the aims of cooperative intelligent traffic control system. Each signal wishes to catch better travel move. During the course, signals form a strategy of cooperation in addition to restriction for neighboring signals to exploit their individual benefit. A superior traffic signal scheduling strategy is used to resolve the difficulty. The several parameters may influence the traffic control model. So it is hard to learn the best possible result. Traffic light controllers are not expert to study from previous results. Due to this, they are unable to include the uncertain transformation of traffic flow. Reinforcement learning algorithm based traffic control model used to get fine timing rules by properly defining real-time parameters of the real traffic scenario. The projected real-time traffic control optimization prototype is able to continue with the traffic signal scheduling rules successfully. The model expands traffic value of the vehicle, which consists of delay time, the number of vehicles stopped at a signal, and the newly arriving vehicles to learn and set up the optimal actions. The experimentation outcome illustrates a major enhancement in traffic control, demonstrating the projected model is competent of making possible real-time dynamic traffic control.

Specifically, one active attacker who introduces errors, in addition to one or many passive attackers who amplify the error, may, by the modification of a single parameter, induce oscillatory traffic jams that cause delay, driver discomfort, excess energy expenditure, and increased risk of accidents that could result in serious injury or death. We determine the conditions under which an attacker(s) is able to violate the primary design criterion of automated vehicle streams, known as string stability, to guarantee system instability. Furthermore, we prove that once the stream has been destabilized it will continually deviate from the desired state, even in the absence of additional input to the system-i.e. the jammed condition will self-perpetuate. Through a comparison with a behavioral human driver model, this work demonstrates that automated vehicle systems are more vulnerable to disruption than their non-automated counterparts. The postulated attack is demonstrated on a scaled system and identification of attackers is discussed.

In this paper, we consider a mixed traffic profile where a fraction of vehicles are smart and able to form platoons, and the remaining are regular and manually driven. We develop two models for road capacity under mixed autonomy that are based on the fundamental behavior of autonomous technologies such as adaptive cruise control. Moreover, we formulate an optimal routing problem of mixed traffic for the first capacity model with two parallel roads. We first study the case that a planner aims to minimize the social cost of the system, and has control over both regular and smart traffic flows. We prove that this optimization problem is convex for the chosen road delay function, and fully characterize its optimal solution. We further study the case that only smart vehicles can be controlled and the regular vehicles choose their route selfishly according to the best response to the routing choice of smart vehicles. Finally, we provide extensive numerical studies that corroborate our analytical results.

We show how solving the dual problem of maximizing the network utility via a gradient projection algorithm synthesizes a low-complexity control law that is simple enough to be implemented on real platforms, while being robust to measurement noises. Our control algorithm can be partially distributed at each time step, every onramp selects a traffic flow to maximize its own benefit, and the network adjusts unit traffic flow prices for different onramps. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of our algorithm under mild technical assumptions. We further demonstrate the practicality of our method in an example where the state of the art controls fail (due to infeasibility) and introduce multiple interesting future directions.

A Hierarchical Approach for Air Traffic Routing and Scheduling	2017 IEEE 56TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL (CDC)	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 56th Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	DEC 12-15, 2017	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA	IEEE		air traffic flow management; flow dynamic model; hierarchical architecture; incremental routing and scheduling; integer linear programming	FLOW MANAGEMENT; MODEL	Efficient flight routing and scheduling plays an important role in air traffic flow management (ATFM), which aims to maximize the utilization of airport and enroute capacities to ensure safety and efficiency of air transportation. In this paper we first propose a novel discrete-time flow dynamic model for an air traffic network, consisting of airports, waypoints and air links, upon which we formulate an air flow routing and scheduling problem as an integer linear programming problem. Considering the NP-hard nature of the problem, we present a novel hierarchical flow routing and scheduling approach, where the hierarchical architecture is derived naturally from the network containment relationship, and computation is carried out in a bottom-up manner, which relies on an incremental strategy. Upon resulting flow routes and schedules, a heuristic algorithm is carried out to determine flight plans for individual aircraft. The effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical approach is illustrated by realistic air traffic data in four ASEAN Flight Information Regions (FIRs).

J	Grabec, I; Svegl, L				Grabec, Igor; Svegl, Lovrenc			Predicting traffic density and congestion on motorways	ELEKTROTEHNISKI VESTNIK-ELECTROCHEMICAL REVIEW			Slovak	Article						modeling of traffic flow; statistical forecasting; traffic jam		Unconvenient driving conditions on high-ways often lead to evolution of traffic jams. Disturbances are most often the consequence of traffic accidents, adverse weather conditions or various works and can be described by the decreased road capacity. By estimating the road capacity drop, the traffic-information providers can forecast the evolution of jams at a disturbed section and inform the population about it in advance. The paper describes a new mathematical prediction method formulated using an intelligent unit developed for its execution. The unit first forecasts the traffic flow for a disturbed road section based upon records of the past traffic flow and then converts the forecast data into characteristics of the evolving jam by using the decreased value of the road capacity. The performance of the method is demonstrated by forecasting evolution of a jam at a disturbed section of a maximal traffic activity on a high-way in Slovenia.

Field data collected on four-lane highway sections are analysed to develop speed-flow relations. A microscopic traffic simulation model VISSIM is also deployed for generating traffic flow data after calibrating it for mixed traffic conditions. PCUs of different vehicle types at six lane and eight lane divided highways are also estimated. The effect of number of lanes on PCUs was studied, and it was observed PCU of each vehicle type decreases with increase in the number of lanes and at a different level of service. The Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), Artificial neural network (ANN) and Multiple linear regression (MLR) models are used for development of PCU Models from the results obtained through VISSIM simulation. A comparative study was performed with PCU obtained from different models reveals that the ANFIS model showed greater potential in predicting PCUs at varying v/c ratios and proportional share of vehicle types in the traffic stream. The models developed in the present study may be used for developing algorithms which describe traffic flow behaviour under mixed traffic conditions with better accuracy and precision.

At present, China's urban road traffic accidents occur frequently, the occurrence frequency is high, the accident causes traffic congestion, and accidents cause traffic congestion and vice versa. The occurrence of traffic accidents usually leads to the reduction of road traffic capacity and the formation of traffic bottlenecks, causing the traffic congestion. In this paper, the formation and propagation of traffic congestion are simulated by using the improved medium traffic model, and the control strategy of congestion dissipation is studied. From the point of view of quantitative traffic congestion, the paper provides the fact that the simulation platform of urban traffic integration is constructed, and a feasible data analysis, learning, and parameter calibration method based on RBF neural network is proposed, which is used to determine the corresponding decision support system. The simulation results prove that the control strategy proposed in this paper is effective and feasible. According to the temporal and spatial evolution of the paper, we can see that the network has been improved on the whole.

The model consists of a scalar conservation law describing the main traffic evolution and an ODE accounting for the trajectory of the slower vehicle that depends on the downstream traffic density. The moving constraint is operated by an inequality on the flux, which accounts for the bottleneck created on the road by the presence of the slower vehicle. We introduce a conservative scheme for the constrained hyperbolic PDE and we use a tracking algorithm for the ODE. We perform numerical tests and compute numerically the order of convergence.

Computing Programs for Determining Traffic Flows from Roundabouts	INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF AUTOMOTIVE AND TRANSPORT ENGINEERING - MOBILITY ENGINEERING AND ENVIRONMENT (CAR2017)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Congress of Automotive and Transport Engineering - Mobility Engineering and Environment (CAR)	NOV 08-10, 2017	Pitesti, ROMANIA	Soc Automot Engineers Romania, FISITA, Groupe Renault, AVL, Horiba, FEV, Asociatia Constructorilor Automobile Romania, Registrul Auto Roman, Uniunea Nationala Transportatorilor Rutieri Romania, Mag engn, Compact Ind, Nobel Automot, Haulotte Grp, CAD Works				For modelling road traffic at the level of a road network it is necessary to specify the flows of all traffic currents at each intersection. These data can be obtained by direct measurements at the traffic light intersections, but in the case of a roundabout this is not possible directly and the literature as well as the traffic modelling software doesn't offer ways to solve this issue. Two sets of formulas are proposed by which all traffic flows from the roundabouts with 3 or 4 arms are calculated based on the streams that can be measured. The objective of this paper is to develop computational programs to operate with these formulas. For each of the two sets of analytical relations, a computational program was developed in the Java operating language. The obtained results fully confirm the applicability of the calculation programs. The final stage for capitalizing these programs will be to make them web pages in HTML format, so that they can be accessed and used on the Internet. The achievements presented in this paper are an important step to provide a necessary tool for traffic modelling because these computational programs can be easily integrated into specialized software.

This prediction is performed in order to provide input data to a dynamic control system for street lighting. The forecasting is done by a multi-layer using artificial neural network. Because of the limited number of sensors, the data is insufficient to describe the relation between the traffic intensity at a given point and the points in which the flow intensity is measured. The proposed approach is tested by using data from the centre of Krakow. The prediction error turned to be low.

J	Hu, WB; Wang, H; Du, B; Yan, LP				Hu, Wenbin; Wang, Huan; Du, Bo; Yan, Liping			A MULTI-INTERSECTION MODEL AND SIGNAL TIMING PLAN ALGORITHM FOR URBAN TRAFFIC SIGNAL CONTROL	TRANSPORT			English	Article						cellular automata; signal timing plan; delay time; multi-intersection model; urban traffic signal control	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; TIME	The urban traffic signal control system is complex, non-linear and non-equilibrium in real conditions. The existing methods could not satisfy the requirement of real-time and dynamic control. In order to solve these difficulties and challenges, this paper proposes a novel Multi-Intersection Model (MIM) based on Cellular Automata (CA) and a Multi-Intersection Signal Timing Plan Algorithm (MISTPA), which can reduce the delay time at each intersection and effectively alleviate the traffic pressure on each intersection in the urban traffic network. Our work is divided into several parts: (1) a multi-intersection model based on CA is defined to build the dynamic urban traffic network; (2) MISTPA is proposed, which truly reflects the real-time demand degree to green time of the traffic flow at each intersection. The MISTPA is composed Single Intersection Volume Algorithm (SIVA), Single-Lane Volume Algorithm (SLVA) and single intersection signal timing plan algorithm (SISTPA). Extensive experiments show that when the saturation is greater than 0.3, the MIM and the MISTPA achieve good performance, and can significantly reduce the vehicle delay time at each intersection. The average delay time of the traffic flow at each intersection can obviously be reduced. Finally, a practical case study demonstrates that the proposed model and the corresponding algorithm are correct and effective.

With the use of Duffing Holmes Oscillator, we estimate the emergence of traffic flow congestion when the traffic load on a specific section of the road and in a specific time period is close to exceeding the capacity of the road infrastructure.

On the other hand, with the development of traffic sensors, traffic data are collected with a fantastic scale. It leads ITS into a data-driven application fashion. With this observation, it is a challenge to accurately and promptly forecast the traffic flow by effectively utilizing the big traffic data. In view of this challenge, in this paper, we propose an evolutionary method for short-term traffic flow forecasting service. Concretely, in our method, traffic flow is firstly specified by a model of time series. Then, the model is decomposed into seasonal component and the residual component. The seasonal component reflects the history average condition, while we treat the residual component as the output of a linear filter. The proposed method is evaluated with real bus transaction dataset. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.

I study on the influence of district opening on peripheral roads by three critical solutions acquired by the three models above that I make. I take advantage of the model simulation to make quantitative conclusion on the influence of different districts opening The article takes the qualification, integrity and independence of the evaluation index into consideration especially to build the evaluation index system. I extract the throughput around the community, queue length and delay time from the evaluation index and conclude the three indicators to build an evaluation system. The article makes three mathematical models according to the three chosen indicators. (2) I figure out the shortest length of roads around the community by solving the model built on the throughout. simplify the queue length calculated by the model based on the traffic flow theory to the times of the number of the waiting cars. I get the smallest road saturation of the community which is suitable for opening based on the improved 'Webster' model whose factor is fitted by least square method. I think the built models are practical by calculation and model simulation. The models are suitable for promoting to the traffic management department, the house ministry and the municipal planning department to carry out research activities.

Traffic shape changes over time and location in which it is observed. Moreover it depends on roads, lines and crossroads arrangement. In addition, each congestion event has its own peculiarities (e.g. duration, extension, flow). Therefore, to give correct responses any detection model needs some kind of parametric adjustment. In this paper, we present an adaptive biologically-inspired technique for swarm aggregation of on-vehicle GPS devices positions, able to detect traffic congestion. The aggregation principle of the position samples is based on a digital mark, released at each sample in a digital space mapping the physical one, and evaporated over time. Consequently, marks aggregation occurs and stays spontaneously while many stationary vehicles are crowded into a road. In order to identify actually relevant traffic events, marks aggregation has to be correctly configured. This is achieved by tuning the mark's structural parameters. Considering that each urban area has a specific traffic flow and density, determining a proper set of parameters is not trivial. Here, we approach the issue using different differential evolution variants, showing their impact on performance.	[Alfeo, Antonio L.; Cimino, Mario G. C.

J	Gu, YM; Qian, Z; Zhang, GH				Gu, Yiming; Qian, Zhen (Sean); Zhang, Guohui			Traffic State Estimation for Urban Road Networks Using a Link Queue Model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							INCIDENT DETECTION; HIGHWAY; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS; WAVES; FLOW	Traffic state estimation (TSE) is used for real-time estimation of the traffic characteristics (such as flow rate, flow speed, and flow density) of each link in a transportation network, provided with sparse observations. The complex urban road dynamics and flow entry and exit on urban roads challenge the application of TSE on large-scale urban road networks. Because of increasingly available data from various sources, such as cell phones, GPS, probe vehicles, and inductive loops, a theoretical framework is needed to fuse all data to best estimate traffic states in large-scale urban networks. In this context, a Bayesian probabilistic model to estimate traffic states is proposed, along with an expectation-maximization extended Kalman filter (EM-EKF) algorithm. The model incorporates a mesoscopic traffic flow propagation model (the link queue model) that can be computationally efficient for large-scale networks. The Bayesian framework can seamlessly integrate multiple data sources for best inferring flow propagation and flow entry and exit along roads. A synthetic test bed was created. The experiments show that the EM-EKF algorithm can promptly estimate traffic states. Another advantage is that the EM-EKF can update its model parameters in real time to adapt to unknown traffic incidents, such as lane closures. Finally, the proposed methodology was applied to estimating travel speed for an urban network in the Washington, D.C., area and resulted in satisfactory estimation results with an 8.5% error rate.

J	Bang, S; Ahn, S				Bang, Soohyuk; Ahn, Soyoung			Platooning Strategy for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles Transition from Light Traffic	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							CAR-FOLLOWING THEORY; MODEL	This study presents a strategy for platoon formation and evolution of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in free-flow traffic. The proposed strategy is based on swarm intelligence, which describes bird flocking, fish schooling, and so on, in natural and artificial systems. In this concept, CAVs behave according to some rules to move together as a platoon without collisions. The rules are expressed by a spring-mass-damper system: CAV platoon formation and evolution are controlled by the spring constant and damping coefficient. Valid domains of these control parameters were derived on the basis of physical vehicle properties (e.g., bounded acceleration and deceleration) for realistic control. Furthermore, various relationships-maximum (in which the spring constant was set at its maximum for the given flow), quadratic, and cubic-between the control parameters and traffic flow were examined with simulations to obtain insight into desirable control parameter settings. The results suggest that the most efficient platooning can be achieved by the maximum relationship between the spring constant and flow with critical damping. However, the cubic relationship coupled with overdamping is more desirable in low-flow states to allow more freedom for vehicles to change lanes.

An online estimator of the cross-correlation was studied with the use of empirical data. The result suggests that the measure can be used to identify traffic phases. To understand better the behavior of the true statistical cross-correlation, generic networks were simulated. With homogeneously distributed densities, the simulations suggested that the cross-correlation monotonically decreases with the growth of the mean density and vanishes when the network is at capacity. As a consequence, for such networks, the phase can be identified from a single point on the curve of the cross-correlation versus mean density. A case study of cross-correlation-based perimeter-control strategies was performed, with gate traffic flowing into the network when the cross-correlation was below a (negative) threshold to improve network flows. The simulation results suggest that even with anisotropic traffic demand, the cross-correlation-based control strategy can improve network performance, specifically traffic flow and density heterogeneity.

The V2V-based data delivery that is opposite to the direction of a vehicle is called a backward delivery against the traffic flow, and it is blocked by an existing problem: a traffic hole. Under the backward delivery with a traffic hole problem, there are no available vehicles that can move the data to its destination using the movement-assisted routing protocol; the data move in the direction opposite to that of the vehicle's motion. In this paper, we investigate backward data delivery under the traffic hole problem in order to provide more opportunities for V2V data transmissions. To mitigate the impact of the traffic hole on the backward data delivery, we propose an RSU-Assisted Backward Delivery scheme (RABD) which employs the roadside units (RSUs) as low-cost relays instead of traditional access points. RABD combines two methods of data delivery: one based on backward data forwarding among vehicles and another which is forwarded by the RSU. To reduce resource consumption, we investigate the single-copy scheme and consider the tradeoffs of both methods. Our extensional simulations verify the effectiveness of our proposed schemes.

Accurate and timely prediction on the future traffic flow is strongly needed by individual travelers, public transport, and transport planning. Over the last few years, with the exploding of traffic data, various big data analytics based methods have been proposed to predict the traffic flow. However, it is hard to provide timely prediction by processing real-time traffic data. This paper proposes DeepTFP, which conducts the prediction with a time series function which considers the spatial and temporal correlations of traffic data to track the changes of traffic flow, and DeepTFP uses deep learning to extract the feature of traffic data as the basis of the time series function. Contrast experiments are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model.

By applying the framework to planet scale imagery dataset (traffic cameras) we were able to model the traffic demand of a large scale urban scenario (city of London) by means of origin/destination matrix and trips starting within 30 minutes. Along the way, we investigate the relationship of traffic flow (vehicles per minute) vs occupancy, lognormality of trip duration distribution and number of trips started within 30 minutes using available datasets of Berkeley highways and taxicabs of Beijing and San Francisco (SF). We then compare different routing methods and study the effects of system parameters on the number of generated trips.

Previously, there have been many studies involving load forecasting using time series approach, including weather-load relationships. In one such approach to predict load, this paper investigates through different structures that aim to relate various daily parameters. These parameters include temperature, humidity and solar radiation that comprises the weather data. Along with natural phenomenon as weather, physical aspects such as traffic flow are also considered. Based on the relationship, a prediction algorithm is applied to check if prediction error decreases when such external factors are considered. Electricity consumption data is collected from the City of Tallahassee utilities. Traffic count is provided by the Florida Department of Transportation. Moreover, the weather data is obtained from Tallahassee regional Airport weather station. This paper aims to study and establish a cause and effect relationship between the mentioned variables using different causality models and to forecast load based on the external variables. Based on the relationship, a prediction algorithm is applied to check if prediction error decreases when such external factors are considered.	[Madhavi, Lalitha K.

A Continuous Deviation-Flow Location Problem for an Alternative-Fuel Refueling Station on a Tree-Like Transportation Network	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article							MODEL; INFRASTRUCTURE; FACILITIES	Due to the increasing popularity of alternative-fuel (AF) vehicles in the last two decades, several models and solution techniques have been recently published in the literature to solve AF refueling station location problems. These problems can be classified depending on the set of candidate sites: when a (finite) set of candidate sites is predetermined, the problem is called discrete; when stations can be located anywhere along the network, the problem is called continuous. Most researchers have focused on the discrete version of the problem, but solutions to the discrete version are suboptimal to its continuous counterpart. This study addresses the continuous version of the problem for an AF refueling station on a tree-type transportation network when a portion of drivers are willing to deviate fromtheir preplanned simple paths to receive refueling service. A polynomial time solution approach is proposed to solve the problem. We first present a new algorithm that identifies all possible deviation options for each travel path. Then, an efficient algorithm is used to determine the set of optimal locations for the refueling station that maximizes the total traffic flow covered. A numerical example is solved to illustrate the proposed solution approach.

This paper presents a fixed point learning based intelligence traffic network control system. The system applies convergence property of fixed point theorem to optimize the traffic flow density. The intelligence traffic control system achieves maximum road resources usage by averaging traffic flow density among the traffic network. The intelligence traffic network control system is built based on decentralized structure and intelligence cooperation. No central control is needed to manage the system. The proposed system is simple, effective and feasible for practical use. The performance of the system is tested via theoretical proof and simulations. The results demonstrate that the system can effectively solve the traffic congestion problem and increase the vehicles average speed. It also proves that the system is flexible, reliable and feasible for practical use.

Some social policies can potentially be helpful to alleviate traffic congestion and help people maintain a healthy work-life balance. In this initial model, we study the impact of flexi-time work arrangement and the construction of a new bypass on average daily commute time and CO2 emissions. We find that both flexi-time scheme and the new bypass will effectively reduce average daily commute time. Introducing a 30-min flexi-time range will reduce daily commute time by 6.5 min on average. However, further increasing flexi-time range will produce smaller saving in commute time. The new bypass will also reduce daily commute time, but only by one minute on average. As for environmental impact, introducing a 30-min flexi-time range will decrease CO2 emissions by 7%. Not only that, it also flattens the peak emission at rush hour. The bypass, on the other hand, will increase CO2 emissions by roughly 2 %.

The executed analysis of methods for quality assessment of passenger transportation service by urban transport has shown that it is expedient to use complex indices for such assessment. The existing methods for quality assessment of urban passenger transport do not fully take into account subjective passengers' evaluation of service quality criteria. The investigations conducted with the purpose to estimate significance of quality assessment criteria pertaining to urban passenger transport operation for passengers have made it possible to formalize importance of the given significance. A complex index of urban passenger transport quality has been prepared that includes such isolated quality indicators as pedestrian motion component, waiting time, travel time, dynamic factor of capacity usage. It has been determined that it is possible to plan quality of passenger transportation while using transport process simulation. Influence of technological parameters on quality parameters can be determined with the help of the developed simulation model for quality assessment of transportation process on route of urban passenger transport. While using the simulation model regularities in changing a complex quality index of urban passenger transport have been analyzed according to number of transport facilities operating on route. Simulation results have shown that changes in number of transport facilities significantly exert an influence on the value of dynamic factor of transport facility capacity usage, waiting time for transport facility and time travel. This leads to changes in quality of transportation process. Analysis of the obtained results has permitted to make a conclusion that every route with certain parameters has such rational number of transport facilities that ensures maximum efficiency of urban passenger transport with appropriate quality. It has been revealed that any change in number of transport facilities is described with a reasonable degree of accuracy by a nonlinear regression equation where parameters of transport facilities, passenger traffic flows and route are used as independent variables.

Evaluation of Transport Flow Efficiency on the Basis of Traffic Movement Data	SCIENCE & TECHNIQUE			Russian	Article						transport facility; navigation system; mathematical model for evaluation of transport flows		The paper considers a method for evaluation of transport flow parameters and determine an efficiency of variants concerning organization of traffic movement and provision of qualitative transportation. A method for evaluation of main traffic flow parameters while using a two-fluid mathematical model of Herman - Prigogine has been developed and it is based on passive processing of navigation data for road transport facilities on highways and urban road and street networks. The main advantages and novelty of the method (in contrast with the traditional usage of a mathematical model of Herman - Prigogine on the basis of active processing of navigation data) are the following: a passive treatment of GPS-tracks and support of their formats that make it possible significantly improve quality and adequacy of the model results; cloud computing (usage of cloud storage for storing large bulk of data); presence of client mobile application for Android operating system which is used for data collection in addition to operation with already collected navigation data from navigation and information center and other sources; application for calculation and processing of modern web technologies; scalability and configurability of the system. Efficiency of the proposed algorithms, mathematical models for evaluation of transport flow parameters and system as a whole have been proved in the process of their approbation while using a set of tracks on main highways of Belarus.

In its first part the traffic flow is described as a Markov chain of joint states consisting of a combination of trucks/buses (TB) and personal cars (PC) from adjoining lanes. The heat release rate is then taken for a measure of the fire power. The intensity lambda(f) reflecting the frequency of fires was assessed based on extensive studies carried out in Austria [1] and Italy [2, 3]. The traffic density AADT, the length of the tunnel L, the percentage of TBs, and the number of lanes are the remaining parameters characterizing the traffic flow. In the second part, a special combination of models originally proposed by Bazant and Thonguthai [4], and Kunzel & Kiessl [5] for the description of transport processes in concrete at very high temperatures creates a basis for the prediction of the thickness of the spalling zone and the volume of concrete degraded by temperatures that exceed a certain temperature level. The model was validated against a macroscopic test on concrete samples placed into the furnace.

This paper describes a method of map matching based on grid index, which is used to quickly get the closest K candidate sections to improve the speed of map matching. When establishing the grid index, with characteristics of road network, this method can establish index for reference point, reduce the search space, and reduce redundancy of the storage. When selecting candidate sections, integrating the similarity between distance and direction, the distance is calculated by Helen formula, the method can avoid projection of track point to section and reduce the computation complexity. The experiment uses large datasets, which are respectively tested in the capability to resist noise, network adaptability, running speed, etc. The results show that when the elected candidate section K is 10, compared with the ground truth, the accuracy is over 99%, in Beijing datasets, compared with matching speed of a single track point and classical methods, the average is promoted 5000 times.

This compound control is a combination of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller and credit assignment cerebellar model articulation controller (CACMAC). Firstly, a cell transmission model (CTM) is formulated, which is an advanced technology means for simulating highway dynamic traffic flow. Then, CMAC (cerebellar model articulation controller)-PID composite control and CACMAC-PID composite control are investigated. CACMAC uses a credit assignment CMAC learning algorithm to raise learning efficiency and to attain the expected accuracy quickly. Highway density control is realized by using feedforward control and nonlinear feedback control, as well as by integrating the CTM. Finally, system simulation is carried out by two different traffic situations. The results show that CACMAC-PID composite control has superior density tracking effect and stronger interference suppression capability compare to CMAC-PID control. The composite control can eliminate highway traffic congestion quickly. Obviously, the proposed compound control approach is especially suitable for highway density control.

The traffic condition cannot be accurately expressed when the road is congested. The concept of Link Capacity was proposed in the paper, and the Link Capacity calculation model was established according to Traffic Wave Theory. All influences on Link Capacity were analyzed and ranked in impact. Traffic can be pre-controlled in order of the volume of downstream intersection, the speed of passing through the link, the length of the link, the time of passing through the downstream intersection, the speed of passing through the downstream intersection, and the optimal pre-control method of the link congestion without building more roads is proposed.

Principal scope is to develop a tool to be used by decision-makers to evaluate the necessity of introducing a new crosswalk and/or switching to a traffic light and estimate the potential benefits of such a measure in terms of Level of Service. The model is based on empirical evidence gained during an observation of a non-signalized crosswalk. Pedestrian motion is simulated using a Cellular Automata model which is capable to simulate pedestrian dynamics at low density conditions, as observed in the considered scenario. Vehicles use a continuous car following model inspired on Gipps equations in which driver's reaction time is considered. Pedestrian's decision-making process on crossing attempt and model parameters are directly obtained from the analysis of pedestrian-vehicle interactions observed in reality. The model developed employs small time steps, thus allowing the consideration of different pedestrian speeds (intrinsically considering pedestrians with reduced mobility, such as elderlies) and smoothly reproducing car-pedestrian interactions. This aspect required the definition of distinct behavioral rules for vehicles and pedestrians that, in their dynamic interaction, implement an ad-hoc coordination model. In order to validate the model, delays (or waiting times) measured for both pedestrians and drivers were compared with simulated values. Results show a good agreement between empirically obtained time delay and values computed in the simulation.

A reversible lane scheme selection model, which based on the BPR function, was formulated with decision variable of the number of reversible lanes and based on smallest energy consumption and emission costs with the consideration of delay, as well as solution algorithm. The influence of delay reversible lane scheme selection and energy consumption and emission costs were considered in the formulation of model. Using Ronghua Road as a case with simulation software VISSIM, model was verified and the environmental benefits of reversible lane scheme was discussed. The feasibility of model was verified by comparing the results between model calculation and simulation, and the reasonable scheme of reversible lane was calculated. The simulation results show that the delay has been reduced by 25.3s, and the costs of energy consumption and emission have been reduced by 44.6% after the implementation of reversible lane scheme considering environmental benefits. It also certifies that not only the delay is reduced but also the energy consumption and emission costs are reduced after the implementation of reversible lane scheme. Thus the environmental benefits are made.

On-site investigations of the structure and intensity of the traffic flow on the main thoroughfares of Naberezhnye Chelny were conducted. Based on the obtained data, a summary calculation of 143 pollutantswas carried out, taking into account those, included in 28 summation groups; maps of distribution of air pollution level throughout the city were drawn and analyzed for each substance, first-ever for Naberezhnye Chelny. Based on the results of calculation of pollutants dispersion, a forecast was made for the concentrations of pollutants in the residential area of the city. The substances and summation groups, for which maximum permissible concentration is likely to be exceeded (carbonic oxide, nitrogen dioxide and the summation groups, formed by these substances) were detected. Along major automobile highways and interchanges, the zones with expected values of maximum surface concentrations of more than 1 MPC were observed for carbonic oxide. To estimate the relative share of emissions from stationary and mobile sources, the calculation was carried out, without taking into account the vehicles and enterprises of the motor transport complex. It was found, that the calculated emissions of carbon oxide and nitrogen dioxide by stationary sources, in comparison with mobile sources, are not so significant and cause no more than 0.1 MPC. By the nature of spatial distribution, two distinctly different groups of pollutants were defined: mainly contained in emissions of industrial enterprises, and coming into the atmospheric air, mainly with emissions from automotive transport.

The traffic flow dynamics is described with the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model with Newell-Daganzo flux function. We aim at minimizing the L-2 quadratic error to a desired outflow, given an inflow on a single road. We first provide existence of a minimizer and compute analytically the cost functional variations due to needle-like variation in the control policy. Then, we compare three strategies: instantaneous policy; random exploration of control space; steepest descent using numerical expression of gradient.

Traffic congestion causes chaos on the road and interruption to daily activities of users. Time consumed on road give lots of negative effects on productivity, social behavior, environmental and cost to economy. Congestion is worsens and leads to havoc during the emergency such as flood, accidents, road maintenance and etc., where behavior of traffic flow is always unpredictable and uncontrollable. Real-time and historical traffic data are critical inputs for most traffic flow analysis applications. Researcher attempt to predict traffic using simulations as there is no exact model of traffic flow exists due to its high complexity. Open Traffic is an open source platform available for traffic data analysis linked to Open Street Map (OSM). This research is aimed to study and understand the Open Traffic platform. The real-time traffic flow pattern in Kuala Lumpur area was successfully been extracted and analyzed using Open Traffic. It was observed that the congestion occurs on every major road in Kuala Lumpur and most of it owes to the offices and the economic and commercial centers during rush hours. At some roads the congestion occurs at night due to the tourism activities.

The resilience of a highway system subjected to various hazards depends on not only post-hazard integrity of infrastructure, but also safe and smooth movements of vehicles through the system during and immediately following hazards. To rationally predict the post-hazard performance of a highway system including both structural integrity and traffic functionality, an advanced traffic flow simulation tool of a highway system under hazardous conditions is needed. A new cellular automaton (CA)-based traffic flow simulation framework is developed for the traffic flow simulation on a typical highway system including a long-span bridge under hazardous conditions by incorporating limited deceleration rate, anticipation effect, realistic vehicle properties, and different driving behaviors. A demonstrative study is carried out with the proposed framework to investigate the traffic flow characteristics and potential impacts on both infrastructure performance and vehicle safety.

The key feature of the approach is the combination of the intellectual multi-agent simulation method and the virtual reconstruction of the road scene based on the data from various on-board informational subsystems (mainly from the technical vision subsystem). The data received from the on-board subsystems in real time mode is used for the virtual reconstruction of the current road scene, which is displayed in the three-level multi-agent simulation model developed by the authors. The lower level of the model is of the outmost interest, as it reflects a multitude of functioning intellectual agents. The agents in the model, being in constant cooperation with each other, make individual decisions about their movement regime based on the intellectual analysis of the combined data about the traffic flow, and taking into account their objective functions. The suggested model allows conducting virtual monitoring of various types of moving objects in the road scene, which have gone out of the technical vision field due to some reasons. This, enables better analysis of the road scene and anticipates possible road safety risks. For road safety risk assessment, the model makes a prognosis for the traffic situation development and evaluates the safety indicators in the real-time mode. Data collection on the multitude of the scenarios of simulated traffic situation development is conducted in the form of traffic situation - behavioral decision. The collected data is processed using methods of intellectual data analysis to evaluate the compliance of the chosen behavior with the road safety standards. As a result of the analysis, a database of the situational rules for the behavioral decisions is formed.

To find an appropriate time to carry out maintenance work, a freeway maintenance model based on Nagel-Schreckenberg (NaSch) model is proposed in this study. It includes three submodels: the model under normal traffic conditions, the maintenance model for the carriageway and the maintenance model for the overtaking lane. Vehicle types and driver characteristics influence the traffic flux in the freeway traffic system, so we analyze their relationship based on our simulation data. According to the results, if carriageway is in maintenance, the constructors had better not maintain the lane when the density is 0.1-0.2 and the proportion of large type vehicle is 0.4. For the maintenance of overtaking lane, the maintenance should be avoided when the density is 0.25 and the proportion of large type vehicle is small.

The gradually proven automatic driving technique fastens the participation of Automatic Vehicles (AV) in real traffic system, and changes the environment, objective characteristics and possible methods of traffic control. This paper established a mathematical model of continuous traffic flow under two kinds of rules in simulation technologies according to improved cellular automata theory, and analyzed the performance of two kinds of rules through reasonable assumptions and simplifications and taking into account the efficiency, safety and applicability. In addition, this research analyzed the impact of automatic vehicles on the performance through assigning a zero value and used randomization deceleration probability to describe the uncertainty psychological factors of drivers and drivers' reaction time. This research found that within the impact of automated driving environment, continuous traffic flow will have higher efficiency and safety by adopting the fast and slow lanes classification rule.

Progress on defense strategies such as removing permanently flux after the initial failure has been made. This paper proposes a new method considering the dynamical flux removal at each time step to mitigate the cascading failure. Results on both scale-free network model and real transportation networks such as Oldenburg road network and California road network reveal that the dynamical flux removal is superior to the static flux removal strategy, where there exists an optimal removal fraction. This method may be helpful for designing the self-healing mechanism for the future intelligent transportation systems.

J	Uchida, K; Kato, T				Uchida, Kenetsu; Kato, Teppei			A Simplified Network Model for Travel Time Reliability Analysis in a Road Network	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article							TRAFFIC EQUILIBRIUM PROBLEM; CAPACITY RELIABILITY; ALGORITHMS; DEMAND; ASSIGNMENT; VARIANCE; COSTS	This paper proposes a simplified network model which analyzes travel time reliability in a road network. A risk-averse driver is assumed in the simplified model. The risk-averse driver chooses a path by taking into account both a path travel time variance and a mean path travel time. The uncertainty addressed in this model is that of traffic flows (i.e., stochastic demand flows). In the simplified network model, the path travel time variance is not calculated by considering all travel time covariance between two links in the network. The path travel time variance is calculated by considering all travel time covariance between two adjacent links in the network. Numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate the applicability and validity of the proposed model. The experiments introduce the path choice behavior of a risk-neutral driver and several types of risk-averse drivers. It is shown that the mean link flows calculated by introducing the risk-neutral driver differ as a whole from those calculated by introducing several types of risk-averse drivers. It is also shown that the mean link flows calculated by the simplified network model are almost the same as the flows calculated by using the exact path travel time variance.

J	Chavis, C; Christofa, E				Chavis, Celeste; Christofa, Eleni			A real-time signal control strategy for mitigating the impact of bus stops at urban signalized intersections	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						bus stops; kinematic wave theory; real-time signal control; signalized intersection capacity	KINEMATIC WAVES; TRAFFIC FLOW; OPTIMIZATION; ARTERIALS; CAPACITY	Buses stopping at transit stops reduce the capacity of signalized intersections, which can lead to excessive delays for all users. In order to avoid such phenomena, signal control strategies can be utilized. This article presents a real-time signal control strategy to mitigate the impact of bus stop operations on traffic operations along an undersaturated approach. The objective of the proposed strategy is to ensure that any residual queues due to a bus stopping are fully dissipated as soon as possible by increasing the green time for the bus stop approach as soon as the bus departs. In addition, this strategy ensures that the cross-street approaches do not become oversaturated. Kinematic wave theory is utilized to track the formation and dissipation of queues and determine the green extension (or red truncation) for the subject approach. The benefits achieved from the proposed strategy are illustrated through simulation tests at a single intersection for a variety of bus stop and bus operation characteristics. Average delay and average queue length for the bus stop and cross-street approaches, as well as for the whole intersection, are used to assess the performance of the strategy. The tests performed indicate that the signal control strategy can achieve substantial reductions in delay for the bus stop approaches and the intersection as a whole without adversely affecting the cross street operations, when the demand at those cross streets is low.

The sky-rocket number of autos, especially those private ones, has made traffic congestion and car accidents a significant problem Although people are eager to know the real-time road conditions, this is not supported by traditional traffic control system and thus Intelligent Traffic Control System cries out to address these issues Intelligent Traffic Control System serves as the frontier research subject in China and capturing concerns from both the academic field and society for the meantime data Innovation has witnessed the significant and remarkable changes in Information technology. This paper designs a brand new Intelligent Traffic Control System Model based on CDA and Data Innovation-driven; the main functions of the system consist of data acquirement, data analysis and dada driven process in both macro and micro layers. An Empirical Study has followed up to check the effects of this model by the case study of Canton City in transportation system. A positive statistical result has obtained, confirming the positive effect of this model. The results have shown a high practicability and reliability in practical use. With the data acquired, collected and innovatively-driven by monitors installed and decoded in intersections and sub-sections, different road conditions are discriminated, calculated and shown in diverse modes on the controlling layer to allocate efficient paths/routes to avoid the traffic congestion; meanwhile this model renders a guideline for a traffic authority to make decisions on traffic control.

In the meantime, I take the accident prevention, heavy traffic and the throughput of the toll plaza into consideration. After that, I present the emergency area and portable toll collector in order to deal with emergency situations. Moreover, I analyze the traffic flow in various periods every day, after which I we get the scheme of mixed lanes. Then I get the distribution of toll plaza.

A GENERIC MODEL FOR CAMERA BASED INTELLIGENT ROAD CROWD CONTROL	JOURNAL OF FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED SCIENCES			English	Article						surveillance; traffic flow; network; vehicles		Traffic flow control is often a big problem in many big cities in the world, especially during the peak and off-peak hours. Researchers are trying to find the optimal solution to solve this daily problem. Often, the problem is caused by the poor traffic signal light control system. Improper placement of the signal light and timing is the main issue. The problem can be solved by proper time management for the traffic signal through the congested and often over crowded areas. This research proposes a model for intelligent traffic flow control by implementing camera based surveillance and feedback system. A series of cameras are set minimum three signals ahead from the target junction. The complete software system is developed to help integrating the multiple camera on road as feedback to the signal light control systems.	[Zaman, F.

In spite of increasing the size of transportation systems and prompting the public transportation may increase the traffic overflow. This kind of traffic overflow problem cannot be solved manually. Today the traffic data has been entered and erupted the time of huge transportation of the data. Hence it is important to predict the traffic information on the accurate and timeline based, for forming the successful Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). In the existing system, the forecasting of traffic flow is depend on the short term of spectral analysis [3] with the small amount of data. This paper focuses on predicting the traffic flow of taxes traveling from multiple sources to the destination on basis of Nearest Neighbor (NN) approach on a Hadoop platform. The performance of the proposed algorithm is measured using metrics like MAPE, RMSE, MAE, and ME. The result shows that the proposed algorithm gives the better accuracy than the existing approach on a Hadoop platform.

Modern highways play a vital role in increasing the agglomeration benefits of commuters by reducing the travel time, emission levels, fuel consumption, travel fatigue, etc. With the recent progresses on intelligent transport systems (ITS) and vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET), new revolutionizing highway transportation solution proposals are getting released at rapid pace. Vehicular platooning is an emerging research area which tackles common traffic problems via cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) techniques by keeping minimal inter vehicular distances using autonomous methods. In this paper, we select the Southern Expressway (E01 Expressway) located in Sri Lanka as our study region and propose a cooperative vehicle platooning solution which performs better on selected comparison parameters than the noncooperative methods. Since experimenting our solution directly on real traffic environments will introduce significant disturbances in usual traffic flow, we have followed the simulation procedure for evaluations. For our study, we have used PLEXE an open source simulation framework which extends VEINS vehicular network simulator and SUMO microscopic traffic simulator features. We have evaluated our solution using synthetic traffic data forming a platoon cluster of vehicles.	[Rakkesh, S. T.; Weerasinghe, A. R.; Ranasinghe, R. A.

To the best of our knowledge, none of the previous research considered using on-road taxicabs as mobile video surveillance cameras and road traffic flow patterns, therefore not suitable for recovering trajectories of vehicles. With this insight, we model the travel time-cost of a road segment during various time periods precisely with LNDs (Logarithmic Normal Distributions), then use LSNDs (Log Skew Normal Distributions) to approximate the time-cost of an urban trip during various time periods. We propose an approach to calculate possible location and time distribution of the vehicle, select the taxicab to verify the distribution by uploading and checking video clips of this taxicab, finally refine the restoring trajectory in a recursive manner.

Therefore, information of traffic flow, covering frequencies and vehicle weights, is of crucial importance for the calculation of fatigue damage and the prediction of the bridge lifetime. This paper investigates accuracy of fatigue life estimates depending on a length of traffic flow records. The presented data were obtained from the measurements carried out on a bridge of the Prague Highway Ring. The analysis reveals that the optimal length of records for fatigue life assessment is about 30 days.

JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article							ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; CONTROL-SYSTEMS; TIME; STABILITY; POLICY	With low-level vehicle automation already available, there is a necessity to estimate its effects on traffic flow, especially if these could be negative. Along gradual transition will occur from manual driving to automated driving, in which many yet unknown traffic flow dynamics will be present. These effects have the potential to increasingly aid or cripple current road networks. In this contribution, we investigate these effects using an empirically calibrated and validated simulation experiment, backed up with findings from literature. We found that low-level automated vehicles in mixed traffic will initially have a small negative effect on traffic flow and road capacities. The experiment further showed that any improvement in traffic flow will only be seen at penetration rates above 70%. Also, the capacity drop appeared to be slightly higher with the presence of low-level automated vehicles. The experiment further investigated the effect of bottleneck severity and truck shares on traffic flow. Improvements to current traffic models are recommended and should include a greater detail and understanding of driver-vehicle interaction, both in conventional and in mixed traffic flow. Further research into behavioural shifts in driving is also recommended due to limited data and knowledge of these dynamics.	[Calvert, S. C.; Schakel, W. J.; van Lint, J. W.

This study investigates the effect of the location of BEVs public charging facilities on a network with mixed conventional gasoline vehicles (GVs) and BEVs. These two types of vehicles are distinguished from each other in terms of travel cost composition and distance limit. A bilevel model is developed to address this problem. In the upper level, the objective is to maximize coverage of BEV flows by locating a given number of charging stations on road segments considering budget constraints. A mixed-integer nonlinear program is proposed to formulate this model. A simple equilibrium-based heuristic algorithm is developed to obtain the solution. Finally, two numerical tests are presented to demonstrate applicability of the proposedmodel and feasibility and effectiveness of the solution algorithm. The results demonstrate that the equilibrium traffic flows are affected by charging speed, range limit, and charging facilities' utility and that BEV drivers incline to choose the route with charging stations and less charging time.

J	Liu, YZX; Guo, JQ; Taplin, J; Wang, YB				Liu, Yangzexi; Guo, Jingqiu; Taplin, John; Wang, Yibing			Characteristic Analysis of Mixed Traffic Flow of Regular and Autonomous Vehicles Using Cellular Automata	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article							FUNDAMENTAL DIAGRAM; TRAJECTORY DESIGN; MODEL	The technology of autonomous vehicles is expected to revolutionize the operation of road transport systems. The penetration rate of autonomous vehicles will be low at the early stage of their deployment. It is a challenge to explore the effects of autonomous vehicles and their penetration on heterogeneous traffic flow dynamics. This paper aims to investigate this issue. An improved cellular automaton was employed as the modeling platform for our study. In particular, two sets of rules for lane changing were designed to address mild and aggressive lane changing behavior. With extensive simulation studies, we obtained some promising results. First, the introduction of autonomous vehicles to road traffic could considerably improve traffic flow, particularly the road capacity and free-flow speed. And the level of improvement increases with the penetration rate. Second, the lane-changing frequency between neighboring lanes evolves with traffic density along a fundamental-diagram-like curve. Third, the impacts of autonomous vehicles on the collective traffic flow characteristics are mainly related to their smart maneuvers in lane changing and car following, and it seems that the car-following impact is more pronounced.

However, when bicycle flow is large, extensive passing maneuvers could occupy vehicle lanes and thus cause interferences to vehicle traffic. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate how bicycle traffic affects vehicle operation on urban streets with bike lanes. Data were collected on six street segments in Nanjing, China. The cumulative curves were constructed to extract traffic flow information including individual bicycle and vehicle speeds and aggregated traffic parameters such as flow and density. The results showed that as bicycle density on bike lanes continuously increases faster bicycles may run into vehicle lanes causing considerable reductions in vehicle speeds. A generalized linear model was estimated to predict the vehicle delay. Results showed that vehicle delay increases as bicycle flow and vehicle flow increase. Number of vehicle lanes and width of bike lane also have significant impact on vehicle delay. Findings of the study are helpful to regions around the world in bike infrastructure design in order to improve operations of both bicycles and vehicles.

THE USE OF SIMULATION MODELING IN TRAFFIC FLOW MANAGEMENT	JOURNAL OF FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED SCIENCES			English	Article						Estimated complex index of the atmospherepollution; emissions from motor transport; sampling; maximum-permissible concentration; imitative modeling	INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS	The problem of ensuring motor transportation complex ecological safety is reduced to optimizing thesystem parameters by generalized criterion for which the estimated complex atmosphere pollution index (ECAPI) stands, being the ecological indicator of the air basin quality. On the basis of ECAPI classification which allows determining the admissible level of ecological danger within the "motor traffic flow of the industrial citystreet"system is developed. The traffic flow management in the industrial city is within such area where carrying out a natural experiment is difficult or impossible, andimitative modeling becomes the only instrument for effective decision-making. One of the main advantages of this method is that unlike analytical one the imitative modeling allows to reproduce repeatedly the "motor traffic flow-street of the industrial city"system and to define its optimum state characterized by ECAPIcriterion. Thus, the studied system imitative modelcreation, on the basis of the scientific analysis of the obtained statistical, estimated and experimental information, will allow predictingecological situation on roads of the Naberezhnye Chelny. Developing the imitative model for "motor traffic flow-street of the industrial city"systems and experiment on model include three stages: 1) forming the imitative model "motor traffic flow-street of the industrial city" systems; 2) computer experiment with model; 3) ranging the actions for the traffic flow management by ecological efficiency on the basis of the imitative modelanalysis.

J	Liu, DW; Shi, ZK; Ai, WH				Liu, Dawei; Shi, Zhongke; Ai, Wenhuan			An Improved Car-Following Model Accounting for Impact of Strong Wind	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							LATTICE HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW; VELOCITY CHANGES; ANTICIPATION; TIME; STABILITY; VEHICLES; BEHAVIOR; ROAD; DYNAMICS	In order to investigate the effect of strong wind on dynamic characteristic of traffic flow, an improved car-following model based on the full velocity difference model is developed in this paper. Wind force is introduced as the influence factor of car-following behavior. Among three components of wind force, lift force and side force are taken into account. The linear stability analysis is carried out and the stability condition of the newly developed model is derived. Numerical analysis is made to explore the effect of strong wind on spatial-time evolution of a small perturbation. The results show that the strong wind can significantly affect the stability of traffic flow. Driving safety in strong wind is also studied by comparing the lateral force under different wind speeds with the side friction of vehicles.

This paper proposes selection mechanism by a parallel two-link network model. Through computer simulation, we get the conclusion that in the static state, just with the road choice mechanism, the relationship is that when the flow on the road increases monotonously, the driving time increases first and then decreases. Congestion appears at the turning point, the hypercongestion appears after the turning point. The computer simulation proves this new relationship between the travel time and traffic flow on the road indeed exists.

By analyzing the behavior process, the arrival distribution and the distribution model of the vehicles at the toll station, we get a reasonable number of conventional lanes, toll stations In the export confluence area, the traffic volume is large and the road is complex. Vehicles in accelerated lane will have a common merger behavior, it often causes the trunk line of traffic flowing disorder, reduces the traveling speed of traffic flow, causes the severe delay, and causes the traffic accident. So the confluence area is the accident-prone areas of the highway. Based on the research on the layout and design of toll station, we use the BP-neural network method to simulate the driver in the confluence of the highway entrance and line decision-making process. By comparing the capacity of the conventional toll plaza with the same conditions, and then comparing the results of the model forecast with the actual situation, the results are more consistent. Thus I obtain a more reasonable merging model.

According to the complexity of traffic flow, we adopt a revised cellular automation to establish corresponding simulation model, in which each vehicle is regarded as a cellular. As the position and speed of each vehicle in the traffic flow are all continual, we alter the conventional cellar space and adjacent zone. We propose and quantify the indexes, including traffic volume, safety and level of service (LOS) of the road to evaluate the performance of traffic rules, and the rationality of road speed limits is analyzed. The results of simulation show that safety and traffic volume are contradicted. Hereafter, we propose two methods to balance the two indexes and provide recommendations for the traffic administrative branches. Meanwhile, the simulation results show the weakness of low road occupancy in light traffic. In terms of the weakness, we propose a new rule, under which vehicles with different speeds travel on different lanes and the speed limits for different lanes are different. Simulation results show that only in light traffic this rule is efficient.

However, these two data processes gather data differently. The RTMS detects spot speeds at specific cross sections. The FCD system collects travel speed along a segment of a road link. Although the difference between time mean speed (TMS) and space mean speed (SMS) has been discussed for decades, the speed differences between RTMS and FCD have been underestimated in many engineering applications. This study examined the speed differences between the RTMS and FCD data on expressways in Beijing. First, the differences between the two data collections over 5 days were analyzed. The correlation between the difference and the value of the speeds was investigated. The relationships between TMS and SMS in existing studies were then compared with the relationship derived from the field data. It was found that the existing relationships between TMS and SMS were not valid for representing the relationship between the RTMS and FCD speeds. The flow-speed relationship from each data group was then investigated by using the Van Aerde traffic flow model; it was found that free-flow speed and speed at capacity determined on the basis of the RTMS data were significantly overestimated. It was inaccurate to apply the RTMS speed to the analysis of fundamental traffic flow diagrams. Finally, the repeatability and stability of the relationship between these two data groups were validated.

Analysis of the Effects of Connected-Automated Vehicle Technologies on Travel Demand	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; FRAMEWORK	Connected-automated vehicle (CAV) technologies are likely to have significant effects not only on how vehicles operate in the transportation system, but also on how individuals behave and use their vehicles. While many CAV technologies-such as connected adaptive cruise control and ecosignals-have the potential to increase network throughput and efficiency, many of these same technologies have a secondary effect of reducing driver burden, which can drive changes in travel behavior. Such changes in travel behavior-in effect, lowering the cost of drivinghave the potential to increase greatly the utilization of the transportation system with concurrent negative externalities, such as congestion, energy use, and emissions, working against the positive effects on the transportation system resulting from increased capacity. To date, few studies have analyzed the potential effects on CAV technologies from a systems perspective; studies often focus on gains and losses to an individual vehicle, at a single intersection, or along a corridor. However, travel demand and traffic flow constitute a complex, adaptive, nonlinear system. Therefore, in this study, an advanced transportation systems simulation model-POLARIS-was used. POLARIS includes cosimulation of travel behavior and traffic flow to study the potential effects of several CAV technologies at the regional level. Various technology penetration levels and changes in travel time sensitivity have been analyzed to determine a potential range of effects on vehicle miles traveled from various CAV technologies.

J	Hyun, K; Ritchie, SG				Hyun, Kyung (Kate); Ritchie, Stephen G.			Sensor Location Decision Model for Truck Flow Measurement	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							ALGORITHMS; MOVEMENT; NETWORKS	Timely and reliable truck activity data are of importance for transportation planning and investment analysis, traffic management, environmental and safety analyses, and operation and maintenance of infrastructure. Therefore, state and regional agencies have used various types of sensors to obtain truck flows. To measure accurate traffic flows with the use of sensors, considerable effort has been made to determine optimal sensor locations. The most common approach has been to focus on capturing the maximum number of origin-destinations (O-Ds) and routes at the sensor locations; this approach is referred to as the observability problem. However, when the long travel distances of trucks are considered, sensor locations that seek observability of O-Ds and routes may not acquire meaningful proportions of truck movements in a large-size truck network when budgets are limited. Therefore, this study provides a decision model that optimally locates sensors to capture the maximum O-D and route flow. A goal-programming approach with different weights that prioritize O-Ds or route flow, depending on a prior objective, was investigated. The proposed model was implemented in a real network in Los Angeles, California, with actual truck flow data obtained from sampled truck GPS trajectories. Results showed that significantly larger numbers of O-Ds and route flows were captured by the proposed flow-capturing model than with conventional observability approaches. In addition, trade-offs between O-D and route flow capturing depended on the applied weights and budgets. Particularly in the Los Angeles truck network, equally applied weight provided balanced capturing of O-D and route flow when sufficient numbers of sensors were located in the network. The proposed goal-programming approach can provide insights for researchers and practitioners for alternative sensor location solutions.

Despite autonomous vehicles' potential to enhance safety and to reduce congestion, energy consumption, and emissions, many studies suggest that the system-level effects will be minimal at low market penetration rates. Introducing reserved lanes for autonomous vehicles is one potential approach to address this limitation because these lanes increase autonomous vehicles' density. However, preventing regular vehicles from using specific lanes can significantly increase congestion in other lanes. Accordingly, this study explored the potential effects of reserving one lane for autonomous vehicles on traffic flow dynamics and travel time reliability. A two-lane hypothetical segment with an on-ramp and a four-lane highway segment in Chicago, Illinois, was simulated under different market penetration rates of autonomous vehicles. Three strategies were evaluated: (a) mandatory use of the reserved lane by autonomous vehicles, (b) optional use of the reserved lane by autonomous vehicles, and (c) limiting autonomous vehicles to operate autonomously in the reserved lane. Policies based on combinations of these strategies were simulated. It was found that optional use of the reserved lane without any limitation on the type of operation could improve congestion and could reduce the scatter in a fundamental diagram. Throughput analysis showed the potential benefit of reserving a lane for autonomous vehicles at market penetration rates of more than 50% for the two-lane highway and 30% for the four-lane highway. Travel time reliability analysis revealed that the optional use of the reserved lane was also significantly beneficial.

The strategy assumes that some vehicles equipped with vehicle automation and communication systems are capable of receiving and executing specific lane-changing orders or recommendations. From a previously proposed optimal control strategy based on a simplified multilane motorway traffic flow model and formulated as a linear quadratic regulator, a feedback control problem was designed. The aim was to maximize the throughput at bottleneck locations while distributing the total density at the bottleneck area over the lanes according to a given policy by optimal lane assignment of the vehicles upstream of the bottleneck. The feedback control decisions were based on real-time measurements of the traffic state and inflow. The proposed strategy was tested on a nonlinear first-order macroscopic multilane traffic flow model, which also accounted for the capacity drop phenomenon.

The toll-setting system incorporates models to predict both the vehicle arrival process upstream of the toll lane facility and drivers' choice whether to use the toll lanes as a function of the toll rate and travel times presented to drivers within the information system. A macroscopic traffic simulation model is used to predict the flow conditions within the prediction horizon. The travel times provided to users as information and the travel times predicted by the traffic flow model are iterated until consistency between them is obtained. The whole process is embedded within an optimization algorithm that sets tolls to optimize a given objective function. Several case studies demonstrate the use of this framework and its potential to provide useful toll settings.

Compared with previous research efforts with the pseudomulti-objective optimization process, this paper proposes an automated longitudinal control framework based on multiobjective optimization (MOOP) for CACC by taking into consideration four optimization objectives: mobility, safety, driver comfort, and fuel consumption. Of the target time headways that have been tested, the proposed CACC platoon control method achieved the best performance with 0.9-and 0.6-s target time headways. Compared with a non-optimization-based CACC, the MOOP CACC achieved 98%, 93%, 42%, and 33% objective value reductions of time headway deviation, unsafe condition, jitter, and instantaneous fuel consumption, respectively. In comparison with a single-objective-optimization-based approach, which optimized only one of the four proposed objectives, it was shown that the MOOP-based CACC maintained a good balance between all of the objective functions and achieved Pareto optimality for the entire platoon.

J	Li, XB; Khattak, AJ; Wali, B				Li, Xiaobing; Khattak, Asad J.; Wali, Behram			Role of Multiagency Response and On-Scene Times in Large-Scale Traffic Incidents	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							DURATION PREDICTION; TEXT ANALYSIS; MODELS	Traffic incidents, often known as nonrecurring events, impose enormous economic and social costs. Compared with short-duration incidents, large-scale incidents can substantially disrupt traffic flow by blocking lanes on highways for long periods. A careful examination of large-scale traffic incidents and associated factors can assist with actionable largescale incident management strategies. For such an analysis, a unique and comprehensive 5-year incident database on East Tennessee roadways was assembled to conduct an in-depth investigation of large-scale incidents, especially focusing on operational responses, that is, response and on-scene times by various agencies. Incidents longer than 120 min and blocking at least one lane were considered large scale; the database contained 890 incidents, which was about 0.69% of all reported incidents. Rigorous fixed-and random-parameter, hazard-based duration models were estimated to account for the possibility of unobserved heterogeneity in large-scale incidents. The modeling results reveal significant heterogeneity in associations between operational responses and large-scale incident durations. A 30-min increase in response time for the first, second, and third (or more) highway response units translated to a 2.8%, 1.6%, and 4.2% increase in large-scale incident durations, respectively. In addition, longer response times for towing and highway patrol were significantly associated with longer incident durations. Given large-scale incidents, associated factors included vehicle fire, unscheduled roadwork, weekdays, afternoon peaks, and traffic volume. Notably, the associations were heterogeneous; that is, the direction could be positive in some cases and negative in others. Practical implications of the results for large-scale incident management are discussed.

Long-Range Dependence of Traffic Flow and Speed of a Motorway Dynamics and Correlation with Historical Incidents	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							SELF-SIMILARITY; HURST EXPONENT; SAFETY; MARKETS; TIME	Speed and flow of vehicles tend to have several effects on the dynamics of a transport system. Fluctuations of these variables can implicate congestion, can lower predictability, and may even catalyze crashes. A concept of fractal theory called the Hurst exponent-a measure of the long-range dependence (LRD) of a time series-was used to understand the fluctuations in flow and speed of a motorway in Sydney, Australia. The spatial and temporal variation of the LRD for flow (H-flow) and speed (H-speed) at several monitor sites is discussed. Furthermore, the effects of number of lanes on flow and speed predictability are explored. It was observed that the flow predictability of two-lane sections was significantly lower when compared with three-lane and four-lane sections. Conversely, the speed predictability of four-lane sections was considerably higher than that of two-lane and three-lane sections. Finally, traffic congestion was defined with regard to the LRD of speed, and its correlation with historical incident rates was measured. It was ascertained that monitor sites with a historically high proportion of large Hspeed were correlated with unsafe locations. This study could lead to many applications of fractal analysis on highways and urban traffic.

Because of branching channels, the cyclical change of water levels, and sophisticated operating rules in many large bifurcated estuaries, it is often difficult to estimate the traffic capacity and simulate ships' motions, even though it is critically important for traffic management and efficiency. In recent years, the increasing number of ships that collect and contribute to the Automatic Identification System (AIS) have made it possible to monitor traffic flow along waterways, including bifurcated estuaries. This study developed a typical capacity estimation model based on ship domain theory. By using AIS data collected in the Yangtze River estuary, a typical bifurcated estuary system, the study analyzed various physical characteristics, weather conditions, and vessel characteristics to derive related impacts of each on overall capacity of the bifurcated estuary. Validated with practical observations, the method can be applied to similar estuary channel systems to improve waterway operations and management.

J	Claros, B; Zhu, ZY; Edara, P; Sun, C				Claros, Boris; Zhu, Zhongyuan; Edara, Praveen; Sun, Carlos			Design Guidance for J-Turns on Rural High-Speed Expressways	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Owing to the J-turn's safety effectiveness, it has become a viable alternative to replace high-crash, two-way, stop-controlled intersections on high-speed expressways. National guidance on the design of J-turns on high-speed highways is limited. What is the safety effect of spacing between the intersection and the U-turn? Under what circumstances is the provision of acceleration lanes recommended? This study answered these questions through a safety assessment on the basis of (a) an examination of crashes that occurred at 12 J-turn sites in Missouri and (b) a simulation-based assessment of the effect of various design variables and traffic flows. The crash review revealed the proportions of the five most frequently occurring crash types at J-turn sites: (a) major road sideswipe (31.6%), (b) major road rear-end (28.1%), (c) minor road rear-end (15.8%), (d) loss of control (14%), and (e) merging from U-turn (10.5%). The crash rates, accounting for exposure, decreased with the increase in the spacing to the U-turn for sideswipe and rear-end crashes; J-turns with a spacing of 1,500 ft or greater experienced the lowest crash rates. The crash rates were lower for J-turn sites with acceleration lanes for minor road traffic merging onto the major road than for sites without acceleration lanes. A calibrated simulation model analysis revealed that the presence of acceleration lanes reduced conflicts for all volumes and designs, including low volumes. The simulation analysis also reinforced the crash analysis results that safety improved with an increase in spacing between the main intersection and the U-turn.

Optimal Portfolio Strategy for Risk Management in Toll Road Forecasts and Investments	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							VEHICULAR TRAFFIC FLOW; PROJECTS	The study leveraged modern portfolio theory and stochastic time series models to develop a risk management strategy for future traffic projections along brownfield toll facilities. Uncertainty in future traffic forecasts may raise concerns about performance reliability and revenue potential. Historical time series traffic data from brownfield corridors were used for developing econometric forecast estimates, and Monte Carlo simulation was used to quantify a priori risks or variance to develop optimal forecasts by using mean-variance optimization strategies. Numerical analysis is presented with historical toll transactions along the Massachusetts Turnpike system. Suggested diversification strategies were found to achieve better long-term forecast efficiencies with improved trade-offs between anticipated risks and returns. Planner and agency forecast performance expectations and risk propensity are thus jointly captured.

The market share of automated vehicles is expected to increase and will greatly affect traffic flow characteristics. This paper focuses on the mixed traffic flow of manual and automated vehicles. The study improves the existing cellular automaton model to capture the differences between manual vehicles and automated vehicles. Computer simulations are employed to analyze the characteristic variations in the mixed traffic flow under different automated vehicle proportions, lane change probabilities, and reaction times. Several new conclusions are drawn in the paper. First, with the increment of the proportion of automated vehicles, freeway capacity increases; the capacity increment is more significant for single-lane traffic than for two-lane traffic. Second, for single-lane traffic flow, reducing the reaction time of the automated vehicle can significantly improve road traffic capacity-as much as doubling it-and reaction time reduction has no obvious effect on the capacity of the two-lane traffic. Third, with the proportion increment of automated vehicles, lane change frequency reduces significantly. Fourth, when the density is 15 < q < 55 vehicles/km, the addition of 20% automated vehicles to a traffic flow that consisted of only manual vehicles can decrease congestion by up to 16.7%.

J	Wang, L; Chen, FL; Yin, HM				Wang, Liang; Chen, Fangliang; Yin, Huiming			Mechanics-Based Acceleration Modeling of Multilane Traffic Flow	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							CAR-FOLLOWING MODELS; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; DRIVING BEHAVIOR; DYNAMICAL MODEL; SIMULATION; STATE; VEHICLES; SPEED	Inspired by the similarity between vehicle interactions and particle interactions, a mechanical system with force elements is introduced to simulate a vehicle's acceleration behavior in a multilane traffic flow. On the basis of Newton's second law of motion, a subject vehicle's longitudinal behavior is simulated with the interaction force induced by the neighboring vehicles and the driver's driving preference. Five important factors-(a) subject vehicle's speed, (b) acceleration sensitivity, (c) safety consideration, (d) relative speed sensitivity, and (e) gap-reducing desire-are considered; each is modeled by a force element. A recently developed data collection system is used to capture the testing driver's acceleration behavior; the model parameters are calibrated with the traveler's driving behavior. To demonstrate the present model, a microscopic simulation program was developed with MATLAB. The simulated trajectories not only describe a driver's acceleration behavior in common scenarios but also accurately present complex, high-order behavior during multi-faceted scenarios, such as lane changing or lead gap changing. The present model can be applied to single-lane and multilane car-following scenarios with the same algorithm.

Based on literature reviews and empirical research, it has been proved that the PCE value for all vehicle classes is directly correlated with the road gradient. The PCE values in free flow conditions have been determined for the approved vehicle classes. Based on the measured values, models for determining the average PCE value depending on the upward grade on two-lane roads have been developed. Comparison of the developed models in conditions of free traffic flow with the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) models has shown lower PCE values in this research. Models for the percentage of PCE values PCE15%, PCE50% and PCE85% have also been established.

The increase of urban traffic flows leads directly to a rise of the externalities associated with motorized traffic. One of the major impacts is the atmospheric damage caused by pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles contributing to negative atmospheric phenomena, global warming and climate change. Traffic emissions pose a serious threat because although they do not cause large numbers of direct victims, serious consequences may arise in the long term which are both local and universal in character. In the present study the effects of the urban road networks' functional and traffic characteristics on traffic as well as on the produced emissions are investigated along selected road segments in the city of Thessaloniki, Greece. Towards this purpose, the road network was first categorized according to the road characteristics, based on in-situ surveys. Then, traffic volume and composition field measurements were conducted and the collected data were used for the CO2, CH4, N2O, NO and PM10 emission calculation due to motorized traffic using the COPERT4 emission estimation model. Finally, the findings are presented, evaluated and associated with the characteristics of each road category.

Excessive emissions and energy consumption are typically observed at traffic congested areas and around traffic signalized intersections. At those latter locations, vehicles are frequently subjected to long idling periods and deceleration/acceleration maneuvers due to the operation of the traffic lights. Thus, the characteristics of the traffic signals are a determinant regarding traffic flow and its impacts on the environment. Within the framework of the present research, the environmental impacts of actuated signals on an 11 km signalized arterial street that connects Thessaloniki's city center with the local airport and the eastern suburbs of the city are evaluated. The morning peak period of a typical weekday on this arterial has been simulated with the use of the traffic modelling software AIMSUN. Network-wide and section output statistics (i.e. fuel consumed, carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM)) are presented in this research.

A CONVEX FORMULATION OF TRAFFIC DYNAMICS ON TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS	SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						traffic modeling; networks; junction solver; convex optimization; traffic control	HAMILTON-JACOBI EQUATIONS; CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; KINEMATIC WAVES; CONSERVATION-LAWS; WELL-POSEDNESS; HIGHWAY; FLOW; JUNCTION	This article proposes a numerical scheme for computing the evolution of vehicular traffic on a road network over a finite time horizon. The traffic dynamics on each link is modeled by the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) partial differential equation (PDE), which is an equivalent form of the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards PDE. The main contribution of this article is the construction of a single convex optimization program which computes the traffic flow at a junction over a finite time horizon and decouples the PDEs on connecting links. Compared to discretization schemes which require the computation of all traffic states on a time-space grid, the proposed convex optimization approach computes the boundary flows at the junction using only the initial condition on links and the boundary conditions of the network. The computed boundary flows at the junction specify the boundary condition for the HJ PDE on connecting links, which then can be separately solved using an existing semi-explicit scheme for single link HJ PDE.

This paper presents a new hybrid Gaussian process regression (GPR) optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) for coping with the forecasting of the uncertain, nonlinear, and complex traffic flow for road tunnel. In this proposed coupling approach, the PSO algorithmis employed to overcome the disadvantages of too strong dependence of optimization effect on initial value and easy falling into local optimum of the traditional conjugate gradient algorithm and accurately search the optimal hyperparameters of the GPR method, and the GPR model simulates the internal uncertainties and dynamic feature of tunnel traffic flow. The predicted results indicate that the proposed PSO-GPR algorithm with different kernel function is able to predict traffic flow for road tunnel with a higher degree of accuracy. The PSO-GPR-CK is effective in boosting the forecasting accuracy in comparison with the single kernel function and is worth promoting in the field of traffic flow forecasting for road tunnel to improve the ventilation efficiency.

J	Shirazi, M; Geedipally, SR; Lord, D				Shirazi, Mohammadali; Geedipally, Srinivas Reddy; Lord, Dominique			A procedure to determine when safety performance functions should be recalibrated	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION SAFETY & SECURITY			English	Article						safety performance functions; Highway Safety Manual; recalibration guidelines; calibration factor	PREDICTIVE ACCIDENT MODELS; CALIBRATION FACTORS; METHODOLOGY	Crash prediction models or safety performance functions can be used for estimating the number of crashes and evaluating roadway safety. Developing a new model can be a difficult task and requires a significant amount of time and energy. To simplify the process, the Highway Safety Manual provides safety performance functions for conducting different types of safety analyses for several facilities. However, because data collected from a few selected states for a specific period of time were considered for fitting and validating these models, they are required to be calibrated to the conditions of the new jurisdiction, and as well need to be revisited for recalibration over time. Therefore, the analyst may need to know when or how often the models are recommended to be recalibrated. This article addresses this question and documents recommendations that are based on the general characteristics of data. The proposed procedure only requires (1) the total number of crashes, (2) the average traffic flow, and (3) the total segment length (or number of intersections) in the network. The method was validated with different empirical datasets collected in Texas and Michigan. The results show that the proposed procedure provides useful information about when recalibration is recommended.

The study addresses a gap in existing research by applying a Bayesian logistic regression and Geographic Information System (GIS) geospatial analysis to predict biorefinery site locations. A one-way trucking cost assuming a 128.8 km (80-mile) haul distance was estimated by the Biomass Site Assessment model. The "median family income," "timberland annual growth-to-removal ratio," and "transportation delays" were significant in determining mill location. Transportation delays that directly impacted the costs of trucking are presented. A logistic model with Bayesian inference was used to identify preferred site locations, and locations not preferential for a mill location. The model predicted that higher probability locations for smaller biomass mills (feedstock capacity, the size of sawmills) were in southern Alabama, southern Georgia, southeast Mississippi, southern Virginia, western Louisiana, western Arkansas, and eastern Texas. The higher probability locations for large capacity mills (feedstock capacity, the size for pulp and paper mills) were in southeastern Alabama, southern Georgia, central North Carolina, and the Mississippi Delta regions.

Indeed, the concept of smart city or city of future becomes a new paradigm for urban planning and management, it considered as a complex system made up of services, citizens and resources. On the other hand, ITS concept is implemented to deal with some problems as though traffic congestion, energy consumption and property damage and human losses caused by transport accidents. In this paper we propose an approach for urban traffic management in smart cities based on markov chains implementing all vanet's technology units to optimize traffic flow simultaneously with real time monitoring of vehicle in urban area from its starting point to the destination.

However, due to the limited space in city centers, it might be unfeasible to provide sufficient loading/unloading spots. As a result, this type of operations often interferes with traffic by occupying road space (e.g., illegal parking). In this study, a potential solution is investigated: Dynamic Delivery Parking Spots (DDPS). With this concept, based on the time-varying traffic demand, the area allowed for delivery parking changes over time in order to maximize delivery opportunities while reducing traffic disruptions. Using the hydrodynamic theory of traffic flow, we analyze the traffic discharging rate on an urban link with DDPS. In comparison to the situation without delivery parking, the results show that although DDPS occupy some space on a driving lane, it is possible to keep the delay at a local level, that is, without spreading to the network. In this paper, we provide a methodology for the DDPS design, so that the delivery requests can be satisfied while their negative impacts on traffic are reduced. A simulation study is used to validate the model and to estimate delay compared to real situations with illegal parking, showing that DDPS can reduce system's delay.

J	Guo, AX; Liu, ZL; Li, SC; Li, H				Guo, Anxin; Liu, Zhenliang; Li, Suchao; Li, Hui			Seismic performance assessment of highway bridge networks considering post-disaster traffic demand of a transportation system in emergency conditions	STRUCTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Highway bridge network; topological property; vulnerability analysis; traffic flow; post-disaster traffic; seismic performance	FRAGILITY CURVES; RISK-ASSESSMENT; EARTHQUAKE; MODEL; FUZZY	Highway bridge networks (HBN) are one of the critical components of a transportation system that supports the operation of modern society. The traffic-carrying capacity of a transportation system is essential for emergency responses in a catastrophic seismic hazard. In this article, a methodology is proposed to assess the regional seismic performance of HBN considering the post-disaster traffic demand of a transportation system in emergency conditions. First, the framework of the methodology is introduced. Then, topological properties and vulnerability analyses are conducted to understand the connectivity of the HBN and the traffic-carrying capacity of the damaged bridge networks. In addition, traffic flow analysis is employed to consider the traffic situation in an emergency condition. Then, the entropy-right method is adopted to integrate these factors and to assess the importance of each bridge link in an emergency condition. Last, the seismic performance of HBN is also evaluated considering the decrease in the traffic-carrying capacity and the increase in traffic cost after earthquake events. The methodology is demonstrated using a HBN located in San Jose, California.

One of the most concerned side effects is the safety problem under mixed traffic flow. In order to evaluate the safety performance of mixed traffic flow, numerous studies have been done to analyze the dispersion characteristics and influencing factors of driving speed. In present studies, the relationship between the dispersion of driving speed and traffic conflicts was revealed based on traffic conflict technology. In this paper, regression models were developed from aspects of speed dispersion and influencing factors to estimate the severity of conflicts under various traffic and road conditions. With the result of this paper, we can predict the road traffic conflict and take steps in advance. The results of the study would be of great value and help to the evaluation of traffic safety under mixed traffic flow.

J	Zhang, WL; Wang, NY; Nicholson, C				Zhang, Weili; Wang, Naiyu; Nicholson, Charles			Resilience-based post-disaster recovery strategies for road-bridge networks	STRUCTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Decision optimisation; network recovery; resilience; restoration schedule; transportation networks; uncertainty modelling	SEISMIC RESILIENCE; GENETIC ALGORITHM	This paper presents a novel resilience-based framework to optimise the scheduling of the post-disaster recovery actions for road-bridge transportation networks. The methodology systematically incorporates network topology, redundancy, traffic flow, damage level and available resources into the stochastic processes of network post-hazard recovery strategy optimisation. Two metrics are proposed for measuring rapidity and efficiency of the network recovery: total recovery time (TRT) and the skew of the recovery trajectory (SRT). The TRT is the time required for the network to be restored to its pre-hazard functionality level, while the SRT is a metric defined for the first time in this study to capture the characteristics of the recovery trajectory that relates to the efficiency of those restoration strategies considered. Based on this two-dimensional metric, a restoration scheduling method is proposed for optimal post-disaster recovery planning for bridge-road transportation networks. To illustrate the proposed methodology, a genetic algorithm is used to solve the restoration schedule optimisation problem for a hypothetical bridge network with 30 nodes and 37 bridges subjected to a scenario seismic event. A sensitivity study using this network illustrates the impact of the resourcefulness of a community and its time-dependent commitment of resources on the network recovery time and trajectory.

J	Du, B; Chien, S; Lee, J; Spasovic, L				Du, Bo; Chien, Steven; Lee, Joyoung; Spasovic, Lazar			Predicting Freeway Work Zone Delays and Costs with a Hybrid Machine-Learning Model	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK; TRAFFIC FLOW; CAPACITY; HIGHWAY; WAVES	A hybrid machine-learning model, integrating an artificial neural network (ANN) and a support vector machine (SVM) model, is developed to predict spatiotemporal delays, subject to road geometry, number of lane closures, and work zone duration in different periods of a day and in the days of a week. The model is very user friendly, allowing the least inputs from the users. With that the delays caused by a work zone on any location of a New Jersey freeway can be predicted. To this end, tremendous amounts of data from different sources were collected to establish the relationship between the model inputs and outputs. A comparative analysis was conducted, and results indicate that the proposed model outperforms others in terms of the least root mean square error (RMSE). The proposed hybridmodel can be used to calculate contractor penalty in terms of cost overruns as well as incentive reward schedule in case of early work competition. Additionally, it can assist work zone planners in determining the best start and end times of a work zone for developing and evaluating traffic mitigation and management plans.

Since the speed profile of the lookahead control may differ from that of the conventional vehicle, the structure of the traffic flow changes. The paper analyses the impact of vehicles applying look-ahead control strategy on the traffic flow. The analysis is performed by using the VISSIM traffic simulation software. In this simulation a highway section using real topographic data is also built in. In the paper the results of the simulation-based analysis are also illustrated.

These queues may appear randomly on a two-lane highway depending on geometry, traffic volumes, location and vehicle performance. For example, on the uphill side of a highway with relatively high AADT, a transient queue can rapidly grow behind a slow leading heavy vehicle. Aggressive drivers in the queue, losing patient of coasting along at a low speed, may make unsafe passing maneuver at occasions with limited passing sight distances in the presence of double-yellow centerline. Since passing sight distance may not be sufficient at many spots along a two-lane highway, installing a passing lane becomes necessary to relieve recurrent transient queues and avoid traffic collisions due to passing. The purpose of our study is to determine the passing segment length that is sufficiently long to dissipate the foreseeable traffic queues. Based on the criterion for dissipating a traffic queue behind a slow leading vehicle, we derive the passing length by integrating vehicle performance, driver characteristics, roadway geometry, traffic flow volume, and queue size into one realistic and analytic equation. All parameters introduced into this study can be adjusted for any highway project to fit anticipated design scenarios for enhancing traffic operational safety on two-lane highways. Interesting consequences from this study will be presented to showcase the usefulness of this multi-parameter framework. Practitioners can easily apply this framework to estimate or check the potential project scope and make long-lasting smart decisions for improving safety and operation and potentially reducing emissions on two-lane highways (C) 2017 The Authors.

The main goal of this article is to make a high-precision prediction on four kinds of merging behaviors at expressway on-ramp bottlenecks. Based on the videos of traffic flow at two on-ramp bottlenecks at Yan'an Expressway in Shanghai, 403 empirical samples are collected by extracting trajectories from merging vehicles, as well as each adjacent one using trajectory processing software. A learning-based support vector machine (SVM) approach is adopted to predict the various merging behaviors. Considering four merging behaviors have different degrees of merging risk and effect on the mainline traffic flow, three SVM models are established. To overcome the potential over-fitting problem, variance analysis is used to extract the key variables in each model. The results show that the SVM models perform well. The highest prediction accuracy in the binary classification models reaches up to nearly 90% followed by 80.10% in the multi-classification model. Besides, the results of SVM models are compared with several frequently used models, including discrete choice model, Bayesian network and classification and regression tree. It turns out that SVM achieves the best prediction results. The proposed method can be used for traffic simulation and real-time driver assistant system on future automated and connected vehicles.

The bottleneck phenomenon observed at sag sections on Japanese expressways is an example where the accumulation of driving behavior variability results in obvious capacity drop and probabilistically occurring breakdown. Conventional theoretic analysis on drivers' car-following behavior generally treats the variability as a random error around a standard behavior pattern, which is not sufficient to study the exact pattern and extent of the variability to provide any acceptable explanation to the probabilistic occurrence of breakdown as well as applicable solution to unify the behavior. Trajectory data from video processing provides a source for this research to analyze every single driver's follow-the-leader behavior pattern and extent of variability from a microscopic view as well as their impact on overall traffic flow condition. 875 time series profile of single drivers' behavior such as acceleration, speed, distance and road geometry is studied. The follow-the-leader behavior of every driver is fitted into a car-following model, where drivers decide their acceleration based on the speed difference, spacing with its leading vehicle, its own reaction delay time, target spacing as well as the road geometry. Reaction delay time and desired spacing are obtained for every driver through correlation analysis and regression. Other parameters are obtained with heuristic optimization algorithm. The car-following model is calibrated with objective function and performance indicators as well as simulation. The objective function and perform lance indicators are studied to ensure that the model and its parameters can reproduce car-following behavior well. The simulation is carried out to reproduce the probabilistic nature of traffic congestion occurrence at a bottleneck of sag section including the effect of vertical slope increase. It successfully reproduces the tendency that the congestion occurrence probability grows with traffic demand. Finally, the variability of car-following behavior in drivers at sag section is studied with car-following parameter distribution. The desired spacing parameters are jointly distributed. The vertical effect parameter has two peaks concentrating on the value range, which indicates that there are drivers who are not affected by the vertical grade while others are. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The influence of freeway traffic flow characteristics caused by different rainfall intensity was quantified through collecting the Hainan Province Eastern Freeway traffic flow and rainfall data. The speed and density distribution of microscopic parameters about freeway traffic flow under different rains was researched, and the highway two-regime speed density distribution traffic flow model under different rainfall weather conditions was calibrated. Besides, the weather influence coefficient that the rainfall intensity and visibility affect the freeway traffic flow model parameters was determined through regression analysis. The research indicates that it has an greater influence on the maximum highway volume and free flow speed as the rainfall intensity increases. Compared with the normal weather, the maximum flow rate decreases 15.7%, 19.1%,32.5% respectively and the free flow speed decreases 4.4%, 7.3%, 10.6% respectively because of light rain, moderate rain and heavy rain weather conditions. In the traffic flow model, the breakpoint density and the speed-intercept of traffic flow model are not obviously relevant with the rainfall intensity. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The effect of varying waiting times and time pressure was investigated in a mixed experimental design with 64 participants in a driving simulator. Besides accepting routes with longer distance, one third of participants also chose routes with longer travel times to avoid red light. Results can be used for road traffic control to guide drivers to less frequented roads without traffic lights which can improve overall traffic flow. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Rainfall however has a moderate effect of washing the pollution in the air as well. The literature has mostly concerned one of these two conflicting impacts, but they are better analyzed by simultaneous linear equations. The paper employs a path analysis to investigate the complex impact of rainfall on the air pollution on the road via the change in traffic flow.

J	El Hatri, C; Boumhidi, J				El Hatri, Chaimae; Boumhidi, Jaouad			Traffic management model for vehicle re-routing and traffic light control based on Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization	INTELLIGENT DECISION TECHNOLOGIES-NETHERLANDS			English	Article						Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO); multi-agent system (MAS); q-learning; traffic light control; vehicle re-routing; Simulator of Urban Mobility (SUMO); JAVA Agent Development Framework (JADE); Traffic Control Interface (TraCI)		In this paper, a novel traffic management model is presented, which simultaneously optimizes vehicle re-routing and traffic light control to alleviate traffic congestion and limit the effects of incidents on traffic flow based on Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) method. Once a congested road is predicted, our proposed Multi-Objective Traffic Light Control is then applied to optimize signal timing which takes the maximization of traffic flow on the edge where the incident takes place and the minimization of the average junction waiting time as two objectives. To improve the performance and sensitivity of MOPSO algorithm, we used Q-Learning algorithm to grant to each agent of the swarm the ability of selecting appropriate MOPSO parameters adapted to the structure of the problem. At the same time, when the situation of the traffic flow starts to become more serious, we adopt a novel Multi-Objective Vehicle Re-routing strategy for assigning alternatives routes to cars before entering the congested road, in order to perform dynamic load balancing. Vehicle re- routing is also optimized by MOPSO to simultaneously find the shortest and least popular path. The obtained results from the simulation using SUMO, a well-known microscopic traffic simulator, confirm the efficiency of the proposed system.

J	Wang, D; Qiao, WX; Shao, CF				Wang, Ding; Qiao, Wenxin; Shao, Chunfu			Relieving the Impact of Transit Signal Priority on Passenger Cars through a Bilevel Model	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article								Transit signal priority (TSP) is an effective control strategy to improve transit operations on the urban network. However, the TSP may sacrifice the right-of-way of vehicles from side streets which have only few transit vehicles; therefore, how to minimize the negative impact of TSP strategy on the side streets is an important issue to be addressed. Concerning the typical mixed-traffic flow pattern and heavy transit volume in China, a bilevel model is proposed in this paper: the upper-level model focused on minimizing the vehicle delay in the nonpriority direction while ensuring acceptable delay variation in transit priority direction, and the lower-level model aimed at minimizing the average passenger delay in the entire intersection. The parameters which will affect the efficiency of the bilevel model have been analyzed based on a hypothetical intersection. Finally, a real-world intersection has been studied, and the average vehicle delay in the nonpriority direction decreased 11.28 s and 22.54 s (under different delay variation constraint) compared to the models that only minimize average passenger delay, while the vehicle delay in the priority direction increased only 1.37 s and 2.87 s; the results proved the practical applicability and efficiency of the proposed bilevel model.

At the same time the traffic flows have a significant impact on the environment and especially significant is the noise. This article presents the different effect of traffic lights switching period to the results of traffic flow dynamics. Results were achieved by using discrete model of traffic flow. For the modelling a line of road marking its points with the traffic lights is created. For the traffic lights the appropriate switching period was determined. Results presents the simulated dynamic of traffic flows also determining the variation of the velocity, flow, density and the total number of vehicles. The results can help to determine the most appropriate traffic lights switching periods for the dynamics of traffic flows. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The expected travel time in making a trip is modelled against sectional traffic characteristics (flow and speed) at origin and destination points of road segments, and roadway and segment traffic characteristics such as diversion routes are also tried in accounting for travel time. Predicted travel time is then used along with free flow time to determine the state of congestion on the segments using a congestion index (CI). A development of this kind may help in understanding traffic and congestion behaviour practically using easily accessible inputs, limited only to the nodes, and help in improving road network planning and management.

The use of Autoregressive Integrated Moving average (ARIMA) or seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) for traffic flow prediction requires huge flow data for model development and hence it may not be possible to use ARIMA in cases where sufficient data are unavailable. To overcome this problem, a prediction scheme based on Kalman filtering technique (KFT) was proposed and evaluated which requires only limited input data. Only previous two days flow observations has been used in the prediction scheme developed using KFT for predicting the next day flow values with a desired accuracy. Traffic flow prediction using both historic (previous two days flow data) and real time data on the day of interest was also attempted. Promising results were obtained with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 10 between observed and predicted flows and this indicates the suitability of the proposed prediction scheme for traffic flow forecasting in ITS applications.

The environmental noise impact by the DIRECTIVE 2002/49/EC is described using the one year average noise descriptors Lden, L-night which usually is presented via the appropriate noise maps. However, there are cases when together with the calculation model the direct acoustic measurements are needed. The permanent noise monitoring for this purpose often is unpractical and a short-term noise level measurements become important. When long-term noise measurement (annual noise monitoring) is not applicable, the standard ISO 1996-2 allows carry out measurements in shorter time intervals than the specified one. For the case of the suburbia roads it is shown that exist the possibility to assess the one year descriptors using the data coupled from the few hours' measurements only. As shown in paper it based on the statistics of traffic flow data for heavy and light transport (intensity, speed) as well as on the measured statistics of sound exposure levels of vehicle passing bys. For the urban traffic noise, as was shown by the statistical analysis of one year experimental data, at least one whole-day measurements are needed.

In current practice, traffic volumes and speeds are collected from inductive loop or similar devices. As probe vehicle data become more widespread, it is imperative that methods are developed so that traffic state estimators like speed, density and flow can be derived from probe vehicle data as well. In this paper, a methodology to estimate traffic flow on a freeway based on probe vehicle trajectory data combined with traffic shockwave theory is proposed. In essence, probe vehicle trajectory can indicate the free-flowing and congested regimes. By using LWR kinematic wave model, a shockwave can be identified that separates both regimes. From the formation of the shockwave, flows for each regime are estimated. To identify the shockwave, k-means clustering is applied to the data. When applied to simulated data, the error of the estimated flow during free-flow ranges from -9% to 1% with an average of -5%. The estimated flow during congestion has an error of 0%. Based on the results, this paper shows that the proposed method can predict traffic flow with a reasonable accuracy under congested and free-flow conditions. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Well designed infrastructure and traffic controllers along with more efficient vehicles and policy measures are required to mitigate congestion and thus reduce transport emissions. In order to evaluate how changes in the traffic system affect energy use and emissions, traffic analysis tools are used together with emission models. In large urban areas emission models mainly rely on aggregated outputs from traffic models, such as the average link speed and flow. Static traffic models are commonly used to generate inputs for emission models, since they can efficiently be applied to larger areas with relatively low computational cost. However, in some cases their underlying assumptions can lead to inaccurate predictions of the traffic conditions and hence to unreliable emission estimates. The aim of this paper is to investigate and quantify the errors that static modeling introduces in emission estimation and subsequently considering the source of those errors, to suggest and evaluate possible solutions. The long analysis periods that are commonly used in static models, as well as the static models' inability to describe dynamic traffic flow phenomena can lead up to 40% underestimation of the estimated emissions. In order to better estimate the total emissions, we propose the development of a post processing technique based on a quasi-dynamic approach, attempting to capture more of the excess emissions created by the temporal and spatial variations of traffic conditions.

Despite the restricting assumption of stationary flows that intuitively limit its application to real traffic systems, many operational models implementing it are still used without an empirical validation of the existence of the equilibrium. We investigate its existence on a traffic dataset of three months for the region of Paris, FR. The implementation of an application for interactive spatio-temporal data exploration allows to hypothesize a high spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and to guide further quantitative work. The assumption of locally stationary flows is invalidated in a first approximation by empirical results, as shown by a strong spatial and temporal variability in shortest paths and in network topological measures such as betweenness centrality. Furthermore, the behavior of spatial autocorrelation index of congestion patterns at different spatial ranges suggest a chaotic evolution at the local scale, especially during peak hours. We finally discuss the implications of these empirical findings and describe further possible developments based on the estimation of Lyapunov dynamical stability of traffic flows.

In the literature, many data collection methods have been used such as; magnetic loops, road tube counters, piezo sensors, radars, Bluetooth etc. to estimate the link occupancy, average speed or density of a corridor. More recently, Floating Car Data (FCD) has become another important traffic data source and has an increasing usage due to its lower cost and higher coverage despite its reliability problems. FCD obtained from GPS equipped vehicles moving in the traffic can provide speed or travel speed data for many segments for even 1-min intervals in real-time. Though not totally diverse providing more than one of the traffic flow parameters, measuring the effectiveness of this extensive data source in detecting some critical urban traffic states is the ultimate goal of this study. As a case study, 1-min interval FCD for an urban arterial in Ankara has been collected during the morning peak hour for 2 months. Average speed values were transformed into a qualitative 4-scale state parameter based on the Level of Service (LOS) definitions for urban roads. Pattern searches over consecutive segment states using different search length (i.e. 2 segments, 3 segments, etc.) showed that FCD is capable to detect recurrent congestion or bottleneck locations, and even have an idea about the length of queue formed before the bottlenecks.

However; when the traffic volumes reach the highway capacity, speed differentials occur leading to phenomenon of congestion which either can be recurrent in peak hours or nonrecurrent in case of having an incident on the highway. Congestions are considered a case of matter as the freeway network performance is adversely affected in terms of reducing the speed, increasing the travel time, and increasing the vehicle emissions due to increase the fuel consumption. Also the distraction during congestion period, can increase the probability of accidents occurrence, where all drivers try to pass the congested segment of the freeway. For instance the structural solutions for congestion has become inefficient for economic, urban and environmental considerations. Thus, since 1960s the trend have been changed to control the link traffic and optimize its capacity by using coordinated and integrated surveillance and control strategies. For the recent decades ramp metering strategies are noticed to be an effective approach for controlling and managing the freeway traffic.

A suitable index for the evaluation of the walkability level of an urban street is the pedestrian traffic flow and the walking behavior. The researchers examined six urban streets of various types in the city of Volos (a medium-sized Greek city, 130,000 inhabitants). They collected data of the pedestrian traffic flow and their legal or illegal walking behavior for each road segment of the examined streets. Furthermore, they collected data of motorists' traffic flow in the same road segments of the streets in the study area. The combination of those data with the administrative ranking of each road can indicate a walkability level of an examined street or a specific route and reveal pedestrians' mobility and safety issues. This study supports that walking behavior differs for various road types. Pedestrians with the highest rate of legal behavior were presented in main arterials (91.8%) and the lowest one in local streets (53.7%). Low level of motorized traffic flow in combination with maintenance and mobility problems in pedestrian infrastructure incites pedestrians to walk in the street thus underestimating their safety issues. Promotion of pedestrian mobility emphasizing in safety issues can change the modal split in favor of vulnerable road users, increase the sustainability index of an urban area and improve the citizens' quality of life.

Theory and Practice (TSTP)	SEP 19-21, 2016	Katowice, POLAND	Silesian Univ Technol, Fac Transport, Dept Transport Syst & Traff Engn		Speed-volume relationship; Length of urban road segments; Microscopic simulation		Speed-flow equations have been developed for use in travel demand models to accurately predict the speed of traffic on urban roads. However, in urban environments the corresponding correlations are quite complex since they are influenced by relatively short road segments and signalized intersections resulting in interrupted traffic flow. Hence, networks, traffic and control strategies represent influencing factors with respect to the speed-volume relationship. In this context, the adequate length of a lane is a basic condition for a lane to realize its full capacity. Thus, this paper focuses on the investigation of the impact of different lengths of urban road segments on the speed-volume relationship by means of a simulative approach. The impact of both reductions and extensions of an urban road segment with respect to statistically significant changes in speed values under undersaturated and saturated traffic conditions will be presented.

Investigations into breakdown occurrence at ramp junctions have demonstrated that when the groups of several vehicles following each other enter the freeway from the ramp, they are expected to create 'turbulence' resulting from lane changes, decelerations of vehicles on the mainline and inevitably by the cars merging from the on-ramp. This turbulence can lead to breakdown when the level of mainline demand is adequately high. In other words, the impact of a ramp vehicle on capacity is higher than that of a mainline vehicle, which indicates that a part of vehicles will simultaneously occupy two lanes during the process of changing them thus momentarily decreasing the capacity of the link. This feature becomes particularly important near bottlenecks where it might reduce the already limited throughput. The article introduces the main approaches, methodology, principles and stages of transport demand management on freeways that are aimed at improving the operation quality of transport facilities, including road safety. The technique allows evaluating and optimizing a Ramp-Metering (RM) concept from the viewpoint of minimizing the length of queues on ramps and a possibility of transport congestion. The proposed algorithm estimates the probability of starting congestion formation on the ramp using objective information on traffic conditions in each segment of the highway, which is based on the criterion for vehicle density on the lane. The last chapter shows the examples of traffic flow optimization on Western bypass ramps in Vilnius comparing two strategies for access control management using one or several vehicles per lane. Conclusions, trends and work on future investigations are presented at the end of the article.

A mathematical or analytical treatment of such condition is found infeasible due to its complex nature. Hence, simulation has become inevitable tool for analysis and interpretation of such real world situations. There are only few studies which focuses exclusively on developing a bidirectional traffic simulation model considering the longitudinal and lateral behaviour of vehicles for urban undivided roads. With the above motivation, the present study focuses on development of simulation models for bi-directional mixed traffic flow using object oriented programming (OOP) concepts. The proposed model would be of significant assistance to traffic engineers while making key decisions in traffic control and management policies.

J	Duan, HM; Xiao, XP; Pei, LL				Duan, Huiming; Xiao, Xinping; Pei, Lingling			Forecasting the Short-Term Traffic Flow in the Intelligent Transportation System Based on an Inertia Nonhomogenous Discrete Gray Model	COMPLEXITY			English	Article							SPEED PREDICTION; REGRESSION	The traffic-flow system has basic dynamic characteristics. This feature provides a theoretical basis for constructing a reasonable and effective model for the traffic-flow system. The research on short-term traffic-flow forecasting is of wide interest. Its results can be applied directly to advanced traffic information systems and traffic management, providing real-time and effective traffic information. According to the dynamic characteristics of traffic-flow data, this paper extends the mechanical properties, such as distance, acceleration, force combination, and decomposition, to the traffic-flow data vector. According to the mechanical properties of the data, this paper proposes four new models of structural parameters and component parameters, inertia nonhomogenous discrete gray models (referred to as INDGM), and analyzes the important properties of the model. This model examines the construction of the inertia nonhomogenous discrete gray model from the mechanical properties of the data, explaining the classic NDGM modeling mechanism in the meantime. Finally, this paper analyzes the traffic-flow data of Whitemud Drive in Canada and studies the relationship between the inertia model and the traffic-flow state according to the data analysis of the traffic-flow state. A simulation accuracy and prediction accuracy of up to 0.0248 and 0.0273, respectively, are obtained.

Effect of Information Availability on Stability of Traffic Flow: Percolation Theory Approach	PAPERS SELECTED FOR THE 22ND INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON TRANSPORTATION AND TRAFFIC THEORY	Transportation Research Procedia		English	Proceedings Paper	22nd International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory (ISTTT)	JUL 24-26, 2017	NW Univ, Evanston Campus, Chicago, IL		NW Univ, Evanston Campus	Connected Vehicles; Autonomous Vehicles; Percolation Theory; String Stability	SENSOR NETWORKS; CONNECTIVITY; VALIDATION; COVERAGE; IMPACT; MODEL	Connectivity and automation are expected to enhance safety and efficiency in transportation systems. Connectivity will provide information to drivers/autonomous vehicles to enhance decision-making reliability at the operational and tactical levels. Consequently, drivers are more likely to execute safe and efficient maneuvers and autonomous vehicles will have a more accurate perception of the traffic condition and an "error-free" execution of the driving maneuvers. At the operational level, ensuring string stability is a key consideration since unstable traffic flow results in shockwave propagation and possibly crashes. While several studies have examined the effects of information availability on string stability in a connected environment, most of the approaches are focused on automated driving (e.g., Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control systems) and do not consider a mixed environment with regular, connected, and autonomous vehicles. To ensure connectivity in such a mixed environment, the correlation between communication range and connected vehicles density should be considered. To capture the effects of this correlation, this study uses the Continuum Percolation theory to determine the effects of the vehicular density and communication range on the connectivity level in telecommunications network and consequently, on the string stability of traffic flow. Based on the Continuum Percolation theory, there is a critical density of connected vehicles above which the entire system is connected. This critical density also depends on the communication range. This study presents an analytical derivation of this critical density. Moreover, this study evaluates the string stability under different communication ranges and market penetration rates of connected and autonomous vehicles. Results revealed that as communication range increases, the system becomes more stable and at high communication ranges, the system performs similar to the system with full connectivity. Moreover, results indicated the existence of an optimal communication range to maximize stability and ensure information delivery. (C) 2017 The Authors. Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we attempt to fill the gap by constructing and solving a unifiable multi-commodity kinematic wave model. We first construct commodity speed-density relations based on generic generating functions. Then for two commodities we discuss the properties of the unifiable kinematic wave model and analytically solve the Riemann problem with a combination of total and commodity kinematic waves. We propose a unifiable multi-commodity Cell Transmission Model (CTM) with a general junction model for numerical simulations of network traffic flows, which are unifiable but may violate the FIFO principle. We prove that the CTM is well-defined under an extended CFL (Courant et al., 1928) condition. With examples we verify the consistency between the analytical and numerical solutions and demonstrate the convergence of the CTM. We conclude with several follow-up research directions for unifiable multi-commodity kinematic wave models. (C) 2017 The Authors. Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper reports our experimental and empirical studies on traffic flow instability. We have carried out a large scale experiment to study the car-following behavior in a 51-car platoon. The experiment has reproduced the phenomena and confirmed the findings in our previous 25-car-platoon experiment, i.e., standard deviation of vehicle speeds increases in a concave way along the platoon. Based on our experimental results, we argue that traffic speed rather than vehicle spacing (or density) might be a better indicator of traffic instability, because vehicles can have different spacing under the same speed. For these drivers, there exists a critical speed between 30 km/h and 40 km/h, above which the standard deviation of car velocity is almost saturated (flat) along the 51-car-platoon, indicating that the traffic flow is likely to be stable. In contrast, below this critical speed, traffic flow is unstable and can lead to the formation of traffic jams. Traffic data from the Nanjing Airport Highway support the experimental observation of existence of a critical speed. Based on these findings, we propose an alternative mechanism of traffic instability: the competition between stochastic factors and the so-called speed adaptation effect, which can better explain the concave growth of speed standard deviation in traffic flow.

Possible mechanisms include traffic flow instabilities, indifference regions or finite human perception thresholds (action points), and external acceleration noise. However, the relative importance of these factors in a given situation remains unclear. We bring light into this question by adding external noise and action points to the Intelligent Driver Model and other car-following models thereby obtaining a minimal model containing all three oscillation mechanisms. We show analytically that even in the subcritical regime of linearly stable flow (order parameter epsilon < 0), external white noise leads to spatiotemporal speed correlations "anticipating" the waves of the linearly unstable regime. Sufficiently far away from the threshold, the amplitude scales with (-0'5. By means of simulations and comparisons with experimental car platoons and bicycle traffic, we show that external noise and indifference regions with action points have essentially equivalent effects. Furthermore, flow instabilities dominate the oscillations on freeways while external noise or action points prevail at low desired speeds such as vehicular city or bicycle traffic. For bicycle traffic, noise can lead to fully developed waves even for single-file traffic in the subcritical regime. (C) 2017 The Authors. Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Invariant ratios reduce a control policy's impact on the crossing streets, so a policy can be optimized and evaluated by focusing on the street itself without the confounding factors present in networks. Designed for heavy traffic with spillovers, the proposed policies are adaptive and need little data they only require average traffic density readings and no demand forecasts. A battery of numerical experiments simulating the dynamics of rush hour traffic on a congested, homogeneous circular street reveals that the proposed form of adaptation reduces the duration of the rush and overall congestion compared with pre-timed control strategies. Eighteen different adaptation policies were considered. All inspect the street densities periodically and simulataneously, and retime the signals immediately thereafter. The period is a fixed multiple of the cycle. The street is evenly divided into sections that contain a set number of consecutive blocks and signals. The offset is the same for all blocks in a section. Three inspection intervals and six section sizes were tested. The latter ranged from a single block/signal to the whole street. It was found that adaptation worked best when sections were large and adaptation frequent. The effects were considerable across all scenarios. For a short street with a short rush and high input flows the probabilistic incidence of gridlock was reduced from 10% to 0%, and the average duration of a trip from 216s to 181s. For a long street with a long rush and high input flows the gridlock probability was reduced from 23% to 0% and the average trip duration from 2037s to 1143s. (C) 2017 The Authors. Elsevier B.V.

Route choice; Lyapunov stability; String stability; V2X; Connected vehicle	TRAFFIC SIGNAL CONTROL; ASSIGNMENT	Research on connected vehicle environment has been growing rapidly to investigate the effects of real-time exchange of kinetic information between vehicles and road condition information from the infrastructure through radio communication technologies. A fully connected vehicle environment can substantially reduce the latency in response caused by human perception-reaction time with the prospect of improving both safety and comfort. This study presents a dynamical model of route choice under a connected vehicle environment. We analyze the stability of headways by perturbing various factors in the microscopic traffic flow model and traffic flow dynamics in the car-following model and dynamical model of route choice. The advantage of this approach is that it complements the macroscopic traffic assignment model of route choice with microscopic elements that represent the important features of connected vehicles. The gaps between cars can be decreased and stabilized even in the presence of perturbations caused by incidents. The reduction in gaps will be helpful to optimize the traffic flow dynamics more easily with safe and stable conditions. The results show that the dynamics under the connected vehicle environment have equilibria. The approach presented in this study will be helpful to identify the important properties of a connected vehicle environment and to evaluate its benefits. (C) 2017 The Authors. Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we propose a big data-driven two-stage clustering framework to calibrate link FDs for freeway networks. The first stage captures, under normal traffic state, the variations of link FDs over multiple days based on which links are clustered in the second stage. Two methods, i.e. the standard k-means algorithm combined with hierarchical clustering and a modified hierarchical clustering based on the Frechet distance, are applied in the first stage to obtain the FD parameter matrix for each link. The calibrated matrices are input into the second stage where the modified hierarchical clustering is reemployed as a static approach resulting in multiple clusters of links To further consider the variations of link FDs, the static approach is extended by modifying the similarity measure through the principle component analysis (PCA). The resulting multivariate time-series clustering models the distributions of the FD parameters as a dynamic approach. The proposed framework is applied on the Melbourne freeway network using one-year worth of loop detector data. Results have shown that (a) similar roadway physical attributes do not necessarily result in similar link FDs, (b) the connectivity-based approach performs better in clustering link FDs as compared with the centroid-based approach, and (c) the proposed framework helps achieving a better understanding of the spatial distribution of links with similar FDs and the associated variations and distributions of the FD parameters.

The concept has been extended to the Arterial Fundamental Diagram (AFD), which has shown that the same relationship holds on arterial streets. However, constructing an AFD is subject to considerable variability in the measured quantities, due to the highly cyclical nature of signalized intersections. In most cases, these diagrams are based on the data from upstream detectors, located away from traffic signals. Recent scientific literature has shown a value of using stop-line detection data to develop AFDs, opening a plethora of opportunities to further investigate traffic dynamics utilizing the data from adaptive traffic signal systems (ATCSs). This can, however, be problematic for the two major reasons. First, the data may come from detectors unfit to provide good-quality inputs to develop an AFD. Second, such ATCSs may use their own surrogate measures of density and traffic flow, primarily developed for the purpose of controlling traffic, which may be inappropriate for developing fundamental relationships of AFDs. This study aims to address these issues by investigating appropriateness of using Degree of Saturation (DS), a density-like measure from Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System (SCATS), to develop an AFD. The empirical SCATS data showed an interesting pattern of the AFD, which cannot be explained by the data itself. Hence, a new analytical model of the DS based on the high-resolution signal and detection data was derived and revealed parameters that drive its behavior. A Cyclical Vehicle Arrival and Discharge Model was also developed to simulate SCATS-like operations and derive causal relationships between traffic flow variables and density-like performance measures in a controlled environment. The findings showed that DS does not have to be a poor estimator of traffic conditions, but when it is combined with SCATS-measured traffic flows it gives a false representation of near-capacity and over-saturated conditions.

We build a generalized analytical framework with fixed set theory to evaluate bi-modal arterials with any kind of flexible sharing strategies. These strategies are modelled parsimoniously using a single parameter to describe their effectiveness. This parameter can be estimated analytically, empirically, or with simulations. Overall, the mathematical formulation is versatile, as it applies to both intuitive cases when the arterial capacity is shared in a fixed manner, and non-intuitive cases when flexible sharing strategies are installed. This framework can provide practitioners both analytical and graphical tools to systematically and quantitatively evaluate any given bi-modal arterial. Moreover, the requirements to efficiently install flexible sharing strategies along the arterial are established. Lastly, one particular flexible sharing strategy, the pre-signal, is illustrated as an example both mathematically and with a calibrated simulation. (C) 2017 The Authors. Elsevier B.V.

The capture effect can occur in wireless network when packets arrive with different powers. Packets with high power can effectively swamp low power packets, such that they are received successfully, when otherwise a collision would have occurred. We present a vehicular network performance prediction model for a Rayleigh capture channel in Drive-thru Internet scenario. The model incorporates the capture effect into a 2-D Markov chain modeling the high-node mobility and distributed coordination function broadcast scheme. The performance-prediction model unveils the impacts of mobility velocity and number of vehicles on the throughput in a Rayleigh capture channel. We use a vehicular traffic flow model to predict vehicular movement on road by aggregating all vehicles into a flow. Simulation results confirm that our performance-prediction model accurately predicts the performance of traveling vehicles with Rayleigh capture channel in the Drive-thru Internet scenario. We demonstrate that using our performance-prediction model, we can obtain optimal contention window value, by which the best system throughput can be reached without wasting contention time.

To build proper network models and set their parameters, we have utilized historical flight track data, which includes last filed flight plans and actual movements. Through their comparisons, actual delay profiles of the airports and continental inflows/outflows were evaluated. In order to reduce the complexity of the models, most congested 103 European airports were held, and other airports were aggregated without considering their topological specs. Then, we have utilized these models to simulate the impact of local disturbances on the whole network through real air traffic data of certain days that disrupted due to capacity reductions issues such as heavy rain at an airport, an airline of controller strikes, runway construction, industrial events, etc. The results of these comparisons that performed by the certain simulations are reviewed to provide the performance assessment of the methods in demand-capacity balancing.

Analysis of a Transportation System With Correlated Network Intersections: A Case Study for a Central Urban City With High Seasonal Fluctuation Trends	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Transportation systems; correlated network intersections; traffic simulations; traffic planning; emergency evacuation analysis; traffic flows; congested networks	EVACUATION; DESIGN	Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) providing efficient road-transportation strategies have recently become a very active research area. Efficient transportation of visitors to/from highly congested sites is one of the most important challenges addressed by ITS. A transportation-system analysis is presented here and is applied on an urban city ring road network that encompasses a major attraction site characterized by correlated network-intersections and large vehicle-pedestrian movement conflicts. The presented model analysis first examines the influences exerted by network-correlations at intersection-points, and second, presents case-study evacuation scenarios examined under varying circumstances and flow requirements within each segment of the modeled network. The significance of this paper is clearly evident in emergency/evacuation scenarios or in design considerations in which the influence of correlated network intersections must be known beforehand. As a main contribution, a mathematical model was developed with simulations evaluating the current system using real-life data as statistical input to our model. Results had demonstrated the counter-propagation effect between adjacent intersections along the ring road of an urban congested city. Furthermore, the study modeled and investigated two emergency-evacuation scenarios within chosen segments at road network sites entering and exiting the central area in order to demonstrate how efficient evacuation can be conducted during an emergency scenario. It is expected that the results of this model can also be extended and applied for evacuation analyses for other sites with similar practical conditions or in other congested cities in which correlated intersections have a significant presence that must be included in the real-life analysis of a transportation system.

The model is applied to a real-world congesting network for Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota (Twin Cities), which comprises nearly 8000 nodes and more than 20,000 links, using network data collected since 1978. Four experiments are carried out with different initial conditions and constraints, the results of which allow us to explore model properties such as computational feasibility, qualitative implications, potential calibration procedures, and predictive value. The hypothesis that road hierarchy is an emergent property of transportation networks is corroborated and the underlying reasons discovered. Spatial distribution of capacity, traffic flow, and congestion in the transportation network is tracked over time. Potential improvements to the model, in particular, and future research directions in transportation network dynamics, in general, are also discussed.

This study presents an optimized crash prediction model on freeway with over-sampling techniques based on Support Vector Machine (SVM). The model was constructed with traffic data collected by discrete loop detectors from a 48.7 km segment on the G60 Freeway, Shanghai, China. Matched case-control method and SVM were applied to identify the high-risk traffic flow status. Two kinds of over-sampling techniques have been conducted to optimize the raw samples. The adaptive synthetic over-sampling technique presents better performance than the synthetic minority over-sampling technique according to the nonparametric test. The results indicate that SVM classifiers with the adaptive synthetic over-sampling technique improve the accuracy and robustness when dealing with imbalanced data. Mean Impact Value method was employed to rank the contributing factors leading to crash. This research contributes to more targeted strategies for real-time safety management of freeway.

J	Zhang, WL; Wang, NY				Zhang, Weili; Wang, Naiyu			Bridge network maintenance prioritization under budget constraint	STRUCTURAL SAFETY			English	Article						Transportation network; Travel time; Optimal maintenance scheduling; Prioritization; Optimization	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; RELIABILITY; PROBABILITY; PERFORMANCE; HEURISTICS; CRITERIA; DESIGN; COST	This study develops a decision model to assist bridge authorities in determining a preferred maintenance prioritization schedule for a degraded bridge network in a community that optimizes the performance of transportation systems within budgetary constraints at a regional scale. The study utilizes network analysis methods, structural reliability principles and meta-heuristic optimization algorithms to integrate individual descriptive parameters such as bridge capacity rating, condition rating, traffic demand, and location of the bridge, into global objective functions that define the overall network performance and maintenance cost. The performance of the network is measured in terms of travel time between all possible origin-destination (O-D) pairs. In addition to the global budgetary constraint, the optimization is also conditioned on local constraints imposed on traffic flow by insufficient load carrying capacity of deficient bridges. Uncertainties in traffic demands, vehicle weights and maintenance costs are also considered in the problem formulation. Two project priority indices are introduced the static priority index (SPI), defined as a function of the difference in network travel time between block running (with reduced load carrying capacity before repair) and smooth running (design-level load carrying capacity after repair) of a bridge, and the dynamic priority index (DPI) defined as the likelihood of a bridge being selected for repair when the budget is fixed and the uncertainties governing the performance of the transportation network are considered. Finally, this decision model is illustrated with a hypothetical network with 160 bridges. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Intrinsic characteristics of these networks are the constant mobility and high dynamics. Furthermore, being based on vehicles, the number of network nodes tends to increase in a fast pace. All these characteristics combined with the fact that a vehicle does not always have direct communication with the core network, turns crucial the use of all available technologies and networks in the range of a vehicle, including multi-hop communications. This paper proposes an uplink manager for vehicular networks that offers multihoming, traffic differentiation and load-balancing, taking into account context-information to increase the network performance. The proposed uplink manager provides simultaneous connectivity and traffic in multiple networks and technologies, and also enables the support of vehicles with single and multi-hop connections available simultaneously. To provide such functionalities, several extensions have been performed to the control messages used in the mobility protocol to carry useful information needed to perform the uplink manager decisions. The proposed uplink manager has been tested in real networks and with real equipments. The obtained results show that it fulfils all proposed requirements, both in terms of load-balancing and traffic differentiation, without incurring any performance drop in terms of packet losses or delay.

The main objective of this study is to improve the traffic flow to overcome these problems. The methodology used in this study is to design a communication system between the road and the car to alert and control the speed of the car wirelessly via XBEE; it consists of a two transceiver module. The device is fixed at Predetermined position send the speed limit and gives notes about general facilities of the road like the word "emergency" to inform the drivers that there is an ambulance, this alert appear in a form of messages which displayed on the Liquid Crystal Display LCD. The other device is fixed on the car that received these messages wirelessly, and then displays it on the LCD. The result obtained from this study is by calculating the number of Revolution Per Minute (RPM) for a motor is 460 rpm, therefore the maximum speed of the car is 450 kilometers per hour for cars with the wheel radius of 26 cm. The programs used for simulation are Proteus, arduino software and visual basic.

Conventional approaches, using artificial neural networks with narrow network architecture and poor training samples for supervised learning, have been only partially successful. In this paper, a deep-learning neural-network based on TensorFlow (TM) is suggested for the prediction traffic flow conditions, using real-time traffic data. Until now, no research has applied the TensorFlow (TM) deep learning neural network model to the estimation of traffic conditions. The suggested supervised model is trained by a deep learning algorithm, which uses real traffic data aggregated every five minutes. Results demonstrate that the model's accuracy rate is around 99%.

Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) have been envisioned to prominently enhance the road safety and traffic efficiency through real-time vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to- infrastructure communications. Roadside Units (RSUs) play an important role in vehicular environments in terms of connectivity, routing, and transmission delay. However, deploying enough RSUs to provide a universal coverage within an area is not feasible. In addition, there still lacks understanding of the performance of message dissemination in urban environments where one deploys RSUs in a stand-alone fashion. In this paper, we study the performance of message dissemination in VANET environments and propose a Safety-Based Disconnected RSU Placement algorithm (S-BRP) that reduces the dissemination delay in some areas. We evaluate the S-BRP algorithm through extensive simulation studies. The proposed algorithm outperforms Mesh, the alternate deployment policy, in terms of the dissemination delay and traffic flow.

J	Xu, Y; Hu, DW; Su, B; Zhang, DJ				Xu Yang; Hu Da-wei; Su Bing; Zhang Duo-jia			City traffic flow breakdown prediction based on fuzzy rough set	OPEN PHYSICS			English	Article						Traffic management; Traffic flow breakdown; Fuzzy rough set; SVM; Fuzzy decision table	SVM; DIAGNOSIS	In city traffic management, traffic breakdown is a very important issue, which is defined as a speed drop of a certain amount within a dense traffic situation. In order to predict city traffic flow breakdown accurately, in this paper, we propose a novel city traffic flow breakdown prediction algorithm based on fuzzy rough set. Firstly, we illustrate the city traffic flow breakdown problem, in which three definitions are given, that is, 1) Pre-breakdown flow rate, 2) Rate, density, and speed of the traffic flow breakdown, and 3) Duration of the traffic flow breakdown. Moreover, we define a hazard function to represent the probability of the breakdown ending at a given time point. Secondly, as there are many redundant and irrelevant attributes in city flow breakdown prediction, we propose an attribute reduction algorithm using the fuzzy rough set. Thirdly, we discuss how to predict the city traffic flow breakdown based on attribute reduction and SVM classifier. Finally, experiments are conducted by collecting data from I-405 Freeway, which is located at Irvine, California. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to achieve lower average error rate of city traffic flow breakdown prediction.

J	Como, G				Como, Giacomo			On resilient control of dynamical flow networks	ANNUAL REVIEWS IN CONTROL			English	Review						Dynamical flow networks; Transportation networks; Compartmental systems; Distributed control; Network resilience; Network flow control; Dynamical routing; Robust control; Monotone systems	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW; STABILITY; SYSTEMS; ASSIGNMENT; POLICIES	Resilience has become a key aspect in the design of contemporary infrastructure networks. This comes as a result of ever-increasing loads, limited physical capacity, and fast-growing levels of interconnectedness and complexity due to the recent technological advancements. The problem has motivated a considerable amount of research within the last few years, particularly focused on the dynamical aspects of network flows, complementing more classical static network flow optimization approaches. In this tutorial paper, a class of single-commodity first-order models of dynamical flow networks is considered. A few results recently appeared in the literature and dealing with stability and robustness of dynamical flow networks are gathered and originally presented in a unified framework. In particular, (differential) stability properties of monotone dynamical flow networks are treated in some detail, and the notion of margin of resilience is introduced as a quantitative measure of their robustness. While emphasizing methodological aspects including structural properties, such as monotonicity, that enable tractability and scalability over the specific applications, connections to well-established road traffic flow models are made.

It is a key component of traffic control and operations, because traffic variables are measured not everywhere due to technological and financial limitations, and their measurement is noisy. Therefore, numerous studies have proposed TSE methods relying on various approaches, traffic flow models, and input data. In this review article, we conduct a survey of highway TSE methods, a topic which has gained great attention in the recent decades. We characterize existing TSE methods based on three fundamental elements: estimation approach, traffic flow model, and input data. Estimation approach encompasses methods that estimate the traffic state, based on partial observation and a priori knowledge (assumptions) on traffic dynamics. Estimation approaches can be roughly classified into three according to their dependency on a priori knowledge and empirical data: modeldriven, datadriven, and streamingdatadriven. A traffic flow model usually means a physicsbased mathematical model representing traffic dynamics, with various solution methods. Input data can be characterized by using three different properties: collection method (stationary or mobile), data representation (disaggregated or aggregated), and temporal condition (real-time or historical). Based on our proposed characterization, we present the current state of TSE research and proposed future research directions. Some of the findings of this article are summarized as follows. We present modeldriven approaches commonly used. We summarize the recent usage of detailed disaggregated mobile data for the purpose of TSE. The use of these models and data will raise a challenging problem due to the fact that conventional macroscopic models are not always consistent with detailed disaggregated data. Therefore, we show two possibilities in order to solve this problem: improvement of theoretical models, and the use of datadriven or streamingdatadriven approaches, which recent studies have begun to consider. Another open problem is explicit consideration of traffic demand and routechoice in a large-scale network; for this problem, emerging data sources and machine learning would be useful.

Comparing Signal Setting Design Methods Through Emission and Fuel Consumption Performance Indicators	ADVANCES IN SYSTEMS SCIENCE, ICSS 2016	Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	19th International Conference on Systems Science (ICSS)	2016	Wroclaw, POLAND	Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Univ Nevada Las Vegas, Coventry Univ		Network signal setting design; Macroscopic traffic flow model; Microscopic traffic flow model; Sustainable transportation	URBAN CORRIDOR; OPTIMIZATION; MODEL	In order to address the Signal Setting Design at urban level two main approaches may be pursued: the coordination and the synchronisation approaches depending on the steps considered for the optimisation of decision variables (two steps vs. one step). Furthermore, in terms of objective functions mono-criterion or multi-criteria may be adopted. In this paper the coordination approach is implemented considering the multi-criteria optimisation at single junctions and mono-criterion optimisation at network level whereas the synchronisation is implemented considering the mono-criterion optimisation. The main purpose of the paper is the evaluation of the performances of two strategies not only considering indicators such as the total delay, the queue length etc. but also considering other indicators such as the emissions and the fuel consumption. The methodological framework is composed by three stages: (i) the decision variables (green timings and offsets) computation through optimisation methods; (ii) the implementation of optimal signal settings in a microscopic traffic flow simulator ("Simulation of Urban MObility"-SUMO); (iii) the estimation of emissions and fuel consumption indicators.

The model is based on the GSOM methodology, supplemented with an instantaneous travel time estimator and a multilane extension. The instantaneous travel time estimator can be estimated with the GSOM model and can take into account multilane. Thus the model is compatible with information based reactive dynamic assignment based on a logit behavioral scheme. It is also applicable for transportation systems endowed with vehicular multimodality.

Passenger flows following assumed set of travel destinations transit through different transportation modes. The network of repetitively acting local transportation modes routed along road loops of FTRN structure provides a framework for passengers' origin-destination trip routing and scheduling. In that context, first of all some mass-customized services following presumed scenarios caused by seasonal timetable changes and major sporting events or other special events, e.g. emergency transportation ones, have to be assessed in advance. In general case such problems belong to NP-hard ones. However, the passenger travel schedules can be estimated easily while taking into account both structural features of transportation network, e.g. its regularity, and cyclic behaviour of local transportation modes employed in FTRN. Therefore, the goal is to provide a declarative model allowing one to formulate a constraint satisfaction problem enabling assessment of a city network period as well as development of conditions guaranteeing the right match-up of local transportation line schedules to a given passenger flow itineraries.

Compared with traditional models, it can depict traffic flow dispersion with a uniform model under conditions of different road speeds or road lengths. Based on it, a dynamic model that depicts how the TTI distribution parameters vary with speed of road segment is proposed. Furthermore, parameters of the dynamic model are used to construct a characteristic vector to reveal a new inherent feature of road segments. The tests of goodness of fit for the two proposed models were carried out with data collected from 66,000 floating cars. The test area covered 40,400 urban road segments in the urban area of Beijing. Test results showed that more than 98% of the tested bins accepted the proposed TTI probability distribution model, and more than 90% of the tested road segments accepted the proposed dynamic model. The proposed models would be applied in traffic simulation, congestion forecast, signal control, and other relevant fields in the future. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

According to the psychological and behavioural characteristics of aggressive drivers and conservative drivers, the safety conditions for lane changing are designed respectively. The numerical simulations show that the proposed model is suitable for describing the traffic flow with frequent lane changing, which is more consistent with the driving behaviour of drivers in China. Compared with symmetric two-lane cellular automata (STCA) model, the proposed model can improve the average speed of vehicles by 1.04% under different traffic demands when aggressive drivers are in a higher proportion (the threshold of risk factor is 0.4). When the risk factor increases, the average speed shows the polarization phenomenon with the average speed slowing down in big traffic demand. The proposed model can reflect the relationship among density, flow, and speed, and the risk factor has a significant impact on density and flow.

Four-phase intersection was analyzed and modeled based on the Cell Transmission Model (CTM). CTM and signal control model in our study had both been improved for multi-intersections by three-phase theory and information-exchanging. To achieve a real-time application, an improved genetic algorithm (GA) was proposed finally, the DISCO traffic simulation software was used for numerical simulation experiment, and comparisons with the standard GA and CTM were reported in this paper. Experimental results indicate that our searching time is less than that of SGA by 38%, and our method needs only 1/3 iteration time of SGA. According to our DISCO traffic simulation processing, compared with SGA, if the input traffic flow is changed from free phase to synchronized phase, for example, less than 900 vel/h, the delay time can reduce to 87.99% by our method, and the minimum delay time is 77.76% of existing method. Furthermore, if input traffic volume is increased to 1200 vel/h or more at the synchronized phase, the summary and minimum values of average delay time are reduced to 81.16% and 75.83%, respectively, and the average delay time is reduced to 17.72 seconds.

The usage of existing knowledge from decision tree control is one of the most suitable methods for identification of the new fuzzy model. However, such method introduces several difficulties. These difficulties are described and possible measures are proposed. Several fuzzy logic algorithms were developed and tested by a microsimulation model. The results are presented and the finest algorithm is recommended for testing on the Prague City Ring Road in real conditions. This paper provides a guidance for researchers and practitioners dealing with similar problem formulation.

Service Quality Assessment of Shared Use Road Segments: A Pedestrian Perspective	PROCEEDINGS OF 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT COMPUTING AND APPLICATIONS	Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Applications (ICICA)	FEB 05-06, 2016	KCG Coll Technol, Chennai, INDIA		KCG Coll Technol	Mid-sized city; Pedestrian facility; Pedestrian level of service; Fuzzy C-Means cluster analysis	LEVEL	At present, a suitable methodology is not available for assessment of the quality of services offered by the transportation facilities like shared use roadway segments for pedestrian use under the influence of heterogeneous traffic flow. Hence an initiative has been taken in present study to develop a new method that can be well applicable for mid-sized cities. Required data sets has been collected from a total of 60 segments of three Indian cities namely; Bhubaneswar (Odisha), Rourkela (Odisha) and Kottayam (Kerala). These segments widely vary in their traffic flow and geometric conditions. Also, both kinds of segments, i.e. with and without provision of sidewalk facilities have been considered. The quality of walking environments offered by these segments has been examined. Approximately 700 respondents differing in their age, sex, education level and driving experiences participated in perception surveys to share their satisfaction level on these segments. Ten different variables affecting the service quality significantly (p < 0.001) has been found out and stepwise multi-variable regression analysis has been carried out to develop a new model. Primary factors included are namely: total available width of the road, paved shoulder and sidewalk facilities in through direction; volume of pedestrians and vehicles in peak hours of traffic flow; percentage of heavy vehicles; 85th percentile speed of running motor vehicles; and interruptions created by nearby commercial activities and available public transits. Also, influences of two secondary factors namely; availability of driveways and type of separation of sidewalk facilities from the main carriageway has been examined under prevailing conditions. These influences have been reflected in the developed model by using adjustment factors. This regression model reported high reliability in its universal application with a high correlation coefficient (R-2) of = 0.75. Also, its parameter estimates satisfied required significance criteria through several tests including t test, collinearity statistics etc. Fuzzy C-Means clustering technique has been used to define the ranges of service categories (A-F). In order to evaluate off-street pedestrian facilities, average pedestrian space (m(2)/ped) has been used as the measuring parameter. The service categories predicted by the developed model for fifteen randomly selected segments has been compared with the observed ones. The high value found for exact matching (86.7 %) denotes well applicability of this developed model.	[Beura, Sambit Kumar; Chellapilla, Haritha; Jena, Suprava; Bhuyan, P.

Applying a less restrictive lighting class decreases energy consumption. Thanks to this setting lighting classes accordingly to actual road conditions yields up to 34% reduction of the power usage. This result may be further improved if one performs control on a well design installation. The optimization of a lighting design for one lighting class is the subject to the intensive research. In this article we show in turn that the optimization within one class is not sufficient for preparing an optimal solution. The metrics allowing the comparison of two solutions has been also introduced. The energy consumption in the presented case is reduced by 2.73% only but in the context of the global energy consumption of lighting systems (estimated for 3GWh in the EU) it seems to be interesting.

Measuring air pollution levels is an important step in designing and assessing air quality related public policies. Unfortunately, existing solutions are inadequate to get insights on the real exposition of citizens. In particular, high quality sensors deployed today are too large and too costly to envision a three dimensional deployment at the scale of a street. In this paper, we investigate the deployment of wireless sensor networks (WSN) used for building a three-dimensional mapping of pollution concentrations. We consider in our simulations a 3D model of air pollution dispersion based on real experiments performed in wind tunnels emulating the pollution emitted by a steady state traffic flow in a typical street canyon. Our contribution is to analyze the performances of different 3D WSN topologies in terms of the trade-off between the economical cost of the infrastructure and the quality of the reconstructed air pollution mapping.

Conclusion is drawn as follows: The influence of signal lights on vehicle speed, which mainly concentrate in the 70 m area near the stop line; During the green light period, at the same time point, the operational characteristics of vehicles on different positions have significant difference, which changes with the passing of green time; Compared with no signal countdown case, the vehicle speed fluctuation is larger and the average speed is obviously lower in signal countdown case; Under the traffic without blocking, most drivers want to increase speed through the stop-line. Eventually, by performing the analysis of pilot behaviors in with or without signal countdown device, an attempt is made to provide the urban road entrance lanes of more realistic CA model, which describes the operational characteristics of urban road entrance lanes with the signal controlling has obvious advantages through simulation results.

The core intersection on the arterial road in Shenyang was selected as research object. Based on traffic parameter investigation and delay evaluation of intersection status, bus station settings, traffic organization and signal control were optimized and the optimization effect was simulated. The results show that intersection saturation and queue length decrease, while traffic flow average speed increase, further, vehicle average delay is reduced from 60 to 25 s, while intersection level of service is raised from E to C. The optimization effect is obvious and perfect. It suggests that the optimization design of intersection can actually not only reduce the traffic delay, improve the level of service, but also ensure city arterial road being safe and smooth.

A set of discussed models includes autoregressive integrated moving average models (ARIMA and VARMA), error correction models (VECM and EC-VARMA), space-time ARMA (STARMA), and multivariate autoregressive space state models (MARSS). All these models are based on different assumptions about a structure of interrelationships in traffic data (in time, in space or between different traffic characteristics). We discussed base assumptions of these models (such as stationary of traffic flows and spatial independence of data) and their importance in the domain of transport flows. The discussion is supplemented with an empirical application of the models to forecasting of traffic speeds for a small road segment. Empirical conclusions and projected research directions are also presented. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The composite indicator to assess system efficiency was proposed. An information-logical model of data as well as process of scientifically based decision making in the sphere of urban public transport routing were described. Such routing approach requires actual information about traffic flows on the city roads and, in the same time, takes into account the minimization of negative environmental impact while keeping index of population mobility.

The presentation illustrates a new method for the management of the traffic flow on highways, based on the constant time to collision criterion. This criterion is addressing the car fallowing issue and it offers a speed adapted planner for the distance gap between cars. This method is able also to support a highway traffic flow management.

This paper proposes an urgent traffic dispersion and assignment model for the case of urban road flooding, with the aim of maximizing the level of service in the road network by controlling the road capacity. First, based on prospect theory and taking the historical travel time average as a reference, the model adopts the BPR (Bureau of Public Roads) function to represent the cost-flow relationship to calculate the prospect value of each route. Second, the travelers route choice behavior is described in logitmodel with the prospect value as the utility. Third, based on the route choice results, the traffic flow on the congested road sections is dispersed by controlling the road capacity, so the traffic flow to the flooded roads can be adaptively assigned to other roads. Finally, a direct iterative method and genetic algorithm are used to solve the proposed model. The former attempts to implement the traffic assignment based on the travelers route choice behavior, and the latter is used to find the satisfying solution through selection, crossover and mutation. The proposed model is applied to a given road network with an assumption of some road capacity reduction due to road flooding. The results show that when the proposed model is applied, the saturation ratio (or level of service) of the roads in the entire network is more uniform and the distribution of the saturation ratio of main roads is reduced, so the traffic flow in the whole network can remain smooth and the level of service can remain high.

The impact on traffic flow and road capacity is far greater than ordinary roads, which will produce more serious than the average delay road loss. In this study, the VISSIM software was used to simulate the "3 off 1" situation on highway. The effective highway capacity under unexpected traffic incident is simulated at different mainline traffic amount, different road configuration and different speed limits in this article.

Bi-level optimization with hybrid algorithms for energy saving and CO2 emissions reduction by wireless sensor networks for transportation management	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Wireless sensor networks; hybrid algorithm; transportation management; bi-level optimization; energy saving	PROGRAMMING APPROACH; SIGNAL CONTROL; DESIGN; FORMULATION; MODEL	In general, there are two sorts of strategies of energy saving and CO2 emissions reduction in transportation systems using wireless sensor network for transportation. They are single-level optimization solutions and the bi-level optimization ones. The bi-level optimization solutions are considered a sort of optimization in both road side unit (RSU) side and on-board unit (OBU) one. However, the single-level optimization solutions are considered optimization only in RSU or OBU side. A bi-level optimization model with Genetic Algorithm/Particle Swarm Optimization (GA/PSO) hybrid algorithm is proposed to improve performance instead of non-hybrid algorithms. The upper-level optimization model considers the real-time traffic characteristics of the traffic flows near the signalized road intersection. At the same time, vehicles in the lower-level optimization model retrieve the real-time traffic signals using vehicular networks. Then, the traffic signals update the schedule and the vehicles motion states for greener environment factor respectively. Simulation results indicate that the GA/PSO hybrid algorithm performs much better than non-hybrid ones especially when the traffic is heavy. The fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are greatly reduced.	[Liu, Kun; Li, Jianqing] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Informat Technol, Ave Wai Long, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China; [Chris, H.

Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is an advanced technology that can greatly enhance the vehicle mobility, improve traffic safety, and alleviate traffic jams. To explore the benefits of BLIP operation under a connected environment, this study proposed a three-lane cellular automata (CA) model under opening boundary condition. In particular, a mandatory BLIP lane-changing rule is developed to analyze special asymmetric lane-changing behaviors. To improve the simulation accuracy, a smaller cell size is used in the CA model. Through massive numerical simulations, the benefits and influences of BLIP are explored in this paper. They include impacts on neighborhood lanes such as traffic density increasing and average speed decreasing, lane changing behaviors, lane usage, and the impacts of bus departure interval and clear distance on the road capacity of BLIP. Analysis of traffic flow characteristics of BLIP reveals that there is a strong relationship among bus departure interval, clear distance, and road capacity. Furthermore, setting conditions for deployment of BLIP under the V2V environment such as reasonable departure interval, clear distance, and traffic density are obtained.

Safety performance appraisal at roundabouts: Case study of Salalah City in Oman	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION SAFETY & SECURITY			English	Article						crash prediction models (CPMs); generalized linear modelling (GLM); Oman; safety	TRAFFIC ACCIDENT OCCURRENCE	Although, roundabouts have proved significant in improving safety, capacity, and environmental performance, they have shown an increasing crash rate in Oman over the years. This article aims to evaluate the safety performance of the roundabouts in Oman through the development of crash-predictionmodels to examine the relationship between the geometric, traffic flow variables, and crash frequency and severity. These models can determine which variables are the best indicators for safety performance. GLM technique with Poisson or negative binomial regression (NBR) was carried out to develop these models. Two types of models were developed separately: the flow-based models including only exposure functions, and the full models containing exposure functions and other significant geometry and traffic variables. The result shows that the 85th percentile speed, number of lanes at specific approach, entry angle, and circulating width were the most significant variables. It was found that reducing the 85th percentile speed reduces the total and injuries crashes, however increasing the number of lanes in each approach and adding right-turn bypass lane may be the most effective methods to reduce the rear-end accidents.

J	Kosun, C; Ozdemir, S				Kosun, Caglar; Ozdemir, Serhan			An entropy-based analysis of lane changing behavior: An interactive approach	TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION			English	Article						Nonadditive entropy; traffic flow; driver behavior; lane changing behavior; traffic safety; safe distance	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; MODEL; OVERTAKING	Objectives: As a novelty, this article proposes the nonadditive entropy framework for the description of driver behaviors during lane changing. The authors also state that this entropy framework governs the lane changing behavior in traffic flow in accordance with the long-range vehicular interactions and traffic safety.Methods: The nonadditive entropy framework is the new generalized theory of thermostatistical mechanics. Vehicular interactions during lane changing are considered within this framework. The interactive approach for the lane changing behavior of the drivers is presented in the traffic flow scenarios presented in the article. According to the traffic flow scenarios, 4 categories of traffic flow and driver behaviors are obtained. Through the scenarios, comparative analyses of nonadditive and additive entropy domains are also provided.Results: Two quadrants of the categories belong to the nonadditive entropy; the rest are involved in the additive entropy domain. Driving behaviors are extracted and the scenarios depict that nonadditivity matches safe driving well, whereas additivity corresponds to unsafe driving. Furthermore, the cooperative traffic system is considered in nonadditivity where the long-range interactions are present. However, the uncooperative traffic system falls into the additivity domain. The analyses also state that there would be possible traffic flow transitions among the quadrants. This article shows that lane changing behavior could be generalized as nonadditive, with additivity as a special case, based on the given traffic conditions.Conclusions: The nearest and close neighbor models are well within the conventional additive entropy framework. In this article, both the long-range vehicular interactions and safe driving behavior in traffic are handled in the nonadditive entropy domain. It is also inferred that the Tsallis entropy region would correspond to mandatory lane changing behavior, whereas additive and either the extensive or nonextensive entropy region would match discretionary lane changing behavior. This article states that driver behaviors would be in the nonadditive entropy domain to provide a safe traffic stream and hence with vehicle accident prevention in mind.

These data are used by Caltrans for traffic management operations, such as freeway ramp metering, and to evaluate the performance of freeway corridor traffic management systems. These data are also being used to calibrate traffic flow models and to perform model-based predictions of freeway corridor congestion and traffic throughput performance. However; such detection is prone to contain errors and inconsistencies, which can pose problems in further use of the data, and is also of such large quantities that identification of errors can be tedious. This paper proposes a fault detection algorithm associating loop detector data to the cell transmission model to identify significant errors among such detectors. It discusses how such an algorithm would apply to loop detection along the mainline freeway, as well as extends the algorithm to determine errors along on and off ramp detectors. It also gives a real-life example with appropriate identification of detectors in error.

ASSESSING FUEL ECONOMY FROM AUTOMATED DRIVING: INFLUENCE OF PREVIEW AND VELOCITY CONSTRAINTS	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 9TH ANNUAL DYNAMIC SYSTEMS AND CONTROL CONFERENCE, 2016, VOL 2			English	Proceedings Paper	9th ASME Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference	OCT 12-14, 2016	Minneapolis, MN	ASME, Dynam Syst & Control Div				Constrained optimization control techniques with preview are designed in this paper to derive optimal velocity trajectories in longitudinal vehicle following mode, while ensuring that the gap from the lead vehicle is both safe and short enough to prevent cut-ins from other lanes. The lead vehicle associated with the Federal Test Procedures (FTP) [1] is used as an example of the achieved benefits with such controlled velocity trajectories of the following vehicle. Fuel Consumption (FC) is indirectly minimized by minimizing the accelerations and decelerations as the autonomous vehicle follows the hypothetical lead. Implementing the cost function in offline Dynamic Programming (DP) with full drive cycle preview showed up to a 17% increase in Fuel Economy (FE). Real time implementation with Model Predictive Control (MPC) showed improvements in FE, proportional to the prediction horizon. Specifically, 20 s preview MPC was able to match the DP results. A minimum of 1.5 s preview of the lead vehicle velocity with velocity tracking of the lead was required to obtain an increase in FE. The optimal velocity trajectory found from these algorithms exceeded the presently allowable error from standard drive cycles for FC testing. However, the trajectory was still safe and acceptable from the perspective of traffic flow. Based on our results, regulators need to consider relaxing the constant velocity error margins around the standard velocity trajectories dictated by the FTP to encourage FE increase in autonomous driving.

Traffic forecasting is an integral part of the process of designing of road facilities, starting from investment feasibility study to developing of working documentation. Determination of transportation and distribution of cars in sections are performed under a set of interrelated factors. Complete and valid consideration of these factors for complex road networks is possible only by means of mathematical models and corresponding software applications. Accuracy and consistency of the forecast determines validity of almost all the main characteristics of the designed object starting from direction of the route and location of connection points to the existing elements of the road network, ending with specific planning solutions for road facilities.

This paper applies a model of cyclic balance of transportation demand and supply in order to find out an optimum traffic light control mode. The traffic light control mode is determined by challenging the issue of maximization of traffic intensity control subject to restrictions on the volumes of arriving and leaving flows and the queue length at respective sets of links. A feature of the proposed method is a differentiated approach to transportation links. It suggests that excess traffic demand in the control zone is localized on a set of links characterized by presence of a controllable line. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This research is intended to study the alternatives and models of traffic management during a major sports event in a city. In doing so four alternatives have been selected for an intersection of the streets, for a main three-lane street depending on the intensity of: background traffic flow (NF), public transport (NM) and transport which services the major sports event (NS). Special attention is paid to the movement of traffic flows of different types in a controlled intersection of the street and road network. Based on the analysis of dynamic models of traffic as well as the impact of background traffic flow and public transport on the transport which services a major sports event, we defined the efficiency criteria and specified characteristics of traffic in a street and road network with the right most lane dedicated to public transport.

One of the reasons is the surging vehicles day by day. Another reason is the shortage of the traffic supply seriously. But the most important reason is that the traffic organization and optimization hardly met the conditions of modern transport development. In this paper, the practical method of the traffic organization and optimization used in regional area is explored by the dynamic traffic network analysis method. Firstly, the operational states of the regional traffic network are obtained by simulation method based on the self-developed traffic simulation software DynaCHINA, in which the improved traffic flow simulation model was proposed in order to be more suitable for actual domestic urban transport situation. Then the appropriated optimizationmodel and algorithm were proposed according to different optimized content and organization goals, and the traffic simulation processes more suitable to regional optimization were designed exactly. Finally, a regional network in Tai'an city was selected as an example. The simulation results show that the proposed method is effective and feasible. It can provide strong scientific and technological support for the traffic management department.

J	Tang, L; Luo, X; Zhai, PF; Gao, XF				Tang, Li; Luo, Xia; Zhai, Pengfei; Gao, Xunfei			A Density-Based Ramp Metering Model Considering Multilane Context in Urban Expressways	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							TRAFFIC FLOW; BOULEVARD-PERIPHERIQUE; FEATURES	As one of the most effective intelligent transportation strategies, ramp metering is regularly discussed and applied all over the world. The classic ramp metering algorithm ALINEA dominates in practical applications due to its advantages in stabilizing traffic flow at a high throughput level. Although ALINEA chooses the traffic occupancy as the optimization parameter, the classic traffic flow variables (density, traffic volume, and travel speed) may be easier obtained and understood by operators in practice. This paper presents a density-based ramp metering model for multilane context (MDB-RM) on urban expressways. The field data of traffic flow parameters is collected in Chengdu, China. A dynamic density model for multilane condition is developed. An error function represented by multilane dynamic density is introduced to adjust the different usage between lanes. By minimizing the error function, the density of mainstream traffic can stabilize at the set value, while realizing the maximum decrease of on-ramp queues. Also, VISSIM Component Object Model of Application Programming Interface is used for comparison of the MDB-RM modelwith a noncontrol, ALINEA, and density-based model, respectively. The simulation results indicate that theMDB-RM model is capable of achieving a comprehensive optimal result from both sides of the mainstream and on-ramp.

J	Lan, TY; Yan, F; Lin, H				Lan, Tianyi; Yan, Fei; Lin, Hui			Iterative Learning Control with Forgetting Factor for Urban Road Network	JOURNAL OF CONTROL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article								In order to improve the traffic condition, a novel iterative learning control (ILC) algorithm with forgetting factor for urban road network is proposed by using the repeat characteristics of traffic flow in this paper. Rigorous analysis shows that the proposed ILC algorithm can guarantee the asymptotic convergence. Through iterative learning control of the traffic signals, the number of vehicles on each road in the network can gradually approach the desired level, thereby preventing oversaturation and traffic congestion. The introduced forgetting factor can effectively adjust the control input according to the states of the system and filter along the direction of the iteration. The results show that the forgetting factor has an important effect on the robustness of the system. The theoretical analysis and experimental simulations are given to verify the validity of the proposed method.

However, due to the nonstationarity of traffic flow data, traditional point forecasting can hardly be accurate, so probabilistic forecasting methods are essential for quantification of the potential risks and uncertainties for traffic management. A probabilistic forecasting model of traffic flow based on a multikernel extreme learning machine (MKELM) is proposed. Moreover, the optimal output weights of MKELM are obtained by utilizing Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm. To verify its effectiveness, traffic flow probabilistic prediction using QPSO-MKELM was compared with other learning methods. Experimental results show that QPSO-MKELM is more effective for practical applications. And it will help traffic managers to make right decisions.

J	Osman, H; Ammar, M; El-Said, M				Osman, Hesham; Ammar, Marwan; El-Said, Moheeb			OPTIMAL SCHEDULING OF WATER NETWORK REPAIR CREWS CONSIDERING MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES	JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						water networks; optimization; simulation; resource allocation	SYSTEM	Water main breaks disrupt water services and impact traffic flow along congested city roads. Dispatching water pipe repair crews needs to consider several factors that include: 1) the priority of repair site; 2) the suitability and efficiency of the construction crew in repairing a particular break type; and 3) the time required for crews to travel between break sites. This paper presents a simulation-based multi-objective optimization model to schedule repair crews across water network break sites in an urban setting. Discrete-event simulation models for the water pipe repair process are developed to account for various repair methods. These models are subsequently integrated within a GA-based multi-objective optimization model that considers the following objectives: 1) minimizing the total repair time required to complete all breaks; 2) minimizing the total cost to complete the breaks; and 3) minimizing the cumulative impact of all breaks incident on road users and water customers. A case study for the water network on the City of Damietta, Egypt is used to demonstrate the capabilities of the model. Results show a 21% reduction in repair time and 50% reduction in user impact compared to heuristic crew allocation methods used by the water utility.

Therefore, potential conflicts due to intermittent sight distance obstructions may occur between vehicles in minor roads and those in major roads. To reduce the potential conflicts, a rightturn lane is offset from the through lanes at these intersections. Thus, a clear view of the through movements on the major road could be provided to the drivers on the minor road. Field data were collected at the four study locations in Illinois, and historical crash data were collected to understand the possible safety problems at the sites with conventional right-turn lanes. A new probabilistic model was developed to predict the potential traffic conflict rates. Traffic simulation software TSIS/CORSIM was used to verify the probabilistic model and determine the frequency of the potential conflicts for different traffic-flow conditions. This methodology and its results provide the traffic agencies and policy-makers with a step forward to design guidelines which determine when to install the offset right-turn lane based on the potential conflict occurrence to proactively improve the safety at unsignalized intersections.

Besides the significant impact on human mobility analysis, it is quite important in lots of fields, such as traffic flow analysis, urban planning, and path recommendation. Common ways to obtain these pieces of information are mostly based on the questionnaires, which have many disadvantages such as high manpower cost, low accuracy, and low sampling rate. To overcome these problems, we propose a commute routes recovering model to recover individuals' commute routes based on passively generated mobile phone data. The challenges of the model lie in the low sampling rate of signal records and low precision of location information from mobile phone data. To address these challenges, our model applies two main modules. The first is data preprocessing module, which extracts commute trajectories from raw dataset and formats the road network into a better modality. The second module combines two kinds of information together and generates the commute route with the highest possibility. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate the results in two ways, which are path score evaluation and evaluation based on visualization. Experimental results have shown better performance of our method than the compared method.

J	Theofilatos, A; Yannis, G				Theofilatos, Athanasios; Yannis, George			Investigation of powered 2-wheeler accident involvement in urban arterials by considering real-time traffic and weather data	TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION			English	Article						Powered 2-wheelers; accidents; real-time data; urban arterials	CRASH INJURY SEVERITY; OVERTAKING; MODELS; SAFETY; FLOW; FREEWAYS	Objective: Understanding the various factors that affect accident risk is of particular concern to decision makers and researchers. The incorporation of real-time traffic and weather data constitutes a fruitful approach when analyzing accident risk. However, the vastmajority of relevant research has no specific focus on vulnerable road users such as powered 2-wheelers (PTWs). Moreover, studies using data from urban roads and arterials are scarce. This study aims to add to the current knowledge by considering real-time traffic and weather data from 2 major urban arterials in the city of Athens, Greece, in order to estimate the effect of traffic, weather, and other characteristics on PTW accident involvement. Methods: Because of the high number of candidate variables, a random forest model was applied to reveal the most important variables. Then, the potentially significant variables were used as input to a Bayesian logistic regression model in order to reveal the magnitude of their effect on PTW accident involvement. Results: The results of the analysis suggest that PTWs are more likely to be involved in multivehicle accidents than in single-vehicle accidents. Itwas also indicated that increased traffic flow and variations in speed have a significant influence on PTW accident involvement. On the other hand, weather characteristics were found to have no effect. Conclusions: The findings of this study can contribute to the understanding of accident mechanisms of PTWs and reduce PTW accident risk in urban arterials.

J	Lu, C; Huang, J				Lu, Chao; Huang, Jie			A self-learning system for local ramp metering with queue management	TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Intelligent transport systems; traffic flow model; ramp metering; reinforcement learning; simulation	NETWORK	This paper presents the design and evaluation process of a self-learning system for local ramp metering control. This system is developed on the basis of reinforcement learning (RL) and can deal with the problem of on-ramp queue management through a continuous learning process. A general framework of the system design including the definition of RL elements and an algorithm that can accomplish the learning process is proposed. Simulation tests are carried out to evaluate the performance of the new system. In terms of the total time spent by road users, the new system can achieve a 30% reduction from the situation of no control, a result which is competitive with the widely accepted algorithm ALINEA. Meanwhile, simulation results show that the new system can keep on-ramp queues strictly under a series of pre-specified constraints, which proves its capability of managing on-ramp queues.

Excessive noise paradoxes in urban transportation networks	TRANSPORTMETRICA A-TRANSPORT SCIENCE			English	Article						Braess' paradox; emission paradox; excessive noise paradox; speed limit	DESIGN PROBLEM; ROAD NETWORKS; TRAFFIC FLOW; OPTIMIZATION APPROACH; ASSIGNMENT PARADOX; PROPERTY-VALUES; DEPARTURE TIME; EXTERNAL COSTS; BRAESS PARADOX; ROUTE CHOICES	The Braess' paradox (BP) of traffic flow has been researched thoroughly, but travel time is not the only measure for network performance evaluation, especially with the increasing concern on environmental protection. An analogue of BP related to traffic noise is less well known, but is also worth exploring. In traffic assignments with non-cooperative behavior of travelers, some traffic control strategies or network improvements can cause the total amount of excessive noise (and its cost) to increase. This study demonstrates the existence of such excessive noise paradoxes (NP), which can be triggered by network control strategies such as demand change, link addition or speed limit implementation. The simultaneous and asynchronous occurrences among the NP, the emission paradox and BP are also examined. These findings indicate the inadequacy of designing road networks solely to mitigate congestion may cause increased emissions or excessive noise.	[Wang, Yi; Szeto, W.

This research aspires to interpret these observations from the human factors perspective in traffic flow theory. A combination of these factors shapes the above-mentioned influence regions, transition around capacity, and capacity drop. Of critical importance in determining the transition around capacity and capacity drop is drivers' aggressiveness, a factor that has long been overlooked in the past. This paper provides a detailed account of where it comes from and how it influences the fundamental diagram.

J	Zhu, ZJ; Lu, Y; Zeng, J; Chen, HS				Zhu, Zhenjun; Lu, Yang; Zeng, Jun; Chen, Hongsheng			Highway Traffic Accident Influence Area Based on Vehicle Bypass Decision-Making Index	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article							TRANSPORTATION NETWORK; KINEMATIC WAVES; INFORMATION	In order to reduce the impact of highway traffic accidents on surrounding road networks, accident influence area should be determined reasonably. According to the relationship between vehicle bypass decision-making index and threshold under accident condition, the vehicles' route choice behavior at upstream of the accident spot can be divided into two types: bypass and nonbypass. Under nonbypass condition, the method of using traffic wave theory was put forward to determine the upstream influence area. Under bypass condition, the total number of bypass vehicles is determined based on bypass decision-making index being greater than bypass threshold. Assignment algorithms based on routes were proposed. Using improved Logit model to get the selection probability and the traffic flow of each route, then traffic flow of surrounding links could be obtained. At last, the road network influenced by the accident could be determined by comparing with the level of service of each link under normal condition. The paper takes Beijing-Kunming highway as an example, and the results show that the road network formed by the influenced links was highway traffic accident influence area. Comparing with the actual survey results, correctness of the calculation method is verified. Therefore, the analytical method based on bypass decision-making is applicable to determining highway accident influence area.

Traffic flow is a variable, dynamic and complex system, which is non-linear and unpredictable. The emergence of traffic flow congestion in road traffic is estimated when the traffic load on a specific section of the road in a specific time period is close to exceeding the capacity of the road infrastructure. Under certain conditions, it can be seen in concentrating chaotic traffic flow patterns. The literature review of traffic flow theory and its connection with chaotic features implies that this kind of method has great theoretical and practical value. Researched methods of identifying chaos in traffic flow have shown certain restrictions in their techniques but have suggested guidelines for improving the identification of chaotic parameters in traffic flow. The proposed new method of forecasting congestion in traffic flow uses Wigner-Ville frequency distribution. This method enables the display of a chaotic attractor without the use of reconstruction phase space.

Based on a partial outer convexification approach, which has been successfully applied in the area of mixed-integer optimal control for systems of ordinary or differential algebraic equations, we develop a computationally tractable two-stage solution heuristic. The two-stage approach consists of the solution of a (smoothed) nonlinear programming problem with dynamic constraints and a reconstruction mixed-integer linear program without dynamic constraints. The two-stage approach is founded on a discrete approximation lemma for partial outer convexification, whose grid-independence properties for (smoothed) conservation laws are investigated. We use the two-stage approach to compute traffic light programs for two scenarios on different discretizations and demonstrate that the solution candidates cannot be improved in a reasonable amount of time by global state-of-the-art mixed-integer nonlinear programming solvers. The two-stage solution candidates are not only better than results obtained by global optimization of piecewise linearized traffic flow models but also can be computed at a faster rate.

As road transportation is one of the main contributors, public administrations are facing these problems with a number of complementary policy measures: shift to cleaner modes, new fuels and vehicle technologies, demand management, and the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) applied to transportation. Eco-driving is one of the measures that present large fuel savings at individual level. Although these savings are well documented in the literature, few studies focus on how eco-drivers driving patterns affect the surrounding vehicles and the traffic in general, and more particularly what would be the impact when the number of eco-drivers grows. Using a traffic microsimulation tool, four models in urban context have been built, corresponding to the different types of urban roads. Both the base-case and the parameters setting to simulate eco-driving have been calibrated with real data collected through floating vehicles performing the trips with normal and eco behaviors. In total, 72 scenarios were simulated, varying the type of road, traffic demand, and the percentage of eco-drivers. Then, the CO2 and NOx emissions have been estimated through a microscopic emission model. The results show that in scenarios with low or medium demand levels and increasing number of eco-drivers, the effects are positive in terms of emissions. On the other side, with high percentage of eco-drivers and high traffic demand, the emissions rise. Higher headways and smooth acceleration and decelerations increase congestion, producing higher emissions globally.

Nonlinear State Estimation and Control for Freeway On-Ramp Metering	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CONTROL			English	Article						Macroscopic traffic model; flat system; ramp metering; algebraic methods; estimation; control	EXTENDED KALMAN FILTER; TRAFFIC FLOW; ALGEBRAIC FRAMEWORK; MODEL; WAVES	The work presented in this paper deals with freeway ramp metering using a differential flatness concept. Such an approach is deployed in the cases when the traffic data provided by loop detectors (or any measurements device), are partially unknown or missed, and/or the downstream measurement station, located at the vicinity of the controlled ramp, is faulty. The proposed solution rests on the estimation of the main variables using the revised method of numerical differentiation, i.e., estimation of the derivative of noisy time signals. Such an algebraic approach, which does not need any integration of differential equations, turns out to be quite robust with respect to perturbations inputs and measurements noises. Convincing numerical simulations are provided using a modified second-order continuum macroscopic model. Furthermore, a comparative study using the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which is the most used in the area of traffic state estimators, is proposed in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the strategy.

J	Yang, XF; Lu, Y; Lin, YJ				Yang, Xianfeng; Lu, Yang (Carl); Lin, Yongjie			Optimal Variable Speed Limit Control System for Freeway Work Zone Operations	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Variable speed limit (VSL); Work zone; Optimization; Kalman filter; Traffic flow model	TRAFFIC FLOW	Improving operational safety and efficiency of variable speed limit (VSL) systems are the two core control objectives at work zone areas. In response to such need, this study presents a proactive VSL control model for freeway work zone operations. The proposed model uses an embedded macroscopic traffic flow model to predict the traffic state evolutions over the projected time horizon and to determine the optimal speed limits. In addition, Kalman filter is adopted to correct the prediction inaccuracy in a timely manner. To improve the safety of operations, this study proposes a new control objective function to smooth speed transition along the target freeway sketch by minimizing the difference between actual speeds and ideal speeds. Also, the smoothness of speed transition can help prevent the formation of shockwave and consequently enhance system's operational efficiency. The authors' numerical experiment with a calibrated Verkehr In Stadten-SIMulation-smodell (VISSIM) simulator reveals that the proposed VSL system can significantly reduce the speed variance among different freeway subsegments. The evaluation of several measures of effectiveness (MOEs) also shows the promising results of the VSL system on the improvement of freeway operational efficiency.

Traffic congestion, which is an important research topic on intelligent transportation systems (ITS), is rapidly becoming one of the most serious problems affecting urban areas. This study utilises the vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) technology to build a virtual traffic light (VTL) environment to reduce traffic congestion. The objective of this study is to adjust the traffic light signal time length on-demand to enable vehicles to pass through numerous intersections rapidly, thereby saving energy and reducing fuel consumption. The traffic phase combination algorithm and VTL operation mechanism are also addressed to improve the traffic congestion situation in urban areas. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme can increase the percentage of traffic flow and the average speed of all vehicles in all intersections, thereby saving energy.

Sticking to the idea that the macroscopic characteristics of traffic flow, including the distribution of the driving risk along a road, are ultimately generated by one-to-one interactions among drivers, the model links the personal (i.e., individual) risk to the changes of speeds of single vehicles and implements a probabilistic description of such microscopic interactions in a Boltzmann-type collisional operator. By means of suitable statistical moments of the kinetic distribution function, it is finally possible to recover macroscopic relationships between the average risk and the road congestion, which show an interesting and reasonable correlation with the well-known free and congested phases of the flow of vehicles.

Transport networks which make up a TS encompass various modes of transport, e.g., road vehicles, trains, freight cars, containers, material packages, etc. Together, these modes form streams of traffic in the system. Assuming that the structure of a TS network determines its behavior, in this study, we attempt to develop a declarative model which would enable analysis of the relationships between the structure of a TS and its potential behavior. The problem in question boils down to determining sufficient conditions ensuring smooth traffic flow in a transport network with a fractal structure. The proposed approach, which assumes a recursive, fractal network structure, enables rapid prototyping, in polynomial time, of alternative transport routes and associated schedules. An example is used to illustrate the quantitative and qualitative relationships between the morphological characteristics of the investigated TS structures and the functional parameters of the transport processes carried out in them.

J	Lu, NIW; Noori, M; Liu, Y				Lu, Naiwei; Noori, Mohammad; Liu, Yang			First-passage probability of the deflection of a cable-stayed bridge under long-term site-specific traffic loading	ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Bridge; probability of failure; first passage; weigh in motion; traffic load; overloading	EXTREME-VALUE DISTRIBUTION; RELIABILITY; EXTRAPOLATION; SYSTEM	Long-span bridges suffer from higher traffic loads and the simultaneous presence of multiple vehicles, which in conjunction with the steady traffic growth may pose a threat to the bridge safety. This study presents a methodology for first-passage probability evaluation of long-span bridges subject to stochastic heavy traffic loading. Initially, the stochastic heavy traffic loading was simulated based on long-term weigh-in-motion measurements of a highway bridge in China. A computational framework was presented integrating Rice's level-crossing theory and the first-passage criterion. The effectiveness of the computational framework was demonstrated through a case study of a cable-stayed bridge. Numerical results show that the upper tail fitting of the up-crossing rate is an appropriate description of probability characteristics of the extreme traffic load effects of long-span bridges. The average daily truck traffic growth increases the probability of exceedance due to an intensive heavy traffic flow and results in a higher first-passage probability, but this increased trend is weakening as the continuous increase of the traffic volume. Since the sustained growth of gross vehicle weight has a constant impact on the probability of failure, setting a reasonable threshold overload ratio is an effective scheme as a traffic management to ensure the bridge serviceability.

J	Zhang, J; Cheng, Y; He, SL; Ran, B				Zhang, Jian; Cheng, Yang; He, Shanglu; Ran, Bin			Improving method of real-time offset tuning for arterial signal coordination using probe trajectory data	ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Improving method; signalized intersections; offset tuning; probe trajectory data		In the environment of intelligent transportation systems, traffic condition data would have higher resolution in time and space, which is especially valuable for managing the interrupted traffic at signalized intersections. There exist a lot of algorithms for offset tuning, but few of them take the advantage of modern traffic detection methods such as probe vehicle data. This study proposes a method using probe trajectory data to optimize and adjust offsets in real time. The critical point, representing the changing vehicle dynamics, is first defined as the basis of this approach. Using the critical points related to different states of traffic conditions, such as free flow, queue formation, and dissipation, various traffic status parameters can be estimated, including actual travel speed, queue dissipation rate, and standing queue length. The offset can then be adjusted on a cycle-by-cycle basis. The performance of this approach is evaluated using a simulation network. The results show that the trajectory-based approach can reduce travel time of the coordinated traffic flow when compared with using well-defined offline offset.

In particular, a lattice hydrodynamic model is proposed to capture the impacts from the lateral gaps of the right-side and left-side sites of the considered lattice sites. Linear stability analysis of the proposed model is performed using the perturbation method to obtain the stability condition. Nonlinear analysis of the proposed model is performed using the reductive perturbation method to derive the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation to characterize the density wave propagation. Results from numerical experiments illustrate that the smoothness and stability of the proposed model are improved compared with the model that considers the effect of unilateral gap. Also, the proposed model is able to more quickly dissipate the effect of perturbation occurring in the vehicular traffic flow.

J	Rajabzadeh, Y; Rezaie, AH; Amindavar, H				Rajabzadeh, Yalda; Rezaie, Amir Hossein; Amindavar, Hamidreza			Short-term traffic flow prediction using time-varying Vasicek model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Traffic prediction; Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs); Stochastic differential equation; Time-varying model	COMBINATION METHOD; VOLUME; TREND	This paper provides a two-step approach based on the stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to improve short-term prediction. In the first step of this framework, a Hull White (HW) model is applied to obtain a baseline prediction model from previous days. Then, the extended Vasicek model (EV) is employed for modeling the difference between observations and baseline predictions (residuals) during an individual day. The parameters of this time-varying model are estimated at each sample using the residuals in a short duration of time before the time point of prediction; so it provides a real time prediction. The extracted model recovers the valuable local variation information during each day. The performance of our method in comparison with other methods improves significantly in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean relative error (MRE) for real data from Tehran's highways and the open-access PeMS database. We also demonstrate that the proposed model is appropriate for imputing the missing data in traffic dataset and it is more efficient than the probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA) and k-Nearest neighbors (k-NN) methods.

Thus, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impacts of the CACC system on reducing rear-end collision risks on freeways. The CACC model is firstly developed, which is based on the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM). Then, two surrogated safety measures, derived from the time-to-collision (TTC), denoting time exposed time-to-collision (TET) and time integrated time-to collision (TIT), are introduced for quantifying the collision risks. And the safety effects are analyzed both theoretically and experimentally, by the linear stability analysis and simulations. The theoretical and simulation results conformably indicate that the CACC system brings dramatic benefits for reducing rear-end collision risks (TET and TIT are reduced more than 90%, respectively), when the desired time headway and time delay are set properly. The sensitivity analysis indicates there are few differences among different values of the threshold of TTC and the length of a CACC platoon. The results also show that the safety improvements weaken with the decrease of the penetration rates of CACC on the market and the increase of time delay between platoons. We also evaluate the traffic efficiency of the CACC system with different desired time headway. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Conventional approaches for optimizing lane allocation often ignore fluctuations in traffic demand (TD). This article presents a stochastic model for robust optimal lane allocation of an isolated intersection under stochastic traffic conditions. This model is built in three steps. In the first step, an enhanced lane-based model in the form of a binary mixed-integer nonlinear program is proposed to optimize lane allocation and traffic signals for both vehicles and pedestrians in a unified framework under deterministic traffic conditions. In the second step, a two-level stochastic model is developed to obtain a robust lane allocation that is less sensitive to traffic flow fluctuations considering the flexibility of traffic signals. In the third step, the two-level model is further transformed into a TD-based stochastic model in a two-phase form to reduce the solution dimension for efficient computation. A TD-based genetic algorithm procedure is presented for solvability. Numerical studies are conducted to validate the model formulations and solution algorithms.

The dynamics of European cities are however different. Cites such as Lithuanian, Slovakian and Polish ones will rapidly increase traffic flows and car ownership at fast pace. Also in most of Western Europe, even if at lower rates, private mobility is increasing. In some cities, however, car use and car ownership are finally decreasing, also thanks to policies implemented. Of course, an increase of traffic flows poses problems in terms of street space, pollution and liveability of cities. Sustainable integration of all kinds of transport into the urban development process is one of the most effective actions in the hands of city planners. The coordination between the planning of residential and business development areas and the expansion of public transport and its hierarchical integration is however a difficult but necessary exercise. Transport modelling tools, in particular, need important advancements to integrate transport and land use in simulations. This article analyses the main challenges in the use of transport models to support the construction of city plans by means of two case studies of Milan and Vilnius. The analysis deals both with traditional aspects, such as the proper simulation of multimodal choices, the level of detail of zoning, the issues associated to the simulation of traffic management policies. Then, we will focus on two aspects still open: the integration of transport modelling and economic assessment or ranking of actions, and the inclusion of land use changes in the modelling.

In order to alleviate congestion and reduce economic costs, it is important to predict the current and future traffic flows of road network nodes. Unfortunately, there are some challenges that make this work difficult. Firstly, the traffic flow is changeable and difficult to predict. Secondly, there are massive traffic data, but the quality of data is not high. For instance, when the traffic lights are just turning green, the speed of the vehicle can't represent the speed of the road vehicle. To this end, this paper proposes a traffic congestion prediction and detection algorithm based on data analysis. One of the most important parts of our algorithm is a short-term prediction method to predict the future traffic flow, which is called SRBDP. Moreover, we designed data characteristics and use clustering methods and a small amount of human intervention to determine the historical data congestion situation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through a real traffic data set.

Previous research on vehicle trajectory recovery mostly focuses on recovering trajectory with low-sampling-rate GPS coordinates by retrieving road traffic flow patterns from collected GPS information. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them considered using on-road taxicabs as mobile video surveillance cameras as well as the time-varying characteristics of vehicle traveling and road traffic flow patterns, therefore not suitable for recovering trajectories of hit-and-run vehicles. With this insight, we model the travel time-cost of a road segment during various time periods precisely with LNDs (Logarithmic Normal Distributions), then use LSNDs (Log Skew Normal Distributions) to approximate the time-cost of an urban trip during various time periods. We propose a novel approach to calculate possible location and time distribution of the hit-and-run vehicle in parallel, select the optimal taxicab to verify the distribution by uploading and checking video clips of this taxicab, finally refine the restoring trajectory in a parallel and recursive manner. We evaluate our solution on real-world taxicab and road surveillance system datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms alternative solutions in terms of accuracy ratio of vehicle tracking.

Starting with the installation of the first traffic signal in London, England in the nineteenth century, signal control technology has evolved steadily. Nowadays, traffic signal control is not only used to provide the right-of-way at intersections, but also to improve traffic efficiency by means of minimizing waiting times and optimizing traffic flow. In this paper we present recent efforts to introduce different types of traffic signal control for isolated intersections into the microscopic traffic simulator TraffSim. The developed traffic control model supports both time-based and actuated control strategies, and allows for a straightforward configuration of customized control logic. Furthermore, it provides the possibility to easily add new control strategies on demand, owing to a flexible data model. We demonstrate the applicability of selected control strategies by simulating a signalized four-way intersection under varying traffic flows.

In this paper, a random forest estimator was proposed to predict travel time in a network. The estimator was trained using two years of historical travel time data for a case study network in St. Louis, Missouri. Both temporal and spatial effects were considered in the modeling process. The random forest models predicted travel times accurately during both congested and uncongested traffic conditions. The computational times for the models were low, thus useful for real-time traffic management and traveler information applications.

Traffic flow prediction has a long history and is still a difficult problem due to intrinsically highly nonlinear and stochastic characteristics of complex transportation systems. In this paper, we employ the long shortterm memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to analyze the effects of various input settings on the LSTM prediction performances. Flow, speed, and occupancy at the same detector station are used as inputs to predict traffic flow. The results show that the inclusion of occupancy/speed information may help to enhance the performance of the model overall. Further, we include as inputs traffic variables from the upstream and/or downstream detector stations for traffic flow prediction. The evaluation of such spatial-temporal input interactions show that the inclusion of both downstream and upstream traffic information is useful in improving prediction accuracy.

Conventionally, the FD has been estimated by measurements from detectors which are fixed on roads. Therefore, it has been difficult to estimate FDs over wide spatial domain, due to high installation and maintenance cost of detectors. In this study, a method of estimating FD using measurements from GPS-equipped probe vehicles (also known as connected vehicles) is developed. Specifically, the proposed method estimate values of free-flow speed and backward wave speed of so-called triangular FD based on trajectories of multiple probe vehicles which are randomly sampled. Since probe vehicles can collect data from wide spatial domain, it can be expected that the proposed method enable to estimate FD continuously in large area. The proposed method was verified by using actual traffic data in an urban expressway.

Short-term travel time prediction uses real travel time values within a sliding time window to predict travel time one or several time step(s) in future. However, the nonstationary properties and abrupt changes of travel time series make challenges in obtaining accurate and reliable predictions. Recent achievements of deep learning approaches in classification and regression shed a light on innovations of time series prediction. This study establishes a series of long short-term memory neural networks with deep neural layers (LSTM-DNN) using 16 settings of hyperparameters and investigates their performance on a 90-day travel time dataset from Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Then competitive LSTM-DNN models are tested along with linear models such as linear regression, Ridge and Lasso regression, ARIMA and DNN models under 10 sets of sliding windows and predicting horizons via the same dataset. The results demonstrate the advantage of LSTM-DNN models while showing different characteristics of these deep learning models with different settings of hyperparameters, providing insights for optimizing the structures.

This can impact traffic flow operations, especially the roadway capacity and flow stability. It is of paramount importance to understand and predict the implications of automated driving systems on traffic flow at the early design phase to avoid disruptive impacts on traffic. String stability properties of automated vehicle platoons are a fundamental block to understand their traffic flow stability impact. Previous reports on string stability analysis focussed on homogeneous vehicle strings and simplify the time delays in vehicle systems. This work propose an analytical approach to determine string stability conditions for non-connected vehicle platoons with heterogeneous parameters. To this end, a third-order linear vehicle dynamics model is used in the control design and Laplace transform of the spacing and speed error dynamics in time domain to frequency domain enables the determination of sufficient string stability criteria of heterogeneous vehicle strings. The analytical string stability conditions give new insights into the relationship between the string stability properties of vehicle strings in relation to the system properties of time delays and controller design parameters of feedback gains and desired time gap. Analytical results are verified via systematic simulation of both homogeneous and heterogeneous strings. Simulations demonstrate the predictive power of the analytical string stability conditions.

This type of ADS is typically limited to restricted-access freeways only, that is, the transition from manual to automated modes takes place only after the ramp merging process is completed manually. One major challenge to extend the automation to ramp merging is that the automated vehicle needs to incorporate and optimize long-term objectives (e.g. successful and smooth merge) when near-term actions must be safely executed. Moreover, the merging process involves interactions with other vehicles whose behaviors are sometimes hard to predict but may influence the merging vehicle's optimal actions. To tackle such a complicated control problem, we propose to apply Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques for finding an optimal driving policy by maximizing the long-term reward in an interactive environment. Specifically, we apply a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to model the interactive environment, from which an internal state containing historical driving information is conveyed to a Deep Q-Network (DQN). The DQN is used to approximate the Q-function, which takes the internal state as input and generates Q-values as output for action selection. With this DRL architecture, the historical impact of interactive environment on the long-term reward can be captured and taken into account for deciding the optimal control policy. The proposed architecture has the potential to be extended and applied to other autonomous driving scenarios such as driving through a complex intersection or changing lanes under varying traffic flow conditions.

Our goal is to enhance the offline route planning and driving decision adjustment based on the first-hand traffic information, especially during poor Internet connection moments. Specifically, our model helps to select the optimal speed on a road, the optimal distance for timing to brake, and the safe distance from other vehicles to keep. Moreover, our model can also assist neighboring autonomous vehicles by communicating required information through Ad-Hoc network communications or through a centralized cloud. In detail, we first focus on the unique characteristic of traffic flow (such as traffic rule, avoid collision behaviours), and then build a comprehensive model to handle multiple scenarios. Technically, our model uses density functions of velocities, the differential equation of traffic flows, and the traffic viscosity with information collected from the traffic flow, the distances between vehicles, the amount and density of vehicle, the instant velocity, the speed limit, and the momentum to analysis the the driving scene. We evaluate our model with real traffic data collected by in-vehicle CPS sensors to the proposed nearby traffic flow model. Results show that our work can accurately conduct offline estimation on nearby traffic signal influence, and reveal the correlations among velocity, density and (spatial and temporal) location to adjust route during runtime.

With the increase of density, the critical density of the system is larger and the influence of driver behavior on traffic flow is increased.When the driver's interference factor is below the p=0.8 ratio, the impact of the system's flow is tiny and the purpose of safe driving is achieved by observing the trend of traffic.However, when the driver interference factor ratio is large, in the high density area, the system traffic will be more affected, the traffic than the above situation is smaller.

Mining traffic data is a challenging task that can be used for traffic forecasting and improving traffic flow. In this paper, we explore and analyse the historical traffic big data to extract the informative patterns. Three years (2013 to 2015) real traffic data was collected from the city of Porto, Portugal. We developed a Java based traffic data observation (TDO) tool for visualising traffic data, which can filter and extract expressive patterns from the traffic big data based on input features. Then, graphs are generated by TDO from the traffic data to find the historical averages of traffic flow. Finally, we have applied regression models: Linear Regression, Sequential Minimal Optimisation (SMO) Regression, and M5 Base Regression Tree on the traffic data to find annual average daily traffic (AADT) and compare their results. Also, we have used regression trees to find the traffic patterns. The goal is to find the abnormal traffic patterns from the historical traffic big data and analyse them to improve the traffic management system (TMS).

The emergence of autonomous vehicles and IoT based intelligent vehicular networks has created an opportunity to develop an efficient traffic scheduling algorithm that eliminates the need for traffic signals. There is now a possibility of a more flexible traffic management system that schedules vehicles dynamically depending on their speeds and the behaviour of other vehicles within the system. This paper proposes an algorithm for automatic road traffic control that eliminates traffic signals and avoids human intervention. A unique approach is introducedwherein vehicles are clusteredinto batches dynamically. These batches are then scheduled to ensure collision free movement of vehicles while reducing fuel consumption. The algorithm is developed to run on a centralized server in an environment with fully autonomous vehicles. An experimental setup demonstrating a scaled down version of a realistic traffic scenario is constructed to observe the behaviour of the algorithm at a microscopic scale. Also, a simulation based model is developed and the algorithm is validated for higher traffic density. The results presented in the paper prove the effectiveness of the algorithm in maintaining a balance between traffic flow efficiency and energy consumption.

Smart traffic monitoring involves real-time traffic scene analysis from CCTV cameras to detect and identify stalled vehicles and measure traffic density on roads. The scene analysis essentially necessitates tracking and counting the number of moving and stopped vehicles as they progress along the image sequence by utilizing computer vision techniques. The obtained features along with manually annotated traffic data are translated to a higher level information using semantic web technologies, thus providing a common platform to exchange the information. As the perceptual modelling of traffic data involves media patterns so we have employed Multimedia Web Ontology Language (MOWL) for the semantic interpretation and to tackle inherent uncertainties involved in these media documents. MOWL supports hierarchical probabilistic reasoning framework and utilizes time-varying Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) to perform semantic comparison and predict the evolution of changing situations. In this paper, we discuss the key tasks of vision and probabilistic reasoning components that provide a feasible solution to identify the cause of traffic jam. The proposed approach can be used to trigger an automatic warning or alerts to traffic authorities in case any anomalous activity is encountered and guide users to take some different route to avoid jam. The experimental results shows effectiveness of real-time vehicle monitoring to assess congestion on road and offer user an assistive environment to operate.

By creating a vehicular network, each vehicle can exchange information to inform drivers in other vehicles about the current status of the traffic flow or a dangerous situation. Multi-hop communications is an effective method that can be used for information exchange over distances greater than the transmission range of the transmitting vehicle. However, it is a great challenge to ensure a stable multi-hop communication link with a low delivery delay due to the high mobility of the vehicles involved. The goal of this paper is to design a TDMA aware Routing Protocol for Multi-hop wireless vehicular ad hoc networks (TRPM) in order to provide the ability to transmit/receive packets over long distances. The proposed routing scheme is based on a medium access control protocol, in which the intermediate vehicles are selected based on the TDMA scheduling. The simulation results reveal that our routing protocol significantly outperforms other protocols in terms of average end-to-end delay, average number of relay vehicles and the average delivery ratio.

This paper will improve the precision of data expansion algorithm presented by Lederman R and Wynter L. (2011) using Kalman Filter during real-time estimation. Computation is composed of a heavyweight offline calibration and a lightweight online estimation. During offline calibration, traffic flow is supposed to correspond to user-equilibrium. All historic link flow at a given time window can be derived by solving a mathematical programming. Splitting probability at a specific intersection would then be obtained. Furthermore, all real-time link flow could be estimated preliminarily under the assumption of splitting probability which is supposed to be identical at the same time window and intersection. Afterwards, link flow will be amended by Kalman filter. Simulation is implemented on an urban road network located in XuanWu District, Nanjing. The precision of this algorithm shows that while real-time traffic data lacking of 80% and also influenced by a stochastic disturbance, the average relative error (ARE) is less than 16%. The value of ARE is under 10% while 80% of real-time link value is observed.

However, at the same time, recent studies in Europe, US and other countries have stressed the fact that cyclist fatalities are still alarmingly frequent, and lead researchers to want improved knowledge about bicycle traffic flow theory and modeling. The challenge is to make available robust analysis methods and models for building effective and safe infrastructures, for increased cycling mobility combined with positive effects on transport and social systems. This work presents the application of a procedure for fitting bicycle time headways and bicycle speed distributions from traffic data collected along bike tracks. The general frame of the procedure, together with functional components and their mutual interactions, are reported here. The effects of flow rate in both directions (analyzed and opposite) on time headway and vehicle speed distributions were examined. The possibility of associating the probability density functions of bicycle time headways and speeds in various cycling traffic conditions is a significant and interesting advance with respect to previous works. The procedure was applied to cross-sections belonging to the cycling network of the city of Bologna (Italy). The analysis compared a set of headway and speed distribution models, highlighting their goodness-of-fit with reference to empirical distributions. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The research on NFD was finalizes for applications connected to congestion control by means of gating, pricing schemes, multi-modal network analysis, freight vehicle routing. The control of urban road networks by means of NFD is a promising research area, where new methods and models are proposed to reduce traffic congestion and delay. The general objective of the research is to investigate if and in which measure the NFD profile (estimated by means of observed traffic data) changes according to the control strategy adopted for junction signals in an urban area. The first empirical evidences presented in this paper are related to a portion of Santander urban area, where a specific zone has been identified according to traffic characteristics and land uses. Data from traffic loops are collected and correlated with the signal control plans during a working day at link (flow-density diagrams) and network levels (NFD). Some preliminary considerations are derived from the empirical results. The cycle length with a fixed regulation plan does not influence the main traffic variables (flow, density) at link and network level, but these results cannot be generalized. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The proposed optimisation method is an application of the Simulated Annealing meta-heuristic. Some numerical applications are proposed, specifically analysing 'two step' optimisation (synchronisation), and'one step' optimisation (scheduled synchronisation), for off-line (pre-timed strategy) and on-line applications (on-line computation strategy). A grid network was considered as case study and the effectiveness of the proposed strategies were evaluated by comparing the obtained results with those computed through commercial (benchmark) and in-house codes.

Automated and connected vehicles (ACVs) have received a great deal of attention. Indeed, their full market penetration will be desirable in terms of traffic efficiency, as ACVs can efficiently drive by precisely and instantaneously communicating, recognizing, and reacting to other ACVs. However, it is not yet certain whether traffic efficiency is improved in mixed traffic where ratio of manual vehicles is substantially high. This is because, for example, ACVs in mixed traffic may require excessive safety clearance, as they have to rely on relatively imperfect vision/radar-based vehicle recognition. Meanwhile, relative benefit of ACVs compared to manual vehicles would be proportional to travel time (because the most significant merit of ACVs for their driver is comfortable in-vehicle experience) and therefore severity of congestion. Consequently, equilibrium states of a myopic car market may suffer severer congestion and higher social cost than the current state-this is congestion paradox. This kind of phenomena can be considered as a consequence of market penetration of a good with network externality or social interaction, where market penetration of ACVs is endogenously determined based on their cost/benefit which depend on current number of ACVs users. This study analyzes this problem under idealized conditions. Specifically, a theoretical model of endogenous market penetration of ACVs considering changes in value of time, travel time, and transportation fare, which are the most direct impacts of ACVs to the society, is formulated. Then, its market dynamics is analyzed. Finally, strategic policies to avoid congestion paradox and achieve social optimum are proposed. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

These GNSS devices can operate offline or online. Off-line, when the GIS database is installed in the device and there is not any information regarding the actual traffic flow, in that case the program always calculates the same route between two places. Online, when the actual traffic flow information is available, in that case there is the possibility of the calculation of the optimal route in real time. Based on the above options, the driver's route-choice decision can be static, dynamic or informed. Static, when the driver always follows the same route: either without using a GNSS device (choosing the usual way) or with an offline device. Dynamic, when the driver chooses the way conforming to only real time visual information on the spot without any navigation tool or external information, and decides according to traffic density. Informed, when the GNSS device calculates the optimal route in line with the current traffic flow information. The aim of this study is the present the influence of the proportion of different route-choice decision modes. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Towards Fair and Efficient Traffic Flow Coordination Mechanisms for 2+1 Roadways	20TH EURO WORKING GROUP ON TRANSPORTATION MEETING, EWGT 2017	Transportation Research Procedia		English	Proceedings Paper	20th EURO-Working-Group-on-Transportation Meeting (EWGT)	SEP 04-06, 2017	Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Transportat Engn & Vehicle Engn, Budapest, HUNGARY	EURO Working Grp Transportat	Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Transportat Engn & Vehicle Engn	fairness; satisfaction; rural roadways; 2+1 systems; coordination; microscopic simulation; preferences		In 2013, 2+1 roadways have become mandatory for newly constructed rural roadways in Germany. The steady trend towards autonomous vehicles and vehicle-to-X (V2X) communication will enable new automated traffic coordination mechanisms. In our research, we study how traffic flow on 2+1 roadways can be improved by using such mechanisms for coordinating the usage of overtaking lanes. Conflicts between vehicles on 2+1 roadways arise due to (1) differing capabilities (e.g. maximum speed), and (2) conflicting preferences of drivers (e.g. desired speed). These conflicts can lead to poor use of resources, and ultimately in time loss both from an individual vehicle and aggregated system perspective. To foster acceptance of coordination mechanisms, it is important to not only consider the system perspective but also to ensure some level of driver satisfaction and fairness, e.g. if vehicles are denied access to the overtaking lane in favour of faster vehicles, this raises questions regarding the acceptance of external coordination. While there is some research studying microscopic optimisation of traffic flows on rural 2+1 roads and intersections, there has been only little research focusing on driver satisfaction and fairness of mechanisms. In this work, we present the results of a pre-study on simulated 2+1 manoeuvres conducted using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) suite to estimate optimisation potentials of coordination. Preliminary results indicate potentials to reduce driver dissatisfaction while maintaining fairness. We analyse optimisation potentials and propose a model which combines driver satisfaction and fairness of coordination, aiming at increasing acceptance of autonomous vehicle coordination.

An integrated low-cost road traffic and air pollution monitoring platform to assess vehicles' air quality impact in urban areas	20TH EURO WORKING GROUP ON TRANSPORTATION MEETING, EWGT 2017	Transportation Research Procedia		English	Proceedings Paper	20th EURO-Working-Group-on-Transportation Meeting (EWGT)	SEP 04-06, 2017	Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Transportat Engn & Vehicle Engn, Budapest, HUNGARY	EURO Working Grp Transportat	Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Fac Transportat Engn & Vehicle Engn	Urban air pollution; Integrated monitoring platform; Low-cost sensors; Road traffic air quality impact; Statistical models.		An integrated monitoring platform (IMP) was developed for real-time monitoring of traffic flows and related air pollution in urban areas. The IMP includes: (i) an air quality monitoring unit, integrating the "Arduino" open-source technology with low-cost and high-resolution sensors, to measure air pollutant concentrations; (ii) a traffic monitoring device, equipped with a camera sensor and a video analysis software, to detect vehicles' counts, speed and category; (iii) a spatial data infrastructure, composed of a central GeoDatabase, a GIS engine, and a web interface, for data storage and management. The IMP was tested in Florence (Italy) by installing sensor devices at a road site where a 1-year measuring campaign was carried out. A reference meteorological station in the city centre was used to provide observations of wind speed and direction, air temperature, and relative humidity. In this work, a statistical analysis was performed to investigate the influence of local road traffic and meteorological conditions on CO, NO2 and CO2 concentrations. Two different methods were applied: a linear regression model and an artificial neural network. To investigate the role played by emissions from road traffic, the influence of all drivers by period of the year (cold vs. warm months) and day of the week (weekdays vs. weekends) was analysed. As a result, the contribution of local road traffic on pollutant concentrations proved to be lower than meteorological parameters. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This system is envisioned to provide a transport service within a city area with a seamless door-to-door connection for all passengers' origins and destinations. ATs can drive themselves on the roads with reduced direct human input. which allow taxis to satisfy the next trip or park themselves while waiting for a request if needed. We propose an integer programming model to define the routing of the vehicles according to a profit maximization function while depending on dynamic travel times which vary with the flow of the ATs. This will be especially important when the number of automated vehicles circulating on the roads is so high that will cause traffic congestion. The total profit involves the system revenue, vehicle fuel costs. vehicle depreciation costs, parking costs, penalties for unsatisfied trips and passengers' congestion delay. The model is applied to a small case study and the results allow assessing the impact of the ATs movements on traffic congestion and the profitability of the system. Even with a small case study, it is possible to conclude that having in consideration the effect of the vehicle flows on travel time leads to different results in terms of the system profit, the parking cost and the driving distance which points out the importance of this type of models.

However, the transferability of HCM recommendations for heterogenous traffic condition represents a significant research issue as they are often not suitable to adequately explain the traffic complexities of a mixed-traffic state. This research investigates the suitability of HCM equations for determining the entry capacity of a four-legged roundabout under mixed traffic condition and proposes a methodology for validating and calibrating HCM equations for performance evaluation. Data corresponding to traffic composition, traffic volume, critical gap and follow-up time have been extracted from the video records collected at two roundabouts. The relationship between entry flow and circulatory flow has been plotted from the observed data when there is a complete saturation in the approach leg and depicted that it follows a negative exponential behavior. It implies that the entry capacity reduces exponentially with the increase in circulating flow. The critical gap has been estimated by various methods such as Maximum Likelihood Method (MLM), Root Mean Square (RMS) method and Probability Equilibrium Method (PEM). Further, a stream equivalent critical gap of 1.60 seconds and stream equivalent follow-up time of 1.24 seconds have been derived due to the mixed traffic scenario at the study location. A multiplicative adjustment factor of 1.1 is suggested for the use of HCM 2010 equation directly to estimate entry capacity under heterogeneous traffic condition. The study results may use for planning and designing of roundabout under mixed-traffic flow condition. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Mathew, Sonu; Dhamaniya, Ashish; Arkatkar, S.

Network capacity in a transportation system becomes an important measurement for transport planning and management because it addresses its capability to satisfy an efficient network traffic flow reducing the inefficiency of congestion phenomena. This work provides a discussion of road urban transport network capacity including existing definitions in literature and the validation of new measurement methods. The study explores some of the properties of network-wide traffic flow relationships in a large-scale complex urban street network using real-time simulated results obtained from a dynamic traffic assignment model, periodically updated by data from radar sensors through rolling horizon technics. The basic variables used in the methodology, such as network flows and speeds, are characterized using a network model calibrated in the urban area of Catania (Italy). For a comprehensive yet simple analysis, equations and graphs are utilized to resume the obtained results related to different days and several time intervals of the day. This procedure proved to be suitable to investigate the properties of network-level traffic flow relationships and concluding remarks include suggestions for further research in this highly promising area.

The current paper presents an attempt to reduce the noise level created by the road traffic along some main roads in the city of Sibiu, Romania by suggesting ways to optimize the traffic flow. The number of cars and the resulting noise levels were recorded in a key area of Sibiu. The noise levels were compared to standards and to measurements taken in areas with less traffic. Then, they were fed, together with road geometry data, into a specialized simulation software that allowed the computer-aided reproduction of the traffic flow, but also the modifying of conditions such as the road geometry to achieve, coupled with a multicriterial analysis, an optimization of the pedestrian and road traffic flow in view of a reduced noise pollution.

In particular, in order to alleviate serious road congestions, traffic jams, and stampedes, it is essential to predict and be informed about the occurrence of an event as soon as possible. When we know an event occurrence in advance, some of those who are not interested in the event might change their plans and/or might take a detour to avoid to get involved in a heavy congestion. In this context, this paper presents an early event detection technique using GPS trajectories collected from periodic-cars, which are vehicles periodically traveling on a pre-scheduled route with a pre-determined departure time, such as a transit bus, shuttle, garbage truck, or municipal patrol car. Using these trajectories, which provide the real-time and continuous traffic flow and speed, our technique detects large-scale events in advance, without incurring any privacy invasion. The behavior of periodic-cars shows a certain sign of a large-scale event before attendees gather around a venue because traffic can be slowed around the venue before the event occurrence. We evaluated our method using over 7, 000-bus data from January to May in 2015 in Beijing, which we compared with the check-in data collected from a social network service.

These technologies create possibilities for advanced AI-based traffic management techniques. Developing such techniques is an important challenge and opportunity for the AI community as it requires synergy between experts in game theory, multiagent systems, behavioral science, and flow optimization. This paper takes a step in this direction by considering traffic flow optimization through setting and broadcasting of dynamic and adaptive tolls. Previous tolling schemes either were not adaptive in realtime, not scalable to large networks, or did not optimize traffic flow over an entire network. Moreover, previous schemes made strong assumptions on observable demands, road capacities and users homogeneity. This paper introduces Delta-tolling, a novel tolling scheme that is adaptive in real-time and able to scale to large networks. We provide theoretical evidence showing that under certain assumptions Delta-tolling is equal to Marginal-Cost Tolling, which provably leads to system-optimal, and empirical evidence showing that Delta-tolling increases social welfare (by up to 33%) in two traffic simulators with markedly different modeling assumptions.

The possibility of realization forecasting methods for the transportation system is an important element of traffic management in the city. In the article the forecast for future periods on the basis of cyclical fluctuations in the traffic flow using the method of harmonic analysis will be calculated. The forecast data obtained from the intersection of the Slowackiego and Lobzowska street were registered with an interval of time during one week. Cyclical fluctuations are typical for the period exceeding one year. The article aims to prove the application of harmonic analysis for hourly periods in forecasting traffic flow at the intersection. The forecast is confirmed using mean absolute percentage error for long-time periods.

Multi-step ahead of the ability to predict the traffic flow is particularly important. The monitoring data of road traffic flow is characterized by uncertainty and non-linearity. And using the existing methods to carry out multi-step prediction error will be very large. In this paper, based on these feature, we propose GRU neural network and autocorrelation analysis for multi-step prediction. We make this model dynamically update the network with the input of the measured real-time data, namely on-line prediction, to work effectively and constantly. Through the theoretical derivation and simulation analysis, it is shown that the prediction accuracy of the proposed GRU prediction model is improved. The model can be used as an effective method for multi-step traffic prediction.

J	Osowski, C; Waterson, B				Osowski, Chris; Waterson, Ben			Establishing the validity of cycle path capacity assumptions in the Highway Capacity Manual	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						Agent-based modelling; bicycles; cycle infrastructure; simulation; social force model	DESIGN	Cycle mode share increase is widely desired, but highway design practitioners lack the numerical tools to deliver infrastructure, instead relying on design standards and intuition, with little literature basis. As a case in point, the US Highway Capacity Manual (which is well used internationally) has developed levels of service for cycle infrastructure that are, at their core, based on an assumption of noninteraction between multiple cyclists. This paper uses a modified implementation of the Social Force Model to test the validity of this assumption. Necessary changes such as the consideration of acceleration characteristics and minimum maintainable speed are included. The resulting model produces valid outcomes in keeping with established traffic flow properties, reflecting three-phase traffic flow theory and the ability for the stochastic elements in traffic flow to cause flow breakdown. The developed simulation indicates that there is a fundamental difference in outcome if cyclists are assumed to have a fixed speed versus one they can change given their surroundings. This difference in outcomes is found to exist within the range of literature design flow capacities for bicycle infrastructure and also yields emergent outcomes that align closely with those known behaviors of highway vehicles, which intuitively transfer to cyclists. These findings reinforce the standing need for large-scale empirical studies to determine the basic numerical and behavioral parameters for cyclists, upon which all design ultimately rests.

The performance of the traffic management system is presented as a relation of the traffic flow performance and the traffic safety impacts. These performances and the maintenance costs are expressed in euros. In this business-case the performance of one 5km long representative express lane is calculated as a case study with relations between the maintenance costs, reliability and the performance of dynamic traffic management systems of this express lane. The purpose of this representative model is to test methods with regard to how the maintenance costs, reliability and the performance of one representative 5 km long express lane can be modeled with the RCMCost application. This paper presents new method how to calculate the total social costs (maintenance plus traffic jams) of any dynamic traffic management system using the results of RCM calculation of representative express lane, the practical evaluation studies of the effects of traffic management studies and historical traffic data.

Numerous researchers have paid much attention to it in the past decades. However, the performance of traditional traffic flow prediction methods is not satisfactory, for those methods cannot describe the complicated nonlinearity and uncertainty of the traffic flow precisely. Neural networks were used to deal with the issues, but most of them failed to capture the deep features of traffic flow and be sensitive enough to the time-aware traffic flow data. In this paper, we propose a deep bi-directional long short-term memory (DBL) model by introducing long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network, residual connections, deeply hierarchical networks and bi-directional traffic flow. The proposed model is able to capture the deep features of traffic flow and take full advantage of time-aware traffic flow data. Additionally, we introduce the DBL model, regression layer and dropout training method into a traffic flow prediction architecture. We evaluate the prediction architecture on the dataset from Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed model for short-term traffic flow prediction obtains high accuracy and generalizes well compared with other models.

Using a Separable Convolutional Neural Network for Large-Scale Transportation Network Speed Prediction	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER MODELING AND SIMULATION (ICCMS 2018)			English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Computer Modeling and Simulation (ICCMS)	JAN 08-10, 2018	Sydney, AUSTRALIA	Int Assoc Comp Sci & Informat Technol		Traffic speed prediction; deep learning; convolutional neural network; separable convolution; spatiotemporal features; transportation network	TRAFFIC FLOW	This paper proposes the reduction of the convergence time on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method for traffic speed prediction, without reducing the performance of speed prediction method. The proposed method contains two procedures: The first one is to convert the traffic network data to images; in this case the speed variable will be transformed. The second step of the procedure presents a modification of the CNN method for speed prediction in which a separable convolution is used to reduce the number of parameters. This separable convolution helps to reducing the convergence time of speed predictions for large-scale transportation network. The proposal is evaluated with real data from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS), obtained through sensors. The results show that Separable Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) reduces convergence time of CNN method without losing the performance of the predictions of traffic speed in a largescale transportation network.

Therefore, we established a microscopic traffic simulation model to analyze the dynamic change of service traffic volume under the different service levels of the large vehicles, and the grading standard on service level of evacuation road intersections for container terminals could also be determined. The results showed that the average delay and the queue length could be effected obviously by the rate of large vehicles when the loading degree was within 0.7 similar to 0.9. And the case study demonstrated that compared with the recommended values of evaluation index for road intersection service level from Code for Planning Intersections on Urban Roads, the proposed evaluation values would be more reasonable for container terminals.

Funded by the Energy Efficient Mobility Systems (EEMS) program of the Vehicle Technologies Office of the US Department of Energy, we performed a preliminary investigation on the modelling and control framework in context of urban network of signalized intersections. In specific, we developed a recursive input-output traffic queueing models. The queue formation can be modeled as a stochastic process where the number of vehicles entering each intersection is a random number. Further, we proposed a preliminary B-Spline stochastic modelling and control for a one-way single-lane corridor traffic system based on theory of stochastic distribution control that shapes the PDF of the queue length.

Although it is clear that the software-hardware components embedded in such vehicles may react in a timely manner to reduce errors attributed to human drivers, their timely adaptation to dynamic changes in their environment for safe navigation needs a convincing proof or at least a simulated validation. This paper proposes the use of Adaptive Traffic Control System (ATCS), and explains through a simulation platform how it can enforce safety and promote optimized travel on the road populated by vehicles with and without human drivers. A mathematical models for vehicle behavior near road intersections is given as the foundation of ATCS simulator. The simulation results on a variety of traffic patterns is presented followed by the discussion on the limitation of the current work and challenges in extending the simulator.

Traffic congestion avoiding can be achieved by knowing traffic flow and then conducting transportation planning. Achieving traffic flow prediction is challenging as the prediction is affected by many complex factors such as inter-region traffic, vehicles' relations, and sudden events. However, as the mobile data of vehicles has been widely collected by sensor-embedded devices in transportation systems, it is possible to predict the traffic flow by analysing mobile data. This study proposes a deep learning based prediction algorithm, DeepTFP, to collectively predict the traffic flow on each and every traffic road of a city. This algorithm uses three deep residual neural networks to model temporal closeness, period, and trend properties of traffic flow. Each residual neural network consists of a branch of residual convolutional units. DeepTFP aggregates the outputs of the three residual neural networks to optimize the parameters of a time series prediction model. Contrast experiments on mobile time series data from the transportation system of England demonstrate that the proposed DeepTFP outperforms the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture based method in prediction accuracy.

With the continued growth in number of vehicles, it can be clearly seen that the existing road traffic management systems have reached their limits and can't cope with the daily challenges in a efficient way through the road jamming, remarkable increase in the number of accidents and traffic-related pollution. Seen in this perspective, this paper proposes a global system based on wireless sensor networks for managing road traffic networks of different scales; it therefore presents a functional and deployment architecture of the system. The paper presents also a simple use case of the proposed system in order to explain how to monitor the traffic flow. At the end, a real world implementation of some of the components, namely visualization and Traffic Modelling and Analytics that model the traffic flow dynamics evolution were provided.

This model is typically continuous and traffic micro-simulator updates its vehicle positions by a numerical integration scheme. While increasing the order of the scheme should lead to more accurate results, most micro-simulators employ the simplest Euler rule. In our contribution, inspired by [1], we will provide some additional details that have to be addressed when implementing higher-order numerical integration schemes for CFMs and we will show that the theoretical gain of higher-order methods is unfortunately masked out by the stochastic nature of real-world traffic flow.

Its objective is to demonstrate the possibilities and efficiency of using traffic flow modelling when assessing the importance of the road infrastructure object and quantification of the influence of the object's functionality loss on the traffic load of a part of road infrastructure. For comparison, we tracked the capacity and performance parameters of the road infrastructure under standard conditions and particularly in the situation when the operation of the traffic system is limited (e.g. shutdown of a bridge). The solution of the situation at the shutdown of an important element of infrastructure is possible to be designed, verified and modified using appropriately devised adequate virtual models. By this means, it is possible to predict the significance of the shutdown - criticality and influence of the loss of the functionality considering the transport serviceability parameters of the road infrastructure in the affected area.

The role of confidence interval is the expression of estimate accuracy for on-time probability. The accuracy is expressed as width of the confidence interval of on-time probability estimate. On-time probability is interpreted by variable called weighted estimate of on-time probability, which also includes distribution of mail flows within geographical stratification according to disjunctive set of defined postal areas. The rate of variability caused by used sample design is expressed by dispersion parameters of sample variance in various forms and by design factors regarding particular samples. The main objective of this paper is to research sensitivity of confidention interval to changes in sample variance parameters considering limit value of interval width related to acceptable accuracy level. Measurement system created by sample of test postal items flows is based on real traffic mail flows on fixed postal transportation network. The results will come out from modelling of this measurement system and evaluation of postal transport network efficiency by such system is an important managerial tool for quality of service. Analysis of mentioned sensitivity can help to find the most appropriate sample design.

A statistical method for estimating predictable differences between daily traffic flow profiles	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Functional Data Analysis; Functional Linear Models; Systematic variations; Traffic flow profiles; Day-to-day variability	TRAVEL-TIME RELIABILITY; FUNCTIONAL REGRESSION; NETWORK EQUILIBRIUM; STOCHASTIC DEMAND; USER EQUILIBRIUM; ADVERSE WEATHER; LINEAR-MODELS; F-TEST; CAPACITY; VARIABILITY	It is well known that traffic flows in road networks may vary not only within the day but also between days. Existing models including day-to-day variability usually represent all variability as unpredictable fluctuations. In reality, however, some of the differences in flows on a road may be predictable for transport planners with access to historical data. For example, flow profiles may be systematically different on Mondays compared to Fridays due to predictable differences in underlying activity patterns. By identifying days of the week or times of year where flows are predictably different, models can be developed or model inputs can be amended (in the case of day-to-day dynamical models) to test the robustness of proposed policies or to inform the development of policies which vary according to these predictably different day types. Such policies could include time-of-day varying congestion charges that themselves vary by day of the week or season, or targeting public transport provision so that timetables are more responsive to the day of the week and seasonal needs of travellers. A statistical approach is presented for identifying systematic variations in daily traffic flow profiles based on known explanatory factors such as the day,of the week and the season. In order to examine day-to-day variability whilst also considering within-day dynamics, the distribution of flows throughout a day are analysed using Functional Linear Models. F-type tests for functional data are then used to compare alternative model specifications for the predictable variability. The output of the method is an average flow profile for each predictably different day type, which could include day of the week or time of year. An application to real-life traffic flow data for a two-year period is provided. The shape of the daily profile was found to be significantly different for each day of the week, including differences in the timing and width of peak flows and also the relationship between peak and inter-peak flows. Seasonal differences in flow profiles were also identified for each day of the week. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Crawford, F.; Watling, D. P.; Connors, R.

Most existing approaches lack quantitative methods for estimating the impact of bus lanes or for optimizing the operation of bus lanes at a system level. This paper proposes a novel optimization approach for allocating road space to bus lanes in cities. The approach determines the optimal space share between the modes in service and allocates the bus lanes by integrating strategies that lead to less total travel cost. By relying on recent advances in network-level traffic flow modeling, namely, the mullimodal macroscopic fundamental diagram (mMFD), the approach captures multimodal traffic dynamics and travel costs by mode. The impact of a bus lane on mode usage is taken into account to aggregated mode shift phenomena under changes in layout of dedicated bus lanes. Simulation was performed in a Swiss city network to test the proposed optimization approach. The research found I hat (a) the mMFD could be properly integrated to decide for road space optimization of large-scale multimodal urban networks, (b) an optimal and efficient space share minimized the total travel cost for all users, and (c) the best strategy for the studied network was to implement the allocated space on the connected links on a corridor rather than to assign them sparsely to the links that are heavily congested.

J	Stipancic, J; Miranda-Moreno, L; Saunier, N				Stipancic, Joshua; Miranda-Moreno, Luis; Saunier, Nicolas			Impact of Congestion and Traffic Flow on Crash Frequency and Severity Application of Smartphone-Collected GPS Travel Data	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM; SPEED PROFILE; SAFETY	Mobility and safety are the two greatest priorities within any transportation system. Ideally, traffic flow enhancement and crash reductions could occur simultaneously. although their relationship is likely complex. The impact of traffic congestion and flow on road safely requires more empirical evidence to determine the direction and magnitude of the relationship. The study of this relationship is an ideal application for instrumented vehicles and surrogate safety measures (SSMs). The purpose of this paper is to correlate quantitative measures of congestion and flow derived from smartphone-collected GPS data with collision frequency and severity at the network scale. GPS travel data were collected in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada, and the sample for this study contained data for more than 4,000 drivers and 20,000 trips. The extracted SSMs, the congestion index (CI), average speed ((V) over bar), and the coefficient of variation of speed (CVS) were compared with crash data collected over an 11-year period from 2000 to 2010 with the use of Spearman's correlation coefficient and pairwise Kolmngorov-Smirnov tests. The correlations with crash frequency were weak to moderate. CI was shown to be positively correlated with crash frequency, and the relationship to crash severity was found to be nonmonotonous. Higher congestion levels were related to crashes with major injuries, whereas low congestion levels were related to crashes with minor injuries and fatalities. Surprisingly, (V) over bar was found to be negatively correlated with crash frequency and had no conclusive statistical relationship to crash severity. CVS was positively correlated with crash frequency and statistically related to increased crash severity. Future work will incus on the development of a network screening model that incorporates these SSMs.	[Stipancic, Joshua] McGill Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Appl Mech, Room 391,Macdonald Engn Bldg, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C3, Canada; [Miranda-Moreno, Luis] McGill Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Appl Mech, Room 268,Macdonald Engn Bldg, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C3, Canada; [Saunier, Nicolas] Polytech Montreal, Dept Civil Geol & Min Engn, CP 6079,Succursale Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3A7, Canada	Stipancic, J (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Civil Engn & Appl Mech, Room 391,Macdonald Engn Bldg, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C3, Canada.	joshua.stipancic@mail.mcgill.ca		Saunier, Nicolas/0000-0003-0218-7932	Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaCGIAR	Funding for this project was provided in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

J	Zhao, PB; Lee, C				Zhao, Peibo; Lee, Chris			Analysis and Validation of Surrogate Safety Measures by Types of Lead and Following Vehicles	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								This study analyzed rear-end collision risk in a mixed traffic flow pleats and heavy vehicles on a freeway using two surrogate safety measures: time to collision (TTC) and postencroaehment time (PET). The study estimated surrogate safety measures for types of lead and following vehicles (car or heavy vehicle) by using the individual vehicle trajectory data. The vehicle trajectory data were collected from a segment of the US-101 freeway in Los Angeles, California. It was found that the distributions of TTC and PET were significantly different between types of lead and following vehicles. Also, the mean values of TTC and PET were higher for heavy vehicles following cars than for cars following cars and for can following heavy vehicles. The study also validated TTC by using the simulated traffic data for a few minutes before the lime of crashes that occurred on a section of the Gardiner Expressway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was found that TTC reflects higher collision risk in the time intervals closer to the crash time and it reflects higher collision risk for the crash case than for the noncrash ease. The findings suggest that the difference in rear-end collision risk between types of vehicle pairs should be considered in safety assessment of mixed traffic flow of cars and heavy vehicles.

Multi anticipative bidirectional macroscopic traffic model considering cooperative driving strategy	TRANSPORTMETRICA B-TRANSPORT DYNAMICS			English	Article						Macroscopic model; bidirectional driving; linear stability; multiple anticipations; anisotropy	ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; ANISOTROPIC CONTINUUM MODEL; CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; SHOCK-WAVES; FLOW; STABILITY; TIME; CONGESTION; SIMULATION; FREEWAY	Recent development of information and communication technologies (ICT) has enabled vehicles to timely communicate with others through wireless technologies, which will form future (intelligent) traffic systems (ITS) consisting of so-called connected vehicles. Cooperative driving with the connected vehicles is regarded as a promising driving pattern to significantly improve transportation efficiency and traffic safety. In the vast literature of traffic flow theory, there are continuum models considering multiple forward anticipative strategy, where the driver reacts to many leaders. Few study effort has been undertaken to include bidirectional driving strategy, where the driver reacts to both direct leader and direct follower, in the continuum traffic flow models. This paper aims to derive a continuum traffic model considering both multiple forward and backward driving strategy. It is shown that the derived model is a generalised version of a current continuum model for ITS and can improve important properties of such bidirectional (continuum) model.

Coping with Large Traffic Volumes in Schedule-Driven Traffic Signal Control	TWENTY-SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTOMATED PLANNING AND SCHEDULING	Proceedings of the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling		English	Proceedings Paper	27th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS)	JUN 18-23, 2017	Pittsburgh, PA				REAL-TIME; MAXIMUM THROUGHPUT; NETWORKS; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHMS; POLICIES; SYSTEMS	Recent work in decentralized, schedule-driven traffic control has demonstrated the ability to significantly improve traffic flow efficiency in complex urban road networks. However, in situations where vehicle volumes increase to the point that the physical capacity of a road network reaches or exceeds saturation, it has been observed that the effectiveness of a schedule-driven approach begins to degrade, leading to progressively higher network congestion. In essence, the traffic control problem becomes less of a scheduling problem and more of a queue management problem in this circumstance. In this paper we propose a composite approach to real-time traffic control that uses sensed information on queue lengths to influence scheduling decisions and gracefully shift the signal control strategy to queue management in high volume/high congestion settings. Specifically, queue-length information is used to establish weights for the sensed vehicle clusters that must be scheduled through a given intersection at any point, and hence bias the wait time minimization calculation. To compute these weights, we develop a model in which successive movement phases are viewed as different states of an Ising model, and parameters quantify strength of interactions. To ensure scalability, queue information is only exchanged between direct neighbors and the asynchronous nature of local intersection scheduling is preserved. We demonstrate the potential of the approach through microscopic traffic simulation of a real-world road network, showing a 60% reduction in average wait times over the baseline schedule-driven approach in heavy traffic scenarios. We also report initial field test results, which show the ability to reduce queues during heavy traffic periods.
