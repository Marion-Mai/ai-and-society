We analyse the existing methods of traffic flow detection and propose a traffic flow detection method which based on vertical virtual road induction line (VVRIL). Firstly, according to the direction of the vehicle travelling, we set a VVRIL in the middle of the driveway. Secondly, the background image is gained from the video image with Gauss mixture model. We then make differential operation between the background image and video image to get a binary image, which we set the values of the foreground pixels as 1 and that of background pixels as 0. Thirdly, we extract the values of the pixels in the VVRIL of the binary image. Besides, we regard the vehicle maximum length obtained by self-learning as the length of the detection zone and get the information of vehicles in the VVRIL. Finally, we get the number of vehicles through the analysis of vehicle centre coordinates in the VVRIL of each video image. Experimental and theoretical analyses show that the method is accurate enough to meet the requirement of real-time performance.

J	Zefreh, MM; Torok, A				Zefreh, Mohammad Maghrour; Torok, Adam			Theoretical Comparison of the Effects of Different Traffic Conditions on Urban Road Traffic Noise	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article							PREDICTION; HEALTH; SPEED; ROUNDABOUT; POLLUTION; EXPOSURE; MODEL	Road traffic noise is one of the most relevant sources in the environmental noise pollution of the urban areas where dynamics of the traffic flow are much more complicated than uninterrupted traffic flows. It is evident that different traffic conditions would play the role in the urban traffic flow considering the dynamic nature of the traffic flow on one hand and presence of traffic lights, roundabouts, etc. on the other hand. The main aim of the current paper is to investigate the effect of different traffic conditions on urban road traffic noise. To do so, different traffic conditions have been theoretically generated by the Monte Carlo Simulation technique following the distribution of traffic speed in the urban roads. The "ASJ RTN-Model" has been considered as a base road traffic noise prediction model which would deal with different traffic conditions including steady and nonsteady traffic flow that would cover the urban traffic flow conditions properly. Having generated the vehicles speeds in different traffic conditions, the emitted noise (L-WA) and subsequently the noise level at receiver (L-A) were estimated by "ASJ RTN-Model." Having estimated L-WA and L-A for each and every vehicle in each traffic condition and taking the concept of transient noise into account, the single event sound exposure levels (SEL) in different traffic conditions are calculated and compared to each other. The results showed that decelerated traffic flow had the lowest contribution, compared to congestion, accelerated flow, free flow, over-saturated congestion, and undersaturated flow by 16%, 14%, 12%, 12%, and 10%, respectively. Moreover, the distribution of emitted noise and noise level at receiver were compared in different traffic conditions. The results showed that traffic congestion had considerably the maximum peak compared to other traffic conditions which would highlight the importance of the range of generated noise in different traffic conditions.

The learning mechanism is introduced in this model. Cellular can learn traffic information from cellular neighbors in real time. The traffic environment information, such as, relative speed and safety distance will be cellular parallel ruler through the randomization probability form after learning. Finally through numerical simulation, the space-time characteristics were obtained, and comparison with the NaSch model is analyzed. The results show that the improved model can reduce the blocking the road to a certain extent and traffic jam dissolving efficiency is higher. The stability analysis of vehicle running from two aspects of speed fluctuation and headway fluctuation shows that the method in this paper can make traffic flow more stable.

Noise measurements cannot be performed everywhere, or even in a large number of sites, because of high costs and time consumption. For this reasons, Road Traffic Noise predictive Models (RTNMs) can be implemented to estimate the noise levels at any distance, knowing certain parameters needed as input of the RTNM. In this paper, the main statistical RTNMs are presented, together with the implementation of two innovative and advanced models: the EU suggested model (CNOSSOS-EU) and a research model presented by Quartieri et al. (2010). These models will be compared with noise measurements performed in different sites and with different traffic conditions, in order to avoid bias from geometry or other features of the area under study. The main conclusion is that the application of innovative models and the inclusion of dynamical information about traffic flow, will lead to better results with respect to statistical models.

J	Chen, JF; Lo, SK; Do, QH				Chen, Jeng-Fung; Lo, Shih-Kuei; Do, Quang Hung			Forecasting Short-Term Traffic Flow by Fuzzy Wavelet Neural Network with Parameters Optimized by Biogeography-Based Optimization Algorithm	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							IDENTIFICATION; PREDICTION; SYSTEM; MODEL	Forecasting short-term traffic flow is a key task of intelligent transportation systems, which can influence the traveler behaviors and reduce traffic congestion, fuel consumption, and accident risks. This paper proposes a fuzzy wavelet neural network (FWNN) trained by improved biogeography-based optimization (BBO) algorithm for forecasting short-term traffic flow using past traffic data. The original BBO is enhanced by the ring topology and Powell's method to advance the exploration capability and increase the convergence speed. Our presented approach combines the strengths of fuzzy logic, wavelet transform, neural network, and the heuristic algorithm to detect the trends and patterns of transportation data and thus has been successfully applied to transport forecasting. Other different forecasting methods, including ANN-based model, FWNN-based model, and WNN-based model, are also developed to validate the proposed approach. In order to make the comparisons across different methods, the performance evaluation is based on root-mean-squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and correlation coefficient (R). The performance indexes show that the FWNN model achieves lower RMSE and MAPE, as well as higher R, indicating that the FWNN model is a better predictor.

Tunnels help greatly to overcome possible traffic congestion and considerably reduce journey time. The continuous growth of Traffic volumes leads to increased congestion and possibly decreased safety. This leads to requirements for better traffic flow including the provision of extra lanes and consequently extra tunnel space. The extra tunnel space can be achieved either by the widening of the existing tunnel or by adding a new one. The choice of the suitable method is dependent on many factors like tunnels alignment, site conditions, construction method, tunnel operation, risk assessment...etc. The current research investigates the second alternative through a specific case study as an example. The method comprises adding two new tunnels to an existing twin roadway tunnels. The problem was investigated considering the new tunnels to be possibly added vertically or horizontally. The influence of the new tunnels construction on the existing tunnels is investigated considering both the variation of relative position and spacing distance in a parametric study context. Several numerical two and three-dimensional models are employed to check the construction sequence, the tunnelling safety and to evaluate the induced stresses in surrounding ground, straining actions in tunnels' liner and deformations of both ground and liner. The results help to find out the minimum practical and safe spacing distance between the driven new tunnels and the existing ones without the need to the relatively costly soil strengthening techniques.

Dense traffic conditions are exacerbated by the lack of availability of off-street parking in public spaces, forcing vehicles to use on-street parking, which in turn impedes traffic flow and causes gridlock and traffic jams. Semarang City is a good case-study area, with significant parking problems which are clearly unresolved. The research objective is to develop urban parking controls by conducting a comprehensive parking rate analysis based on zoning, using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model to direct and refine the research in a methodical way. The research results determined appropriate urban parking rates based not simply on zoning, but also accounting for the influence of additional quantifiable criteria: assessed land value, location and accessibility, additional value derived from various types of land use, economic capability/ability to pay, and hidden value ascribed to amenities/type of facilities. The highest weighted value, 8,498, was obtained for zone A, which represents the trade zone (BWK 1/Urban Boundaries 1); the value obtained for zone B, 3,71, represents the industrial zone (BWK 4/Urban Boundaries 4); and zone C (BWK 6/Urban Boundaries 6) is represented with the weighted value of 1,867.

Control of Intelligent Transport System in Minsk	SCIENCE & TECHNIQUE			Russian	Article						road traffic; traffic management; management algorithms; automatic traffic management system; intelligent transportation systems; efficiency; quality; coordinated regulation		The paper considers algorithms for searching a maximum traffic volume of road vehicles in a traffic light cycle with a distributed intensity pulse and optimization of shifts under coordinated traffic flow control. Modeling of traffic flows have been made while using a computer program developed by the authors and it has made it possible to improve efficiency of traffic management by taking into account the distributed pulse of transport intensity. The paper proposes a model for minimizing total losses in road traffic during the integration of an incident control sub-system and route guidance for and an automatic road traffic management system as part of Minsk intelligent transportation system which has been studied as a tool for modeling a computer-aided design system "Backbone management". The model that minimizes vehicle delays, uses an algorithm implementing traffic flow intensity parameters depending on the time of day, days of the week. As a result of the simulation it has been revealed that the most effective parameter is an indicator of vehicle delays which does not always satisfy drivers trying to choose routes of their traffic which are based on a minimum transportation speed. However, from the point of view of managing an intelligent transportation system, it is necessary to choose parameters based on the requirements for minimizing delays on the road traffic network of the largest city in our country. All the proposed algorithms and models are used in the automatic traffic management system of Minsk city and will be used while creating an integrated intellectual transportation system of the city.

It is found that the impact of buses can be adequately captured by the theory of moving bottlenecks using only the bus average free-flow speed. This speed considers the effects of signals and stops but not traffic conditions and therefore can be calculated endogenously. A formulation is developed to approximate the bus average free-flow speed as a function of bus operational parameters. We also found that buses produce an additional capacity restriction that is similar to the 'short block' on networks without buses and that can severely reduce corridor capacity. The proposed method is validated with numerical approximations of the corresponding kinematic wave problem.

The linear adaptive approach is represented by the linear message rate integrated control (LIMERIC) algorithm, which integrates the error in order for the message generation rate to converge to a desired value. The stability of this algorithm has been established in the case of repetitive transmission of the basic safety messages in a single-hop communication setting. However, the communication might be realized in a multi-hop fashion, so, in this work we adopt simple models of single and multiple lane roads to investigate the stability of the LIMERIC algorithm in a multi-hop communication setting. Our results indicate that the stability of the system depends on the vehicle density, which dictates appropriate choice of the algorithm parameters for each vehicle density to avoid instability. To this end, we propose the use of certainty equivalent controllers, which adapt the parameters based on vehicle density estimates. Inspired by recent works on adaptive probabilistic flooding, we propose that these density estimates are obtained using speed measurements via a nonlinear relationship of the traffic flow equations whose parameters can be tuned using on-line parameter identification techniques.

The statistic analysis of vehicle load data was carried out. For calculating the operating vehicle load effects on bridges, by Monte Carlo method used to generate random traffic flow and influence line loading method, the maximum bending moment effect of simple supported beams were obtained. The extreme value I distribution and normal distribution were used to simulate the distribution of the maximum bending moment effect. By the extrapolation of Rice formula and the extreme value I distribution, the predicted values of the maximum load effects were obtained. By comparing with vehicle load effect according to current specification, some references were provided for the management of the operating vehicles and the revision of the bridge specifications.

Considering the traffic flow information as well as the length of vehicles on different approaches, the average delay hours had been selected out as the performance index. By using the control algorithm to improve the traditional fixed cycle length time distribution method of the intersection, the paper successfully designed a signal control system to adapt to various traffic conditions. By using Matlab software to analyze the data and simulate the effect, the results showed that this algorithm significantly reduced the traffic delay, achieved good control effect, and enhanced the capacity of the intersection. It has proved that the utilization of the control algorithm is a practical and effective method for the intelligent urban traffic control.

CAVs hold significant potential to positively affect traffic flows, air pollution, energy use, productivity, comfort, and mobility. On the other hand, there is an increasing number of sources and reports highlighting potential problems that may arise with CAVs, such as, conservative driving (relaxed thresholds), problematic interaction with human-driven vehicles (inability to take decisions based on eye contact or body language) and increased traffic demand. Therefore, it is of high importance to assess vehicle automated functionalities in a case-study simulation. The scope of this paper is to present some preliminary results regarding the impact assessment of cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) on the case-study of the ring road of Antwerp, which is responsible for almost 50% of the traffic and pollution of the city. Scenarios with various penetration rates and traffic demands were simulated showing that coordination of vehicles may be needed to significantly reduce traffic congestion and energy use.

Influence of Traffic Vehicles Against Ground Fundamental Frequency Prediction using Ambient Vibration Technique	INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS IN SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGY 2017 (ISMAP 2017)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	International Seminar on Mathematics and Physics in Sciences and Technology (ISMAP)	OCT 28-29, 2017	MALAYSIA				NOISE	Ambient vibration (AV) technique is widely used nowadays for ground fundamental frequency prediction. This technique is easy, quick, non-destructive, less operator required and reliable result. The input motions of ambient vibration are originally collected from surrounding natural and artificial excitations. But, careful data acquisition controlled must be implemented to reduce the intrusion of short period noise that could imply the quality of frequency prediction of an investigated site. In this study, investigation on the primary noise intrusion under peak (morning, afternoon and evening) and off peak (early morning) traffic flows (only 8 meter from sensor to road shoulder) against the stability and quality of ground fundamental frequency prediction were carried out. None of specific standard is available for AV data acquisition and processing. Thus, some field and processing parameters recommended by previous studies and guideline were considered. Two units of 1 Hz tri-axial seismometer sensor were closely positioned in front of the main entrance Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia. 15 minutes of recording length were taken during peak and off peak periods of traffic flows. All passing vehicles were counted and grouped into four classes. Three components of ambient vibration time series recorded in the North-South: NS, East-West: EW and vertical: UD directions were automatically computed into Horizontal to Vertical Spectral Ratio (HVSR), by using open source software of GEOPSY for fundamental ground frequency, F-o determination. Single sharp peak pattern of HVSR curves have been obtained at peak frequencies between 1.33 to 1.38 Hz which classified under soft to dense soil classification. Even identical HVSR curves pattern with close frequencies prediction were obtained under both periods of AV measurement, however the total numbers of stable and quality windows selected for HVSR computation were significantly different but both have satisfied the requirement given by SESAME (2004) guideline. Besides, the second peak frequencies from the early morning HVSR curve was clearly indicated between 8.23 to 8.55 Hz at very low amplitude (A(o) <= 2), but it should be neglected according to the similar guideline criteria. In conclusion, the ground fundamental frequency using HVSR method was successfully determined by 1 Hz seismometer instrument with recommended to specific parameters consideration on field as well as data processing, without disruption from the nearest traffic excitations.

Traffic Flow of Connected and Automated Vehicles: Challenges and Opportunities	ROAD VEHICLE AUTOMATION 4	Lecture Notes in Mobility		English	Proceedings Paper	Automated Vehicles Symposium (AVS)	JUL, 2016	San Francisco, CA			Traffic flow modeling; CAV; Deployment; CACC; Urban networks; Research needs	AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES	Significant progress has been observed in recent years in the development of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). Such progress has been publicized through the latest products/applications being released or announced by the industry. However, there is a limited knowledge on the impact of CAV technologies on surface transportation network performance. In particular, the technological specifications associated with CAVs and the response of drivers to such technologies are not well integrated into traffic flow models. These models are needed to assess and evaluate the safety and mobility impact on our roadway conditions. Accordingly, a more elaborate discussion is needed between three entities: (1) the industry partners leading the efforts in developing CAVs; (2) the academic traffic flow modeling community researching the impact of CAVs on traffic flow performance; and (3) the public/government agencies devising the standards and the rules to regulate the deployment of CAVs on our roadway network. This chapter summarizes the presentations of speakers from these three entities during the Automated Vehicles Symposium 2016 (AVS16) held in San Francisco, California on July 19-21, 2016. These speakers participated in the break-out session titled "Traffic Flow of Connected and Automated Vehicles". The corresponding discussion and recommendation are presented in terms of the lessons learned and the future research direction to be adopted. This session was organized by the AHB45 (3) Subcommittee on Traffic Flow Modeling for Connected and Automated Vehicles.

Model of cyclist accident characteristics in the city of Malang and Blitar	4TH INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON SUSTAINABLE URBAN DEVELOPMENT	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Seminar on Sustainable Urban Development (ISoSUD)	AUG 09-10, 2017	Univ Trisakti, Fac Landscape Architecture & Environm Technol, Jakarta, INDONESIA		Univ Trisakti, Fac Landscape Architecture & Environm Technol	bicycle; road traffic safety; traffic accidents; sustainable transportation		Utilization of bicycles as an environmentally friendly mode of transportation is re-concerned as the development of sustainable transportation programs. The use of bicycles in some developed countries such as the Netherlands is 27 per cent of total travel, while for developing countries such as Indonesia, cyclists are less than 1% of total travel with low educated characteristics (65 per cent) and low income (48 per cent). Cyclist reduces dependencies on petroleum and environmental pollution as well as lessen the occurrence of congestion and traffic accidents involving motor vehicles. It was necessary to know the behavior and interaction of bicycle riders with other vehicle users in a heterogeneous traffic flow. The main purpose of the research is to create a model of bicycle accidents to increase the road traffic safety in Malang city and Blitar city. The research used analyses of frequency, the road's level of service, and multiple linear regression. The results showed that there was a need for a development basis of a special lane for bicycle. It aims to reduce the level and number of cyclist accidents and to achieve transportation safety as well as to raise public awareness in traffic safety.	[Arifin, M.

Simulating and evaluating an adaptive and integrated traffic lights control system for smart city application	4TH INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON SUSTAINABLE URBAN DEVELOPMENT	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Seminar on Sustainable Urban Development (ISoSUD)	AUG 09-10, 2017	Univ Trisakti, Fac Landscape Architecture & Environm Technol, Jakarta, INDONESIA		Univ Trisakti, Fac Landscape Architecture & Environm Technol	economic cost of congestion; smart city; smart traffic light control		A city could be categorized as a smart city when the information technology has been developed to the point that the administration could sense, understand, and control every resource to serve its people and sustain the development of the city. One of the smart city aspects is transportation and traffic management. This paper presents a research project to design an adaptive traffic lights control system as a part of the smart system for optimizing road utilization and reducing congestion. Research problems presented include: (1) Congestion in one direction toward an intersection due to dynamic traffic condition from time to time during the day, while the timing cycles in traffic lights system are mostly static; (2) No timing synchronization among traffic lights in adjacent intersections that is causing unsteady flows; (3) Difficulties in traffic condition monitoring on the intersection and the lack of facility for remotely controlling traffic lights. In this research, a simulator has been built to model the adaptivity and integration among different traffic lights controllers in adjacent intersections, and a case study consisting of three sets of intersections along Jalan K. H. Hasyim Ashari has been simulated. It can be concluded that timing slots synchronization among traffic lights is crucial for maintaining a steady traffic flow.

Speed-volume relationship and headway distribution analysis of motorcycle (case study: Teuku Nyak Arief Road)	4TH INTERNATIONAL SEMINAR ON SUSTAINABLE URBAN DEVELOPMENT	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science		English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Seminar on Sustainable Urban Development (ISoSUD)	AUG 09-10, 2017	Univ Trisakti, Fac Landscape Architecture & Environm Technol, Jakarta, INDONESIA		Univ Trisakti, Fac Landscape Architecture & Environm Technol	flow; headway distribution; motorcycle equivalent unit; transportation modes		In many developing countries, transportation modes are more varied than the other country. For example, in Jakarta, Indonesia, in some roadway, motorcycle is the most dominant vehicle, with total volume is four times higher than a passenger car. Thus, the traffic characteristic in motorcycle-dominated traffic differs from a common traffic situation. The purpose of this study is to apply the concept and theory developed to analyze motorcycle behaviour under motorcycle-dominated traffic condition. The survey is applied by recording the traffic flow movement of research location at specified time period. The macroscopic characteristic analyzed in this research is a speed-flow relationship based on motorcycle equivalent unit (MCU). Furthermore, a detail microscopic characteristic analyzed that is motorcycle time headway regarding traffic flow. MCU values computed were consists of motorcycle (MC), light vehicle (LV) and heavy vehicle (HV). Those values were calculated 1.00, 6.13 and 10.71 respectively. The speed and volume relationship result is showing a linear regression model with R-2 value is 0.58, it can be explained that the correlation between two variables is intermediate. The headway distribution of motorcycle is compatible with the negative exponential distribution which fitted with the proposed theory for a small vehicle such as a motorcycle.

The high Definition Monitoring System (HDMS) data contribute comprehensive and precise individual vehicle information. This paper proposes an innovative Variable Speed Limit (VSL) based approach to manage crash risks by intervening in traffic flow dynamics on freeways using HDMS data. We first conducted an empirical analysis on real-time crash risk estimation using a binary logistic regression model. Then, intensive microscopic simulations based on AIMSUN were carried out to explore the effects of various intervention strategics with respect to a 3-lane freeway stretch in China. Different speed limits with distinct compliance rates under specified traffic conditions have been simulated. By taking into account the trade-off between safety benefits and delay in travel time, the speed limit strategies were optimized under various traffic conditions and the model with gradient feedback produces more satisfactory performance in controlling real-time crash risks. Last, the results were integrated into lane management strategies. This research can provide new ideas and methods to reveal the freeway crash risk evolution and active traffic management.

The world major city urban agglomerations have already accepted the intermodal techniques for transport service development which demonstrates strong potential for improving quality of transport services and reduction of spent trip time. The article presents factors with regard to the formation of "Park-and-Ride" system as part of an urban intermodal system that offer variety of transportation options and enable people to switch from a personal car to public transport. The article provides the Model of access control to the arterial road and city street network through the interception of personal vehicles. Such Model defines the main outcomes and advantages of the "Park-and-Ride" system on the territory of wide Metropolitan areas. The researches were done collecting and analysing current data of the Moscow agglomeration pursuing technical and commercial results. The aim is to improve transport imbalance in the distribution of passenger's mobility between different city transport modes with priority use of passenger transport. Implementation of the proposed model within the concept of smart city will generate an intelligent transport system, which will allow for traffic flows optimization as well as for contribution for sustainable urban development.

Moreover, the advent of the "information" era has accelerated the development of Internet of Thing (IoT). For purpose of improving the current situation of urban transport, and in the context of rapid development of IoT, intelligent transportation system (ITS) has received extensive attention. Traffic path guidance system (TPGS) is an important research field of ITS, which improves the traffic condition of road network by guiding user's travel behaviors, and ultimately realizes the reasonable distribution of traffic flow in each section of road network. In this paper, we adopt Performance Evaluation Process Algebra (PEPA) to model the process of path guidance in TPGS, and analyze performance indexes on the response time of the model by simulation method.

However, merely estimating the benefits of these direct (or first-order) effects is unlikely to show the full picture of the consequences that will emerge once autonomous vehicles enter the roads. In this paper, we therefore put emphasis on discussing systemic (or second-order) effects. The paper presents a conceptual exploration of these effects based on literature and research findings to date. We show that these systemic effects have the potential - especially in urban areas and without adequate policy intervention - to eliminate at least some of the benefits initially associated with autonomous vehicles. Following this systemic view on autonomous vehicles, we discuss policy aspects for responsible authorities and planners on how to prepare transportation systems for the challenges related to the introduction of autonomous vehicles, and conclude with areas of research that seem highly important in terms of further investigation in this context.

Vehicle traffic is one of the main causes of this problem, further worsened by uncontrolled urban growth which eliminates front setbacks, squares and gardens that could enable a better dispersion of sound energy. Urban planning requires tools that allow it to estimate sound energy emission from traffic flow. There are softwares in the market that make this prediction, but they have a high cost. The other option is the use of mathematical algorithms available cost-free in the literature, but that have been developed for a reality different from the Brazilian. The objective of this work is to evaluate the accuracy of these algorithms to the Brazilian reality. Sound pressure level measures were made in a traffic lane. During the measurements, the number of vehicles was counted to feed the selected algorithm in order to compare the measured and the simulated values. The results indicated a good correlation between the values obtained, but the noise emitted by vehicles in circulation need to be better studied in order to obtain more accurate results.

One of them is the intersection of Patal Pusri Underpass. The smooth traffic due to the underpass construction needs to be balanced by the arrangement management at the intersections located close to the underpass to get the best network performance since both affect each other performance. The Taman Kenten and Seduduk Putih junctions which are just 569 and 226 meters from the underpass of Patal Pusri has to be analyzed for its needs of management and traffic arrangements to reduce its impact on the performance of the intersection of Patal Pusri or vice versa. Some alternatives of management and traffic arrangements were developed to get the best solutions and the Vissim 8.00 microsimulation program was used to evaluate the performance of intersections in the network where the compared parameters are the value of the queue length and average delay. The results of the analysis and the conducted modeling show that the best solution to optimize the performance of the two junctions are to make geometric changes and diversion of traffic flow at Seduduk Putih Junction and making geometric changes at Taman Kenten Junction.

To mitigate traffic congestion over a widespread area, a method using an advanced genetic algorithm and a traffic simulator has been proposed (Nishihara, T., et al., "The Verification with Real-World Road Network on Optimization of Traffic Signal Parameters using Multi-Element Genetic Algorithms", ITS World Congress, 2012). However, this method consumes considerable time when simulating traffic flow. This paper proposes a method that reduces the processing time of the simulator by using a neural network.

J	Gravelle, E; Martinez, S				Gravelle, Evan; Martinez, Sonia			Distributed dynamic lane reversal and rerouting for traffic delay reduction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL			English	Article						Traffic flow; traffic routing; lane reversal; distributed control	AUTONOMOUS INTERSECTION MANAGEMENT; FLOW; NETWORK; HIGHWAY; WAVES; MODEL	Traffic congestion is a major source of delays in modern road networks. Motivated by this, we propose two distributed algorithms to reduce delays: a dynamic lane reversal algorithm and a rerouting algorithm. When there is a density imbalance on a road, time can be saved by reallocating lanes from the less dense side to the more dense side, which motivates dynamic lane reversal. When a road has greater density than nearby roads, time can be saved by redirecting flow into the least congested roads, this motivates dynamic rerouting. Given a communication system between infrastructure and vehicles on the road, the local state of the network can be approximated and utilised by the algorithms to minimise travel time. In order to provide a better fundamental understanding of the system dynamics, we analyse equilibrium conditions for the system and prove convergence of the lane reversal algorithm to a critical point. Overall performance is also examined in simulation.

A hybrid model based method for bus travel time estimation	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						bus travel time estimation; k-NN classifying algorithm; exponential smoothing; Kalman filtering; bus arrival information	TRAFFIC FLOW; PREDICTION; SYSTEM	Providing accurate information about bus arrival time to passengers can make the public transport system more attractive. Such information helps the passengers by reducing the uncertainty on waiting time and the associated frustrations. However, accurate estimation of bus travel time is still a challenging problem, especially under heterogeneous and lane-less traffic conditions. The accuracy of such information provided to passengers depends mainly on the estimation method used, which in turns depends on the input data used. Hence, developing suitable estimation methods and identifying the most significant/appropriate input data are important. The present study focused on these aspects of development of estimation methods that can accurately estimate travel time by using significant inputs. In order to identify significant inputs, a data mining technique, namely the k-NN classifying algorithm, was used. It is based on the similarity in pattern between the input and historic data. These identified inputs were then used in a hybrid model that combined exponential smoothing technique with recursive estimation scheme based on the Kalman Filtering (KF) technique. The optimal values of the smoothing parameter were dynamically estimated and were updated using the latest measurements available from the field. The performance of the proposed algorithm showed a clear improvement in estimation accuracy when compared with existing methods.	[Kumar, B.

A nonlinear distance-based toll considering the congestion-level correction is levied for road users in a charging cordon. It is assumed that both users' departure time and route choice behavior follow the dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) principle. A bi-level programming model for the nonlinear distance-based dynamic pricing which considers the congestion-level correction is formulated to determine the optimal toll rate. The upper level aims to maximize the total social benefits, while the lower level depicts user' departure time as well as route choice behavior in terms of the DUE theory. The model proposed here can be used to design the optimal toll rate for the dynamic congestion pricing.

As part of the smart-city strategies, the overall division of transport work and the urban transport system must be managed as long-term sustainable. In public transport, it is necessary to achieve such a state, where this system will be attractive for passengers. It is necessary to describe and to model traffic flows in the city, and to respond to them through the structural arrangement of the urban public transport system. In this respect, there are considerable differences between smaller towns and larger cities, depending on their size and population. The smaller is the city, the passanger flows are shattered, weaker and less graspable. However, in such a situation, it is necessary to look for tools to create a clever operational concept of urban transport. The article describes possible approaches to optimizing urban bus transport in terms of identifying demand for transport and consequently the principles of creating operational concepts.

We illustrate how the system controls standard four-way intersections using three parameters; namely, average vehicles flow speed, level of crowdedness of vehicles, and a critical state timer. These parameters are detected from traffic videos using our computer vision algorithm. The ATCS decision-making process has been designed to adapt to predefined priorities over the traffic parameters. The validation of the proposed ATCS has been tested using four synchronized test videos in order to feed the proposed ATCS with different traffic information.

Forecasting Traffic Flow: Short Term, Long Term, and When It Rains	BIG DATA - BIGDATA 2018	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Congress on Big Data (BigData Congress) Held as Part of the Services Conference Federation (SCF)	JUN 25-30, 2018	Seattle, WA			Traffic flow forecasting; Big data analytics; Time series analysis; Seasonal ARIMA; Exponential smoothing; Neural networks; Dynamic regression	WEATHER; PREDICTION	Forecasting is the art of taking available information of the past and attempting to make the best educated guesses of the ever unforeseen future. From the historical data, patterns can be observed and forecasting models have been developed to capture such patterns. This work focuses on forecasting traffic flow in major urban areas and freeways in the state of Georgia using large amounts of data collected from traffic sensors. Much of the existing work on traffic flow forecasting focuses on the immediate short terms. In addition to that, this work studies the forecasting powers of various models, including seasonal ARIMA, exponential smoothing and neural networks, for relatively long terms. A second experiment that incorporates precipitation data into forecasting models to better predict traffic flow in rainy weather is also conducted. Dynamic regression models and neural networks are used in this experiment. In both experiments, neural networks outperformed the others overall.

The hybrid strategy of the game is obtained. The relevant parameters of model are calibrated by collected video data in Changchun, China. A two-way four-lane cellular automaton model with the game model imbedded is constructed for identifying the effect of U-turn vehicle on traffic performance. The influencing factors are identified with their correlation analyzed by numerical simulation of different traffic conditions. According to the simulation results, U-turn traffic has a significant influence on traffic delay in the lane of same direction, compared with opposite direction. The severity of conflict between vehicles is classified and the causes are identified by analyzing the arrival rate of the U-turn vehicle and the conflicting straight vehicle and the relationship with one another. In addition, the threshold of traffic flow causing traffic conflict and traffic delay are proposed. The results show that the proposed models reconstructed the traits of traffic flow and conflict phenomenon in the presence of U-turn vehicles on road section.

J	Herty, M; Moutari, S; Visconti, G				Herty, Michael; Moutari, Salissou; Visconti, Giuseppe			MACROSCOPIC MODELING OF MULTILANE MOTORWAYS USING A TWO-DIMENSIONAL SECOND-ORDER MODEL OF TRAFFIC FLOW	SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						traffic flow; macroscopic model; two-dimensional model; second-order traffic flow models	FUNDAMENTAL DIAGRAMS; DERIVATION; HIERARCHY; BEHAVIOR; WAVES; ROADS	Lane changing is one of the most common maneuvers on motorways. Although macroscopic traffic models are well known for their suitability to describe fast moving crowded traffic, most of these models are generally developed in a one-dimensional framework; henceforth lane-changing behavior is either not explicitly modeled or is explicitly forbidden. In this paper, we propose a macroscopic model which accounts for lane-changing behavior on motorways, based on a two-dimensional extension of the Aw and Rascle [SIAM J. Appl. Math., 60 (2000), pp. 916-938] and Zhang [Transport. Res. B-Meth., 36 (2002), pp. 275-290] macroscopic model for traffic flow. Under conditions when lane-changing maneuvers are no longer possible, the model "relaxes" to the one-dimensional Aw-Rascle-Zhang model. Following the same approach as in [SIAM J. Appl. Math., 63 (2002), pp. 259-278], we derive the two-dimensional macroscopic model through scaling of time discretization of a microscopic follow-the-leader model with driving direction. We provide a detailed analysis of the space-time discretization of the proposed macroscopic model as well as an approximation of the solution to the associated Riemann problem. Furthermore, we illustrate some promising features of the proposed model through some numerical experiments.

In this paper, we study these properties for a platoon of vehicles driving on a single-lane straight road. Specifically, we model individual vehicle's dynamics by the Classical Car-Following Model (CCFM) and the Modified Optimal Velocity Model (MOVM). These models capture the reaction delays inherent in such a setting. First, we focus on string stability. For both models, we derive a sufficient condition for string stability. We then concentrate on the robustness to uncertainties in the parameters of the said models. For both models, we derive bounds on the reaction delay to ensure (a) pairwise robust stability, and (b) platoon robust stability, when the remaining model parameters lie in an interval. Finally, we compare our results with conditions for these models to be locally asymptotically stable. This brings forth the additional constraints imposed on the reaction delay to achieve string and robust stability. Our results may provide design guidelines for futuristic connected vehicle systems. Additionally, from a technological perspective, our results suggest the sufficiency of using only on-board sensors for all forms of local stability except platoon robust stability.

In order to achieve the effective control of intersections, multi-lane four-phase intersection is studied. The corresponding queue length model and vehicular delay model are established. Aiming at the dynamic uncertainty problem in the intersection, a type-2 fuzzy logic controller is designed. The green time of each phase is dynamically decided according to the real-time traffic information for purpose of achieving the smallest vehicular average delay, so as to enhance the traffic efficiency in the intersection. The excellent performance of the designed controller is confirmed through simulation experiments under different conditions. Finally, in view of the difficulty of parameter settings in type-2 fuzzy controller, DNA evolutionary algorithm is applied to online optimize and adjust the parameters of membership function. One group of parameters is difficult to fit all traffic situations, so on-line optimization and adjustment is necessary for reflecting the real-time change of traffic flow in time, which is of great significance for the practical application. The experimental results indicate that the online optimized type-2 fuzzy traffic control method has better effect.

Under this situation, using the mobile relay nodes (MRN) in conventional cellular communication to support auxiliary transmission communication can effectively improve the ability of data transmission in the process of mobile performance. In this paper, we discuss that under the driving on the highway scenario, with the using of mobile relay nodes, we chose the whole vehicle as the communication transfer object and the middle vehicle carry as mobile relay node (MRN). Under the condition of considering the link capacity, this paper analyzes the traffic flow with the demand of the mobile relay nodes (MRNs) and conveys a digital expression. Simulation and probability analyses indicate that for three different traffic flows, it is expounded to the change of traffic to the mobile relay nodes (MRNs) demand changes.

Additionally, there are many situations where the application of traditional solutions is not entirely effective, e.g., when the processing of large amounts of data collected from in-vehicle sensors and network devices is required. To overcome these issues, several Artificial Intelligence-based techniques have been applied to different areas related to the transportation environment. In this paper, we present a study of the diverse Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques which have been implemented to improve Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). In particular, we grouped them into three main areas depending on the main field where they were applied: (i) Vehicle control, (ii) Traffic control and prediction, as well as (iii) Road safety and accident prediction. The results of this study reveal that the combination of different AI techniques seems to be very promising, especially to manage and analyze the massive amount of data generated in transportation.

J	Dong, SJ; Mostafizi, A; Wang, HZ; Li, J				Dong, Shangjia; Mostafizi, Alireza; Wang, Haizhong; Li, Jia			A stochastic analysis of highway capacity: Empirical evidence and implications	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						mean-standard deviation trade-off; ramp metering; space-time ARIMA; stochastic capacity	TRAFFIC FLOW; PREDICTION; ALGORITHM	This paper presents a stochastic characterization of highway capacity and explores its implications on ramp metering control at the corridor level. The stochastic variation of highway capacity is captured through a Space-Time Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (STARIMA) model. It is identified following a Seasonal STARIMA model (0, 0, 2(3)) x (0, 1, 0)(2), which indicates that the capacities of adjacent locations are spatially-temporally correlated. Hourly capacity patterns further verify the stochastic nature of highway capacity. The goal of this paper is to study (1) how to take advantage of the extra information, such as capacity variation, and (2) what benefits can be gained from stochastic capacity modeling. The implication of stochastic capacity is investigated through a ramp metering case study. A mean-standard deviation formulation of capacity is proposed to achieve the trade-off between traffic operation efficiency and robustness. Following that, a modified stochastic capacity-constraint ZONE ramp metering scheme embedded cell transmission model algorithm is introduced. The numerical experiment suggests that considering capacity variation information would alleviate the spillback effect and improve throughput. Monte Carlo simulation further supports this argument. This study helps verify and characterize the stochastic nature of capacity, validates the benefits of using capacity variation information, and thus enhances the necessity of implementing stochastic capacity in traffic operation.

TCPN is adopted to establish an urban traffic network model composed of three submodels, namely, traffic flow model, traffic signal display and phase switch model, and traffic signal switch control model. An EV preemption optimization control system, consisting of monitoring subsystem, phase time determination subsystem, and phase switching control subsystem, is designed. The calculation method of the travelling speed of EV on road sections is presented, and the methods of determining the actual green time of current phase and the other phase are given. Some computational comparisons are performed to verify the signal preemption control strategies, and simulation results indicate that the proposed approach can provide efficient and safe running environments for emergency vehicles and minimize EV's interference to social vehicles simultaneously.

Assessment and Prediction of Environmental Noise Generated by Road Traffic in Nagpur City, India	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION	Water Science and Technology Library		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Water, Environment, Energy and Society (WEES)	MAR 15-18, 2016	AISECT Univ, Bhopal, INDIA	Texas A & M Univ, ICE WaRM	AISECT Univ		RESIDENTIAL AREAS; POLLUTION; ORISSA; TOWN	The main intention of research is to quantify and predict the noise level due to heterogeneous traffic conditions at critical junctions and highways. A study was carried out to assess the existing status of noise levels and its impacts on the environment with a possibility of further expansion of the city. Vehicular traffic noise levels measured during peak and non-peak hours at all selected locations were higher (71-76 dBA and 69.3-76.3 dBA) than the prescribed limits. The recognized amount of traffic and with the help of road geometry data, prediction of noise level is performed using modified Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) model, and the computed noise was compared with the measured one for assuring the relevance of this model for prediction of forthcoming noise. The outcome received from this model was nearer to the observed noise level, having a percentage error of +/- 3%, the best fit lines generated between them gives R-2 of 0.457. In this study measured and computed noise exposure levels were depicted with the help of contour maps. Octave band spectral analysis reveals that the interrupted traffic flow is above the free flow traffic and realized that the contribution of two wheeler and cars/jeep are mainly responsible for a generation of noise level at both the lower and higher frequencies, it also signifies that the FHWA model is convenient to be used for Indian circumstances.

Importance of traffic flow regimes for forecasting and presence of spatial relationships between road network nodes are widely acknowledged both in traffic flow theory and empirical studies. In this research, we join these concepts and made the first steps to analysis of different regimes of spatial dependency in a traffic flow. Modern Markov-switching autoregressive distributed lag models are utilized and allowed to analyse the model structure in different traffic flow regimes. On the base of the models, we made a conclusion about the importance of traffic flow regimes for identification of a structure of spatial dependencies. The proposed approach is illustrated for real-world traffic flow data.

The traffic flows are divided by virtual grids; we call it virtual grid-based cooperative control of multiple-intersections (VGCC). The road segment between two intersections has been divided into two parts, which are defined as the reference region and the decision region. When the vehicle arrives at or goes away from any one part, it registers or deregisters itself to the road side unit. The traffic controller at intersection, called intersection control unit, collects the traffic information from all road segments and receives traffic messages from adjacent intersections. The proposed signal-scheduling algorithm considers not only the flows at the local intersection with higher passing rates but also the flows at downstream signalized intersections with higher passing rates. To ensure fairness, the algorithm gives chances to those phases who has a lower passing rate by using the ageing-counter matrix. According to the real-time traffic information, this paper makes signal timing for each phase of a signal cycle one by one. Moreover, a cooperative collision avoidance predictive control algorithm is proposed, which can assist vehicles to pass the next intersection without stopping, by predicting the time conflict. The results indicate that the VGCC algorithm significantly decreases the average number of vehicles on a road segment by 30.77%, reduces the average queuing length by 28.89%, decreases the average time spent on passing intersection by 26.93%, and reduces the average waiting time by 35.21% than the intersection of common road networks algorithm.

To capture the randomness in traffic flow dynamics, it develops a single-input Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) trained with a hybrid algorithm. Furthermore, it proposes a new Premise-Consequent Conjugate Effect (PCCE) relationship to estimate fundamental diagram (FD) parameters from the ANFIS model. Several options (i.e. optimal split of data into training and testing data, selection of suitable membership function) offered by ANFIS are then illustrated. An experiment is performed to determine the maximum achievable goodness of fit without the occurrence of overfitting phenomenon by changing the number of clusters. The calibrated ANFIS model is compared against traditional and advanced speed-density models for five different freeway locations. Results show that the proposed model outperforms other preceding models by attaining goodness-of-fit values within a range of 0.82-0.92. Finally, the proposed PCCE relationship shows the ANFIS model's robustness in accurate estimation of FD parameters for all freeway locations.

J	Shreekanth, T; Madhukumar, M				Shreekanth, T.; Madhukumar, M.			Analysis and estimation of traffic density: an efficient real time approach using image processing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SIGNAL AND IMAGING SYSTEMS ENGINEERING			English	Article						image processing; image cropping; canny edge detection; traffic velocity; traffic density; intelligent traffic control		Nowadays, traffic density is very high in most of the urban areas, because of the increase in the number of vehicles. Traffic congestion is a very common problem that leads to more lay-out time in traffic. In order to address this issue, an algorithm has been proposed in this work for traffic flow monitoring and analysis in real time based on image processing techniques. This paper describes a method of real time area and frame based traffic density estimation using edge detection for intelligent traffic control system. Area occupied by the edges of vehicles will be considered to estimate traffic density. The system will automatically estimate the traffic density of each road by calculating the area occupied by traffic which in turn will help to determine the duration of each traffic light. The main role of this study lies in the development of a new technique that detects traffic density according to the area occupied by the edges of vehicles for controlling traffic congestion. The proposed algorithm was evaluated on a 30 s video dataset which was sampled into 8 frames and yielded an average accuracy of 98.07%. This is comparable with the existing algorithms in the literature.

Car-following is divided into four groups by the lead and lag vehicle type. The vehicle behavior, including steady space gap, acceleration, and behavior choice, was studied to find out the diversity of car-following behavior in different vehicle combinations. The results show that vehicles in different vehicle combinations have different car-following behaviors. In the proposed model, each vehicle combination has its particular update rules and parameters. The model was evaluated by comparison with the existing car-following models at the microscopic and macroscopic level and the stability was also analyzed. The results show that the improved cellular automata model has a satisfactory performance.

In this paper, we propose to model urban highway traffic data with an incremental tensor structure to exploit all available feature aspects. It is conceived on the solid basis of dynamic tensor model for traffic prediction, and a fast low-rank tensor completion algorithm, equipped with gravitational search algorithm, is harnessed to optimize the parameters. The proposed method excavates the inner law of traffic flow data by taking account of multi-mode features, such as daily and weekly periodicity, spatial information, and temporal variations, and so on. Empirically, multi-view experiments demonstrate the superiority of Trapit, and indicate that the proposed method is potentially applicable in large and dynamic highway networks.

In multimodal transportation systems, there are two flows; the flow of vehicles, and the flow of passengers. These two flows are not independent, since vehicles carry passengers. Hence the idea of the GSOM approach: to describe first the vehicle flow, and to consider the passenger load of vehicles as an attribute of vehicles. The resulting model is treated in a semidiscretized lagrangian way: vehicles are discretized, and passengers are modelled by continuous quantities (passenger load). Nodes in the model recapture the main complexity of the transportation system. They can represent such distinct features intersections (cars), stations (buses, trains), or intermodal poles. The advantage of the model is that it provides a unifying macroscopic view of multimodal transportation systems, can accomodate various vehicle and passenger attributes, and thus should provide a useful tool for the management of such systems.

Our model is built on a first order macroscopic PDE model coupled with an ODE describing the trajectory of the leader of a platoon accelerating at a given constant rate. We use Wave Front Tracking techniques to construct approximate solutions to the Initial Value Problem. We present some numerical examples including the case of successive traffic signals on an arterial road and we compare the solution to our model with the solution given by the classical LWR equation in order to evaluate the impact of bounded acceleration.

The model is bidimensional in the sense that the underlying network is approximated by a continuous medium, and that traffic flow is approximated as a bidimensional fluid. The model is homogeneous in the sense that it does not presuppose local privileged directions of travel. Thus the proposed model is dynamic and recaptures several existing models. It can also be interfaced with the GSOM (Generic second order model) for traffic on networks, allowing to treat large networks with major arteries (modelled via GSOM) and dense subnetworks, modelled by the proposed bidimensional model. The bidimensional model is introduced in a discretized and phenomenological way, and is completely described in this setting.

This paper investigates the implications of optimally coordinating vehicles that are wirelessly connected to each other in roundabouts to achieve a smooth traffic flow. We apply an optimization framework and an analytical solution that allows optimal coordination of vehicles for merging in such traffic scenario. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulation and it is shown that fully coordinated vehicles reduce total travel time by 51% and fuel consumption by 35%. Furthermore, we study the influence of vehicle coordination in a mixed-traffic environment and compare the network performance under different market penetration rates of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). For this particular study with near-capacity demand, high penetration of CAVs is necessary to ensure an efficient and effective control, due to extremely unstable traffic.

This scenario may benefit of a lane management strategy called tidal flow (or reversible) lane control, in which case the direction of a contraflow buffer lane is reversed according to the needs of each direction. This paper proposes a simple and practical real-time strategy for efficient motorway tidal flow lane control. A switching policy based on the fundamental diagram, that requires only aggregated measurements of density (or occupancy), is adopted. A kinematic wave theory-based traffic flow analysis shows that the proposed strategy provides a Pareto-optimal solution. Simulation studies of the A38(M) Aston Expressway (Birmingham, UK), are used to demonstrate its operation.

A multi-class decentralised event-triggered control framework for congestion and emission reduction in freeway networks	IFAC PAPERSONLINE			English	Proceedings Paper	15th International-Federation-of-Automatic-Control (IFAC) Symposium on Control in Transportation Systems (CTS)	JUN 06-08, 2018	ITALY	Int Federat Automat Control, Int Federat Automat Control, Tech Comm 7 4 Transportat Syst, Int Federat Automat Control, Tech Comm 7 1 Automot Control, Int Federat Automat Control, Tech Comm 7 2 Marine Syst, Int Federat Automat Control, Tech Comm 7 3 Aerosp, Int Federat Automat Control, Tech Comm 7 5 Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles, Univ Genova, Dept Informat Bioengineering Robot & Syst Engn			CONTROL SCHEME; TRAFFIC FLOW; MODEL	The present work deals with the problem of regulating traffic in freeway networks via ramp metering with the twofold objective of reducing congestion and traffic emissions. In this paper, an answer to this problem is given by proposing a multi-class decentralised control scheme that acts according to an event-triggered logic. Local control algorithms receive local measurements from the freeway network and make a periodic prediction on the local system evolution. On the basis of this information, the local control algorithms communicate suitable parameters to the local feedback controllers, which produce control actions able to jointly reduce the congestion and the traffic emissions in a neighbourhood of the controlled on-ramp. Since these local controllers are of the multi-class type, the resulting ramp metering control actions are distinguished for different classes of vehicles. The results obtained by applying such a decentralised scheme are compared in the paper with those achieved by using a centralised control framework.

The proposed concept is a semi-autonomous ecological advanced driver assistance system which predictively plans for a safe and energy-efficient cruising velocity profile autonomously for battery electric vehicles. However, high entropy in transportation network leads to a challenging task to derive a computationally efficient and tractable model to predict the traffic flow. Stochastic optimal control has been developed to systematically find an optimal decision with the aim of performance improvement. However, most of the developed methods are not real-time algorithms. Moreover, they are mainly risk-neutral for safety-critical systems. This paper investigates on the real-time risk sensitive nonlinear optimal control design subject to safety and ecological constraints. This system improves the efficiency of the transportation network at the microscopic level. Obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of states regulation and constraints satisfaction.

The research results based on the principle of multistep prediction can provide more information about the traffic operating quality in advance. Considering that prediction error increases with the increasing numbers of multistep predictions, this research proposes the concept of dynamic predictability that is related to the characteristic of historical traffic flow data used. The traffic flow is characterized by randomness, regularity, and volatility according to the traffic flow theory. Therefore, three key indexes are firstly calculated to measure the characteristics of reliability series. Then a two-phase model is established based on wavelet neural network optimized by particle swarm optimization. The upper phase is a model to estimate the number of predictable steps, and the lower phase is the multistep prediction model of reliability. Compared with that of backpropagation neural network and support vector machine, results show that the convergence time of the wavelet neural network optimized by particle swarm optimization is the lowest, which only costs 256 and 291 seconds in both two-phase models under the same conditions. The average relative error of multistep prediction reached the lowest value, 8.91% and 12.01%, respectively, for weekday and weekend data used. Moreover, the prediction performance based on weekday is better than that of weekend. The research results lay a decision-making basis for managers in determining the key parts of road network to develop future improvement measures.

Meanwhile, ventilation facilities could not satisfy the dynamic requirements of fresh air demand under fast spatial-temporal variation of traffic conditions and operating environment. In this study, the operational data collected from an extra-long highway tunnel were deeply analyzed using big data technology. By combining traffic flow and environmental monitoring data, a data-driven perception model based on the Random Forests was structured. The prediction results show that the proposed model provides better performances as compared to contrast models, indicating it had better ability to adapt to the dynamic changes of in-tunnel operational status while realizing accurate prediction. The designed intelligent control strategies of ventilation facilities and traffic operation applying for different operational status would provide a theoretical basis and data support for lifting the level of intelligent control as well as promoting energy saving and consumption reducing in extra-long highway tunnels.

Equilibrium route flow assignment in linear network as a system of linear equations	VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA SERIYA 10 PRIKLADNAYA MATEMATIKA INFORMATIKA PROTSESSY UPRAVLENIYA			Russian	Article						constrained nonlinear optimization; user equilibrium of Wardrop; route flow traffic assignment		Decision making requires possibilities to influence the object. In urban traffic area it is crucial to influence traffic flows. However, first of all, decision maker needs comprehensive information about traffic flows. From a practical perspective, the most valuable is information about route flows, unlike information about link flows. In this paper, a route flow traffic assignment model in a linear network is studied. Linear road network (linear link performance function) gives a chance to reduce traffic assignment problem to a system of linear equations and conditions in the form of linear inequalities. The directed graph represents road network. Route flow traffic assignment problem is presented as a nonlinear constrained problem. The theorem about the reduction of a route flow traffic assignment problem in linear road network to the system of linear equations is proved. Implementation of developed approach to an example of the linear road network is disassembled in details.	[Krylatov, A. Yu.; Shirokolobova, A.

J	Wang, X; Liu, K				Wang, Xu; Liu, Kai			A Crash Surrogate Metric considering Traffic Flow Dynamics in a Motorway Corridor	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article							FUNDAMENTAL DIAGRAM; SAFETY; MODEL; CONFLICTS; TOLL	We proposed a new crash surrogate metric, i.e., the maximum disturbance that a car following scenario can accommodate, to represent potential crash risks with a simple closed form. The metric is developed in consideration of traffic flow dynamics. Then, we compared its performance in predicting the rear-end crash risks for motorway on-ramps with other two surrogate measures (time to collision and aggregated crash index). To this end, a one-lane on-ramp of Pacific Motorway, Australia, was selected for this case study. Due to the lack of crash data on the study site, historical crash counts were merged according to levels of service (LOS) and then converted into crash rates. In this study, we used the societal risk index to represent the crash surrogate indicators and built relationships with crash rates. The final results show that (1) the proposed metric and aggregated crash index are superior to the time to collision in predicting the rear-end crash risks for on-ramps; (2) they have a relatively similar performance, but due to the simple calculation, the proposed metric is more applicable to some real-world cases compared with the aggregated crash index.

The system is capable of adjusting the signal timing parameters in real time according to the seasonal changes and short-term fluctuation of traffic demand, resulting in improvement of the efficiency of traffic operation on urban road networks. The development of information technologies on computing science, autonomous driving, vehicle-to-vehicle, and mobile Internet has created a sufficient abundance of acquisition means for traffic data. Great improvements for data acquisition include the increase of available amount of holographic data, available data types, and accuracy. The article investigates the development of commonly used self-adaptive signal control systems in the world, their technical characteristics, the current research status of self-adaptive control methods, and the signal control methods for heterogeneous traffic flow composed of connected vehicles and autonomous vehicles. Finally, the article concluded that signal control based on multiagent reinforcement learning is a kind of closed-loop feedback adaptive control method, which outperforms many counterparts in terms of real-time characteristic, accuracy, and self-learning and therefore will be an important research focus of control method in future due to the property of "model-free" and "self-learning" that well accommodates the abundance of traffic information data. Besides, it will also provide an entry point and technical support for the development of Vehicle-to-X systems, Internet of vehicles, and autonomous driving industries. Therefore, the related achievements of the adaptive control system for the future traffic environment have extremely broad application prospects.

Many researchers, vehicle manufacturers, and telecommunication industries are working on VANETS to construct the next generation transport system. In VANETS, vehicles, equipped with wireless devices, exchange the traffic-related information with other vehicles and the fixed road side units (RSUs). The information shared between vehicles and RSUs in VANETS must be secure. For secure communications in VANETS, many cryptographic schemes were proposed in different settings, and most of the schemes are using bilinear pairings over elliptic curves. But the computation of a bilinear pairing is very expensive. Also the verification of signatures/messages sent by vehicles increases the computational workload on RSUs. In order to improve computational efficiency and transmission overhead, in this paper, we present an efficient pairing-free certificateless authentication scheme with batch verification for VANETS. We designed the scheme in pairing-free environment which improves the communication and computational efficiency. The proposed scheme supports batch verification, which significantly reduces the computational workload on RSUs in VANETS. The proposed scheme is proven secure in the random oracle model and meets the security requirements, such as authenticity, integrity, traceability, anonymity, and revocation. We compared our scheme with well-known existing schemes, and the efficiency analysis shows that the proposed scheme is more efficient.	[Gayathri, N. B.; Reddy, P.

In consideration of nonlinear and spatial-temporal features of urban traffic data, we propose a deep hybrid neural network improved by greedy algorithm for urban traffic flow prediction with taxi GPS trace. The proposed deep neural network model first combines the convolutional neural network (CNN), which extracts the spatial features, with the long short term memory (LSTM), which captures the temporal information, to predict urban traffic flow. Then, the proposed model is trained by a greedy policy to short time consumption and improves accuracy when a network goes deeper. Experimental results with real taxis GPS trajectory data from Xi'an city show that the improved deep hybrid CNN-LSTM model can achieve higher prediction accuracy and shorter time consumption compared with existing methods.

We propose methods that aim to reconstruct the used route through a transportation network from call detail records (CDRs) which are spatially and temporally sparse. The route estimation methods are compared based on the individual routes estimated. We also investigate the effect of different route estimation methods when employed in a complete network assignment for a larger city. Using an available CDR dataset for Dakar, Senegal, we show that the choice of the route estimation method can have a significant impact on resulting link flows.

J	Jereb, B; Kumperscak, S; Bratina, T				Jereb, Borut; Kumperscak, Samo; Bratina, Tadej			The Impact of Traffic Flow on Fuel Consumption Increase in the Urban Environment	FME TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						traffic flow; air pollution; PMx particles; increased fuel consumption; green wave		Over 70% of the European population lives in urban areas. This puts pressure on urban transport systems, leading to increased environmental impacts. Such impacts are particularly large in cases where the traffic caused by vehicles with internal combustion engines is repeatedly braking and accelerating due to poorly planned traffic flow. We have evaluated an increase in fuel consumption in the real case of a road section in Celje caused by the difference in traffic flow between the "green" and "red" wave of traffic lights. Based on the obtained results, we are able to estimate the factor of pollution increasing caused by accelerating. By adding the estimates of pollution caused by braking, we get an overall picture of the importance of ensuring a steady flow of traffic to reduce pollution in urban environments.

Alternative to decrease traffic accident is by developing accident prediction model. The model relates accident frequencies with traffic flow and various roadway environment characteristics contributing to accident occurrences. This paper presents the TRA prediction model for Jakarta Outer Ring Road Toll Road (JORR), to identify the most important causes of accidents and to develop predictive models. Data mining (DM) techniques (artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVM)) were used to model accident and incident data compiled from the historical data. Based on the R-Tools, results were compared with those from some classical statistical techniques (logistic regression (LR), revealing the superiority of ANNs and SVM in predicting and identifying the factors underlying accidents in toll road.

It is characterized by the occurrence of structural damage of the road pavement layers in which the neglect for a long period can worsen the condition of the pavement layers that can affect the traffic safety and comfort. Road pavement performance is determined based on the requirements of the functional and structural condition. The functional conditional requirements relate to roughness, pavement surface aggravation, while the structural condition requirements relate to the pavement strength or carrying capacity in serving the load and the traffic flow. The aim of this research is to evaluate the functional and structural of the flexible pavement on south arterial road in Yogyakarta and to provide recommendation of maintenance and rehabilitation. The functional evaluation of pavement is based on DGH and PCI method, which combines International Roughness Index (IRI) and Pavement Condition Index (PCI) values, while structural pavement evaluation is performed by analyzing the deflection value of Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) measurement analyzed by AASHTO 1993 with the output being the Structural Number (SN) value, where SN effective/SN future ratio results Structural Condition Index (SCI) value which determines whether a pavement requires overlay or not. The results of functional analysis based on IRI and PCI values indicate that the mad conditions for each segment are good, damaged and heavily damaged. The structural analysis for 2018 shows all segments yield SCI value<1 which means they require an overlay. The segments requiring functional overlay are Km 00 + 000 up to 02 + 400, Km 04 + 400 up to 05 + 600, Km 07 + 600 up to 13 + 200, Km and Km 16 + 000 up to 18 + 400. Meanwhile, the segments that require structural overlay are: Km 02 + 400 up to 04 + 400, Km 05 + 600 up to 07 + 600 and Km 13 + 200 up to 16 + 000.

Congestion occurs when the road capacity is less capable to handle the traffic volume. Surakarta City is surrounded by Boyolali Regency, Sukoharjo Regency, and Karanganyar Regency. It makes a lot of freight transportation from outside of Surakarta city, which ultimately increases the traffic volume. The objective of this research was to estimate the origin-destination (OD) matrix, and to find out the mad network performance in Surakarta City due to freight transportation as represented by traffic volume per capacity (V/C). Gravity model was used for estimating the O-D matrix. The value of parameter beta as a function of deterrence function was found out by using maximum entropy method. The parameter beta obtained was 0.081067. Subsequently, validity test was done using the coefficient of determination (R2) which represented the comparison of traffic flow from observation (traffic count) and from model was 0.831631. The process of trip assignment utilized EMME/3 software. The result showed the values of V/C in 2017, in which approximately 90.54% of roads in Surakarta City are in stable while 9.46% are in unstable condition (V/C>0.8). However, the absence of freight transportation will maintain 100% roads in the stable condition.

However, there is no specific focus on poweredtwo-wheelers. Furthermore, urban arterials have not received adequate attention so far because the majority of relevant studies considers freeways. This study aims to contribute to the current knowledge by utilizing support vector machine (SVM) models for predicting powered-two-wheeler (PTW) accident risk and VFW accident type propensity on urban arterials. The proposed methodology is applied on original and transformed time series of real-time traffic data collected from urban arterials in Athens, Greece, for 2006 to 2011. Findings suggest that PTW accident risk and PTW accident type propensity can be adequately defined by the prevailing traffic conditions. When predicting PTV/ accident risk, the original traffic time series performed better than the transformed time series. On the other hand, when PTW accident type is investigated, neither of the two approaches clearly outperformed the other, but the transformed time series perform slightly better. The results of the study indicate that the combination of SVM models and time-series data can be used for road safety purposes especially by utilizing real-time traffic data.

The resulted disruption even in small flood events may impose indirect damages which needs to be quantified to better manage traffic flows. In this paper, a framework was developed to address the vulnerability of transportation networks to pluvial and coastal flooding based on a state-of-the-art depth-disruption function which estimates flood depth impact on vehicle's speed reduction. In this framework, the flood depth was modeled using a static and hydrodynamic model and then assigned to each road segment. By turning flood depth into factors causing increase in travel time, the service area of four emergency services were calculated and the effect of coastal and pluvial flooding on road networks were discussed. The Lower Manhattan in New York City was selected as a case study. Results show that this framework provides better insights into determining critical road segments and subsequently traffic management during flooding events.

This allows to describe the system from both, a microscopic and a macroscopic point-of-view simultaneously, in the sense that two scales co-exist and are coupled, namely a set of moving agents and an average density. The resulting mathematical model consists of a strongly coupled PDE-ODE system with non-local interactions. Within this work we specify this multiscale model for a single lane roundabout, that is, an example of a road network. Then, we focus on the computational aspects in order to develop a setup for numerical simulations and to analyse the results of some experiments. This multiscale simulator can reproduce phenomena that characterize the real physical system, e.g. self-organization effects, and thus it can be adopted as an environment for control algorithms benchmarking or as a tool for simulation-based traffic flow control and optimization.

With the rapid growth of population and urban mobility in metropolitan cities, traffic congestion is often seen on roads. To tackle various issues for managing traffic on roads and to help authorities in proper planning, a smart traffic management system using the Internet of Things (IoT) is proposed in this paper. A hybrid approach (combination of centralized and decentralized) is used to optimize traffic flow on roads and an algorithm is devised to manage various traffic situations efficiently. For this purpose, the system takes traffic density as input from a) cameras b) and sensors, then manages traffic signals. Another algorithm based on Artificial Intelligence is used to predict the traffic density for future to minimize the traffic congestion. Besides this, RFIDs are also used to prioritize the emergency vehicles such as ambulances and fire brigade vehicles during a traffic jam. In case of fire on the road, Smoke sensors are also part of this system to detect this situation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed traffic management system, a prototype is developed which not only optimizes the flow of traffic but also connects nearby rescue departments with a centralized server. Moreover, it also extracts useful information presented in graphical formats that may help the authorities in future road planning.

Therefor the ability to predict the nature of the traffic stream accurately is one of the most important requirements of traffic management systems. In this research, we will propose an intelligent method to predict traffic flow based on real data for the years 2016 and 2017 provided by the Moroccan center for road studies and research. The proposed solution focuses on training a neural network model to estimate future traffic flow on an hourly basis. Results determined by the simulation gave a good prediction to the traffic data.

J	Musolino, G; Polimeni, A; Vitetta, A				Musolino, Giuseppe; Polimeni, Antonio; Vitetta, Antonino			Freight vehicle routing with reliable link travel times: a method based on network fundamental diagram	TRANSPORTATION LETTERS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH			English	Article						Vehicle routing problem; network fundamental diagram; traffic flow theory; reliable link travel times; urban area	EMERGENCY CONDITIONS; FLEET SIZE; ALGORITHM; HYSTERESIS; WINDOWS	This paper presents a procedure for the solution of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) based on reliable link travel times. They are obtained as a combination of spatially disaggregated and aggregated data about simulated traffic conditions on an urban road network. The disaggregated data concern the congested link travel times, which are traditionally used as variable to be minimized in VRP. The novelty of this research article consists in the introduction of spatially aggregated data, which are estimated by means of the Network Fundamental Diagram (NFD). In a within-day dynamic context, they are a measure of reliability of travel times because they could anticipate the latter ones' variation in the short term. The equation of reliable link travel times is composed of a congestion term, expressing the traditional congested link travel times (or generalized costs), and a reliability term, which depends on the fundamental diagram of the link and the NFD of the homogeneous cluster of adjacent links. The proposed procedure has been validated and applied for two real test cases. NFDs data are used in the proposed link travel time function to calculate reliable travel times. The reliable link travel times are used for the solution of VRP to obtain optimal routes of freight vehicles.

Mesoscopic queue length simulation models are developed based on the input-output method. The input-output method aims to model the traffic flow arrival profile; then, the mesoscopic simulation model generates random traffic volume to simulate the stochasticity of traffic flow. The simulation models are validated using field-collected data. Simulation results indicated that the traffic flow arrival pattern has significant impacts on ramp queue length; vehicle platoons released from the upstream signalized intersection tend to exacerbate ramp queue length. At metered ramps, the required queue storage length is found to be 5.7% of demand when demand is less than 500 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl), or 3.9% when demand is greater than 500 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl). In comparison, at metered connectors, the percent numbers are 4.7 and 2.1%, respectively.

These manoeuvres result in changes in speed and headways and have a negative influence on traffic safety and capacity. However, the distance upstream where turbulence starts and the distance downstream where it dissolves are yet unknown. In this paper, we propose a new method for detecting the start and end distances of turbulence. This method relies on the analysis of large quantities of empirical loop detector data from multiple on-ramps and off-ramps at different sites. By comparing the traffic operations near ramps to those on a regular motorway section, the length of the turbulence influence area can be estimated. The scope of the research is limited to three-lane motorways in the Netherlands, and shows that the distribution of traffic over the motorway lanes is a useful indicator for turbulence.

In the model, the paths of vehicles travelling toward a road link are depicted for the first time. Based on the model, a simulation approach is used to analyze the traffic jam formation caused by an incident under a scenario that travelers are informed of such an incident from advanced traveler information systems and some of them conduct a detour prior to entering the incident-induced congested roads. Simulation results reveal the influences of some major parameters on an incident-induced congestion formation. These parameters are the ratio of vehicles conducting a detour over the total ones and the amount of traffic flow driving to the blocked link in the traffic network.

However, owing to short of traffic conditions prediction, in earlier studies, the impact on traffic flow dynamics of the applied RM control was not quantitatively evaluated. In this study, a RM control algorithm adopting Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to predict and assess future traffic conditions, which taking both the current traffic conditions and the RM-controlled future traffic states into consideration, was presented. The designed RM control algorithm targets at optimizing the network mobility and safety performance. The designed algorithm is evaluated in a field-data-based simulation. Through comparing the presented algorithm controlled scenario with the uncontrolled scenario, it was proved that the proposed RM control algorithm can effectively relieve the congestion of traffic network with no significant compromises in safety aspect.

S	Ji, X		Liu, L; Yang, C; Ke, J		Ji, Xiang			The impact of self-driving cars on existing transportation networks	ADVANCES IN MATERIALS, MACHINERY, ELECTRONICS II	AIP Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Advances in Materials, Machinery, Electronics (AMME)	JAN 20-21, 2018	Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA					In this paper, considering the usage of self-driving, I research the congestion problems of traffic networks from both macro and micro levels. Firstly, the macroscopic mathematical model is established using the Greenshields function, analytic hierarchy process and Monte Carlo simulation, where the congestion level is divided into live levels according to the average vehicle speed. The roads with an obvious congestion situation is investigated mainly and the traffic flow and topology of the roads are analyzed firstly. By processing the data, I propose a traffic congestion model. In the model, I assume that half of the non-self-driving cars only take the shortest route and the other half can choose the path randomly. While self-driving cars can obtain vehicle density data of each road and choose the path more reasonable. When the path traffic density exceeds specific value, it cannot be selected. To overcome the dimensional differences of data, I rate the paths by BORDA sorting. The Monte Carlo simulation of Cellular Automaton is used to obtain the negative feedback information of the density of the traffic network, where the vehicles are added into the road network one by one. I then analyze the influence of negative feedback information on path selection of intelligent cars. The conclusion is that the increase of the proportion of intelligent vehicles will make the road load more balanced, and the self-driving cars can avoid the peak and reduce the degree of road congestion. Combined with other models, the optimal self-driving ratio is about sixty-two percent. From the microscopic aspect, by using the single-lane traffic NS rule, another model is established to analyze the road Partition scheme. The self-driving traffic is more intelligent, and their cooperation can reduce the random deceleration probability. By the model, I get the different self-driving ratio of space-time distribution. I also simulate the case of making a lane separately for self-driving, compared to the former model. It is concluded that a single lane is more efficient in a certain interval. However, it is not recommended to offer a lane separately. However, the self-driving also faces the problem of hacker attacks and greater damage after fault. So, when self-driving ratio is higher than a certain value, the increase of traffic flow rate is small. In this article, that value is discussed, and the optimal proportion is determined. Finally, I give a nontechnical explanation of the problem.

Existing sources and types of traffic flow data were reviewed and evidences that traffic flow data can be considered as spatiotemporal big data were provided. Current trends in spatiotemporal big data analytics and in urban traffic flow modelling and forecasting were consolidated and a list of joint emerging challenges was composed. The stated challenges cover different spatiotemporal aspects of big data and are linked to optimal time and space data resolution, spatial and temporal relationships in traffic data, computational complexity of spatiotemporal algorithms, fusion of traffic data from heterogeneous data sources into a single predictive scheme, and development of responsive streaming algorithms. The raised challenges are supported by an extensive literature review, and suggestions for future work are offered.

As a step towards developing such a system this paper presents a fuzzy model that estimates the average delay times on a road that ends at an intersection with traffic lights. The model was created based on data obtained using a validated microscopic traffic simulator that is based on the Intelligent Driver Model. Simulations were carried out for different traffic flow, traffic signal cycles, and green period values. The newly developed fuzzy model can be used as a module in a traffic light optimization system.

Regarding a future world where automated driving technologies have become mature and most vehicles follow the pre-scheduled route suggested by a navigation system, it is likely to predict the traffic jam accurately if the navigation system can know the pre-scheduled route of each vehicle. Recently, a navigation algorithm is presented for automated driving vehicles with the assumption that all the navigating query requests are processed by a single system. However, the aforementioned algorithm does not consider any kind of uncertainty originating from accidents and destination change. To get close to the real world, we propose a navigation algorithm with near-future evaluation capability that also allows some kinds of uncertainties. We compare our algorithm with a dynamic-update based conventional navigation algorithm without near-future evaluation capability. We download some metropolitan maps from OpenStreetMap and utilize the data of traffic flow from official statistics to randomly generate many sets queries.

J	Olia, A; Razavi, S; Abdulhai, B; Abdelgawad, H				Olia, Arash; Razavi, Saiedeh; Abdulhai, Baher; Abdelgawad, Hossam			Traffic capacity implications of automated vehicles mixed with regular vehicles	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						automated highway system; automated lane changing; automated vehicles; Connected Vehicles; highway capacity; micro-simulation	ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; FLOW; MODEL; FRAMEWORK; DYNAMICS; SAFETY	Automated vehicles (AVs) have begun to receive tremendous interest among researchers and decision-makers because of their substantial safety and mobility benefits. Although much research has been reported regarding the implications of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) technologies for highway capacity, to our knowledge, evaluations of the impacts of AVs are rare. AVs can be divided into two categories, cooperative and autonomous. Cooperative AVs, unlike Autonomous AVs, can communicate with other vehicles and infrastructure, thereby providing better sensing and anticipation of preceding vehicles' actions, which would have an impact on traffic flow characteristics. This paper proposes an analytical framework for quantifying and evaluating the impacts of AVs on the capacities of highway systems. To achieve this goal, the behavior of AVs technologies incorporated on the car-following and lane-merging modules in the traffic micro-simulation model, based on which an estimate of the achievable capacity is derived. To consider the period before AVs account for a majority of the vehicles in traffic networks, the proposed model considers combinations of vehicles with varying market penetration. The results indicate that a maximum lane capacity of 6,450 vph per lane (300% improvement) is achievable if all vehicles are driven in a cooperative automated manner. Regarding the incorporation of autonomous AVs into the traffic stream, the achievable capacity appears highly insensitive to market penetration. The results of this research provide practitioners and decision-makers with knowledge regarding the potential capacity benefits of AVs with respect to market penetration and fleet conversion.

Graph Model of Vehicle Conflict Interaction at Various Crossroads	SCIENCE & TECHNIQUE			Russian	Article						transport and pedestrian flows; conflict; conflict point; motion trajectory; intersection; graph theory; intersection graph; merging graph; danger		The paper introduces a new notion that is a graph of crossroad transport flows. It has been shown that the given graph serves as a unification of conflict graphs. The paper provides numerical characteristics of graphs on conflict interaction of transport flows in the process of their merging and intersection at crossroads of various configuration. The following construction of the graph has been carried out: merging graphs where their nodes correspond to conflicting flows and their edges indicate what flows enter into a merging conflict between themselves; intersection graphs where graph nodes correspond to conflicting flows and their edges indicate what flows enter into an intersection conflict between themselves Taking into account the conflict interaction between traffic and pedestrian flows, traffic conditions and traffic trajectories before possible physical interaction the traffic flow graph takes such form which contains complete information about existing conflicts for the required intersection. As a result of the construction in accordance with theoretical aspects of a graph theory and actual interaction of transport and pedestrian flows at intersections, some regularities have been revealed that allow to estimate a danger of any particular intersection within the urban street-road network. The proposals can be identified as hazard markers of an object and that is especially topical with due account of available actual data on driving regimes, traffic light regulation, flow intensity and driving speed (especially single vehicles exceeding permissible driving speed for urban traffic or taking into account local restrictions on certain sections of street-road network) which form a vehicle or pedestrian graph. The proposed approaches can be used to assess quality of road traffic in conflict areas of the street-road network in cities and settlements and public roads as well.	[Kapskiy, D.

Self-representation-based matrix completion attempts to optimally represent each sample by linearly combining other samples when conducting missing values recovery. Typically, it implements sparse or dense combination through imposing either l(1)-norm or l(2)-norm regularization over the representation coefficients, which is not always optimal in practice. To permit more flexibility, we propose in this paper a novel approach termed as l(p)-norm regularized sparse self-representation (SSR-l(p))by incorporating nonconvex l(p)-norm with 0 < p < 1 as regularization. In such a way, it is able to produce more sparsity than l(1)-norm and in turn facilitates the accurate recovery of missing data. We further develop an efficient iterative algorithm for solving SSR-l(p). The performance of this method is evaluated on a real-world road network traffic flow data set.

Traffic congestion and traffic lights constitute a large portion of the time spent in traffic. This wasted time for waiting in traffic also costs countries considerable amount of wasted fuel and hence considerable amount of money. In this study, traffic flow of a road in Izmir, Turkey is considered. In order to decrease all the wasted resources in urban traffic, an experimental design is conducted on the factors affecting the signal controlled traffic flow. The design factors are determined to be signal times of traffic lights, traffic intensity and the speed of vehicles. The effects of these factors on the three performance measures of time in system, waiting time in red light and number of vehicles going out of the system are analyzed. A fractional factorial design is carried out on the 486 design points evaluated using simulation modeling. In results, among the design points, best level of factors to minimize total waiting time in traffic flow are determined.

This research mainly focuses on the distribution problem of traffic flow in the urban traffic network. A minimization program has been provided as an alternative formulation for the turning delay stochastic user equilibrium problem. The paper derives the Weibull distribution-based node-link random loading mechanism of turning delay for direct calculation of link and turning flows that are consistent with the path flow, thus avoiding the enumeration of turning paths. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the turning delay stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) model and the node-link-based algorithm. The experiment demonstrates that the present method can reflect the relative performance of link and turning costs well, while presenting its advantages in the simulation of large-scale turning delay flow assignment.

A significant part of freight vehicles moving along the main and regional roads are overloaded and cause significant damage to road infrastructure, affect road safety and result in an increase of emissions of harmful gases for people and the environment. The overloading rate is extremely high, in particular with 5-axle trucks representing 58.7%. The research showed that the increased overload level ranges from 10-20% of the maximum permissible weight. The importance of load limits was recognized early in the history of road development. This interrelation led directly to limitations on vehicle loads, and laws were enacted in many countries to establish the maximum allowable motor vehicle sizes and weights. Strict enforcement of motor vehicle size and weight laws is a step toward reducing motor vehicle size and weight violations, heavy truck accidents, and, even more, improving road maintenance, rehabilitation expenditures and road safety. Thus, based on the applied model the objective of this paper is to evaluate and optimize the locations of truck weigh stations on the road network of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

UPGRADING TRAFFIC CIRCLES TO MODERN ROUNDABOUTS TO IMPROVE SAFETY AND EFFICIENCY - CASE STUDIES FROM ITALY	PROMET-TRAFFIC & TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						traffic circles; modern multilane roundabout capacity models; multilane roundabouts design; operational efficiency analysis; traffic flow simulation	MICROSIMULATION; DESIGN	This paper presents a procedure for analysing safety and operational improvements made possible by converting traffic circles to modern roundabouts. An Italian case study is presented for alternative layouts under various traffic demand scenarios. In the application of the procedure, the average waiting times and queue lengths at entries are computed with an analytical capacity model, using default values for gap parameters. Then, the roundabout is dynamically simulated. The simulation results in a revised set of gap parameters that are in turn used as inputs to a second trial of the capacity model, and in turn fed back into the simulation. The two steps are repeated until the parameters reach a pre-selected convergence criterion, so that gap parameter values for both the static capacity and dynamic microsimulation models are in equilibrium. Therefore, the applied procedure can conduct both static and dynamic roundabout design, usually applied separately. One can start with default values in guidelines and couple them with limited field data, improving both the expected results and cost-effectiveness of solutions. Next, safety is estimated using dynamic simulation software and a compatible conflict counting model to acquire surrogate measures of safety. Level-of-service and surrogate safety indicators for the existing and redesigned roundabouts are then compared. The procedure is first demonstrated on an old "ultra-large" roundabout. The procedure is tested on this roundabout using the Highway Capacity Manual 2016 (HCM2016), Aimsun (TM), and Surrogate Safety Assessment Model (SSAM) software. A redesign is shown to be far superior in efficiency and safety. Finally, two cases are described where large first generation roundabouts were upgraded to modern standards.

About quasi-solutions of traveling wave type in models for organizing cargo transportation	BIZNES INFORMATIKA-BUSINESS INFORMATICS			English	Article						mathematical modeling of cargo transportation process; rule of control; differential equations; non-local restrictions; quasi-solutions; numerical realization		This article is devoted to the construction and research of a model for organizing cargo transportation between two node stations connected by a railway line which contains a certain number of intermediate stations. The organization of freight traffic is facilitated by a number of technologies. These technologies determine the rules for taking on cargo at the initial node station, the rules of interaction between neighboring stations, as well as the rule of distribution of cargo to the final node stations. The process of cargo transportation is accompanied by the set rule of control consisting in measuring the volumes of goods transported at neighboring stations with a single time lag. For such a model, one must determine possible modes of cargo transportation and describe their properties. Traffic flow is described by a finite-difference analog of the nonlinear parabolic equation. The control system is set by nonlocal restrictions, which distinguishes the solutions of traveling wave type. The class of such solutions is extremely narrow. This results in the need for the "correct" extension of a class of solutions of the traveling wave type to a class of quasi-solutions of the traveling wave type. One type of expansion presupposes assumptions of discontinuous solutions of the traveling wave type; the second type allows for violations in a small control system. An essential lack of discontinuous solutions is their limitlessness. In this work, we investigate quasi-solutions obtained with the help of a second type of extension. The distinctive feature of such quasi-solutions is the assumption of feasibility of not local restrictions with the set error. The question of the limitation of such quasi-solutions is investigated. Using computer model implementation we investigate the dependence of the error in the performance of nonlocal restrictions on model parameters, which are the characteristics of the technologies used to carry out the cargo flow.

The Priority Riemann solver (PRS) provides a solution at junctions by taking into consideration priorities for the incoming roads and maximization of through flux. We prove existence of solutions for the solver for junctions with up to two incoming and two outgoing roads and show numerically the comparison with previous Riemann solvers. Additionally, we introduce a second version of the solver that considers the priorities as softer constraints and illustrate numerically the differences between the two solvers.

With the goal of adaptive coordination of a traffic network to achieve high network-wide traffic efficiency, this paper develops a bio-inspired adaptive traffic signal control for real-time traffic flow operations. This adaptive control model is proposed based on swarm intelligence, inspired from particle swarm optimization. It treats each signalized traffic intersection as a particle and the whole traffic network as the particle swarm, then optimizes the global traffic efficiency in a distributed and on-line fashion. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve the performance improvement in terms of the queuing length and traffic flow allocation.

The current control methods suffer from several shortcomings, such as lack of consideration of on-ramp queue or lane-change behavior on multi-lane mainstream. This paper optimizes the real-time density-based on-ramp metering algorithm by taking multi-lane traffic flow character into consideration. The error function representing lane difference is defined as the objective, and real-time density considering lane change is used as the control parameter of calculating the metering rate. The micro-simulation is used for testing the performance of the multi-lane real-time density-based on-ramp metering (MRD-RM) model using the field data collected in Chengdu. The simulation result shows that MRD-RM model outperforms ALINEA and non-control in terms of reducing average queue length as well as keeping traffic flow on mainstream close to capacity.

This article summarizes the cognition and research status of traffic equilibrium, and analyzes the limitations and shortcomings of traffic equilibrium realization mechanism. It points out that the assumptions of existing traffic equilibrium models are too idealistic. These models are not in conformity with the conditions and processes of the equilibrium in reality, and there are drawbacks like not all-sided considering the travelers' features such as individual homogeneity, complete rationality, and perfect information, and models are hard to solve under the "top-down" solution mode, when taking time variation of traffic flow or randomness of travelers' route choice procedure into consideration. It also summarizes the new method of studying the complex adaptive system in social and economic fields and puts forward the idea and prospect that future research on the traffic equilibrium could draw lessons from the related achievements in the researches of social and economic fields. By applying complex adaptive system theory to research of traffic equilibrium and adopting research method of agent-based modeling and simulation under "bottom-up" mode, research in the following future could establish traffic equilibrium model that is in accordance with the characters of traffic participants such as individual heterogeneity, bounded rationality, incomplete information, self-organization, intelligent learning, and decision-making. It opens up a new way to research on traffic equilibrium in the perspective of complex adaptive system theory.

Traffic flows of different moving targets were taken into account in the research to analyze the conflict types of vehicles and bicycles. A mathematical model of vehicle-bicycle conflict at signalized intersections was established according to the location, speed, acceleration, and other parameters of the moving targets. Finally, taking the intersection between Haidian District Bajiao East Street and Era Garden North Road for instance, it is considered to be a conflict when the actual distance between the moving targets is less than the critical conflict radius, and there is no conflict otherwise. The results of the study demonstrate that the mixed traffic conflict model fits well with the actual situation. Besides, it is helpful to alleviate the traffic conflict and to realize the traffic safety at signalized intersection.

J	Cheng, HY				Cheng, Hsu-Yung			Highway Traffic Flow Estimation for Surveillance Scenes Damaged by Rain	IEEE INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article								In this paper, we propose a traffic flow estimation system for intelligent highway surveillance applications under rainy conditions. Major contributions of the proposed system include flexible feature extraction, robust estimation with adaptive clustering, and an effective graph-based traffic-flow mapping model. To evaluate raindrop-tampered scenes, features are extracted via salient region detection and block segmentation. For traffic flow estimation, lane directions are automatically detected for daytime scenes. Foreground moving edges accumulated along the traffic flow direction are used as features. We use an adaptive clustering algorithm to estimate vehicle count for each frame. For nighttime scenes, statistical features are extracted from the segmented blocks, and regression models are applied to generate per-frame vehicle count. Finally, an effective graph-based mapping method is incorporated to map the vehicle-count sequences to per-minute traffic flow. The accuracy of the traffic flow analysis suffices even when the cameras are seriously affected by rain. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed system can effectively analyze traffic flow under rainy conditions for highway surveillance cameras.

The analysis of ship traffic was performed by means of statistical methods with the use of historical AIS data. The paper presents probabilistic models of ship traffic's spatial distribution and its parameters. The results showed that there is a correlation between the standard deviation of traffic flow and TSS lane width that can be used in practical applications to ensure the safety of navigation, improve navigation efficiency, safety and risk analysis in given area, and for the creation of a general model of ship traffic flow.

Effect of Wind Angle Direction on Carbon Monoxide (CO) Concentration Dispersion on Traffic Flow in Padang City	2ND ANNUAL APPLIED SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CONFERENCE (AASEC 2017)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd Annual Applied Science and Engineering Conference (AASEC)	AUG 24, 2017	Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, UPI Publicat Ctr, Bandung, INDONESIA	Univ Sumatera Utara, Univ Negeri Manado, Univ Negeri Surabaya, Univ Muhamadiyah Purwokerto	Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, UPI Publicat Ctr		ON-ROAD VEHICLES; PREDICTION	This study aims to analyze the relationship between CO concentration and wind direction. Wind direction in this context is the wind angle to the road on the traffic flow in Padang City. Sampling of CO concentration was conducted for 9 days at 3 monitoring points (each 3-day point) representing the wind angle to the road (alpha) i. e. at Jend. A. Yani road (0 degrees), Andalas road (30 degrees) and Prof. Dr. Hamka road (60 degrees), using impinger and analyzed by spectrophotometer. The results of the research in the three monitoring sites showed that the concentration of CO ranged between 137.217 and 600.525 mu g/Nm(3). The highest and lowest concentrations respectively on Prof. Dr. Hamka road and Jend. A. Yani road. The sampling showed that CO concentrations will be decreased if wind direction is changed from perpendicular wind direction (alpha 90 degrees) to alpha 60 degrees, 30 degrees, and 0 degrees respectively by 64.62%, 37.77% and 27.09%. It can be concluded that the wind angle direction to the road affects the CO concentrations in the roadside.	[Bachtiar, V.

The model is based on the cellular automata theory and presents a generalization of the Nagel-Schreckenberg model to a multilane case. The created program package allows to simulate traffic on various types of road fragments (T or X type intersection, strait road elements, etc.) and on road networks that consist of these elements. Besides that, it allows to predict the consequences of various decisions regarding road infrastructure changes, such as: number of lanes increasing/decreasing, putting new traffic lights into operation, building new roads, entrances/exits, road junctions.

J	De Blasiis, MR; Diana, S; Veraldi, V				De Blasiis, Maria Rosaria; Diana, Selene; Veraldi, Valerio			Safety audit for weaving maneuver: A driver simulation safety analysis	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION SAFETY & SECURITY			English	Article						driving behavior; weaving lane; driving simulator; road safety audit	DRIVING SIMULATOR; VALIDATION	Weaving lanes are designed to ensure the crossing of two or more traffic streams traveling in the same direction along stretch of road without the aid of traffic control devices. Weaving lanes assume a key role in roundabouts characterized by wide inscribed circle diameter, where the weaving maneuver represents a crucial aspect for safety. This is confirmed by several findings that demonstrate as the weaving maneuver is one of the most difficult operation to analyze in terms of road safety. Many studies report that the combination between the length of weaving lanes and the traffic volume is a key factor to explain high accident rate along interchange zones. Bearing in mind this facet, this article proposes an analysis of driver behavior on different weaving lanes in various traffic conditions performed on an interactive driving simulator. Different lengths of weaving lane combined with different traffic flow conditions were simulated, and the different drivers' performance have been analyzed. A risk assessment has been conducted by analyzing driver's behavior as a function of driver's risk perception. It has been observed that the increase of weaving lane length is effective only when the traffic flow conditions exceed a certain threshold.

J	Qu, X; Yang, MF; Yang, F; Ran, B; Li, LC				Qu, Xu; Yang, Mofeng; Yang, Fan; Ran, Bin; Li, Linchao			An Improved Single-Lane Cellular Automaton Model considering Driver's Radical Feature	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article							CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW; BEHAVIOR; CALIBRATION; PARAMETERS	Traffic flow models are of vital significance to study the traffic system and reproduce typical traffic phenomena. In the process of establishing traffic flow models, human factors need to be considered particularly to enhance the performance of the models. Accordingly, a series of car-following models and cellular automaton models were proposed based on comprehensive consideration of various driving behaviors. Based on the comfortable driving (CD) model, this paper innovatively proposed an improved cellular automaton model incorporating impaired driver's radical feature (RF). The impaired driver's radical feature was added to the model with respect to three aspects, that is, desired speed, car-following behavior, and braking behavior. Empirical data obtained from a highway segment was used to initialize impaired driver's radical feature distribution and calibrate the proposed model. Then, numerical simulations validated that the proposed improved model can well reproduce the traffic phenomena, as shown by the fundamental diagram and space-time diagram. Also, in low-density state, it can be found that the RF model is superior to the CD model in simulating the speed difference characteristics, where the average speed difference of adjacent vehicles for RF model is more consistent with reality. The result also discussed the potential impact of impaired drivers on rear-end collisions. It should be noted that this study is an early stage work to evaluate the existence of impaired driving behavior.

J	Yang, SQ; Wang, C; Jiang, CJ				Yang, Siqian; Wang, Cheng; Jiang, Changjun			Wireless Vehicular Check-in Protocol at Urban Road Intersection	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Urban intersection; wireless check-in; vector auto-regressive and moving average model (VARMA); reinforcement learning	PRIVACY-PRESERVATION; VEHICLE	Intelligent organization of the traffic flow at an urban intersection is fundamentally important in intelligent transportation systems. Because of their low-cost deployment and convenient maintenance, wireless devices attract more attention against traditional devices, e.g., ground loops and road cameras. This paper targets to provide a vehicle-efficient check-in at a roadside unit (RSU) installed at an urban intersection through wireless communication, which means that each vehicle exchanges information with the RSU while traveling past the intersection. While this seems simple, it is nontrivial because fast-moving vehicles limit the lifetime of their packets and the RSU suffers from mutual interference caused by other mobile devices. Especially, the communication background environment is complex and highly dynamic. To address the challenges, we design a wireless check-in protocol with flexible parameters on the basis of the IEEE 802.11 protocols. The protocol leverages a vector auto-regressive and moving average model and reinforcement learning to dynamic environment adaptation. Moreover, a fine-grained tuning method based on an exponential smoothing algorithm is applied on the RSU side to further improve the check-in efficiency. We evaluate the proposed check-in protocol by combining the real urban road intersection data, collected in Shenzhen and Shanghai, with a simulation of urban mobility (SUMO) and an NS-3 network simulator. Its usage brings about 10% improvement in both check-in ratio and packet reception ratio in comparison with the IEEE 802.11p. It also can act as a basic component for various real-time information services.

The stability criterion and neutral stability curve are obtained by linear stability theory. The nonlinear stability analysis is investigated further to get the solution of the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation and get the three areas of stability, metastability, and unstability. The new LRVD model (left and right lane velocity difference model) with bigger stable area can stabilize middle lane traffic flow better, which is proved by the linear theory, nonlinear theory, and the simulation. The LRVD model shows if drivers on the middle lane pay more attention to more cars in front on the two side lanes on the three-lane road, the middle lane traffic flow is certain to be more stable in real life. On the complex three-lane road, if intelligent traffic management system based on the huge traffic data for drivers is applied in real life, it is very helpful to ensure traffic safety, which is also the trend of transportation development in future.

J	Zhang, YC; Hou, ZX				Zhang, Yuchi; Hou, Zhixiang			Short Term Traffic Flow Prediction Based on Improved Support Vector Machine	JOURNAL OF APPLIED SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Support Vector Machine; Particle Swarm Optimization; Traffic Flow Prediction; Parameter Selection		The traditional forecasting methods are not suitable for short term traffic flow prediction, due to strong non-linear, time varying characteristics of urban transportation system. In order to improve forecasting accuracy of short term traffic flow, short term traffic flow prediction model based on support vector machine is presented. The most important parameter of support vector machine is parameter selection including the kernel function parameter and the penalty factor, which has significant influence on the properties of model prediction. Particle swarm optimization is used to optimize support vector machine, and particle swarm optimization is improved by means of adjusting inertia weight and choosing acceleration constant dynamically. Then improved particle swarm optimization is used to optimize support vector parameter. The experiment results show that predictive result based on improved particle swarm optimization LSSVM is closer to the real traffic flow data compared with support vector machine based on basic particle swarm optimization. Short term traffic prediction model based on improved particle swarm optimized support vector machine is feasible.

In order to detect traffic incidents accurately, highway traffic incident detection model is set up based on the characteristics of highway traffic flow and the basic principles of traffic incident detection. This model includes data preprocessing module, construction of SVM and decision output module. Improved particle swarm optimization is adopted to optimize parameters of SVM model. By adjusting the penalty parameter and the size of the radial basis kernel parameter, we can make SVM has better classification performance.

According to the driving rules, the nearside lane is the one that is primarily used. The main reasons for lane changes are overtaking, congestion, or restrictions on other lanes. The empirical research presented in this paper presents comprehensive traffic characteristics observed in different traffic lanes on four-lane motorways in Slovenia. The research was focused on the influence of adverse weather conditions on the lane flow distribution, and on the speed of vehicles in different lanes. The lane flow and speed distributions both directly affect road capacity and safety; therefore, estimating these characteristics could improve the reliability of active traffic control when traffic flow perturbation is detected. Field test results show that lane flow distributions and lane speed distributions at a particular site vary depending on weather conditions, namely, dry, wet (rain), low-visibility, and snow conditions.

The study uses actual data gathered in travel time survey on urban streets, recorded by applying second by second GPS data. The survey is limited to traffic flow in saturated conditions. The RMSE method (Root Mean Square Error) is used for research results comparison with relevant models: Akcelik, HCM (Highway Capacity Manual), Singapore model and modified BPR (the Bureau of Public Roads) function (Dowling - Skabardonis). The lowest deviation in local conditions for urban streets with standardized intersection distance (400-500 m) is demonstrated by Akcelik model. However, for streets with lower signal density (< 1 signal/km) the correlation between speed and degree of saturation is best presented by HCM and Singapore model. According to test results, Akcelik model was adopted for travel speed estimation which can be the basis for determining the level of service in urban streets with standardized intersection distance and coordinated signal timing under local conditions.

Traffic light assistance (TLA) systems in particular utilize real-time traffic light timing data by accessing the information directly from the traffic management center. To test the reliability of a TLA system based on networked intervehicular interaction with infrastructure, we present in this paper an approach to perform theoretical studies in a lab-controlled scenario. The proposed system retrieves the traffic light timing program within a range in order to calculate the optimal speed while approaching an intersection and shows a recommended velocity based on the vehicle's current acceleration and speed, phase state of the traffic light, and remaining phase duration. Results show an increase in driving efficiency in the form of improvement of traffic flow, reduced gas emissions, and waiting time at traffic lights after the drivers adjusted their velocity to the speed calculated by the system.

J	Isaksson-Hellman, I; Lindman, M				Isaksson-Hellman, Irene; Lindman, Magdalena			An evaluation of the real-world safety effect of a lane change driver support system and characteristics of lane change crashes based on insurance claims data	TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION			English	Article						Real-world evaluation; lane change crashes; blind spot information system; insurance data		Objective: Lane changes, which frequently occur when vehicles travel on major roads, may contribute to critical situations that significantly affect the traffic flow and traffic safety. Thus, knowledge of lane change situations is important for infrastructure improvements as well as for driver support systems and automated driving development projects. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the crash avoidance performance of a lane change driver support system, the Blind Spot Information System (BLIS) in Volvo car models, and to describe the characteristics of lane change crashes by analyzing detailed information from insurance claim reports.Methods: An overall evaluation of the safety effect of BLIS was performed by analyzing crash rate differences in lane change situations for cars with and without the optionally mounted BLIS system based on a population of 380,000 insured vehicle years. Further, crashes in which the repair cost of the host vehicle exceeded approximately US$1,250 were selected and compared. Finally, the study examined different precrash factors and crash configurations, using in-depth insurance claims data from representative lane change crash cases including all severity levels in a population of more than 200,000 insured vehicle years.Results: The technology did not significantly reduce the overall number of crashes when all types of lane change crashes and severity levels were considered, though a significant crash-reducing effect of 31% for BLIS cars was found when more severe crashes with a repair cost exceeding US$1,250 were analysed. Cars with the BLIS technology also have a 30% lower claim cost on average for reported lane change crashes, indicating reduced crash severity. When stratifying the data into specific situations, by collecting precrash information in a case-by-case study, the influence of BLIS was indicated to differ for the evaluated situations, although no significant results were found. For example, during general lane change maneuvers (i.e., not while exiting or entering highways or during weaving/merging situations) the crash rate was reduced by 14%, whereas in weaving/merging situations the crash rate increased.Conclusions: The insurance data analyzed provided useful information about real-world lane change crash characteristics by covering collisions in all crash severities and thus revealed information beyond what is available in, for example, data sets of police-reported crashes. This will guide further development of driver support systems. For crashes with repair cost exceeding US$1,250, a significant crash reduction was found, although the technology did not significantly reduce the total number of lane change crashes. An average lower insurance claim cost for cars equipped with the BLIS technology also indicated that the technology contributes to reduced crash severity even if crashes were not totally avoided. Stratifying the data into different lane change crash situations gave indications of the condition-specific performance of the system, even if the results were not statistically significant at the 95% level.

Its small size and aggressive riding patterns can considerably affect the overall traffic flow characteristics and safety. Modelling the characteristic behaviour and complex movement patterns of motorised two-wheelers is essential due to their pronounced role in microscopic traffic simulations, traffic management strategies, safety evaluation, transport planning and intelligent transportation systems. This paper begins with an overview of the determinant factors used for MTW modelling, followed by a critical review of various modelling approaches that have been adopted to depict the movement patterns of MTWs. The review concentrates on (i) identifying the factors mostly studied with respect to MTW-research, (ii) discussing the potential and limitations of each modelling approach and (iii) reporting some of the aspects that need further consideration for modelling MTWs in heterogeneous mixed traffic streams. The findings of the paper suggest that an integrated approach can be more viable to depict the unique riding patterns of motorised two-wheelers and some possible directions for future studies are also proposed.

Demand Research for "Park and Ride" Parking Lots	SCIENCE & TECHNIQUE			Russian	Article						"park and ride" parking lots; transport demand; traffic; traffic flow; transport network; correspondence		The paper presents results of demand research for "park and ride" parking lots in the city of Kharkiv. The analysis of the previous research pertaining to demand for "park and ride" parking lots has been carried out in the paper. Disadvantages of the existing methods have been identified as well. A methodology in research on demand for "park and ride" demand for "park and ride" parking lots in the city of Kharkiv according to various characteristics. Distribution of traffic parking lots in the city of Kharkiv has been developed and it is based on modelling of transportation correspondence distribution on traffic networks and a questionnaire survey of car drivers. The obtained data have made it possible to segment the demand for drivers representing suburban areas according to frequency of visits to the city by private cars has been determined in the paper. Drivers' satisfaction with their efficient movement through the city has been assessed in the paper. Segmentation of traffic demand in the places of possible locations for "park and ride" parking lots has been made according to urban transportation distance and on the basis of modelling distribution of transport correspondences. Quantity demanded for "park and ride" parking lots in the Kharkiv city in dependence to conditions for services has been calculated according to a questionnaire survey of car drivers. It has been established that conditions for parking services significantly determine the demand for "park and ride" parking lots. Analysis of segmentation results concerning the demand for "park and ride" parking lots has shown that under current condions demand for this type of parkings in Kharkiv is at rather low level and they are practically absent in case of 5 km urban transportation distance. Parameters demonstrating dependence of demand for "park and ride" parking lots on transportation distance through the city have beendetermined in the paper. The obtained results of the research are considered as initial data to study demand for "park and ride" parking lots.	[Lobashov, A. O.; Prasolenko, A. V.; Dolya, K. V.; Burko, D.

J	Papantoniou, P				Papantoniou, Panagiotis			Structural equation model analysis for the evaluation of overall driving performance: A driving simulator study focusing on driver distraction	TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION			English	Article						Driving performance; structural equation models; driving simulator; road safety; driver distraction	CELL PHONE CONVERSATIONS; OF-FIT INDEXES; TRAFFIC FLOW; IMPACT; PERSONALITY; VALIDATION; EXPERIENCE; PASSENGER; BEHAVIOR; SAFETY	Objective: The present research relies on 2 main objectives. The first is to investigate whether latent model analysis through a structural equation model can be implemented on driving simulator data in order to define an unobserved driving performance variable. Subsequently, the second objective is to investigate and quantify the effect of several risk factors including distraction sources, driver characteristics, and road and traffic environment on the overall driving performance and not in independent driving performance measures.Methods: For the scope of the present research, 95 participants from all age groups were asked to drive under different types of distraction (conversation with passenger, cell phone use) in urban and rural road environments with low and high traffic volume in a driving simulator experiment. Then, in the framework of the statistical analysis, a correlation table is presented investigating any of a broad class of statistical relationships between driving simulator measures and a structural equation model is developed in which overall driving performance is estimated as a latent variable based on several individual driving simulator measures.Results: Results confirm the suitability of the structural equation model and indicate that the selection of the specific performance measures that define overall performance should be guided by a rule of representativeness between the selected variables. Moreover, results indicate that conversation with the passenger was not found to have a statistically significant effect, indicating that drivers do not change their performance while conversing with a passenger compared to undistracted driving. On the other hand, results support the hypothesis that cell phone use has a negative effect on driving performance. Furthermore, regarding driver characteristics, age, gender, and experience all have a significant effect on driving performance, indicating that driver-related characteristics play the most crucial role in overall driving performance.Conclusions: The findings of this study allow a new approach to the investigation of driving behavior in driving simulator experiments and in general. By the successful implementation of the structural equation model, driving behavior can be assessed in terms of overall performance and not through individual performance measures, which allows an important scientific step forward from piecemeal analyses to a sound combined analysis of the interrelationship between several risk factors and overall driving performance.

A Mixed Network Design Problem (MDNP) is formulated to describe the problem where the upper-level problem is a mixed integer non-linear program designed to maximize the network capacity by optimizing the input parameters (e.g. the signal splits, circles, reassigned number of lanes and O-D demands), while the lower-level problem is the common Deterministic User Equilibrium (DUE) assignment problem formulated to model the drivers' route choices. According to whether one way strategy is permitted in practice, two strategies for implementing reversible roadway are considered. In the first strategy, not all lanes are reversible and the reversible roadways always hold its ability to accommodate the two-way traffic flow. In the second strategy, one-way road is allowed, which means that all the lanes are reversible and could be assigned to one flow direction if the traffic flow in both directions is severally unsymmetrical. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is detailedly presented to solve the bi-level network capacity problem. The application of the proposed method on a numerical example denotes that Strategy 2 can make more use of the physical capacity of key links (signal controlled links), thus, the corresponding network capacity outperforms it is of Strategy 1 considerably.

Demand peaks have been witnessed just around the time when the charge jumps up or down. Such peaks may not be desirable, in particular (a) when the resulting peaks are much higher than available capacities; (b) traffic speeding up to get into the charging zone causes more incidents just before the toll rises up to a higher level; or (c) traffic slowing down or parking on the roadside decreases road traffic throughput just before the toll falls sharply. We term these types of demand peaks 'boundary effects' of congestion charging. This paper investigates these effects in a bottleneck scenario and aims to design charging schemes that reduce undesired demand peaks. For this purpose, we observe and analyse the boundary effects utilising a bottleneck model under three types of toll profiles that are indicative of real charging schemes. The first type maintains a constant toll across the charging period, the second type allows the toll to increase from zero to a given maximum level and then decrease back to zero and the third type allows the toll to rise from zero to a given maximum level, remain at this level for a fixed period and then fall down to zero. This investigation shows that all three types of toll profiles can produce greater boundary peak demands than the bottleneck capacity. A significant contribution of this work is that instead of designing an optimal traffic congestion pricing scheme we analyse how existing sub-optimal congestion pricing schemes could be improved and suggest how observed problems may be overcome. Hence, we propose a set of extra requirements to supplement existing principles or requirements for design and implementation of congestion charging, which aim to reduce the adverse consequences of boundary effects. Concluding remarks are made on implications of this investigation for the improvement of existing congestion charging projects and for future research.

Traffic accidents occur for various reasons, with one of them being the transport infrastructure and next the condition of traffic environment. Motorways are considered to be the safest roads, which have initially been planned as dedicated roads intended to be travelled only by personal cars, but the evolution of modal split of freight transport in Europe is causing the heterogeneity of traffic flows on these roads, which consequently affects the traffic safety. The aim of this paper is to explore the effects of changing volume and structure of traffic flows on road safety on Slovenian motorways. After the exhaustive analysis of past data, the paper provides different models for forecasting traffic safety on Slovenian motorways.

In order to define countermeasures to solve this problem, it is necessary to collect and analyze certain data that will indicate type of measures, which should be applied. In this paper, it was done on the example of one 3-leg and one 4-leg intersection where citizens provided information about frequent RLR to the City Administration of Belgrade (Serbia). The statistical significance of differences between the collected data was tested by ANOVA analysis and by PostHoc Tukey test, which showed that forecasting of second of RLR after red-light onset could effectively be conducted by Cubic distribution. In order to define the so-called RLR risk indicator for the intersection, the use of the Danger Degree (DD) indicator, that presents the rate between the number of dangerous situations caused by RLR and the total number of RLR, was proposed.

J	Kos, G; Sevrovic, M; Jovic, J				Kos, Goran; Sevrovic, Marko; Jovic, Josip			HARMONIZATION AND SYNCHRONIZATION MODEL OF INTERRUPTED TRAFFIC FLOWS ON MOTORWAYS	TRANSPORT			English	Article						motorway; interrupted traffic flow; temporary signage; traffic volume; harmonizing traffic; flow synchronization; coordination diagram	SIGNAL-CONTROL	The research in this paper focuses on harmonization and synchronization of traffic flows in the period of application of zonal temporary traffic regulation. The specific case scenario addressed in this research implicates that on both carriageways no vehicles were allowed to reside in the work zones for a significant time interval in the same time periods on both sections. In order to solve this problem, the model for harmonization of the traffic flows on dual carriageway motorways with synchronization of opposing traffic flows on both carriageways in special traffic conditions is presented. Actual traffic situation that occurred is presented in order to demonstrate the model, where intensive traffic flows were interrupted on both carriageways during extensive road works on two nearby sections. The model described in this paper has several stages. The first stage implies detailed analysis of traffic flows with computation of expected number of vehicles in the queue. The next stage in the modelling process is to calculate the queue discharge time for both directions and propose measures to optimise operating speed in order to maximize capacity. Then, a graphical method by means of two-way coordination diagram is used to synchronise stop signal timings on all closed sections. This paper shows results of a new model that was developed and implemented in real situations in most complex conditions that can occur on motorways. The research findings have shown the suitability of the proposed model.

The capacity of an entire intersection depends not only on the effective green time per phase and the length of each short left-turn lane but also on the selected signal phase plan. This paper enumerates 16 typical signal phase plans for a four-leg intersection with protected left-turn phases. Given the existence of short left-turn lanes and the freedom to select signal phase plans, two optimization models are formulated. Numerical examples are carried out to illustrate the application of these models and show the sensitivity of the outcomes to impact factors. The orthogonal experiments show that the primary factor is whether a short left-turn lane is added on an approach and the demand distribution is the secondary factor in determining an optimal allocation of the time-space resources of an intersection. To analyse traffic flow operations under different signal phase sequences, the simulation tests are fulfilled using VISSIM under the assumption that the components of a signal phase plan and green splits are all identical. The simulated results indicate that the signal phase sequence for a specified approach may greatly affect traffic movements at an approach, and the leading green phasing is better than the lagging one for a specified approach when the left-turn bay length is short at the approach. Finally, two variations of the developed models are recommended for use and the procedure for the model application is provided in practice.

This paper makes an empirical analysis on the spatial-temporal characteristics of highway traffic flow using manifold similarity index and manifold learning technology. The time series of highway traffic flow is converted into the distance series containing manifold features to calculate the manifold distance between multi-section traffic flow data points, which are highly similar to spatial-temporal distribution of traffic flow speed parameters, and then, the levels calibration of traffic state is carried out according to the manifold distance, so as to reveal the distribution rule of spatial-temporal characteristics of highway traffic flow. Its prediction error is obviously lower than the traditional distance measurement method, which has higher accuracy. The research of this paper can provide new ideas and methods to reveal the highway traffic flow evolution and traffic state prediction.

J	Qi, HS				Qi, Hongsheng			Graphical Solution for Arterial Road Traffic Flow Model Considering Spillover	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Traffic flow; arterial; graphical solution; simulation	KINEMATIC WAVES	This research proposes a graphical solution to arterial road dynamics simulation. An arterial road consists of channelized and upstream sections. Traffic flow is mixed in the upstream section (U-section) and operates without lateral interaction in the channelized section (C-section). Under over-saturated conditions, C-section spillover occurrence governs the traffic flow dynamics of the entire road. In order to capture the arterial road traffic flow dynamics, the proposed method takes advantage of the following components: 1) a decomposition mechanism that uniforms the analysis of each lane; 2) a red green pair-based vehicle queue tracking component that describes traffic dynamics both temporally and spatially; and 3) a well-defined converted cumulative curve that is capable of generating a queue solution directly. The graphical method permits arbitrary traffic flow and signal settings input and can easily be automated, as demonstrated in the example.

For most models, the selection of time lag is a crucial factor affecting the forecasting performance. Instead of choosing a single time lag when constructing model, in this paper, we propose a novel approach attempting to construct multiple base forecasting models, each with different time lag and performance. Least squares support vector regression ( LSSVR) with the Gaussian kernel function is adopted as the base model because of its nonlinear modeling capability, as well as empirical performance. Then, the outputs of these base models are integrated to produce final prediction through another LSSVR with the linear kernel function. This ensemble forecasting framework consists of many parameters that need to be adjusted. To address this issue, an improved harmony search algorithm tailored for our forecasting system is further developed for seeking the optimal parameters. The real-world traffic flow data are collected from several observation sites located around the intersection of Interstate 205 and Interstate 84 freeways in Portland, OR, USA. Experimental results verify that the proposed approach is able to provide better forecasting performance in comparison with other competing methods.

R.; Cetin, Mecit; Habtemichael, Filmon			Probe vehicle lane identification for queue length estimation at intersections	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						GPS probe vehicles; lane identification; market penetration rate; queue length estimation	WAVES	Vehicles instrumented with Global Positioning Systems, also known as GPS probe vehicles, have become increasingly popular for collecting traffic flow data. Previous studies have explored the probe vehicle data for estimating speeds and travel time; however, there is very limited research on predicting queue dynamics from such data. In this research, a methodology was developed for identifying the lane position of the GPS-instrumented vehicles when they are standing in the queue at signalized intersections with multiple lanes, particularly in the case of unequal queue. Various supervised and unsupervised clustering methods were tested on data generated from a microsimulation model. Among the tested methods, the Optimal Bayes Rule that utilizes probability density functions estimated using bivariate statistical mixture models was found to be effective in identifying the lanes. The methodology for lane identification was tested for queue length estimation. This research confirms that the lane identification is an important step required prior to the queue length estimation. The accuracies of the models for lane identification and queue length estimation were evaluated at varying levels of demand and probe vehicle market penetrations. In general, as the market penetration increases, the accuracy improves as expected. The result shows that 40% market penetration rate is adequate to reach about 90% accuracy.	[Rompis, Semuel Y.

These are applicable in the context of vehicular traffic flow as well as pedestrian traffic flow. The microscopic model is based on an optimal velocity function and a reaction time parameter. The corresponding macroscopic formulations in Eulerian or Lagrangian coordinates result in first order convection-diffusion equations. More precisely, the convection is described by the optimal velocity while the diffusion term depends on the reaction time. A linear stability analysis for homogeneous solutions of both continuous and discrete models is provided. The conditions match those of the car-following model for specific values of the space discretization. The behavior of the novel model is illustrated thanks to numerical simulations. Transitions to collision free self-sustained stop-and-go dynamics are obtained if the reaction time is sufficiently large. The results show that the dynamics of the microscopic model can be well captured by the macroscopic equations. For nonzero reaction times we observe a scattered fundamental diagram.

Assessment of Heterogeneous Road Traffic Noise in Nagpur	ARCHIVES OF ACOUSTICS			English	Article						traffic noise; Federal Highway Administration (FHWA); Traffic Noise Model (TNM); Prediction Model; A-weighted time-average sound level (L-Aeq, (T)); noise pollution	RESIDENTIAL AREAS; POLLUTION; INDIA; ORISSA; TOWN	The objective of the study is to assess the noise scenario and evaluate prediction model for heteroge-neous traffic conditions. In the past few years, road traffic of Nagpur has increased significantly due to the rapid increase in the number of vehicles. Noise levels are monitored at six different squares, characterized as interrupted traffic flow due to traffic signals, high population density and heavy traffic where the major sources of noise are engines, exhausts, tires interacting with the road, horns, sound of gear boxes, breaks, etc. The A-weighted time-average sound levels (L-Aeq, (T)) are measured at the different time of day during peak and off-peak traffic hours. To assess the traffic noise more precisely, the noise descriptors such as L-10, L-50, L-90, L-Aeq, (T), TNI (Traffic Noise Index), NPL (Noise Pollution Level) and NC (Noise Climate) are used. In the present study, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) noise prediction model is used for prediction of noise levels and it is observed that one-hour duration measured L-Aeq, (T) ranged from 71 to 76 dB(A) and 71.6 to 76.3 dB(A) during peak and off peak hours respectively. Due to the heavy traffic the peak hour Sound Exposure Levels (L-AE) at all locations are exceeding permissible limit of 70 dB(A) prescribed by the World Health Organization (W.H.O). Off-peak traffic hour noise levels are within permissible limit except at two locations, Jagnade and HB town square. Significant correlation was obtained when best fit lines generated between measured and predicted values gives R-2 of 0.455 for all time intervals. Chi-Square test (chi(2)) was also computed to investigate the noise levels at different squares. The results show that the inhabitants of Nagpur city are exposed to high transportation noise during daytime.

VANET has turned into a main module of the intelligent transport system. It is a self-controlled, wheeled network (also called network on wheels), and a wider and stimulating class of mobile ad hoc network (MANET). VANETs raise many innovative challenges because of their high-class and unique features, such as high-node mobility, dynamic topology changes, wireless links breakage, network constancy, and network scalability. A well-organized routing protocol is one of the most challenging matters of such networks. In this paper, we propose an intelligent naive Bayesian probabilistic estimation practice for traffic flow to form a stable clustering in VANET, briefly named ANTSC. The proposed scheme aims to improve routing by employing awareness of the current traffic flow as well as considering the blend of several factors, such as speed difference, direction, connectivity level, and node distance from its neighbors by using the intelligent technique. The proposed technique has proven to be more strong, stable, robust, and scalable than existing ones.

The IEEE 1609.4 is a standard (legacy) designed to support multi-channels in VANETs, namely control channel (CCH) and service channels (SCHs) with fixed alternating CCH and SCH intervals. The CCH is dedicated to broadcast safety and control applications while SCHs are used to transfer service data applications. However, due to the nature of contention-based channel access scheme and the transmission of multiple applications over the CCH during a fixed interval, safety applications performance is degraded during CCH congestion in high network density scenarios. In this paper, we propose an adaptive multi-channel assignment and coordination (AMAC) scheme for the IEEE 802.11p/1609.4 in VANETs which exploits channel access scheduling and channel switching in a novel way. AMAC scheme includes an adaptive execution of the peer-to-peer negotiation phase between service providers and users for SCH resource reservations, and collision-aware packet transmission mechanisms. These two mechanisms alleviate collisions and increase packet delivery ratio (PDR) of safety applications on the CCH. Thereby, the AMAC scheme ensures an efficient and reliable quality of service (QoS) for different traffic flows and improves the time diversity among vehicles based on the traffic conditions. For performance analysis, analytical models are developed based on 1-D and 2-D Markov chain models taking into account an error-prone channels. The probabilities of successful transmission and collisions have been derived to compute PDR, and delay for safety packets in legacy standard and AMAC scheme. Analytical and simulation results indicate that the AMAC scheme reduces the collisions and increases the PDR for safety applications over the CCH compared with the legacy standard. In addition, AMAC scheme outperforms the legacy standard in terms of system throughput of service applications.

The timely and accurate travel information of urban residents could assist users in planning their travel strategies and improve the operational efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. Currently, the origin-destination (OD) flows of urban residents are formulated as an OD matrix, which is used to denote the travel patterns of urban residents. In this paper, a simple and effective model, called NMF-AR, is proposed for predicting the OD matrices through combining the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm and the Autoregressive (AR) model. The basic characteristics of travel flows are first revealed based on the NMF algorithm. Then, the nonlinear time series coefficient matrix, extracted from the NMF algorithm, is estimated based on the AR model. Finally, we predict OD matrices based on the estimated coefficient matrix and the basis matrix of NMF. Extensive experiments have been implemented, in collected real data about taxi GPS information in Beijing, for comparing our proposed algorithm with some known methods, such as different kinds of K-nearest neighbor algorithms, neural network algorithms and classification algorithms. The results show that our proposed NMF-AR algorithm have a more effective capability in predicting OD matrices than other models.

J	Jing, BB; Xu, JM				Jing, Binbin; Xu, Jianmin			A General Maximum Progression Model to Concurrently Synchronize Left-Turn and through Traffic Flows on an Arterial	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							SIGNAL COORDINATION; OPTIMIZATION MODEL	In the existing bandwidth-based methods, through traffic flows are considered as the coordination objects and offered progression bands accordingly. However, at certain times or nodes in the road network, when the left-turn traffic flows have a higher priority than the through traffic flows, it would be inappropriate to still provide the progression bands to the through traffic flows; the left-turn traffic flows should instead be considered as the coordination objects to potentially achieve better control. Considering this, a general maximum progression model to concurrently synchronize left-turn and through traffic flows is established by using a time-space diagram. The general model can deal with all the patterns of the left-turn phases by introducing two new binary variables into the constraints; that is, these variables allow all the patterns of the left-turn phases to deal with a single formulation. By using the measures of effectiveness (average delay time, average vehicle stops, and average travel time) acquired by a traffic simulation software, VISSIM, the validity of the general model is verified. The results show that, compared with the MULTIBAND, the proposed general model can effectively reduce the delay time, vehicle stops, and travel time and, thus, achieve better traffic control.

However, reducing traffic and car accidents can only be achieved by disseminating safety messages in a timely manner with high reliability. Although mathematical modeling of the delay of safety messages is extremely beneficial, analyzing the safety messages propagation is considerably complex due to the high dynamics of vehicles. Moreover, most previous works assume vehicles drive independently and the interaction between vehicles is not taken into consideration. In this paper, we proposed an analytical model to describe the performance of safety messages propagation in the VCPSs under platoon-based driving pattern. Infrastructure-less and RSU-supported scenarios are evaluated independently. The analytical model also takes into account different transmission situations and various system parameters, such as communication range, traffic flow, and platoon size. The effectiveness of the analytical model is verified through simulation and the impacts of different parameters on the expected transmission delay are investigated.

However, the noise frequency changes according to the different types of vehicles moving at various speeds. The primary objective of this study is the development of a method of calculating the insertion loss based on frequencies. First, the noise emissions of a large number of vehicles classified by speed and type were measured to obtain data the noise spectrum. The corresponding relation between vehicle type, speed, and noise frequency was obtained. Next, the impact of different frequencies on the insertion loss was analyzed and was verified to be reasonable in experiments with different propagation distances compared to the analysis of a pure 500 Hz sound. In addition, calculations were applied in a case with different traffic flows, and the effect of a road noise barrier with different types of constituents and flow speeds were analyzed. The results show that sound pressure levels behind a barrier of a heavy vehicle flow or with a high speed are notably elevated.

Extent of Entry Capacity Loss at Roundabouts Caused by Rainy Conditions	ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								Entry capacity loss at multilane roundabouts caused by rainfall was investigated. Traffic and rainfall data were collected continuously for eight weeks at selected sites in South Africa and Malaysia. Three classes of rainfall (light, moderate, and heavy) were used. Both linear and exponential techniques were used to model the relationship between entry and circulating traffic flows. Correction factor for entry angle and radius was introduced in the linear model equations to allow for variations in geometric data. Correction factor is not required for the exponential model technique. Notwithstanding, both techniques predicted that entry capacity loss would result from rainfalls irrespective of their intensity. Results show that light rainfall may cause about 5% entry and circulating capacity loss, moderate rainfall may cause about 12% capacity loss, and heavy rainfall may cause about 17% capacity loss. this paper proposed further studies into the effect of two circulating lanes rather than one on entry capacity at roundabouts.

J	Jin, WL				Jin, Wen-Long			Kinematic wave models of sag and tunnel bottlenecks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Sags and tunnels; Kinematic wave model; Capacity reduction; Capacity drop; Bounded acceleration; Continuous standing wave	TRAFFIC FLOW; CAPACITY DROP	Sags and tunnels are critical traffic bottlenecks, as they can cause capacity reduction, capacity drop, and extreme low acceleration rates when vehicles accelerate away from the upstream queue. In this paper, we present a behavioral kinematic wave model to explain the three bottleneck effects of sags and tunnels. Assuming increasing time gaps, we derive location-dependent triangular fundamental diagrams to explain the capacity reduction effect; with a bounded acceleration constraint on the stationary states inside the capacity reduction zone, we demonstrate the occurrence of capacity drop and derive a formula to calculate the dropped capacity from the fundamental diagram, road geometry, and acceleration process; from the structure of continuous standing waves we verify the low acceleration rate out of the upstream queue. We also present a simplified phenomenological model of capacity drop at sag/tunnel bottlenecks and two Cell Transmission Models for numerical simulations. With four stationary trajectories at the Kobotoke tunnel in Japan, we calibrate and validate the behavioral model and find that the theoretical predictions match the observations very well. This study can help to develop better design and control strategies to improve the performance of a sag or tunnel bottleneck. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Considering the influence of an abandoned object on driving behavior, a Visual-based Asymmetric Two-lane Cellular Automata model with Abandoned Object (V-ATCA-AO) and an Internet-of-Vehicles-based Asymmetric Two-lane Cellular Automata model with Abandoned Object (IoV-ATCA-AO) are proposed. Based on the two models, two types of traffic accidents caused by an abandoned object are analyzed: rear-end collision caused by the abandoned object ahead and collision of the vehicle with the abandoned object. Simulation results show the following: (1) the accidents occur when the road density is smaller, while the accidents will not occur when the density is larger. The results are different from the rear-end collision rate curve without abandoned object in a single lane. (2) Compared with the visual-based avoidance pattern in V-ATCA-AO, the Internet-of-Vehicles-based avoidance pattern in IoV-ATCA-AO can create an early warning for the abandoned object and tell the vehicle to make an earlier lane change and decelerate in advance, thereby significantly reducing the accident rate. (3) Spatiotemporal characteristics in front of the abandoned object directly affect the accident rate: the less the "stability" of a traffic jam in front of the abandoned object, the higher the accident rate.

J	Kang, LJ; Meng, Q; Liu, Q				Kang, Liujiang; Meng, Qiang; Liu, Qiang			Fundamental diagram of ship traffic in the Singapore Strait	OCEAN ENGINEERING			English	Article						Singapore Strait; Strait capacity; Ship traffic; Speed-density fundamental diagram; Big AIS data; Weighted least square approach	SPEED-DENSITY RELATIONSHIP; AIS DATA; CAPACITY; MODELS; COLLISIONS; FLOW	The Singapore Strait plays a vital role for the international freight transportation, including containers, bulk cargo and crude oil. In view of the importance of Singapore Strait, it is of practical significance to investigate the ship traffic's speed-density relationship called the fundamental diagram in the Strait, which can be used to estimate the theoretical strait capacity. Despite the availability of large empirical ship traffic data and the long history of traffic flow modeling, the analysis of ship traffic fundamental diagram for the Singapore Strait is still highly deficient. To fill in the gap, we first develop a research framework to address the big MS (automatic identification system) data for the ship traffic fundamental diagram building. To ensure the correctness of MS data, a tangible error elimination method is presented. Moreover, a novel weighted least square approach is applied to develop the ship traffic speed-density formulations accurately. Meanwhile, we also show the applicability of the weighted least square approach by a theoretical investigation into the difference between the weighted and non-weighted least square approaches. Finally, we study all the fifteen legs in the Singapore Strait and propose 75 fundamental diagrams based on four classic traffic flow models through mining more than 43 million pieces of MS data. These fundamental diagrams also indicate the theoretical capacity of each leg in the Singapore Strait.

Measuring working memory load effects on electrophysiological markers of attention orienting during a simulated drive	ERGONOMICS			English	Article						Attention orienting; working memory load; event-related potentials; driving simulation	EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; CROSSING ASSIST SYSTEM; YOUNG NOVICE DRIVERS; COGNITIVE LOAD; OLDER DRIVERS; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; ERP COMPONENTS; IMPACT; DISTRACTION	Intersection accidents result in a significant proportion of road fatalities, and attention allocation likely plays a role. Attention allocation may depend on (limited) working memory (WM) capacity. Driving is often combined with tasks increasing WM load, consequently impairing attention orienting. This study (n=22) investigated WM load effects on event-related potentials (ERPs) related to attention orienting. A simulated driving environment allowed continuous lane-keeping measurement. Participants were asked to orient attention covertly towards the side indicated by an arrow, and to respond only to moving cars appearing on the attended side by pressing a button. WM load was manipulated using a concurrent memory task. ERPs showed typical attentional modulation (cue: contralateral negativity, LDAP; car: N1, P1, SN and P3) under low and high load conditions. With increased WM load, lane-keeping performance improved, while dual task performance degraded (memory task: increased error rate; orienting task: increased false alarms, smaller P3).Practitioner Summary: Intersection driver-support systems aim to improve traffic safety and flow. However, in-vehicle systems induce WM load, increasing the tendency to yield. Traffic flow reduces if drivers stop at inappropriate times, reducing the effectiveness of systems. Consequently, driver-support systems could include WM load measurement during driving in the development phase.

J	Zhang, G				Zhang, Geng			The self-stabilization effect of lattice's historical flow in a new lattice hydrodynamic model	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS			English	Article						Traffic flow; Lattice hydrodynamic model; Self-stabilization effect; Historical flow	CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA MODEL; MODIFIED KDV EQUATION; 2-LANE TRAFFIC FLOW; INTERRUPTION PROBABILITY; JAMMING TRANSITIONS; DENSITY DIFFERENCE; FEEDBACK-CONTROL; DYNAMICAL MODEL; ANGLE	In order to reveal the self-stabilization effect of the lattice's historical information on traffic flow, a new lattice hydrodynamic model with consideration of the considered lattice's historical flow is proposed. The impact of the lattice's historical flow on traffic stability is uncovered through theoretical analyses and numerical simulation. Through theoretical analyses, the linear stability condition of the new model is obtained, and the nonlinear mKdV equation is derived to describe traffic jamming transition of the new model near the critical point. From numerical simulation, the theoretical analyses are verified and it is shown that the traffic stability can be enhanced by considering the current lattice's self-information of its historical flow.

The self-stabilizing control is constructed into the new model by utilizing the historical traffic data (the historical velocity and the historical optimal velocity of the considered vehicle). We derive the stability condition of the extended model against a small perturbation around the homogeneous flow. Theoretical results reveal that the self-stabilizing control in historical optimal velocity difference can further stabilize traffic system on the basis of the self-stabilizing control in historical velocity difference. It is also derived that the time gap between the current traffic data and the historical ones has an important impact on the stability criterion. We clarify the advantages of the self-stabilizing control over the cooperatively driving control and the flexibility in the choice of suppressing in traffic jams. Moreover, from the nonlinear analysis to the proposed model, the historical traffic data dependence of the propagating kink solutions for jam waves is achieved by deriving the modified KdV equation near critical point by using the reductive perturbation method.

In the existing energy management strategies, the dynamic programming (DP)-based energy management strategy (EMS) can realize the global optimization of the fuel consumption if the global vehicle-speed trajectory is known in advance. The global vehicle-speed trajectory can be obtained by applying GPS data of vehicles when the trip path is determined. However, for a trip path without GPS data, the global vehicle-speed trajectory is difficult to be gained. In this case, the DP-based EMS cannot be utilized to achieve the globally optimal fuel consumption, which is the issue discussed in this paper. This paper makes the following two contributions to solve this issue. First of all, the cell transmission model of the road traffic flow and the vehicle kinematics are introduced to obtain the traffic speeds of road segments and the accelerations of the PHEV. On this basis, a hybrid trip model is presented to obtain the vehicle-speed trajectory for the trip path without GPS data. Next, a DP-based EMS with prediction horizon is proposed, and moreover, in order to improve its real-time implementation, a search range optimization algorithm of the state of charge (SOC) is designed to reduce the computational load of DP. In summary, we propose a computation-optimized DP-based EMS through applying the hybrid tripmodel. Finally, a simulation study is conducted for applying the proposed EMS to a practical trip path in Beijing road network. The results show that the hybrid trip model can effectively construct the vehicle-speed trajectory online, and the average accuracy of the vehicle-speed trajectory is more than 78%. In addition, compared with the existing optimization algorithm for DP calculation, the SOC search range optimization algorithm can further reduce the calculation load of DP. More importantly, compared to the globally optimal DP-based EMS, although the proposed EMS makes the fuel consumption grow less than 5.36%, it can be implemented in real time. Moreover, compared with the existing real-time strategies, it can further reduce the fuel consumption and emissions. Thus, the proposed EMS can offer an effective solution for the PHEV applying it online in the trip path without GPS data.

Once a road is filled with a high traffic flow approaching its capacity, the conventional traffic light controller is not able to handle this traffic congestion phenomenon well. In this paper, we propose a novel regulatory traffic light control system to handle such traffic congestion by using synchronized timed Petri nets (STPNs). Three kinds of intersections in an urban traffic network are defined and employed to demonstrate our new regulatory traffic light control system models. Finally, the liveness and reversibility of the proposed STPN models are proven through the reachability graph analysis method. To our knowledge, this is the first work that solves a traffic congestion problem with a regulatory traffic light control technique that is effective in preventing vehicles from entering traffic congestion zones.

The congestion-pricing problem with reliability maximization as the goal of a transportation network is characterized by expensive-to-evaluate objective functions without closed forms. In this paper, an effective simulation-based optimization (SBO) method is utilized to solve the problem. The network reliability is measured by a weighted average link travel time coefficient of variation (CV) with link traffic flows as the weights. We employ DynusT to evaluate the system reliability as the objective function corresponding to different toll charges for a new toll road in Maryland. The results show that the two optimal toll charge strategies improve the network-wide reliability, reducing the weighted travel time CV by 9.60% and 1.16%, respectively, when compared to the baseline toll.

Scalable evacuation routing in a dynamic environment	COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS			English	Article						GIS; Evacuation; Traffic; Routing; Dynamic; Environment	TRAFFIC FLOW; ALGORITHMS; NETWORK; MODEL	In emergency management, tools are needed so we can take the appropriate action at different stages of an evacuation. Recent wildfires in California showed how quickly a natural disaster can affect a large geographical area. Natural disasters can create unpredicted traffic congestion or can temporarily block urban or rural roads. Evacuating a large area in an emergency situation is not possible without prior knowledge of the road network and the ability to generate an efficient evacuation plan. An ideal evacuation routing algorithm should be able to generate realistic and efficient routes for each evacuee from the source to the closest shelter. It should also be able to quickly update routes as the road network changes during the evacuation. For example, if a main road is blocked during a flood, the evacuation routing algorithm should update the plan based on this change in the road network. In this article major works in evacuation routing have been studied and a new algorithm is developed that is faster and can generate better evacuation routes. Additionally, it can quickly adjust the routes if changes in the road network are detected. The new algorithm's performance and running time are reported. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Shi, Y; Deng, M; Yang, XX; Gong, JY				Shi, Yan; Deng, Min; Yang, Xuexi; Gong, Jianya			Detecting anomalies in spatio-temporal flow data by constructing dynamic neighbourhoods	COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS			English	Article						Spatio-temporal flow data; Dynamic spatio-temporal flow; Dynamic neighbourhoods; Spatio-temporal flow anomalies	FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; OUTLIER DETECTION; SPACE; TIME; MULTIPLE; PATTERNS; CLUSTERS	In massive spatio-temporal datasets, anomalies that deviate from the global or local distributions are not just useless noise but possibly imply significant changes, surprising patterns, and meaningful insights, and because of this, detection of spatio-temporal anomalies has become an important research hotspot in spatio-temporal data mining. For spatio-temporal flow data (e.g., traffic flow data), the existing anomaly detection methods cannot handle the embedded dynamic characteristic. Therefore, this paper proposes the approach of constructing dynamic neighbourhoods to detect the anomalies in spatio-temporal flow data (called spatio-temporal flow anomalies). In this approach, the dynamic spatio-temporal flow is first modelled based on the real-time attribute values of the flow data, e.g., the velocity of vehicles. The dynamic neighbourhoods are then constructed by considering attribute similarity in the spatio-temporal flow. On this basis, global and local anomalies are detected by employing the idea of the G* statistic and the problem of multiple hypothesis testing is further addressed to control the false discovery rate. The effectiveness and practicality of our proposed approach are demonstrated through comparative experiments on traffic flow data from the central road network of central London for both weekdays and weekends.

Because of these disruptive changes, physical systems can now be attacked through cyberspace and cyberspace can be attacked through physical means. The paper considers security and resilience as system properties emerging from the intersection of system dynamics and the computing architecture. A modeling and simulation integration platform for experimentation and evaluation of resilient CPSs is presented using smart transportation systems as the application domain. Evaluation of resilience is based on attacker-defender games using simulations of sufficient fidelity. The platform integrates 1) realistic models of cyber and physical components and their interactions; 2) cyber attack models that focus on the impact of attacks to CPS behavior and operation; and 3) operational scenarios that can be used for evaluation of cybersecurity risks. Three case studies are presented to demonstrate the advantages of the platform: 1) vulnerability analysis of transportation networks to traffic signal tampering; 2) resilient sensor selection for forecasting traffic flow; and 3) resilient traffic signal control in the presence of denial-of-service attacks.

J	Kim, YH; Peeta, S; He, XZ				Kim, Yong Hoon; Peeta, Srinivas; He, Xiaozheng			An Analytical Model to Characterize the Spatiotemporal Propagation of Information Under Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communications	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Information flow propagation wave; V2V communications; cell transmission model; epidemic model	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; AD HOC NETWORKS; WORM EPIDEMICS; SPREAD; HIGHWAY; SYSTEM; WAVES; CONNECTIVITY	Modeling the spatiotemporal propagation characteristics of information under vehicle-to-vehicle communications is critical for developing information-enabled applications to improve traffic safety and mobility. Existing analytical approaches assume instantaneous information flow propagation to simplify the communication constraints arising from the traffic flow dynamics. Consequently, information flow propagation characteristics such as the information flow propagation wave have not been analyzed. They are necessary to describe the interactions with the underlying traffic flow dynamics. An analytical model, which integrates an epidemic model with a traffic flow model, is developed to account for such interactions. The proposed model is able to capture the dynamics of information flow and traffic flow in an integrated formulation that circumvents key analytical and numerical challenges. Results from computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and its ability to describe the dynamic characteristics of information flow propagation along with the traffic flow dynamics.

J	Qi, L; Zhou, MC; Luan, WJ				Qi, Liang; Zhou, MengChu; Luan, WenJing			A Two-level Traffic Light Control Strategy for Preventing Incident-Based Urban Traffic Congestion	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Timed Petri net (TPN); discrete event system; cell transmission model (CTM); traffic light control; emergency strategy; congestion formation and dissipation; traffic incident	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; STOCHASTIC PETRI-NET; CONTROL-SYSTEMS; SIGNAL CONTROL; REAL-TIME; INTERSECTIONS; SCENARIOS; NETWORKS; HIGHWAY; FREEWAY	This work designs a two-level strategy at signalized intersections for preventing incident-based urban traffic congestion by adopting additional traffic warning lights. The first-level one is a ban signal strategy that is used to stop the traffic flow driving toward some directions, and the second-level one is a warning signal strategy that gives traffic flow a recommendation of not driving to some directions. As a visual and mathematical formalism for modeling discrete-event dynamic systems, timed Petri nets are utilized to describe the cooperation between traffic lights and warning lights, and then verify their correctness. A two-way rectangular grid network is modeled via a cell transmission model. The effectiveness of the proposed two-level strategy is evaluated through simulations in the grid network. The results reveal the influences of some major parameters, such as the route-changing rates of vehicles, operation time interval of the proposed strategy, and traffic density of the traffic network on a congestion dissipation process.

Stability of the proposed CF model is analyzed using the perturbation method. Furthermore, the energy consumption of the EV traffic stream is investigated based on the drive cycles produced by the proposed model. Numerical experiments analyze three scenarios: start, stop, and evolution processes for the scenarios of no lateral gap, lateral gap, and lateral gap with roadside device, respectively. Results demonstrate that: 1) the nonlane-discipline-based model is more responsive than the lane-discipline-based model; 2) the nonlane-discipline-based model for the EV traffic stream consumes more energy in the acceleration phase and recuperates more energy in the deceleration phase compared with the lane-discipline-based model; and 3) the nonlane-discipline-based model with roadside device communication for EV traffic stream consumes more energy in the acceleration phase and recuperates more energy in the deceleration phase than the model without roadside devices.

Few studies that have analyzed the influence of highway incidents on traffic flow have discussed the length of vehicle queues during incidents. Therefore, the present study applied artificial neural network and regression methods to construct models for estimating the length of vehicle accident queues. The factors influencing the occurrence of accidents are numerous and complex. To estimate vehicle accident queue lengths, the models incorporated various data from accidents, including accident characteristics, traffic data, illumination, weather conditions, and road geometry characteristics. All raw data were collected from two public agencies and were integrated and cross-checked. Before model development, a correlation analysis was performed to reduce the scale of interrelated features or variables. In the model evaluation, the mean absolute percentage error of the most suitable model was below 50%, indicating that the proposed model and procedure provide a reasonable estimate of vehicle accident queue lengths.

J	Umer, T; Afzal, MK; Munir, EU; Alam, M				Umer, Tariq; Afzal, Muhammad Khalil; Munir, Ehsan Ullah; Alam, Muhammad			A Dual Ring Connectivity Model for VANET Under Heterogeneous Traffic Flow	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Connectivity model; Vehicular adhoc network; Heterogeneous traffic flow	AD HOC NETWORKS; DISSEMINATION	Vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) is characterized as a highly dynamic wireless network due to the dynamic connectivity of the network nodes. To achieve better connectivity under such dynamic conditions, an optimal transmission strategy is required to direct the information flow between the nodes. Earlier studies on VANET's overlook the characteristics of heterogeneity in vehicle types, traffic structure, flow for density estimation, and connectivity observation. In this paper, we have proposed a heterogeneous traffic flow based dual ring connectivity model to enhance both the message disseminations and network connectivity. In our proposed model the availability of different types of vehicles on the road, such as, cars, buses, etc., are introduced in an attempt to propose a new communication structure for moving vehicles in VANETl under cooperative transmission in heterogeneous traffic flow. The model is based on the dual-ring structure that forms the primary and secondary rings of vehicular communication. During message disseminations, Slow speed vehicles (buses) on the secondary ring provide a backup path of communication for high speed vehicles (cars) moving on the primary ring. The Slow speed vehicles act as the intermediate nodes in the aforementioned connectivity model that helps improve the network coverage and end-to-end data delivery. For the evaluation and the implementation of dual-ring model a clustering routing scheme warning energy aware cluster-head is adopted that also caters for the energy optimization.

The recent applications and services need to have integrated data store for efficient data access and deduction. The models at the state of the art are not satisfactory. Therefore, Sii-Mobility research and development project of Italian Ministry has developed a new model ontology, named the Km4City. It makes possible, among several services also the routing and traffic reconstruction. In the paper, the model identified and processes for knowledge base construction are described. The process takes into account Open Street Map, open data, and real-time data from sensors, mobility and transport operator in multiple formats and protocols, to load them into Km4City KB. A Traffic Reconstruction solution based on differential equations has been also presented. The data model and the solution developed with related algorithms are part of Km4City (www.km4city.org), and accessible for test and usage from Http://servicemap.km4city.org and from Http://firenzetraffic.km4city.org applied in Tuscany whole, one of the larges regions in Italy.

Congo River Basin plays an active role in the economy of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and other surrounding countries such as Central Africa Republic (CAR) and Congo Republic (RC). This inter-countries waterway carries approximately two third of the national's cargo volume to and fro hinterland. Up till now there is little or no regulation on the management of marine traffic on this important inland waterway. The problem of traffic management on Congo River is becoming an increasing threat to the transportation of goods by the ships, barges and safety of passenger lives. Marine radar systems has been deemed as possible solution that will monitor and track traffic situation on this important inland water way. A radar system provides a surveillance system that increases intelligent capacity of what transpires on this great waterway. It also provides real-time information and stored captured radar images which will be applied to solve traffic problems. To investigate this, radar simulation model will be setup to depict the traffic flow and the consequences of the presence or absence of surveillance radar. The goal of this research is to improve traffic coordination, safety, management and improve intelligent capability with the use of Marine Radar monitoring system to control and alleviate traffic management bottleneck experienced on Congo River. It will further demonstrate economic efficiency of the radar surveillance system on Congo River Basin. The proposed traffic model which will be based upon research findings will describe in details the operational approach of alleviating traffic management problem on Congo River Basin.

Although other studies have introduced many traffic management schemes in the view of road construction and theoretical analytic method to dominate shockwaves, there are many limitations on those existing methods. In order to explore more efficient and flexible speed control strategies to relieve congestion and queues caused by shockwaves on freeway, the extended variable speed limit strategy is proposed in this paper. Firstly, we explore insights into the traffic evolution based on the macroscopic traffic model ME NET and traffic fundamental diagram. By taking full advantages of intelligent vehicles and inter-vehicle systems on control and communication, the optimal speed limit scheme which is continuous in time and space then is investigated using genetic algorithm. Specially, the optimized scheme aims at improving the traffic evolution process not only on increasing discharge rates and alleviating capacity drops of bottlenecks, but also on restoring the free-flow traffic state and decreasing total travel time delay in traffic. Finally, compared with the uncontrolled case and a referenced analytic method, the extended variable speed limit strategy has demonstrated its potential benefits on relieving/solving congestion and queues caused by shockwaves in the freeway traffic.

Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is one of potential solutions to enable various applications to improve road safety and travel comfort, and has gained a lot of attention from researchers around the world. In order to efficiently manage the transportation system and reduce traffic congestion, one of the paramount problems needed to be solved in ITS is the accurate traffic prediction. In this article, we firstly combine Fourier analysis with wavelet denoising technique to cope with the traffic flow forecasting problem. A two-layer fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based traffic prediction scenario is proposed, in which the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with two different threshold values are adopted to decompose the high-frequent-noise and identify low-frequent traffic flow changing trend from the original data. Three different data sets with different traffic flow patterns are chosen from the England Highways data set to test our proposed work. Intensive simulations are implemented to verify the proposed work.

In particular, platooning can augment the road capacity, improve the traffic flow, and reduce emissions. However, existing studies do not take into account the impact of platooning maneuvers on traffic. Such impact can be particularly relevant as platooning will be gradually introduced, and automated vehicles will have to coexist with non-automated vehicles. Non-automated vehicles can interfere with the execution of platooning maneuvers, and hence have an impact on the benefits of platooning. In this context, this study analyzes for the first time the impact of platooning maneuvers on traffic (flow and speed) in mixed traffic scenarios where automated and non-automated vehicles coexist. The study demonstrates that the traffic benefits obtained with platooning can be overestimated if platooning maneuvers are not properly modelled and taken into account during the analysis.

To improve the forecasting accuracy, most existing methods mainly focus on the time-series data. In this paper, we propose a novel model combining transfer ratio and road similarity (CoTRRS) to forecast the short-term traffic flow, which makes full use of the spatial information in the urban road networks. We first utilize the Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model to extract the road similarity and then combine it with transfer ratio to make accurate forecast using a back propagation neural network. To verify our model, we have performed extensive experiments on a real dataset, and the empirical study reveals that CoTRRS outperforms baselines.

However, many existing prediction models endure several shortages. Most of the methods are constructed as a shallow model, which is difficult to reveal the intrinsic spatio-temporal relations embedded in traffic raw data. Moreover, the separation of feature learning and predictor learning brings a sacrifice of model performance. Then the hand designed features are difficult to be tuned appropriately. Finally, few existing methods consider the incomplete data problem which is in fact very severe for practical application. In this work, we develop a deep learning model to predict traffic flows. The main contribution is development of an architecture that integrates random subspace learning and ensemble learning on deep convolutional neural networks. The proposed model takes the traffic flow data as an image, and considers both exploring spatio-temporal correlations in the unified architecture and the incomplete data problem. The experimental results, using traffic data originated from the California Freeway Performance Measurement System (PeMS), corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with the state of the art.

Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) programs were implemented with the main objective to reduce the delay levels in the whole air transportation sector. The question is to find a suitable way to predict possible delay scenarios to better apply ATFM measures. The present work seeks to enrich the academic literature on the subject and aims to present the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to a prediction model of delays in the air route between Sao Paulo (Congonhas) Rio de Janeiro (Santos Dumont). The configuration of ANN exerts a great influence on its predictive power. To better adjust the parameters of the proposed ANN and for the hyperparameterization of the network to occur, the Random Search technique is used. By using the recall, precision and Fscore metrics in the performance measurement, the prediction results show the satisfactory in the case study.

However, the performance of current traffic flow prediction methods does not meet the expectation. Weather factors such as precipitation in residential areas and tourist destinations affect traffic flow on the surrounding roads. In this paper, we attempt to take precipitation impact into consideration when predicting traffic flow. To realize this idea, we propose a deep traffic flow prediction architecture by introducing a deep bi-directional long short-term memory model, precipitation information, residual connection, regression layer and dropout training method. The proposed model has good ability to capture the deep features of traffic flow. Besides, it can take full advantage of time-aware traffic flow data and additional precipitation data. We evaluate the prediction architecture on the dataset from Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) with precipitation data from California Data Exchange Center (CDEC) and the dataset from KDD Cup 2017. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed model for traffic flow prediction obtains high accuracy and generalizes well compared with other models.

Of these, multi-lane roads cater to a major portion of the urban road network Since they carry high traffic loads it is important to have a framework to evaluate the Capacity of these roads accurately. Since capacity values vary with the nature of the road and traffic stream developing indigenous capacity models is necessary. This research targets fill that gap by developing a speed-flow model for urban four-lane roads. in the process of developing this Passenger Car Unit(PCU) factors are developed for four-lane roads. The theoretical capacity for a four-lane road is found to be 2481 PCU/h/lane for 5-minute interval data. This is compared with the 15-minute interval capacity. Further the headway data of the survey sections were plotted and explored to have a better understanding of the nature of the traffic flow.

There are many causal factors that may give rise to traffic accidents, e.g. driver characteristics, road conditions, traffic flows and weather conditions, etc. Due to uncertain factors as well as the contingency of accident occurrences, it is very difficult to predict traffic accidents. Many existing works have utilized classical prediction models to predict the risk of accidents on highways or road segments. However, predicting the risk of citywide accidents remains an open issue. To address this problem, we propose SDCAE, a novel Stack Denoise Convolutional Auto-Encoder algorithm to predict the risk of traffic accident in the city-level. First, we divided the city into regions by counting the number of accidents and traffic flows in each region. Second, we employed a deep model of stack denoise convolutional autoencoder which considers spatial dependencies to learn the hidden factors in accidents. Third, we conducted extensive experiments on two real-world cross-domain traffic big datasets from a major city of China for accident risk prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that SDCAE could outperforms five baseline methods.

Many assumptions in an urban science may be made by analysing traffic flows and vehicle behaviour on city streets. Since road traffic is a dynamic and possibly spatially large system that depends on many external conditions, approaches like visual analysis and computational steering may be used. There are many traffic modelling frameworks presented in the field, but there are also several drawbacks most of them have: they are limited to a specific model or case; have abstracted logic which disregards some factors affecting vehicle movement; they ignore possible physical interactions which are not described in a model or use too many simplifications in vehicle interaction simulations. In this paper, a novel agent-based traffic modelling framework is presented, combining different classes of traffic models into a single vehicle agent and allowing the user to set a specific model for each supported class. The framework was made using a game engine, Unreal Engine 4, which allows users to model realistic interaction between vehicles and make realistic visualisations for purposes of visual analysis and computational steering.

Especially for lane-change models, cooperative behavior is in some situations inevitable to ensure a smooth traffic flow and avoid abnormally long waiting times for single vehicles. Especially in case of congestion and unconditionally required lane-changes before intersections, at highway exits or road narrows, cooperation between vehicles can significantly improve traffic flow. We analyze the comprehensive model Cooperative Lane-Change and Longitudinal Behavior Model Extension (CLLxt) from literature with regard to its influence to performance indicators of traffic flow such as average travel time and fuel consumption. To conduct the evaluation, the microscopic traffic simulator TraffSim is used. The simulation study includes evaluations for two representative scenarios - one highway exit scenario and an intersection scenario with lanes including turn restrictions. Additionally, effects of a varying traffic density are analyzed. The results reveal significant improvements for all investigated situations due to the application of CLLxt.

A case study is performed on D100 Freeway, using both control methods, in a simulated environment of VISSIM. Calibration of VISSIM is sought using Remote Traffic Microwave Sensor data provided by Istanbul Municipality. Integration of MATLAB with VISSIM is realized via COM interface which allows implementation of user defined control methods. Results show that both control methods perform better when compared the no-control case in terms of Total Time Spent in the selected network. The feedback control strategy, based on occupancy, performs relatively better when compared to control strategy using decision tree based on threshold values of volume, occupancy and average speed. Also, the speed profiles achieved with feedback control is more homogenized when compared to resultant speed profiles from control based on volume, occupancy and average speed. It can also be concluded that application area of VSL, acceleration area, the position of signs and detectors affect the performance of VSL control systems.

In this study, image processing and machine learning techniques are used to detect anomalies in vehicle movements. These anomalies include standing and traveling in reverse direction. Images are captured using CCTV cameras from front and rear side of the vehicle. This capability makes the results robust to the variations in operational and environmental conditions. Multiple consecutive frames are acquired for motion detection. Features such as edges and license plate corner locations are extracted for tracking purposes. Direction of the traffic flow is obtained from the trained classifier. K-nearest neighbor is chosen as the classifier model. The proposed method is evaluated on a public highway and promising detection results are achieved. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

MAY 21-24, 2018	Gold Coast, AUSTRALIA			Data fusion; Traffic condition detection; Mobile signaling; Compressive sensing; Adaptation		The key challenge of detecting highway traffic conditions is to achieve it in a fully-covered, high-accuracy, low-cost and real-time manner. We present an approach named Megrez on the basis of treating mobile phones and probe vehicles as roving sensors, loop detectors as static sensors. Megrez can admit one or multiple types of data, including signaling data in a mobile communication network, data from loop detectors, and GPS data from probe vehicles, to carry out the traffic estimation and monitoring. In order to accurately reconstruct traffic conditions with full road segment coverage, Megrez provides a practical way to overcome the sparsity and incoherence of sensory data and recover the missing data in light of recent progresses in compressive sensing. Moreover, Megrez incorporates the characteristics of traffic flows to rectify the estimates. Using large-scale real-world data as input, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate Megrez. The experimental results show that, in contrast to three other fusion methods, the results from our approach have high precisions and recalls. In addition, Megrez keeps the errors of estimates low even when not all three types of data are available.

INTRODUCTION OF COMPUTER SIMULATION SOFTWARE IN ROAD TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT COURSES	EDULEARN18: 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES	EDULEARN Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN)	JUL 02-04, 2018	Palma, SPAIN			urban traffic simulation; Synchro Studio software; teaching		Problem solving issues related to road traffic management are based on many variables, some known and some random ones. Behind traffic optimization are mathematical forecasting models based on: extrapolation, weighted type; operational; based on the preferential, scholastic balance method. These models start from simplistic hypotheses that most often do not accurately reflect the real situation of traffic. Because of this, the most complex models used in the present are computer-aided simulation. Their advantage is that they can consider a much greater amount of variables and may more accurately reflect the actual situation, for example, traffic flow dynamics in urban networks. In this case, urban traffic models are simulated and analysed with the Synchro Studio software. The paper presents the use of an urban road traffic simulation model using a software product, to increase the understanding of the theoretical notions by the students from the study program Transport and Traffic Engineering. Traffic simulation based on Google Maps and Synchro Studio gives a much clear picture of the real situation of artery geometry, traffic and delay time. This, combined with the simulation of moving vehicles by 2D or 3D animation produces a far greater impact on the understanding of the issues to be solved. Nowadays, simulation models are part of computer-assisted learning and thus they are an important guide both to students and lifelong learning. Classical learning combined with simulation models as an interactive tool is the best way to provide a kind of virtual reality in education. We can think that a model is appropriate if it is accompanied by theoretical notions, demonstration materials, spreadsheets, as well as user guides or tutorials for using the software for students. Maximizing the efficiency of the learning process, while keeping students involved, is the common goal that teachers hope to achieve in any course. In the field of road traffic, the courses, based on mathematics, modelling and simulation applications help to achieve a balance between theory and reality, bringing students from simplified concepts towards complex ones. This makes it the perfect tools to introduce yourself or your students to the principles of simulation modern approaches.	[Inta, M.; Popescu, L.

They trouble citizens a lot in wasting time and gas energy, leading to their bad temper during work, and even causing traffic accidents. Thus, monitoring the traffic flow is a critical portion in building intelligent transportation systems for urban cities. In this paper, we aim to predict traffic flow with big traffic data in urban cities. Our intuition is that although the traffic information is influenced by many factors and precise traffic modeling is difficult, we use the machine learning techniques to analyze the historical traffic data and train the prediction model. Particularly, we build a LSTM model with different dimensions of historical data, and then make prediction almost in real time for current traffic flows. We have built a prototype and tested it with two benchmark dataset. Experiment results show that our system obtains high prediction accuracy compared with the ground truth.

In this paper, a distributed model for short-term traffic flow prediction based on the k nearest neighbors method is presented. This model takes into account spatial and temporal traffic flow distribution. We define a feature vector for a targeted road segment using traffic flow on segments in a compact area at different time intervals. To reduce the dimensionality of the feature vector, we use principal component analysis procedure. The proposed model is based on MapReduce technology and implemented using an Apache Spark framework. An experimental study data is obtained from the transportation network of Samara, Russia.

However, the high composition of trucks in JORR resulted in congestion, and moreover it is suspected that the steep gradient of this road has contributed to this situation. This study aims to investigate the impact of road gradient on the trucks and the overall traffic performance from macroscopic view point. This study is the complement to a similar study that has been done in JORR previously, to confirm the result. The previous study was based on the Vissim simulation, while this paper will be entirely focused on an empirical study. Using the data obtained from 24-hour traffic recording on selected JORR sections that represent various gradients, traffic flow models are generated, and the effect of gradient could be assessed. The speed difference between trucks and non-trucks shows 56.2%similar to 127% gap as the result of different gradient occurred. The overall free flow speed (uf) difference of different gradient is up to 27.3%. This result will benefit to the transport authority to justify the policy concerning the existence of trucks in the traffic flow, particularly in the condition at which trucks are regarded as a culprit of traffic congestion.

The main concept still follows the idea that "capacity is the maximum number of vehicles, which could be managed by a particular freeway section under certain conditions". It is worth noting, that capacity does not depend on the traffic flow, however, it depends on the other parameters of the traffic flow. According to American Highway Capacity Manual, German Capacity Manual and Russian Capacity Guidelines, these parameters are geometric characteristics of the road, traffic flow characteristics, traffic light control parameters (cycle time, its distribution through phases, etc.). Naturally, it is a fact that when analyzing the bandwidth, it is advisable to include the values of the selected parameters not only of the current time interval, but also of the interval preceding the current one. This gives the process under consideration natural dynamics. It was found out, that the freeway section capacity varies over time and can be described by a random variable with some statistical distribution. Studies presented this fact, in most cases give the Weibull distribution to describe capacity the best. Based on the thing, that capacity cannot be measured directly, but only at the moment of traffic congestion, a good solution is to use the concept of "black box" to solve the problem to simulate the process. In this case, we operate with the remodeling strategy, when the process described by the model, could be remodeled by the other structure.

MODELLING AND CALIBRATION OF MICROSCOPIC SIMULATION MODEL CORSIM	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORT ENGINEERING (ICTTE 2018)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Traffic and Transport Engineering (ICTTE)	SEP 27-28, 2018	Assoc Italiana Ingn Traffico & Trasporti Res Ctr, Belgrade, SERBIA	Italian Soc Transportat Infrastructures, City Net Sci Res Ctr Ltd, Univ Belgrade, Fac Transport & Traff Engn	Assoc Italiana Ingn Traffico & Trasporti Res Ctr	CORSIM; Modelling; Calibration		A simulation method is an effective tool in analyzing the various dynamic problems in recent years. Today, many studies related to Traffic Engineering and Transportation benefit from a simulation method. A simulation model reflects the real system through the instrument of mathematical models of operation relations in the system over determined time. Models are developed in order to evaluate the different design and control scenarios. Traffic flow simulation models are divided into three classes according to the detail level of simulation. These are microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic. CORSIM (CORridor SIMulation) has been developed by FHWA (U.S. Federal Road Administration), is one of the tops most used simulation software for transport professionals. The performance of the software has been tested and is used continuously by FHWA in many studies. CORSIM can integrate urban road and highway networks to each other, thus it is possible to test the interaction of the two types of network. CORSIM also offers to intervene to networks thanks to built-in control devices. As an example, Istanbul European side of the Bosporus Bridge near Freeway 01, 2.5 km part, was modeled and calibrated with CORSIM. Traffic Software Integrated System 6.1 software package was used. As a result of the calibration, the selected traffic behavior can be successfully represented by CORSIM according to the test criteria. The Erlang distribution seems to be particularly successful in modeling speed. For this reason, the Erlang distribution will be used in subsequent CORSIM simulations. With the help of calibrated CORSIM, the traffic control methods to be applied to the working segment and the reaction that the traffic will give can be predicted. Thus, it is possible to test the validity of the work in the laboratory environment before applying it.

The goal is the study of new ways for modelling railway traffic flow, for example, based on the idea of multi-agent systems. In the first part, we discuss the possibility of exploiting the existing research works on driving agents in road traffic management. The analysis of these works makes it clear that road and railway traffic management are not so similar as far as decision making is concerned. Hence, we consider three different approaches. First, we analyse existing consensus problem papers dealing with multi-agent systems. Then, we study the problem of reaching a common decision in decentralized systems using the approach of hierarchical self-organization. Finally, we consider task allocation models. After the overview, a brief analysis about further possible directions is discussed, focusing the attention on some promising models.

The European Union plans to ensure functioning of TEN-T multimodal European transportation network on the whole its territory. This system will require bringing technical and technological parameters of the Russian transportation system to be included into international transport corridors. The trend of developing the world automobile industry is to create and to implement pilotless vehicles, which will require the creation of appropriate organizational, technical and information infrastructure for their operation. Mechanisms to implement such projects vary from country to country, but the key components are the same. Existing intelligent transportation systems in Russia are semi-structured set of applied programs to solve particular problems arising in traffic flow managing for manned vehicles on certain sections of the transportation network. The development of regional intelligent transportation and logistics modules and their further integration into a single system is a strategic plan, determines the overall competitiveness of Russia in the global market of transportation and logistics services. The problem involves a conceptual approach to using regional transportation network as a module for the global transcontinental network. Such modules should be positioned into this network with minimal investment while ensuring the management of logistics capacities, investments, construction and coordination of transportation and logistics infrastructure compatible with global traffic management systems. In other words, regional modules integrated into a single ITL (which will be integrated into the European and Asian its) will be used to coordinate physical infrastructure and "soft infrastructure" (e.g. coordination of services to be provided in the transportation network). The paper presents a conceptual model to construct a regional module for the intelligent transportation and logistics system.

The studies on 2+1 roads focus mainly on the comparison of the safety performance for two-lane and 2+1 roads mainly considering a physical separation of the opposite traffic directions (cable barriers) or without any physical separation. In Poland, there are several scenarios of separating traffic directions, which include: horizontal markings (double solid line), horizontal markings with additional measures to improve road safety (low or high safety devices) and physical separation using cable barriers. As already reported, there is no description in the literature of the impact of all the above-mentioned scenarios on safety. Therefore, in order to assess the effectiveness of 2+1 roads and selection of the recommended configuration, it is necessary to quantify the impact of various scenarios of separating traffic directions on safety. The aim of the paper is to assess the impact of 2+1 roads on road safety, considering the various solutions of separating traffic directions on the basis of regression models quantifying the number of crashes considering also traffic and other variables. The quantification is carried out by calibrating a Safety Performance Function (SPF), based on the results of the inventory work, traffic flows and crash data. The effectiveness of the scenarios was estimated considering as base condition the horizontal marking with additional measures to improve road safety (high safety devices) and calculating the relative risk of the other scenarios in comparison with the base one. The overall results indicate safety benefit of implementing 2+1 roads in Poland, which can reduce severe crash frequency of 50% compared to two-lane roads. Furthermore, the present research work introduces a novel approach in 2+1 studies considering the safety effects of different separation of the opposite traffic flows based on SPF.

The aim of the paper was to create a real road intersection model based on a traffic survey. The model created in the PTV VISSIM program was the basis for simulating crisis events at peak hours. The simulation model was used to analyze the crisis situation associated with a light-signaling failure across the intersection. The parameters studied for traffic fluency were a vehicle crossing time and the length of the car queue. The results of the simulation experiments revealed the negative impact of this situation associated with the disrupted traffic flow on the secondary roads. The simulation model was created for the needs of city logistics solutions in the city of KoSice.

A critical research need lies in clarifying the cause-and-effect mechanism between the CV information and driver behaviors and performance measurements of CV effect on operation, safety, and emissions reductions at a certain highway facility. A synthetic methodology is developed to synergize the identified critical driver or vehicle operation factors that will be potentially impacted by the CV functionality via the CV supported systems (e.g., forward collision warning, freeway merging warning, and dynamic speed harmonization systems). A simulation-based testbed is generated to facilitate integrating relevant mobility models (e.g., intelligent driver model, models for measuring time-to-collision, and vehicle emission model vs. traffic flow operation) into a single platform. Possible impact ranges of involved parameters are theoretically analyzed. The demonstrated testing outcomes come from a proof-of-concept study of a freeway conjunction in Cincinnati area, Ohio.

Lower than required speed limits may make the majority of drivers non-compliant, whereas higher speed limits may increase the number of crashes together with related injuries and fatalities. Speed limits on more than 800 miles of freeway sections were raised from 70 mph to 75 mph in Kansas in 2011. This study evaluated the safety impact of the speed limit increase by applying the empirical Bayes observational before-after studies approach. Details of crashes by severity level were obtained from the state crash database for 3 years before and 3 years after the speed limit change. The crash modification factor (CMF) was estimated and showed that the total crashes increased by 16% after the speed limit increase. The results from this study will help for the safety improvement of freeways in Kansas in the future.

Driver behavior characteristics play important role in determining the qualitative dynamics of vehicles in car-following process. A number of driver behavior characteristics associated with uniform traffic flow may be affected by driver distraction. Therefore, this study aims to explore the effect of driver distraction on traffic flow stability from the microscopic viewpoints. Based on the risk homeostasis theory and stimulus-response concept, a desired safety margin car-following model was employed to investigate the variation of traffic flow. Participants make corresponding driving behaviors in the simulated environment based on the motion state of the preceding car with differing traffic scenarios. The motion information of simulated vehicles is collected by driving simulation experiments to analyze the driving behavior parameters under both no task and secondary task situations. Five driving behavior parameters, including the level of perceived risk, the acceleration and deceleration habits, and the reaction characteristics of the participant, are obtained. Analytical results indicate that driver distraction leads to different driving behaviors, thereby affecting the performance of traffic flow and reducing traffic efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the string stability of traffic flow by numerical simulations. Compared with no task, numerical simulations indicate that driver distraction causes the traffic flow to become unstable. Those findings imply that the use of in-vehicle cell phone or car radio and associated public policy may need to further inform.

Inspired by recent developments in data-driven analytics and machine learning, this paper presents a novel approach for predicting traffic speeds on urban arterial roads via pattern recognition and deep neural network modelling. The methodology developed in the current study is as follows: first, a pattern recognition system adaptively extracts inherent data trends and volatilities from historical traffic flow data. The resulting trend data together with historical temporal traffic flow data are used to prepare a representative training set for the deep learning model. In the current study, we adopt a modified empirical mode decomposition for multiscale pattern recognition. Improvements are also made in the deep learning architecture used to model the underlying relationships which influences traffic speed on urban arterials. A series of experiments are designed on U.S. 50 corridor in northern Virginia to evaluate the strengths and limitations of the methodology developed based on mean squared error (MSE) criterion.

The article will present a generative model of movement in a network of streets and intersections that enables to predict traffic congestions of an accidental or deterministic character. The model has a modular, hierarchical character. At the lowest level the model is microscopic and depicts the movement of vehicles, public transport and pedestrians at intersections and between them. It allows comparing real measurements with simulated data and attach data obtained from the learned neural network. At its higher level, the model reflects the traffic in a selected sub-area of the network of intersections. On this level the model is macroscopic, taking into account the parameters of vehicle streams. On both levels, the model is based on a generative deep neural network. A multi-layered neural network was chosen from many available deep architectures. In order to train this network the following methods were used: algorithms prepared for Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Deep Believe Network, as well as neighbourhood network. These architectures and methods adapt to the real dependencies of traffic much better and more accurately than traditional structures and methods of learning. Thanks to the mentioned solutions it is possible to eliminate damaged or incorrect data from data processing. One of the aims of the proposed model is to predict changes in the intensity traffic and traffic congestions in short-term forecasts, also in cases that have not yet occurred.

It connects the D1 motorway with the nearby industrial zone, the shopping centre Vah and the town of Hlohovec. Roundabout are located on roads both in urban and rural areas. Most traffic surveys only measure traffic flow within specific time intervals. However, the data on traffic flow is not enough to create the correct and complete traffic model. In addition to traffic flow, it is necessary to know other characteristics of the traffic flow, especially the speed, which is extremely important.

A current situation and a situation with smart tolling were considered in order to ensure the reliability of the results. The simulation consisted of six scenarios, the error rates were checked with 30 replications, and the error rates were noted to be lower than 0.5%. The scenarios were categorized by vehicle speeds that could affect subsequent vehicles. The smart tolling model was better than the current model overall. In particular, the results of comparing lifelike scenario 1 and scenario 6 with smart tolling are key. The results showed that the level of congestion and average duration time could be decreased to approximately 50%. With regard to the results, there are significant impacts on improving traffic flow while maintaining five lanes, unlike in the current model.

In this paper we focus on providing a automatic traffic flow monitor, named Vehicular Traffic Monitor (VTM), to extract information from GoogleMaps traffic layer. Our monitor bases on image processing and the relationship between geographical coordinates to pixel position and does not needs any interface to process vehicular flow information. VTM can be used to obtain traffic flow logs, which are the base to generate realistic, synthetic vehicular traffic traces, specially for areas where those traces are not available. Moreover, we show the traffic flow evolution along a specific day (Father's day) can vary from usual behavior, and therefore our tool is useful to obtain information of such cases.

Traffic flow theory and traffic flow model play an important role in testing and developing efficient motorway traffic control strategies, while macroscopic models of the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) type fail to reproduce the capacity drop. This paper proposes a modified Cell Transmission Model(CTM) based on the special contribution of on-ramp flow on the capacity drop to reflect the capacity drop at merge in the first-order traffic flow model. We calibrate and validate the presented model with real traffic data, the validation results show that this model is robust and capable to capture capacity drop phenomenon.

It is an approach to determine the possibility of potential or missing link between node pairs in a network. Researches on transportation network's link prediction are mainly about travel time prediction, path prediction, traffic flow prediction, congestion prediction and so on. However, current studies are restrained by direction of the link or a new route. To solve this problem, a node pair entropy based similarity method for link prediction is proposed. Firstly, the initial state of all nodes in the node pair are initialized. Then, the influence weights of upstream node to lower nodes and the feedback state are determined. So the uncertainty degree of a path is obtained. Finally, the link prediction of the unconnected node pair is measured by node pair entropy. This method differentiates the roles of different nodes, and the connection between the common points is considered. It becomes a good solution for transportation network's link prediction.

However, road intersections located in urban areas are designed somewhat differently from those in rural areas, with greater emphasis at rural intersections placed on the issue of traffic dynamics, while service efficiency for various road users features high in the design of urban intersections. A particular problem in rural areas characterized by high vehicle speeds and a different traffic structure is posed by traffic control at the intersection by means of signals which would ensure consistency of geometric features, traffic organization and control at the intersection. In the absence of specific regulations, stakeholders increasingly ask whether the principles of control typically used in cities [5] can be applied at rural intersections. The answer to the above question required pre-tests to determine what specific features of geometry, traffic organization and traffic flows determine the quality of signalised intersection operation on high speed roads in rural areas [3]. Detailed empirical research at 38 intersections focused on vehicular traffic by group of light and heavy vehicles at individual entry lanes of rural intersections [1]. As a result, the authors were able to determine specification of the functioning of rural intersections and the impact of selected entry and intersection geometrical features, traffic features and road surroundings on the speed of vehicles approaching signalised rural intersections. The variability of the analysed factors allowed to examine the significance of the impact of individual quantitative and qualitative variables on vehicle speed and the creation of speed regression models. Proper speed modelling at intersection entries enables proper shaping of entry's geometry and configuration of detector systems and related control parameters (e.g. jednostkowe extension of the green signal).

The project is finished in 2017 and its main target is to improve the capacity and delays estimation technique. In the period of the USSR the manual of traffic circles and roundabouts design was prepared in the middle of the 80th of last century. The former manual contained the capacity estimation technique considering conflict points and weaving zones. In 40 years have changed a lot of things: daily volumes, structure of traffic flows, cars and tracks dynamic, as well as drivers behavior. The results of current project allowing to consider the actual traffic conditions at roundabouts in Russia and feature of driver's behavior. During processing of the obtained data there was a problem of the choice of the critical headways estimation technique. During the observation we got a lack of saturated conditions which are continuous queuing on the minor road entering the roundabout. So Siegloch's method which requires saturated conditions has been rejected and Ruff's method was chosen. Raff's method is based on simple technique of the accepted and rejected intervals consideration and no iterative procedures are required. Received results confirm that the general equations of roundabout's capacity estimation (HCM 2000 and HCM 2010) are applicable in Russia.

A large number of pedestrians and cyclists in urban traffic, specific features of the urban area, insufficient education and training of road users, as well as unregulated infrastructure, play a part in making public safety a growing issue in urban areas. The paper is primarily concerned with the analysis of road traffic accidents in the urban area of the City of Sisak, which is carried out using the geographic information system (GIS). The analysis offers an insight into the information concerning dangerous areas of road network, thus enabling the identification of areas which pose a higher risk and the proposition of suitable countermeasures in order to create a safe environment for road users and improve safety. In addition, the paper gives insight into a survey which estimates the subjective perception of safety of road users in the city of Sisak. Moreover, the paper includes a statistical analysis of the data processing on traffic accidents based on national database of the Ministry of the Interior. Furthermore, the paper also comprises measures such as the removal of problematic areas by introducing a new regulation of traffic flow organisation in the city centre, as well as indicators which have to be monitored on a yearly basis in order to increase the safety of all citizens in urban areas.

By using an exclusive traffic lane, buses can reduce their travel time and increase speed, resulting in a more efficient public transport, better level of service and satisfied passengers. However, the change of an existing traffic lane into a bus lane may have an impact on the quality of traffic on the adjacent lanes and the arterial as a whole. So, it is necessary to analyse and evaluate this impact before implementing a new mode of traffic regulation. This paper presents a traffic analysis of the possibilities of changing the curb traffic lane into a bus-only lane on an arterial street in Split. Using the calibrated simulation model, the average speeds, travel times and average intersection delays were compared for variants with and without a bus lane. Field data were used for performing simulations, and additionally, variants with increased traffic volume were also tested. Based on the obtained results, i.e. the performance measures of arterial and intersections level of service, comments and a conclusion were provided regarding the possibility and purpose of introducing the bus lane in terms of the impact on the traffic flow quality.

The aim of this measurement is to estimate QoS by transit time of end-to-end services for single-piece priority mail provided to customer by domestic mail in each European country and by cross-border mail among European countries. The main objective of this paper is to research possible development of transit time parameters following from mentioned independent measurements. This development could relate to changes in some other indicators connected with layout and organization of logistic network, capacities for processing of concerned postal items and naturally ensuring the whole process of postal service provision. Using of analytic tools for expression of potential influences or dependences could create important supporting step as well. Measurement system created by sample of test postal items flows is based on real traffic mail flows on fixed postal transportation network. The results respect measurement system specifications and analysis of postal transport network efficiency by mentioned procedure could help to find the most appropriate ways to improve the quality of postal services.

As a result, the objective of this study was to research the effect of lighting conditions on the injury severity of ROR crashes that involve large trucks. Based on the crash data pertaining to large trucks in the state of Oregon from 2007 to 2013, two separate mixed logit models were developed to capture the contributing factors that affect injury severity in each lighting condition. The levels of injury severity sustained by truck drivers were categorized into three main categories: severe injury (fatal and incapacitating), minor injury (nonincapacitating and possible injury), and no injury. The mixed logit model was used to account for unobserved factors (i.e.,unobserved heterogeneity). Estimation results indicated that there are significant differences between dark and lighted conditions, that the level of injury severity outcomes was highly influenced by several complex interactions between factors, and that the effects of some factors could vary across observations. The contributing factors include driver, traffic flow, roadway geometric features, land use, and time characteristics. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AGC mainly helps to ease driver fatigue on highways. Vehicles equipped with AGC can maintain an appropriate distance between two vehicles. Therefore, the traffic flow can be improved by AGC-equipped vehicles. In this research, we develop a traffic flow model that considers AGC-equipped vehicles, and is based on the Nagel-Schreckenberg model, which is a probabilistic cellular automaton model. The Nagel-Schreckenberg model can reproduce the basic features of traffic flow. On analyzing the mathematical model for the traffic including AGC-equipped vehicles, we can obtain analytical solutions of the traffic flow and the average velocity.

The influence of on-ramp and off-ramp on the stability of the main road is uncovered by theoretical analysis and computer simulation. Through linear stability theory, the neutral stability condition of the new model is obtained and the results show that the unstable region in the phase diagram is enlarged by considering the on-ramp effect but shrunk with consideration of the off-ramp effect. The mKdV equation near the critical point is derived via nonlinear reductive perturbation method and the occurrence of traffic jamming transition can be described by the kink-antikink soliton solution of the mKdV equation. From the simulation results of space-time evolution of traffic density waves, it is shown that the on-ramp can worsen the traffic stability of the main road but off-ramp is positive in stabilizing the traffic flow of the main road.

To avoid accidents, different sailing rules (i.e., lane-changing, speed control) are required. In this paper, a two-lane cellular automata model is proposed to evaluate such phenomena. Numerical experiments show that ships will form a "slow moving chunk" in the bank area, which will significantly block the flux. As further study demonstrated to alleviate bank effect, ship speed and bank length should be controlled.

The random slowing rule in the MVDE model is modified in order to emphasize the influence of vehicle interaction between two vehicles on the probability of vehicles' deceleration. A single-lane model which without bottleneck structure under periodic boundary conditions is simulated, and it is proved that the traffic flow simulated by S-MVDE model will generate the synchronous flow of three-phase traffic theory. Under the open boundary, the model is expanded by adding an on-ramp, the congestion pattern caused by the bottleneck is simulated at different main road flow rates and on-ramp flow rates, which is compared with the traffic congestion pattern observed by Kerner et al. and it is found that the results are consistent with the congestion characteristics in the three-phase traffic flow theory.

Numerical simulation of air pollution due to traffic flow in urban networks	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Traffic flow; Air pollution model; LWR model; Numerical simulation; Supply-demand method	MODELS; SYSTEM; WAVES; ROADS	As it is well known, traffic flow is the main pollution source in many urban areas, where the number of vehicles ranges from many thousands to millions. Thus, estimating the pollution emission rate due to traffic flow in big cities is a very hard task. To approach this environmental issue, in this paper we propose a methodology that consists of combining the 1D Lighthill-Whitham-Richards traffic model for road networks with a classical 2D advection-diffusion-reaction pollution model for the atmosphere. Here, the pollution model uses a source term that takes into account the traffic flow contamination by means of a Radon measure supported on a road network within an urban domain. Furthermore, we establish the existence of solution of the coupled model, and detail a complete numerical algorithm to compute it (mainly, interfacing a finite volume scheme based on the supply-demand method for the traffic model, with a characteristics-Lagrange finite element method for the pollution model). Finally, several numerical experiences for a real urban domain (the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area in Mexico) are presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Alvarez-Vazquez, L.

The simulation results show that the existence of non-cooperative drivers plays a chief role, where it increases the risk of collisions in the intermediate and high densities. Moreover, the impact of speed limit in the bottleneck (V-b) on the probability P-ac is also studied. This impact depends strongly on the density, where, the increasing of V-b enhances P-ac in the low densities. Meanwhile, it increases the road safety in the high densities. The phase diagram of the system is also constructed.

J	An, HK; Yue, WL; Stazic, B				An, Hong Ki; Yue, Wen Long; Stazic, Branko			Estimation of vehicle queuing lengths at metering roundabouts	JOURNAL OF TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ENGLISH EDITION			English	Article						Unbalanced traffic flow; Metering roundabout; Advance detector location; AIMSUN; Queuing length estimation model	OPTIMAL DETECTOR LOCATION; SIGNAL PRIORITY; SPAIN	Signalized metering roundabouts are equipped with advanced loop detectors and traffic signals that can reduce vehicle queuing lengths, especially on the dominant approach, when unbalanced traffic flow conditions occur. At a metering roundabout, changeable queuing lengths and the location of detectors determine signal phase times, which in turn affect queuing length on each approach. To date, most studies have focused on performance comparisons between normal and metered roundabouts, but have failed to evaluate the effect of detector locations on queuing formations. In addition, no guidelines have been developed to enable practitioners to select the appropriate detector location that would lead to optimum roundabout performance. This study, therefore, formulated a numerical model for the estimation of queuing length at a metering roundabout. The model consists of advance vehicle detectors on two approaches and one traffic signal. In order to calibrate and verify the model, queuing lengths were recorded using two drones for the Old Belair Road metering roundabout in Adelaide, South Australia. In order to assess the fitness of the model, an R-2 test was conducted, and the results showed that the numerical model can predict queuing lengths on the controlling and metered approaches with up to 83% of R-2 value. Moreover, the estimated queuing lengths were compared against those predicted by the software AIMSUN for the same location and under the same conditions. It is expected that the model will assist and guide practitioners in determining the best detector locations for metering roundabouts. (C) 2017 Periodical Offices of Chang'an University.

J	Li, YF; Li, J				Li, Yanfeng; Li, Jun			Multi-class dynamic network traffic flow propagation model with physical queues	FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						first-in-first-out (FIFO); multi-class traffic; physical queues; traffic flow modeling	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; USER OPTIMAL ASSIGNMENT; KINEMATIC WAVES; HIGHWAY; FORMULATION; ROADS	This paper proposes an improved multi-class dynamic network traffic flow propagation model with a consideration of physical queues. Each link is divided into two areas: Free flow area and queue area. The vehicles of the same class are assumed to satisfy the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle on the whole link, and the vehicles of the different classes also follow FIFO in the queue area but not in the free flow area. To characterize this phenomenon by numerical methods, the improved model is directly formulated in discrete time space. Numerical examples are developed to illustrate the unrealistic flows of the existing model and the performance of the improved model. This analysis can more realistically capture the traffic flow propagation, such as interactions between multi-class traffic flows, and the dynamic traffic interactions across multiple links.

This paper regards the traffic modeling through the enhancement of the cell transmission model. It considers the traffic flow as a hybrid dynamic system and proposes a piecewise switched linear traffic model. The latter allows an accurate modeling of the traffic flow in a given section by considering its geometry. On the other hand, the piecewise switched linear traffic model handles more than one congestion wave and has the advantage to be modular. The measurements at upstream and downstream boundaries are also used in this model in order to decouple the traffic flow dynamics of successive road portions. Finally, real magnetic sensor data, provided by the performance measurement system on a portion of the Californian SR60-E highway are used to validate the proposed model.

Such an approach typically requires the use of simulations, which should be as realistic as possible. However, achieving high degrees of realism can be complex when the actual traffic patterns, defined through an Origin/ Destination (O-D) matrix for the vehicles in a city, remain unknown. Thus, the main contribution of this paper is a heuristic for improving traffic congestion modeling. In particular, we propose a procedure that, starting from real induction loop measurements made available by traffic authorities, iteratively refines the output of DFROUTER, which is a module provided by the SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) tool. This way, it is able to generate an O-D matrix for traffic that resembles the real traffic distribution and that can be directly imported by SUMO. We apply our technique to the city of Valencia, and we then compare the obtained results against other existing traffic mobility data for the cities of Cologne (Germany) and Bologna (Italy), thereby validating our approach. We also use our technique to determine what degree of congestion is expectable if certain conditions cause additional traffic to circulate in the city, adopting both a uniform pattern and a hotspot-based pattern for traffic injection to demonstrate how to regulate the overall number of vehicles in the city. This study allows evaluating the impact of vehicle flow changes on the overall traffic congestion levels.

In order to enhance first in, first-out property (FIFO) and transmission function in the multiclass traffic modeling, a new multiclass cell transmission model with FIFO property (herein called FM-CTM) is extended from its prior multiclass cell transmission model (M-CTM). Also, to enhance its analytical compactness and resultant computational convenience, FM-CTM is formulated in this paper as a set of closed-form matrix equations. The objective is to improve the accuracy of traffic state estimation by enforcing FIFO property when a fast vehicle cannot overtake a slow vehicle due to a limitation of a single-lane road. Moreover, the proposed model takes into account a different priority for vehicles of each class to move forward through congested road conditions, and that makes the flow calculation independent from their free-flow speeds. Some hypothetical and real-world freeway networks with a constant or varying number of lanes are selected to verify FM-CTM by comparing with M-CTM and the conventional CTM. Observed densities of VISSIM and real-world dataset of I-80 are selected to compare with the simulated densities from the three CTMs. The numerical results show that FM-CTM outperforms the other two models by 15% of accuracy measures in most cases. Therefore, the proposed model is expected to be well applicable to the road network with a mixed traffic and varying number of lanes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kim, YH; Peeta, S; He, XZ				Kim, Yong Hoon; Peeta, Srinivas; He, Xiaozheng			Modeling the information flow propagation wave under vehicle-to-vehicle communications	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Information flow propagation wave; V2V communications; Epidemic model; Communication kernel; LWR model	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; AD HOC NETWORKS; CONNECTED VEHICLES; INVADING ORGANISMS; SPREAD; SAFETY; HIGHWAY; MOBILE	Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications under the connected vehicle context have the potential to provide new paradigms to enhance the safety, mobility and environmental sustainability of surface transportation. Understanding the information propagation characteristics in space and time is a key enabler for V2V-based traffic systems. Most existing analytical models assume instantaneous propagation of information flow through multi-hop communications. Such an assumption ignores the spatiotemporal relationships between the traffic flow dynamics and V2V communication constraints. This study proposes a macroscopic two-layer model to characterize the information flow propagation wave (IFPW). The traffic flow propagation is formulated in the lower layer as a system of partial differential equations based on the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model. Due to their conceptual similarities, the upper layer adapts and modifies a spatial Susceptible-Infected epidemic model to describe information dissemination between V2V-equipped vehicles using integro-differential equations. A closed-form solution is derived for the IFPW speed under homogeneous conditions. The IFPW speed is numerically determined for heterogeneous conditions. Numerical experiments illustrate the impact of traffic density and market penetration of V2V-equipped vehicles on the IFPW speed. The proposed model can capture the spatiotemporal relationships between the traffic and V2V communication layers, and aid in the design of novel information propagation strategies to manage traffic conditions under V2V-based traffic systems.

J	Zong, XL; Wang, CZ; Chen, HW				Zong, Xinlu; Wang, Chunzhi; Chen, Hongwei			An evacuation model based on co-evolutionary multi-particle swarms optimization for pedestrian-vehicle mixed traffic flow	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Mixed evacuation; pedestrian; particle swarm optimization algorithm; co-evolution; pheromone	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON; CROWD EVACUATION; SIMULATION; SPACE	In a large common place, a huge number of pedestrians may flood into the surrounding region and mix with the vehicles which originally existed on the roads when emergent events occur. The mutual restriction between pedestrians and vehicles as well as the mutual effect between evacuation individuals and the environment which evacuees are situated in, will have an important impact on evacuation effects. This paper presents a pedestrian-vehicle mixed evacuation model to produce optimal evacuation plans considering both evacuation time and density degree. A co-evolutionary multi-particle swarms optimization approach is proposed to simulate the evacuation process of pedestrians and vehicles separately and the interaction between these two kinds of traffc modes. The proposed model and algorithm are effective for mixed evacuation problems. An illustrating example of a study region around a large stadium has been presented. The experimental results indicate the effective performances for evacuation problems which involve complex environments and various types of traffic modes.

J	Hazelton, ML; Bilton, TP				Hazelton, Martin L.; Bilton, Timothy P.			Polytope samplers for network tomography	AUSTRALIAN & NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS			English	Article						convex integer polytope; link-path incidence matrix; MCMC; transport network; unimodular matrix	ORIGIN-DESTINATION MATRICES; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; TRANSPORTATION; ALGORITHM; TABLES	Network tomography is concerned with reconstruction and estimation of properties of traffic flow that are linked to the observed data through an underdetermined linear system. The likelihood function for such problems can be expressed only as the sum over integer-valued points in a convex polytope. Typically this set is too large to enumerate, so that statistical inference must proceed by sampling from the polytope. Recent progress has seen the development of polytope sampling algorithms that operate well when the network link-path incidence matrix is totally unimodular. In this paper we examine whether this property is likely to hold in practical applications. We find that total unimodularity is assured for certain simple networks, but that it can fail in more complex cases. We show that when it does fail, the existing polytope samplers may not generate the requisite irreducible Markov chain. As a remedy, a modified algorithm is proposed in which the basis for the polytope adapts to ensure adequate mixing over the entire polytope. The operation of this algorithm is illustrated by a numerical example.

Northern and Southern European Traffic Flow Land Segment Analysis as Part of the Redirection Justification	TRANSNAV-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON MARINE NAVIGATION AND SAFETY OF SEA TRANSPORTATION			English	Article								Natural geotraffic flows act as one of the most important factors directly affecting redirections of the world transportation routes. In terms of door-to-door multimodal transport chain, several routes from Far East toward European destinations exist, with Northern European route acting as prevailing one. The proposed paper elaborates possibilities of redirection of the traffic flow by directing cargoes to an alternative route through the Adriatic Sea. The aim is to justify realisation of mentioned possibility in terms of land transportation segment analysis, i.e. by analysing cargo transportation from ports to final destinations in Central Europe, placed in natural gravitational hinterland of ports of Northern Adriatic Port Association (NAPA). Geo-traffic and logistics' analyses of NAPA ports are presented in the paper. Container traffic and its trend as compared with Northern European ports are analysed. The development plans of inland connections are presented in function of justification of the traffic flow redirection. A model for the selection and evaluation of the optimal container transport route by using the multiple criteria analysis (MCA) has been introduced and developed. The model was applied for the selection of the representative service connecting Far East (origin) and the central Europe (destination) by detailed analysis of the land transportation segment. The PROMETHEE method was used for the model testing and evaluation. Summarised results are presented and discussed tending to confirmation of the traffic flow redirection justification.

Issues that are encountered in this regard, such as traffic congestion, high accidents rates and air pollution etc., have pushed the use of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) technologies in order to facilitate the traffic management. Seen in this perspective, this paper brings forward a road traffic management system based on wireless sensor networks; it introduces the functional and deployment architecture of the system and focuses on the analysis component that uses a new extension of batches Petri nets for modeling road traffic flow. A real world implementation of visualization and data analysis components were carried out.

Our analysis is motivated by the practical problems of freeway traffic monitoring and estimation using multi-source data measured from mobile devices and fixed sensors. We conduct rigorous mathematical analysis on the Hamilton-Jacobi representation of the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model in the transformed coordinates, and derive explicit and closed-form solutions with piecewise affine initial, boundary, and internal conditions, based on the variational principle. A numerical study of the Mobile Century field experiment demonstrates some unique features and the effectiveness in traffic estimation of the Lagrangian-based model.

However, these first-order models are not able to reproduce significant traffic phenomena of great interest, such as the capacity drop and stop-and-go waves. This paper presents an overview of modeling approaches, which introduce the ability to reflect the capacity-drop phenomenon into discretized LWR-type first order traffic flow models; and also proposes a new approach. The background and main characteristics of each approach are analyzed with particular emphasis on the practical applicability of such models for traffic simulation, management and control. The presented modeling approaches are tested and validated using real data from a motorway network in the U.K. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Safarinejadian, B; Estahbanati, ME				Safarinejadian, Behrooz; Estahbanati, Mahboobeh Estakhri			Consensus Filter-Based Distributed Variational Bayesian Algorithm for Flow and Speed Density Prediction With Distributed Traffic Sensors	IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article						Consensus filter; density estimation; mixture of Gaussians; sensor networks; variational approximations	NETWORKS; SYSTEMS; LINKS; MODEL	This paper formulates a consensus filter-based distributed variational Bayesian (CFBDVB) algorithm for density approximation of traffic flow and average traffic speed in a free-way. This algorithm uses traffic measurements, including volume, occupancy rate, and average velocity, collected by some inductive loop sensors. These traffic sensors are settled in sealed spaces in the freeway network, such that they demonstrate a distributed sensor network. It is assumed that measurements of the sensors can be statistically modeled by a common Gaussian mixture model. Using the suggested algorithm, a challenging problem is solved: selection of the right number of components. The algorithm begins with a large number of initialized components. In this algorithm, each sensor client severally computes local sufficient statistics by using local observations. A consensus filter is then used to spread out local sufficient statistics to neighbors and approximate global sufficient statistics in each client. Then, using the global sufficient statistics, irrelevant components are determined and omitted. Then, the remaining components' parameters are estimated. The suggested CFBDVB algorithm is scalable and robust. It estimates the parameters of mixtures and simultaneously selects the number of components. Various simulations of sensor nets have been done to confirm the promising performance of the CFBDVB algorithm.

The proposed model discriminates four types of car-bus following combination, car-following-bus, bus-following-bus, bus-following-car and car-following-car. The four combinations are considered in terms of following distance, following speed and following acceleration/deceleration. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using data collected from the combination of microwave radar detector and roadside laser detector on Xuanwu Avenue in the main urban area of Nanjing. Besides, the field data is divided into two data sets, one used for the training of the model, and the other for evaluation purpose. Gazis model and Edie model, the two most extensively used car-following models, are calibrated against the same training data sets and used as a reference benchmark. Finally, the performance of the model, proposed by this paper, was compared with the two classic models based on the evaluation data sets. The results show that buses have different characteristics and manoeuvrability compared with passenger cars. With the influence of buses in the car-following process, it could lead to uneven distribution of traffic flow on the lanes and become the main reason for traffic highway capacity decline. The model, proposed in this paper, is more accurate and stable when predicting acceleration/deceleration of different vehicles during car-following. It has better superiority to describe the car-following behaviours under the influence of bus on freeway.

J	Lyu, P; Lin, YJ; Wang, L; Yang, XF				Lyu, Pu; Lin, Yongjie; Wang, Lei; Yang, Xianfeng			Variable Speed Limit Control for Delay and Crash Reductions at Freeway Work Zone Area	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING PART A-SYSTEMS			English	Article						Variable speed limit; Delay; Crash risk; Freeway work zone	TRAFFIC FLOW	Improving operational efficiency and safety on freeway segments has long been recognized as a priority in traffic communities. This study presents a comprehensive variable speed limit (VSL) control model for reducing both travel delays and potential crash risks at freeway work zones. The proposed strategy offers the responsible agency a reliable way to determine reasonable speed limits over the control time horizon in response to traffic fluctuations. The control objective of the proposed system is to minimize total operational cost by using embedded functions to estimate total cost with total travel delay and potential crash rate on the targeted freeway segment. This study used a field site in China for its case study to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed VSL control system. Based on the experimental results, it was observed that the proposed control model shows promise in reducing average delay, number of stops, and average stopped delay on the studied freeway segment. In addition, simulation experiments for sensitivity analysis indicate that the proposed VSL control model is more effective when driver compliance rate exceeds a threshold of 60% and the user-defined benefit threshold ranges 10-20%.

The CEDR PRIMA project aims to extend practical guidance for traffic managers in pro-active Traffic Incident Management (TIM) techniques to reduce the impacts and associated costs of incidents. Methods The paper describes modelling methods used in the project for assessing the effect of different management techniques on incident duration and travel delay under various scenarios, including collision, adverse weather, heavy vehicle breakdown and other obstruction, assuming various management strategies and generic impacts of novel technologies. Macroscopic simulations of 178 variations of 13 basic scenarios have been performed using a flexible and computationally efficient macroscopic queue model, results being verified by simulation using a velocity-based Cell Transmission Model (CTM-v). Results The results of the two modelling methods are broadly consistent. While delays estimated by the two methods can differ by up to 20%, this is small compared to the factor of 30 range of modelled delays caused by incidents, depending on their nature and circumstances, and is not sufficient to affect general conclusions. Under the peak traffic conditions assumed, the most important factor affecting delay is whether running lanes can be kept open, but quick clearance of carriageway is not always feasible. Conclusions Comparison of two very different modelling methods confirms their consistency within the context of highly scenario-dependent results, giving confidence in the results. Future research and data needs include further validation of the models, potential application to traffic flow and conflict prediction and incident prevention, and more complete and consistent recording of incident timelines and impacts.

While negotiating a particular upward gradient, the vehicles will have to overcome the grade resistance additionally along with other resistances (air resistance, rolling resistance and resistance due to inertia). An important aspect of road geometry design is the provision of safe distances to allow vehicle to change speed from low or moderate speed flows to high speed flows, and vice versa. On level roads, vehicles may maintain their speeds uniformly. However, on upgrades, heavy vehicles such as trucks, will experience significant reduction in their speeds, whereas, passenger cars and other smaller vehicles such as motorized-two-wheelers may experience relatively lesser speed reduction. Similarly, the effect of gradient on truck performance on upgrade and downgrade are not same. One of the approaches, to estimate the acceleration rates of truck for different grades to develop the various traffic flow models. The main objective of this study is to study the effect of weight-to-power ratio on truck accelerating characteristics for varying magnitude of gradients. The outcome of the study is expected to explain the dynamics of trucks on grades.

Simulation of Traffic Flow to Analyze Lane Changes on Multi-lane Highways	EUROPEAN TRANSPORT-TRASPORTI EUROPEI			English	Article						Traffic simulation; VISSIM; Calibration; Lane changes; Capacity	CAPACITY	Highways in India generally operate under mixed traffic conditions where the driving behaviour is significantly varies from one place to another. Under mixed traffic, number of influencing factors present on a roadway directly affects the traffic flow stream and hence capacity remains unpredictable. Vehicle maneuverability is another factor that influences the overall operational characteristic and capacity of a multilane highway. Lane change is one maneuver which is influenced by several geometric and roadway features and affects operational characteristic such as capacity and level of service. Some studies reported that the number of lane changes affects capacity of multilane divided roads. But, those studies are performed in uniform traffic flow conditions and under lane based traffic regulations. Infect, lane changing is a very complex maneuver which can be studied through microscopic and macroscopic measures. Present study uses the microscopic traffic simulation flow model VISSIM for generating traffic flow data to obtain the essential parameters. The deployment of traffic flow simulation is due to absence of very accurate and sufficient amount of field data. However, field traffic surveys were conducted for this study to obtain data needed for simulation. Field data collected at four-lane highway sections are analysed and used as inputs to the simulation model VISSIM. Study calibrated and validated the VISSIM model based on the field data through trial and error testing of several influencing simulation parameters such as RSN (random seed number), limits of desired speed, output volume, travel time etc. Traffic volume, speed and capacity are used as measure of effectiveness and calibrated the model upto the some level of satisfaction. Further, lane change behaviour is analysed with homogeneous vehicle type traffic on four-lane, six-lane and eight-lane divided highways sections through VISSIM simulation model. The study finds the number of lane changes depends on traffic volume as well as on number of lanes provided for a direction of travel. Lane change data was correlated with traffic volume and third degree polynomial trend was found to be fitted on each type of simulated highway sections. Maximum number of lane changes and lane change at capacity level of volume are also quantified on simulated sections of four lane, six-lane and eight-lane divided highways. It is found that no more number of lane changes is observed in all simulated sections when traffic volume reaches to capacity level of volume. The relation between capacity per lane and number of lane changes is established which shows capacity decreases with addition of number of lanes.	[Srikanth, Seelam; Mehar, Arpan; Praveen, K. G. N.

J	Chang, BJ; Tsai, YL; Liang, YH				Chang, Ben-Jye; Tsai, Yueh-Lin; Liang, Ying-Hsin			Platoon-Based Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control for Achieving Active Safe Driving Through Mobile Vehicular Cloud Computing	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Active safe driving; Cooperative platoon driving; Shockwave; Butterfly effect; CACC; VANETs	STANDARDS; DSRC	The cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) aims to achieve active safe driving that avoids vehicle accidents or a traffic jam by exchanging the road traffic information (e.g., traffic flow, traffic density, velocity variation, etc.) among neighbor vehicles. However, in CACC the butterfly effect is happened while exhibiting asynchronous brakes that easily lead to backward shockwaves and difficult to be removed. Thus, the driving stability is degraded significantly by backward shockwaves and affects the safe driving performance in CACC. Several critical issues should be addressed in CACC, including: (1) difficult to adaptively control the inter-vehicle distances among neighbor vehicles and the vehicle speed, (2) suffering from the butterfly effect, (3) unstable vehicle traffic flow, etc. For addressing above issues in CACC, this paper thus proposes the cooperative adaptive driving (CAD) approach that consists of three contributions: cooperative vehicle platooning (CVP), shockwave-avoidance driving (SAD), and adaptive platoon synchronization (APS). First, a platoon-based cooperative driving among neighbor vehicles is proposed in CVP. Second, in SAD, the predictive shockwave detection is proposed to avoid shockwaves efficiently. Third, based on the traffic states, APS determines the adaptive platoon length and velocity for achieving synchronous control and reduces the butterfly effect when vehicles suddenly brake. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed CAD approach outperforms the compared approaches in number of shockwaves, average affection range of shockwaves, average vehicle velocity, and average travel time. Additionally, the adaptive platoon length is determined according to the traffic information gathered from the global and local clouds.

J	Younis, O; Moayeri, N				Younis, Ossama; Moayeri, Nader			Employing Cyber-Physical Systems: Dynamic Traffic Light Control at Road Intersections	IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL			English	Article						Distributed algorithms; sensor networks; smart city; traffic flow optimization; traffic light (TL) control	REAL-TIME; NETWORKS	Traffic lights (TLs) are used to control traffic at road intersections. Typically, the TL control mechanism on the road operates according to a fixed periodic schedule to change the light (red/yellow/green). A different schedule may be employed at late night or early morning hours. Such fixed light control does not react to changing traffic conditions, and is unaware of (unresponsive to) congestion. In this paper, we propose a novel framework dynamic TL control (DTLC) at road intersections. DTLC relies on a sensor network to collect traffic data and includes novel protocols to handle congestion and facilitate more efficient traffic flow. The proposed low-overhead algorithms are practical to employ in live traffic flow scenarios. Through analysis and simulations, we demonstrate the benefits of DTLC in optimizing traffic flow metrics, such as traffic throughput, vehicle waiting time, and waiting line length.

Pedestrians of all types, including both sexes with numerous aging groups, are always subjected to risk and are characterized as the most exposed road' users. The increased demand for better traffic management strategies to reduce the risks at intersections, improve quality traffic management, traffic volume, and longer cycle time has further increased concerns over the past decade. Method: This paper aims to develop a sustainable pedestrian gap crossing index model based on traffic flow density. It focusses on the gaps accepted by pedestrians and their decision for street crossing, where (Log-Gap) logarithm of accepted gaps was used to optimize the result of a model for gap crossing behavior. Through a review of extant literature, 15 influential variables were extracted for further empirical analysis. Subsequently, data from the observation at an uncontrolled mid-block in Jalan Ampang in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia was gathered and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Binary Logit Model (BLM) techniques were employed to analyze the results. Results and conclusions: From the results, different pedestrian behavioral characteristics were considered for a minimum gap size model, out of which only a few (four) variables could explain the pedestrian road crossing behavior while the remaining variables have an insignificant effect. Among the different variables, age, rolling gap, vehicle type, and crossing were the most influential variables. The study concludes that pedestrians' decision to cross the street depends on the pedestrian age, rolling gap, vehicle type, and size of traffic gap before crossing. Practical applications: The inferences from these models will be useful to increase pedestrian safety and performance evaluation of uncontrolled midblock road crossings in developing countries.

The VSL has the potential to improve traffic safety and reduce both traffic congestion and emissions through better harmonisation of traffic flow. The VSL results in a reduction of speed variations among vehicles travelling along controlled sections. In this paper, a modified logic-tree-based algorithm is proposed to improve the mobility benefits of VSL controllers. The modified algorithm is assessed using a case study in Auckland, New Zealand. Analysis of the case study is based on a critical bottleneck section of the Auckland motorway using the Aimsun micro-simulator. The proposed algorithm is compared with a known algorithm proposed in the literature and used in practice. The simulation results of the case study show that the proposed logic-tree-based VSL control algorithm outperforms the existing method. Compared with a no-control scenario, it results in respective improvements of 6%, 11%, 3%, 9% and 3% in the capacity of the bottleneck section, the total travel time and emissions of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides.

Whereas typical policy responses prioritize reduction of delays under normal conditions to improve the efficiency of urban road systems, analytic support for investments that improve resilience (defined as system recovery from additional disruptions) is still scarce. In this effort, we represent paved roads as a transportation network by mapping intersections to nodes and road segments between the intersections to links. We built road networks for 40 of the urban areas defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. We developed and calibrated a model to evaluate traffic delays using link loads. The loads may be regarded as traffic-based centrality measures, estimating the number of individuals using corresponding road segments. Efficiency was estimated as the average annual delay per peak-period auto commuter, and modeled results were found to be close to observed data, with the notable exception of New York City. Resilience was estimated as the change in efficiency resulting from roadway disruptions and was found to vary between cities, with increased delays due to a 5% random loss of road linkages ranging from 9.5% in Los Angeles to 56.0% in San Francisco. The results demonstrate that many urban road systems that operate inefficiently under normal conditions are nevertheless resilient to disruption, whereas some more efficient cities are more fragile. The implication is that resilience, not just efficiency, should be considered explicitly in roadway project selection and justify investment opportunities related to disaster and other disruptions.

This paper started from the architecture design of a carbon emission mobile monitoring system using multiple sets of equipment and collected the corresponding data about traffic flow, meteorological conditions, vehicular carbon emissions and driving characteristics on typical roads in Shanghai and Wuxi, Jiangsu province. Based on these data, the emission model MOVES was calibrated and used with various sensitivity and correlation evaluation indices to analyze the traffic carbon emissions at microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic levels, respectively. The major factors that influence urban traffic carbon emissions were investigated, so that emission factors of CO, CO2 and HC were calculated by taking representative passenger cars as a case study. As a result, the urban traffic carbon emissions were assessed quantitatively, and the total amounts of CO, CO2 and HC emission from passenger cars in Shanghai were estimated as 76.95 kt, 8271.91 kt, and 2.13 kt, respectively. Arterial roads were found as the primary line source, accounting for 50.49% carbon emissions. In additional to the overall major factors identified, the mobile monitoring system and carbon emission quantification method proposed in this study are of rather guiding significance for the further urban low-carbon transportation development.

A more reasonable and complete vehicle emission inventory in Zhengzhou for the year 2013 was developed in this study. This inventory is suitable for local emission factors and vehicle kilometers of travel. Estimates show that the total carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), nitrogen oxide (NOx), particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions were 291 Gg, 35 Gg, 106 Gg, 6 Gg, 7 Gg, and 3 Gg, respectively. Approximately 55% of CO and HC emissions were from light duty gasoline vehicles and normal gasoline motorcycles, whereas approximately 60% of NOx, PM2.5, PM10 and SO2 were from heavy duty diesel vehicles, heavy duty diesel trucks, and medium duty diesel trucks. The spatial distribution of emissions was allocated in grid cells based on a road network and traffic flows with a resolution of 1 km x 1 km at different road types and locations, which shows that the six aforementioned air pollutants have similar characteristics in administrative districts. Emissions are mainly concentrated on the central grid cells of each part and in good agreement with line sources. The spatial characteristics were compared at a resolution of 3 km x 3 km and in a population-based approach. The network approach yields better level estimates in this study. Meanwhile, the preliminary temporal profiles were also established for on-road mobile source. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on a space-time lattice, we present a set of integer programming and dynamic programming models for scheduling longitudinal trajectories, where the goal is to consider both system-wide safety and throughput requirements under supports of various communication technologies. Newell's simplified linear car following model is used to characterize interactions and collision avoidance between vehicles, and a control variable of time-dependent platoon-level reaction time is introduced in this study to reflect various degrees of vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-infrastructure communication connectivity. By adjusting the lead vehicle's speed and platoon-level reaction time at each time step, the proposed optimization models could effectively control the complete set of trajectories in a platoon, along traffic backward propagation waves. This parsimonious multi-vehicle state representation sheds new lights on forming tight and adaptive vehicle platoons at a capacity bottleneck. We examine the principle of optimality conditions and resulting computational complexity under different coupling conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Jin, JC; Ma, XL; Kosonen, I				Jin, Junchen; Ma, Xiaoliang; Kosonen, Iisakki			A stochastic optimization framework for road traffic controls based on evolutionary algorithms and traffic simulation	ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE			English	Article						Simulation-based optimization; Archived genetic algorithm; Road traffic controls; Traffic light control; Object-oriented software framework	FLOW; ENVIRONMENT; SIGNALS; MODEL	Traffic flow is considered as a stochastic process in road traffic modeling. Computer simulation is a widely used tool to represent traffic system in engineering applications. The increased traffic congestion in urban areas and their impacts require more efficient controls and management. While the effectiveness of control schemes highly depends on accurate traffic model and appropriate control settings, optimization techniques play a central role for determining the control parameters in traffic planning and management applications. However, there is still a lack of research effort on the scientific computing framework for optimizing traffic control and operations and facilitating real planning and management applications. To this end, the present study proposes a model-based optimization framework to integrate essential components for solving road traffic control problems in general. In particular, the framework is based on traffic simulation models, while the solution needs extensive computation during the engineering optimization process. In this work, an advanced genetic algorithm, extended by an external archive for storing globally elite genes, governs the computing framework, and in application it is further enhanced by a sampling approach for initial population and utilizations of adaptive crossover and mutation probabilities. The final algorithm shows superior performance than the ordinary genetic algorithm because of the reduced number of fitness function evaluations in engineering applications. To evaluate the optimization algorithm and validate the whole software framework, this paper illustrates a detailed application for optimization of traffic light controls. The study optimizes a simple road network of two intersections in Stockholm to demonstrate the model-based optimization processes as well as to evaluate the presented algorithm and software performance.

In particular, the proposed model incorporates the effects of both electronic throttle opening angle and lateral gap into the traffic flow model by assuming that the information on electronic throttle dynamics is shared by surrounding vehicles through vehicle-to-vehicle communications. Stability of the proposed model is analyzed using the perturbation method. Numerical experiments analyze three scenarios: start, stop and evolution processes for the scenarios of lane-discipline-based full velocity difference (FVD) model, non-lane-based full velocity difference car-following (NLBCF) model and non-lane-discipline and throttle-based car-following model, respectively. Results from numerical experiments illustrate that the proposed car-following model has a larger stale region compared with the FVD and NLBCF models. In addition, it also demonstrates that the proposed car-following model can better represent the characteristics of connected and autonomous vehicular traffic flow in terms of the responsiveness, smoothness and stability with respect to the position, velocity, acceleration/deceleration and space headway profiles.

Urban arterial congestion is a recurring problem that affects urban traffic flow. The degree of congestion may amplify if the arterial is a principal arterial that leads to a major bridge. Bosporus Bridge, inaugurated in 1973 and renamed in July 2016 as the Martyrs Bridge, is the first of the three suspension bridges connecting the Anatolian and European sides of Istanbul, Turkey. The Martyrs Bridge, along with the recently inaugurated Eurasia Roadway Tunnel provides a direct connection between the southern districts of the Anatolian and European sides of Istanbul for roadway traffic excluding trucks. Recurring congestion observed along the 5.7 km long westbound approach arterial from the Anatolian side of Istanbul to the bridge initiated a study to investigate methods to mitigate congestion through traffic management and improved roadway parameters. A micro simulation model based on traffic data suggested the applicability of traffic speed management along the existing infrastructure to relieve congestion and provide flow stability. The micro simulation model also provided the means for parametric evaluation of the effects of heavy vehicles, lane-width values and interchange spacing on the arterial flow speed and delay.

J	Xu, HT; Ying, J				Xu, Haitao; Ying, Jing			Bus arrival time prediction with real-time and historic data	CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Bus arrival time prediction; Bus GPS trajectories; Path-section graph	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; SYSTEMS; MODELS	Provision of accurate bus arrival information is vital to passengers for reducing their anxieties and waiting times at bus stop. GPS-equipped buses can be regarded as mobile sensors probing traffic flows on road surfaces. In this paper, we present an approach that predicts bus arrival time in terms of the knowledge learned from a large number of historical bus GPS trajectories. In our approach, we build time-dependent path-section graph, where a path-section is a road segment between two adjacent bus stops, to model the properties of dynamic road networks. Then, a clustering approach is designed to estimate the distribution of travel time on each path-section in different time slots. Finally, bus arrival time is predicted based on the path-section graph and real-time GPS information. Using a real-world trajectory dataset generated by 1000 buses in a period of 2 months, a bus arrival time prediction system is built. Then we evaluate the system with extensive experiments and realistic evaluations. Experiments show that our method is close to the actual value and better than some typical algorithms.

Both system matrices and boundary conditions are subject to the Markov switching. The existence and uniqueness of weak solutions are developed for the stochastic hyperbolic initial-boundary value problem. By means of Lyapunov techniques some sufficient conditions are obtained by seeking the balance between the boundary condition and the transition probability of the Markov process. Particularly, boundary feedback control of a stochastic traffic flow model is developed for the freeway transportation system by integrating the on-ramp metering with the speed limit control.

The objective of this article is designing and implementing a traffic prediction scheme which can forecast the traffic flow with high efficiency and accuracy in Hong Kong. One problem in traffic prediction is how to balance the importance of historical traffic data and real-time traffic data. To make use of the real-time data as well as the history records, our ideas are combining data-driven approaches with model-driven approaches. First, the limitations of two baseline approaches auto-regressive integrated moving average and periodical moving average model are discussed. Second, artificial neural network is applied in the hybrid prediction model to balance between the two models. The training of neural network enables the artificial neural network to weight between real-time traffic data and traffic patterns revealed by historical traffic data. Furthermore, an emergency strategy using the Bayesian network is added to the prediction scheme to handle with the traffic accident or other emergent situation. The emergency prediction strategy on unexpected traffic situation considers the traffic condition of nearby links to predict the speed change on the link. Finally, experimental results of short-term and long-term predictions demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed scheme.

Road traffic, as a part of the most important components in city traffic, is a complex system problem. To solve the difficulties in current city development and people's production and living, and to promote the development of national economy and society greatly, we need to study the road traffic. In order to solve the problem of complex road traffic system influenced by many factors, a physics model of pseudo-fluid of macroscopic road traffic system is established in combination with the traditional Lighthill-Whitham-Richards physics model based on kinetic theory of granular flow. A coupling method of meshless particles with grid is adopted to solve the new traffic model, which is then applied to solving the typical traffic problems. In the new model, vehicles are likened to hard particles. Car-following is likened to collision interactions between particles. Driver driving affected by known road conditions is likened to the driving force exerted by external fluid in two-phase system consisting of fluid and particle, and the influence of vehicles in different lanes is likened to viscous effect between particles. Thus the pseudo-fluid model of road traffic system is deduced and established based on the kinetic theory of granular flow. Then, the traffic multiphase system model is established by adding pedestrians and other non-motorized vehicles to the particles with different attributes. The boundary model of road traffic system based on pipeline theory is established through comparing the boundary model of traffic lights, barricades and forbidden lane changes to wall boundary conditions. Therefore, a complex large traffic model with different initial and boundary conditions considering the complex factors of the system is established. The Smoothed discrete particle hydrodynamics (SDPH) is used to discretize the vehicle system model. A one-to-one correspondence between SDPH vehicles and real vehicles is established through adding the vehicle flow properties characterized by SDPH particles. Then the two-fluid model of road traffic system is solved by combining the finite volume method. Thus, a new simulation approach to solving the macroscopic model of traffic flow is established. Finally, the effects of mixed flow composed of motorized and non-motorized vehicles and vehicles merging on the road traffic are simulated by employing the established model and method. The real-time distribution of the vehicle on the road is obtained, and the variation of the vehicle flow density with time is analyzed. The simulation results are in good agreement with the measured values, which shows that the new model and method are effective and reliable, and they provide a new way of solving the road traffic problem.

Based on the proposed model, we derive analytically the effect of driver's anticipation of multiple optimal current differences on the instability of traffic dynamics. The phase diagrams have been plotted and discussed that the stability region enhances with anticipation effect in sensing multiple optimal current differences. Through simulation, it is found that the oscillation of density wave around critical density decreases with an increase in lattice number and anticipation time for transient and steady state. The simulation results are in good agreement with the theoretical analysis, which show that considering the driver's anticipation of multiple optimal current differences in two-lane lattice model stabilizes the traffic flow and suppresses the traffic jam efficiently.

J	Liu, F; Zeng, ZY; Jiang, R				Liu, Fei; Zeng, Zhiyuan; Jiang, Rong			A video-based real-time adaptive vehicle-counting system for urban roads	PLOS ONE			English	Article								In developing nations, many expanding cities are facing challenges that result from the overwhelming numbers of people and vehicles. Collecting real-time, reliable and precise traffic flow information is crucial for urban traffic management. The main purpose of this paper is to develop an adaptive model that can assess the real-time vehicle counts on urban roads using computer vision technologies. This paper proposes an automatic real-time background update algorithm for vehicle detection and an adaptive pattern for vehicle counting based on the virtual loop and detection line methods. In addition, a new robust detection method is introduced to monitor the real-time traffic congestion state of road section. A prototype system has been developed and installed on an urban road for testing. The results show that the system is robust, with a real-time counting accuracy exceeding 99% in most field scenarios.

The control method is used to analyze the stability of the model. The critical condition for the linear steady traffic flow is deduced and the numerical simulation is carried out to investigate the advantage of the proposed model with and without the effect of optimal flux for forward looking sites. Moreover it indicates that the characteristic of the model can lead to a lower energy consumption in traffic system. The results are consistent with the theoretical analysis correspondingly.

It presents traffic flow model for a transport network, which can be applied for estimation of external costs of transport resulting from congestion and congestion-related effects like noise and harmful emission. Model includes structure of vehicle stock, segmentation of transport, characteristics of roads and elements of surroundings. It allows for computational experiments with traffic distribution into transport network and traffic management and, in consequence, estimation of environmental effects of traffic flow. Formal model was supported by numerical example for transport network of Mazowieckie voivodeship in Poland. The example is based on noise pollution and its external costs. The model was developed on the base of EMITRANSYS model for Mazowieckie in 2016.

The relationship between rear-end crash occurrences and traffic conditions were explored using historical loop detector data from Interstate-894 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA. The extracted loop detection data were aggregated over different stations and time intervals to produce explanatory features. A feature selection process, which addresses the interaction between SVM classifiers and explanatory features, was adopted to identify the features that significantly influence rear-end crashes. Afterwards, the identified significant explanatory features over three separate time levels were used to train three SVM models. In the end, the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network models were used as benchmarks to evaluate the performance of SVM models. The results show that the proposed feature selection procedure greatly enhances the accuracy and generalization capability of SVM models. Moreover, the optimal SVM classifier achieves 81.1% overall prediction precision rate. In comparison with MLP artificial neural networks, SVM models provide better results in terms of crash prediction accuracy and false positive rate, which confirms the superior performance of SVM technique in rear-end crash potential prediction analysis.

Dynamic characteristics of traffic flow with consideration of crossing pedestrians' behavior at a nonsignalized T-shaped intersection	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Cellular automata; nonsignalized T-shaped intersection; phase diagram; crossing pedestrians	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; SIMULATION; STREET	In this paper, we present a cellular automata model to depict the traffic characteristics at such a nonsignalized T-shaped intersection in the presence of pedestrian crossings. The vehicular traffic flow characteristics with different parameters are studied. Throughput, phase diagrams, space-time and density profiles are built to point various traffic states and the phase transition features. The principal finding of the simulation are as follows: (1) The presence of crossing pedestrians has a significant influence on the vehicular traffic and the system performance, (2) The intersection capacity has a close relevance with the state of the weaving section. The smaller the interactions are at the weaving section, the higher the capacity and (3) In order to have a higher system ability, the crosswalk location should not be far from the yield line of the weaving section.

In this paper, we propose an innovative approach for detection of traffic congestion. Specifically, we combine the flexibility and simplicity of a piecewise switched linear (PWSL) macroscopic traffic model and the greater capacity of the exponentially-weighted moving average (EWMA) monitoring chart. Macroscopic models, which have few, easily calibrated parameters, are employed to describe a free traffic flow at the macroscopic level. Then, we apply the EWMA monitoring chart to the uncorrelated residuals obtained from the constructed PWSL model to detect congested situations. In this strategy, wavelet-based multiscale filtering of data has been used before the application of the EWMA scheme to improve further the robustness of this method to measurement noise and reduce the false alarms due to modeling errors. The performance of the PWSL-EWMA approach is successfully tested on traffic data from the three lane highway portion of the Interstate 210 (I-210) highway of the west of California and the four lane highway portion of the State Route 60 (SR60) highway from the east of California, provided by the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Results show the ability of the PWSL-EWMA approach to monitor vehicle traffic, confirming the promising application of this statistical tool to the supervision of traffic flow congestion.

Given the proliferation of newer layouts, it is of interest to explore whether design practices could be improved by capitalizing on the experience gained internationally. Operational aspects of some of these designs have been explored previously, but there is a need to compare both the operational and safety performance of new designs to that of standard roundabouts. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the safety and operational implications of various potential alternatives to the standard roundabouts that proliferate in Europe and elsewhere. Microsimulation is used to simulate traffic operations at roundabout layout alternatives at the same levels of volume to capacity (V/C) ratio and also with the same traffic flow. Operational performance measures include the common level of service parameters, while measures of safety are based initially on time to collision (TTC) values. Threshold values of TTC were then applied in defining conflicts that are used for crash-based safety evaluation by applying crash-conflict models estimated in published research. Interesting insights were revealed, suggesting that the newer layouts should be considered where warranted by cost-benefit considerations.

J	Rinaldi, M; Viti, F				Rinaldi, Marco; Viti, Francesco			Exact and approximate route set generation for resilient partial observability in sensor location problems	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Network Sensor Location Problem; Partial link flow observability; Route set generation; Maximum clique problem; Genetic algorithm	DESTINATION MATRIX ESTIMATION; LINK FLOW INFERENCE; PATH RECONSTRUCTION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; COUNTING LOCATION; TRAFFIC NETWORKS; CLIQUE PROBLEM; MODELS; IDENTIFICATION; ENUMERATION	Sensor positioning is a fundamental problem in transportation networks, as the location of sensors strongly determines how traffic flows are observable and hence manageable. This paper aims to develop a methodology to determine sensor locations on a network such that an optimal trade-off solution is found between the amount of sensors installed and the resilience of the sensor set. In particular, we propose exact and heuristic solutions for identifying the optimal route sets such that no other route would include any additional information for finding optimal full and partial observability solutions. This is an important contribution to sensor location problems, as route-based link flow inference problems have non-unique solutions, strongly depending on the used link-route information. The properties of the new methodology are analyzed and illustrated through different case studies, and the advantages of the algorithms are quantified both for full and for partial observability solutions. Due to the route sets found by our approach, we are able to find full observability solutions characterized by a small number of sensors, while yet being efficient also in terms of partial observability. We perform validation tests on both small and real-life sized network instances. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

On node models for high-dimensional road networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Macroscopic first order traffic model; First order node model; Multi-commodity traffic; Dynamic traffic assignment; Dynamic network loading	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; DYNAMIC TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT; SPILLBACK; FLOWS; TIME	Macroscopic traffic models are necessary for simulation and study of traffic's complex macro-scale dynamics, and are often used by practitioners for road network planning, integrated corridor management, and other applications. These models have two parts: a link model, which describes traffic flow behavior on individual roads, and a node model, which describes behavior at road junctions. As the road networks under study become larger and more complex nowadays often including arterial networks the node model becomes more important. Despite their great importance to macroscopic models, however, only recently have node models had similar levels of attention as link models in the literature. This paper focuses on the first order node model and has two main contributions. First, we formalize the multi-commodity flow distribution at a junction as an optimization problem with all the necessary constraints. Most interesting here is the formalization of input flow priorities. Then, we discuss a very common "conservation of turning fractions" or "first-in first-out" (FIFO) constraint, and how it often produces unrealistic spillback. This spillback occurs when, at a diverge, a queue develops for a movement that only a few lanes service, but FIFO requires that all lanes experience spillback from this queue. As we show, avoiding this unrealistic spillback while retaining FIFO in the node model requires complicated network topologies. Our second contribution is a "partial FIFO" mechanism that avoids this unrealistic spillback, and a (first-order) node model and solution algorithm that incorporates this mechanism. The partial FIFO mechanism is parameterized through intervals that describe how individual movements influence each other, can be intuitively described from physical lane geometry and turning movement rules, and allows tuning to describe a link as having anything between full FIFO and no FIFO. Excepting the FIFO constraint, the present node model also fits within the well-established "general class of first-order node models" for multi-commodity flows. Several illustrative examples are presented. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Nevertheless, air quality does not depend only on traffic flows, but also on pollution dispersion. In this paper we investigate the effects of the temporal variation in pollution dispersion on optimal road pricing, and show that time-varying road pricing is needed to make drivers internalize the social costs of both time-varying congestion and time-varying pollution. To this end, we develop an ecological economics model that takes into account the effects of road pricing on daily commuting patterns. We characterize the optimal road pricing when pollution dispersion varies over the day and analyze its effects on traffic flows, arrival times, and the number of commuters by car.

J	Coifman, B; Li, LZ				Coifman, Benjamin; Li, Lizhe			A critical evaluation of the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) vehicle trajectory dataset	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Traffic flow theory; Highway traffic; Microscopic models; Congested traffic; NGSIM; Empirical data		A clear understanding of car following behavior and microscopic relationships is critical for advancing traffic flow theory. Without empirical microscopic data, plausible but incorrect hypotheses perpetuate in the vacuum. The Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) project was undertaken to collect such data and the NGSIM data set has become the de facto standard, underlying the vast majority of empirically based advances of the past decade. But there has been a growing minority of researchers who have found unrealistic relationships in the NGSIM data. To date, the critical findings have almost exclusively come from the existing NGSIM database itself. Unfortunately, as this paper shows, the NGSIM errors are beyond anything that could be corrected strictly through cleaning or interpolation of the reported NGSIM data. This paper takes the deepest evaluation yet of the NGSIM data. This research manually re-extracts the vehicle trajectories from a portion of the original NGSIM video to explicitly quantify NGSIM errors, e.g., piecewise constant speeds punctuated by brief periods of large acceleration exhibited by the NGSIM data were not evident in the newly extracted trajectories. This point is particularly troublesome for applications that rely on acceleration, e.g., most car following models. The magnitude of errors exhibit a dependency on speed, location and vehicle length. Examples are shown Where a real vehicle stopped but the NGSIM trajectory does not and then overruns the location of the real leader. Needless to say, the re-extracted trajectories showed much cleaner speed-spacing relationships than the corresponding raw NGSIM trajectories. Finally, this work tracked the original NGSIM vehicles seen in one camera and added another 236 vehicles (11%) visible before/after the period of NGSIM tracking. As of publication, the manually re-extracted data from this paper will be released to the research community. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Jin, WL				Jin, Wen-Long			A first-order behavioral model of capacity drop	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Continuous lane-drop bottleneck; Behavioral model; Bounded acceleration constraint; LWR stationary states; Bounded acceleration stationary states; Capacity drop ratio	KINEMATIC WAVE THEORY; FREEWAY BOTTLENECKS; TRAFFIC FLOW; HIGHWAY; DENSITY; RAMP	Understanding traffic dynamics at lane-drop bottlenecks, especially the mechanism of capacity drop, is critical for developing and evaluating centralized and decentralized control strategies in a freeway system. In this study, we propose a first-order behavioral model of capacity drop at a continuous lane-drop bottleneck. By extending the theoretical framework for analytically solving the generalized Riemann problem in Jin (2017), we introduce vehicles' bounded acceleration on the LWR (Lighthill-Whitham-Richards) stationary states inside the lane-drop zone as an additional constraint for the optimization formulation of the entropy condition. We demonstrate that the optimization problem is uniquely solved with well-defined instantaneous continuous standing waves, comprised of the LWR stationary states inside the lane-drop and the bounded acceleration stationary states in the downstream acceleration zones. In the solutions to the generalized Riemann problem, the boundary flux as well as the stationary states and kinematic waves on both upstream and downstream links are the same as those in the phenomenological model of capacity drop proposed in Jin et al. (2015). This is a behavioral model of capacity drop, since both the dropped capacity and the capacity drop ratio are endogenous and can be calculated from the factors related to the fundamental diagram, road geometry, bounded acceleration, and lane changes. We present the Cell Transmission Model for the behavioral and phenomenological models and verify the theoretical results with numerical examples. We calibrate and validate the model with observed stationary speeds at a lane-drop bottleneck. Combined with Jin (2017), this study provides a proof of the conjecture by Hall and Agyemang-Duah (1991) that capacity drop results from the acceleration process when "drivers accelerate away from the (upstream) queue".

J	Jin, WL				Jin, Wen-Long			Kinematic wave models of lane-drop bottlenecks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Discontinuous/continuous lane-drop bottleneck; Generalized Riemann problem; Stationary states; Standing wave; Optimization formulation of entropy condition	TRAFFIC FLOW; FREEWAY BOTTLENECKS; NETWORK; FEATURES; HIGHWAY; ROADS	Lane-drop bottlenecks lead to both capacity reduction and capacity drop, but there are no systematic studies on traffic dynamics, especially the stationary traffic patterns when the upstream link is congested, at such critical bottlenecks within the framework of kinematic wave theory. In this paper, we study three kinematic wave models for both discontinuous and continuous lane-drop bottlenecks, where the number of lanes drops either suddenly or gradually. In the first two models, we apply the multilane LWR model (Lighthill and Whitham, 1955; Richards, 1956) for a discontinuous and continuous lane-drop bottleneck, respectively; in the third model, we assume that the standing wave is instantaneous inside a continuous lane-drop bottleneck. For the first model, we apply the kinematic wave theory developed in Jin et al. (2009) to solve the Riemann problem. In particular, we present an optimization formulation for the entropy condition, solve the stationary states and kinematic waves on both upstream and downstream links, and define instantaneous discontinuous standing waves connecting the upstream and downstream links' stationary states. For the second model, we define a generalized Riemann problem and show that the asymptotic stationary states and kinematic waves on both links are the same as those in the first model, but the asymptotic standing wave is continuous, comprising of stationary states inside the whole lane-drop zone. Assuming standing waves to be instantaneous as in the first model but continuous as in the second model, we present a new model of a continuous lane-drop bottleneck and a new theoretical framework to solve the generalized Riemann problem. Finally we develop three corresponding Cell Transmission Models and verify theoretical results, especially the presence and structure of continuous standing waves inside a continuous lane-drop zone, with numerical examples. We find that vehicles' acceleration rates across the standing waves can be infinite in the first model and unrealistically large in the other two and that there is no capacity drop in all of the models. The theoretical framework of the third model forms a basis for a follow-up study, (fin, 2017), in which we introduce bounded acceleration as an additional constraint on the instantaneous standing waves and present a behavioral model of capacity drop.

Particulate matter has been confirmed as a major pollutant in garage spaces, and exposure to these particles, especially submicron and ultrafine particles, is closely associated with the health of vehicle owners and people who work in garages. In this study, we evaluated the seasonal patterns of PM10, PM2.5, and PM1.0 in a naturally ventilated underground residential parking garage using field measurements collected at various times over a one-year period. The impacts of traffic flow, air exchange rate, and outdoor particles were determined by employing Pearson correlation and a mass-balance model. The results showed significant seasonal diurnal patterns of PM10, PM2.5, and PM1.0, with maximum values during winter and minimum values during summer. The daily mean PM10 and PM2.5 in the garage exceeded the long-term (24 h) exposure limit of the Chinese standard (0.15 mg/m(3) for PM10 and 0.075 mg/m(3) for PM2.5) during spring, fall and winter, with the highest PM10 and PM2.5 concentration exceeding the limit eightfold. Use of natural ventilation only in the residential underground parking garage could not guarantee that particle pollution was at a "safe" exposure level in the study. During the measurements, the hourly mean PM10, PM2.5, and PM1.0 appeared to vary linearly under the combined effects of the air exchange rate multiplied by the outdoor particles; traffic flow; and mean PM10, PM2.5, and PM1.0 during the past hour.

J	Shi, YF; Yang, LC				Shi, Y. F.; Yang, L. C.			Improved coupled map car-following model considering partial car-to-car communication and its jam analysis	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article						car-to-car communication; coupled map; traffic jam; intelligent transportation systems; car-following	INTER-VEHICLE COMMUNICATION; VELOCITY DIFFERENCE MODEL; DELAYED-FEEDBACK-CONTROL; REACTION-TIME DELAY; TRAFFIC FLOW; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; NONLINEAR-ANALYSIS; RELATIVE VELOCITY; MEMORY; ANTICIPATION	The characteristics and the nonlinear phenomenon of traffic flow in the case of car-to-car communication (C2CC) are studied based on an improved coupled map car-following model. The model incorporates the modified optimal velocity function and appropriate control method. The conditions necessary to maintain the system stability and suppress traffic jams are obtained. To describe the car-following dynamics under C2CC accurately, different penetration rates of C2CC vehicles, such as 10%, 30%, and 60% are considered. The simulation results suggest that the improved model can effectively suppress traffic jams. The extent to which traffic jams are suppressed is increasing as the penetration rate increases. Moreover, the car-following stability has a noticeable improvement by analysing the time-space plots.	[Shi, Y. F.; Yang, L.

Through the control theory, the stability conditions are obtained, and by using nonlinear analysis, the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation and the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation are derived. Furthermore, the connection between TDGL and mKdV equations is also given. The numerical simulation is consistent with the theoretical analysis. The evolution of a traffic jam and the corresponding energy consumption are explored. The numerical results show that the control scheme is effective not only to suppress the traffic jam but also to reduce the energy consumption.

During the past decades, several challenging problems have arisen from this domain and attracted intensive studies. This paper addresses the problem of alleviating the airspace congestion and reducing the flight delays in ATFM simultaneously. We formulate this problem as a multi-objective air traffic network flow optimization (MATNFO) problem. In this MATNFO model, comprehensive ATFM actions, for instance, ground-holding, airborne-holding, rerouting, and speed control, are considered. Meanwhile, a systematic approach, namely route and time-slot assignment (RTA) algorithm, is developed to solve the MATNFO problem. The idea of divide-and-conquer is embedded in the algorithm by sequentially applying both route searching module and time refinement module. Furthermore, for the sake of efficiency, a pre-selection operator is proposed as one heuristic strategy to identify promising solutions and reduce the search space by defining a sector equilibrium metric. Experiments on real data of the Chinese airspace show that the RTA algorithm outperforms an existing competitor and three related multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. In addition, RTA is competent for high-quality real-time air traffic network flow assignment.

Service levels of sidewalks for pedestrians under mixed traffic environment using Genetic Programming clustering	KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						pedestrian; level of service; sidewalk; qualitative measure; quantitative measure; clustering analysis		This study aims at developing a model for pedestrian to evaluate service measure at the roadside walking environment from the qualitative and quantitative analysis in developing countries. The potential primary factors influencing service measure of pedestrian were summarized taking consideration to heterogeneous traffic flow condition and perception of road users. Total 735 real-time sense of participant's satisfaction when they are using the sidewalks, road geometric as well as operational characteristics of the road segments were collected from the 73 sites. The selected sites belong to midsized cities with varying geometric features. Different statistical investigations like factor analysis, Wilks' lambda test and stepwise regression analysis were carried out to develop PLOS model for sidewalk facilities. From the results it has been observed that the variables taken such as width of sidewalk, vehicle volume, pedestrian volume etc. are significantly influencing the pedestrian service measure and the model was validated with a significance value of R-2= 0.972. The PLOS scores got from the model are then classified using Genetic Programming clustering to find the six PLOS ranges (A-F) which show score for PLOS A ae<currency>1.8 with best condition and PLOS F > 5.1 having worst condition of service.

This study uses data from 19 Indonesian toll roads over 2008-2015 to calculate the effects of Indonesia's historic recent fuel subsidy reforms on motor vehicle travel. The timing of the reforms was determined by budgetary and political factors, providing a suitable setting for estimating a causal effect. We control for a broad set of other factors potentially influencing traffic flows. Estimates using monthly data suggest an immediate fuel price elasticity of motor vehicle flows on the roads in our study of -0.1, increasing to -0.2 when responses over a year are considered. We estimate that Indonesia's fuel subsidy reforms of 2013 and 2014 had reduced traffic pressure on these roads in the second half of 2015 by around 10% relative to the counterfactual without reform. A move to an adequate fuel excise system could contribute to more free-flowing traffic, while generating revenue for infrastructure and other investment.

These tolls are applied throughout a road network, and can be updated as frequently as travel time observations are made. Notably, A-tolling does not require any details of the traffic flow or travel demand models other than travel time observations, rendering it easy to apply in real-time. The flexibility of this tolling scheme is demonstrated in three specific traffic modeling contexts with varying traffic flow and user behavior assumptions: a day-to-day pricing model using static network equilibrium with link delay functions; a within-day adaptive pricing model using the cell transmission model and dynamic routing of vehicles; and a microsimulation of reservation-based intersection control for connected and autonomous vehicles with myopic routing. In all cases, A-tolling produces significant benefits over the no-toll case, measured in terms of average travel time and social welfare, while only requiring two parameters to be tuned. Some optimality results are also given for the special case of the static network equilibrium model with BPR-style delay functions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hu, XS; Wang, H; Tang, XL				Hu, Xiaosong; Wang, Hong; Tang, Xiaolin			Cyber-Physical Control for Energy-Saving Vehicle Following With Connectivity	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Connectivity; cyber-physical system (CPS); energy saving; intelligent transportation system; predictive control	MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; FUEL CONSUMPTION; PROGRAMMING APPROACH; OPTIMIZATION; MINIMIZE; BUS	This article aims to develop an optimal lookahead control framework to maximize car-following fuel economy, while fulfilling requirements of intervehicle safety. Three original contributions make this work distinctive from the existing relevant literature. First, a model predictive fuel-optimal controller is constructed to optimize the vehicle speed and continuously variable transmission (CVT) gear ratio. The controller leverages state trajectories of the leading vehicle transmitted via Vehicle-to-Vehicle/Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2V/V2I) communication. How operating conditions affect the engine efficiency and CVT efficiency is explicitly taken into account. Second, the controller is sufficiently evaluated in a variety of traffic flows, such as cruising, urban, and highway-like driving, and is compared with a short-sighted alternative without V2V/V2I connectivity. Finally, we further demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme by a comparison with two existing benchmark controllers.

J	Li, Y; Xu, CC; Xing, L; Wang, W				Li, Ye; Xu, Chengcheng; Xing, Lu; Wang, Wei			Integrated Cooperative Adaptive Cruise and Variable Speed Limit Controls for Reducing Rear-End Collision Risks Near Freeway Bottlenecks Based on Micro-Simulations	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Cooperative adaptive cruise control; variable speed limit; rear-end collision; freeway bottleneck	CONTROL STRATEGY; OPERATIONAL IMPACTS; TRAFFIC SAFETY; TIME; ENVIRONMENT; IMPROVEMENT; SYSTEMS; FLOW	Freeway bottlenecks lead to traffic congestion and speed reduction, resulting in increased risks of rear-end collision. This paper aimed to develop a control strategy of an integrated system of cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) and variable speed limit (VSL) to reduce rear-end collision risks near freeway bottlenecks. A microscopic simulation testbed was first constructed, in which the realistic PATH CACC models and surrogate safety measures of the time exposed time-to-collision (TET) and time integrated time-to-collision (TIT) were used. A feedback control algorithm was then developed for the proposed vehicle to infrastructure system of CACC and VSL. The simulation results showed that the proposed integration system with 100% CACC penetration rate can reduce the rear-end collision risks effectively, with the TIT and TET declined by 98%. The average travel time was also decreased by 33%, compared with the manual vehicles without any control. Moreover, the safety improvements of the proposed integrated system are quite stable at the various bottlenecks with different magnitudes of speed reductions. The sensitivity analyses suggested that the penetration rate of CACC has significant impact on safety performance. The VSL control plays an important role in reducing rear-end collision risks when the penetration rate of CACC is low. The combination of CACC and VSL controls mitigates the negative effects of the mixed traffic flow of the manual and CACC vehicles.

Besides the major goal of carrying passengers around, providing a comfortable travel experience for passengers is also a key business consideration. To provide a comfortable travel experience, effective bus scheduling is essential. Traditional approaches are based on fixed timetables. The wide adoptions of smart card fare collection systems and GPS tracing systems in public transportation provide new opportunities for using the data-driven approaches to fit the demand of passengers. In this paper, we associate these two independent data sets to derive the passengers' origin and destination. As the data are real time, we build a system to forecast the passenger flow in real time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper, which implements a system utilizing smart card data and GPS data to forecast the passenger flow in real time.

The successful prediction of traffic speed is increasingly significant for the benefits of both road users and traffic authorities. However, accurate prediction is challenging, due to the stochastic feature of traffic flow and shallow model structure. Furthermore, environmental factors, such as rainfall influence, should also be incorporated to improve accuracy. Inspired by deep learning, this paper investigates the performance of deep belief network (DBN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to conduct short-term traffic speed prediction with the consideration of rainfall impact as a non-traffic input. The deep learning models have the ability to learn complex features of traffic flow pattern under various rainfall conditions. To validate the performance of rainfall-integrated DBN and LSTM, the traffic detector data from an arterial in Beijing are utilised for model training and testing. The experiment results indicate that with the combination input of speed and additional rainfall data, deep learning models have better prediction accuracy over other existing models, and also yields improvements over the models without rainfall input. Furthermore, the LSTM can outperform the DBN to capture the time-series characteristics of traffic speed data.

This study presents a methodology for evaluating the statistical extrapolation of traffic-load effects on long-span bridges. As part of the contributions advancing the state of the art, this study addresses several challenging issues, including traffic growth, and the resulting dynamic impact, and actual traffic patterns. The nonstationarity of the traffic-load effects due to traffic growth is considered in a series system compounded by several interval traffic models. The dynamic impacts of traffic loads were simulated by a traffic-bridge-coupled vibration system, and the statistical characteristics were captured using a level-crossing model. The actual traffic pattern was simulated by stochastic traffic flows on the basis of the statistics of the weigh-in-motion measurements of a highway bridge. Two numerical examples show the ability of the interval-traffic-growth model to capture the nonstationarity of the growing traffic loads. In addition, a case study of a long-span suspension bridge shows the effectiveness of implementing the proposed methodology for the statistical extrapolation of the maximum deflection. The numerical results of the case study also reveal that the degradation of road-roughness conditions leads to more level crossings but also results in a slight increase in the extrapolation of the deflection. However, traffic growth results in rapid increases in both the extrapolated deflection and the probability of exceedance of the deflection limit. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Ma, WJ; Liu, Y; Zhao, J; Wu, N				Ma, Wanjing; Liu, Ye; Zhao, Jing; Wu, Ning			Increasing the capacity of signalized intersections with left-turn waiting areas	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Signalized intersection; Left-turn waiting area; Capacity analysis	OPTIMIZATION; LANE; OPERATION; DESIGN; PHASES; MODEL	One of the most complex issues for the design of at-grade signalized intersections is accommodating left-turn (LT) movements, especially when approaches have insufficient available spatial resources. In this study, we mitigated this problem by reorganizing left-turning traffic flows within intersections through the use of a left-turn waiting area (LTWA). We proposed a series of design pattern left-turn waiting areas for different combinations of spatial and temporal treatments of left-turn movements: exclusive left-turn lanes with protected left-turn phasing, exclusive left-turn lanes with permitted left-turn phasing, and shared left-turn lanes with permitted left-turn phasing. Based on probability theory, an analytical procedure is developed for estimating the capacity of shared and short lanes. Explicit VISSIM simulations are conducted to validate the accuracy of the proposed capacity models, and the impact of design parameters for the proposed system on the left-turn capacity are studied. On the basis of the analyses, benefits of the proposed system are identified, and the domain of application where these benefits are most significant is identified. In addition, optimal LTWA design scheme and critical LT volumes of exclusive LT lane and protected LT phase with different LTWA schemes are presented from the operation efficiency perspective.

The control method optimizes the signal timings in adaptive traffic control systems, and takes full advantage of flexible new technologies to incorporate the most up-to-date traffic information, as collected in real time. The definitions, combinations, and sequencing of the cycle structure stages are generated automatically using a procedure for optimizing the signal-timing plans in response to online data from traffic detectors. This new method provides a wider search space and improves the efficiency of the signal-control systems, thus improving the junction performance, minimizing delays, and maximizing capacity in real time. A multi-resolution strategy is proposed for updating the elements of the signal plans cycle-by-cycle and adjusting the current green signal timing second-by-second. The group-based variables and parameters for the proactive global optimization method utilize lane-based predictive traffic-flow information, such as arrival and discharge rates, expressed as the slopes of polygonal delay formulas. Therefore, there is a high degree of flexibility in the tactical identification of the optimal signal plan in response to the real-time predicted traffic information, the objective function of the polygonal delay formula, and the direct differential equations for the adaptive group-based variables. The reactive local signal-control policy, which is formed based on the max-pressure strategy, is developed to locally adjust the current green signal time and to accommodate delicate demand fluctuations second-by-second at the fine-resolution level. The most appropriate cycle-structure for the tactical level of control is identified using a group-based global-optimization procedure that takes advantage of the latest available information. In part II of this study (Lee et al. 2017), the effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated based on the actualized mathematical frameworks, computer simulations, and a case study, using the appropriate computer programs.

Dynamical capacity drop in a nonlinear stochastic traffic model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article							CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; DIFFERENTIAL-EQUATIONS; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; FREEWAY QUEUES; FLOW; SIMULATION; STABILIZATION; NOISE; CONGESTION; STATES	In this work, we show that the inverse-lambda shape in the fundamental diagram of traffic flow can be produced dynamically by a simple nonlinear mesoscopic model with stochastic noises. The proposed model is based on the gas-kinetic theory of the traffic system. In our approach, the nonlinearity leads to the coexistence of different traffic states. The scattering of the data is thus attributed to the noise terms introduced in the stochastic differential equations and the transition among the various traffic states. Most importantly, the observed inverse-lambda shape and the associated sudden jump of physical quantities arise due to the effect of stochastic noises on the stability of the system. The model parameters are calibrated, and a qualitative agreement is obtained between the data and the numerical simulations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Studying real traffic and mobility scenarios for a Smart City using a new monitoring and tracking system	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE			English	Article						Smart Traffic; Transit indicators; Traffic forecast; Mobility analysis; Smart City; Internet of Things	TERM; PEOPLE; PREDICTION; MODEL	This paper presents a novel mobility monitoring system and some of its applications to address problems that would be solved in a Smart City, such as the optimization of traffic flows in terms of trip-time and security (Smart Traffic), and the improvement of security or energetic issues inside buildings. The system tracks the movement of people and vehicles monitoring the radioelectric space, catching the WiFi and Bluetooth signals emitted by personal (smartphones) or on-board (hands-free) devices. A study has been conducted in four different real scenarios, i.e. with real data gathered by the system: two related with people's mobility (a public building and a discotheque); and two focused in traffic tracking (urban and intercity roads). The analysis has consisted on the application of different data mining techniques to extract useful knowledge, traffic forecasting methods to perform accurate predictions, and statistical analyses to model and validate the system reliability (comparing to other real data sources). The obtained results show the viability and utility of the system in all the cases, along with some of its multiple applications for solving different issues in a city. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The model is based on finite capacity queuing theory which captures the stationary density-flow relationships. It is also inspired from the deterministic Godunov scheme for the road traffic simulation. We first present a reformulation of the existing linear case of M/G/c/c state dependent model, in order to use flow rather than speed variables. We then extend this model in order to consider upstream traffic demand and downstream traffic supply. After that, we propose the model for two road sections in tandem where both sections influence each other. In order to deal with this mutual dependence, we solve an implicit system given by an algebraic equation. Finally, we derive some performance measures (throughput and expected travel time). A comparison with results predicted by the M/G/c/c state dependent queuing networks shows that the model we propose here captures really the dynamics of the road traffic. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wang, MJ; Yang, S; Sun, Y; Gao, J				Wang, Minjie; Yang, Su; Sun, Yi; Gao, Jun			Discovering urban mobility patterns with PageRank based traffic modeling and prediction	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Human mobility; City dynamics; Traffic flow prediction; Spatial-temporal correlation; Intelligent transportation	FLOW	Urban transportation system can be viewed as complex network with time-varying traffic flows as links to connect adjacent regions as networked nodes. By computing urban traffic evolution on such temporal complex network with PageRank, it is found that for most regions, there exists a linear relation between the traffic congestion measure at present time and the PageRank value of the last time. Since the PageRank measure of a region does result from the mutual interactions of the whole network, it implies that the traffic state of a local region does not evolve independently but is affected by the evolution of the whole network. As a result, the PageRank values can act as signatures in predicting upcoming traffic congestions, We observe the aforementioned laws experimentally based on the trajectory data of 12000 taxies in Beijing city for one month.

J	Shen, ZG; Wang, WL; Shen, Q; Li, ZC				Shen, Zhangguo; Wang, Wanliang; Shen, Qing; Li, Zechao			Hybrid CSA optimization with seasonal RVR in traffic flow forecasting	KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Short term traffic flow forecasting; Relevance vector regression (RVR); Chaotic simulated annealing (CSA); Double seasonal holt-winters exponential smoothing (DSHWES)	PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; PREDICTION; VOLUME; MODEL	Accurate traffic flow forecasting is critical to the development and implementation of city intelligent transportation systems. Therefore, it is one of the most important components in the research of urban traffic scheduling. However, traffic flow forecasting involves a rather complex nonlinear data pattern, particularly during workday peak periods, and a lot of research has shown that traffic flow data reveals a seasonal trend. This paper proposes a new traffic flow forecasting model that combines seasonal relevance vector regression with the hybrid chaotic simulated annealing method (SRVRCSA). Additionally, a numerical example of traffic flow data from The Transportation Data Research Laboratory is used to elucidate the forecasting performance of the proposed SRVRCSA model. The forecasting results indicate that the proposed model yields more accurate forecasting results than the seasonal auto regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), the double seasonal Holt-Winters exponential smoothing (DSHWES), and the relevance vector regression with hybrid Chaotic Simulated Annealing method (RVRCSA) models.

Howerver, most of researches concentrate on improving the effect in an independent section. Based on traditional cellular automata traffic model, a multi-section model is proposed by regarding serverl road sections as a traffic system. In this model, different sections of the road might have different lengths, numbers of lanes or maximal speeds. And vehicles travel from one section to another. The main difficulty lies in dealing with the relationships among the traffic flows of different sections. Besides basic rules in NaSch model, the vehicle inflow rule, crossroad randomization brake rule and crossroad inflow rule is added in this paper to enable vehicles to flow between sections. At the beginning of section, to avoid conflicting at crossroads under open boundary condition, the concept of car pool is introduced when new vehicles enter into sections. Before arriving at the end of section, crossroad randomization brake is used to simulate the influences of crossroads. Speed decreases in probability until lower than a maximal crossroad speed. When leaving the section, vehicles go to the next section with a straight ratio. Also, new vehicles may enter according to traffic condition. Therefore, cellular automata of different sections can be connected in series. Finally, numerical simulation is demonstrated to study the influences of important parameters, including traffic inflow probability, maximal crossroad speed and crossroad randomization brake probability. Compared with traditional models, this model focuses on connecting sections. And improvements of basic models can be implanted easily, thereby increasing the accuracy of the whole model in the future. The experimental result are as follows. 1) According to space-time graphs of different inflow probabilities, there is a new kind of traffic flow called mixed flow. Traffic congestion often starts from crossroads, and spreads to the whole section. And traffic jams in previous section might relieve traffic pressure in latter section. 2) With the increase of traffic inflow probability, crossroads tends to have a greater influence on average speed as well as average traffic density. What is more, the moderate increase of vehicle numbers could cause the road capacity to drop rapidly if it exceeds the threshold value.

J	Jayasinghe, A; Sano, K; Rattanaporn, K				Jayasinghe, Amila; Sano, Kazushi; Rattanaporn, Kasemsri			Application for developing countries: Estimating trip attraction in urban zones based on centrality	JOURNAL OF TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ENGLISH EDITION			English	Article						Trip attraction; Centrality; Space syntax; Land use; Developing country	SPACE SYNTAX; TRAFFIC FLOW; LAND-USE; TRANSPORT; INDEX; PRICE; MIX	This paper introduced a network centrality-based method to estimate the volume of trip attraction in traffic analysis zones. Usually trip attraction volumes are estimated based on land use characteristics. However, executing of land use-based trip attraction models are severely constrained by the lack of updated land use data in developing countries. The proposed method used network centrality-based explanatory variables as "connectivity", "local integration" and "global integration". Space syntax tools were used to compute the centrality of road segments. GIS-based kernel density estimation method was used to transform computed road segment-based centrality values into traffic analysis zone. Trip attraction values exhibited significant high correlation with connectivity, global and local integration values. The study developed and validated model to estimate trip attraction by using connectivity, local integration and global integration values as endogenous variables with an accepted level of accuracy (R-2 > 0.75). The proposed approach required minimal data, and it was easily executed using a geographic information system. The study recommended the proposed method as a practical tool for transport planners and engineers, especially who work in developing countries and where updated land use data is unavailable.

As a solution to practical problems, computer simulation has been proved to be a powerful tool in replicating complex traffic systems which allows experimentation to the basic traffic flow system. Various methods are available in literature, some of the methods use statistical tools to verify the difference between simulated and actual outputs and some are based on optimization which tries to minimize the error. For the present work, suitable methodology is adopted for the calibration process. Field data is collected, statistical tests are performed. For the simulation, VISSIM microscopic simulation tool is used and data analysis is performed by considering individual parameters and performance measures like speed, volume and random seed number. Statistical tests have been performed to check the sensitivity of the different simulation parameters. Calibration is done using trial and error method and optimization is performed using solver function. The maximum simulated flow rate was found with default values as 4599 veh/hr, and with calibrated values is 5147 veh/hr which is close to the target capacity 4958 veh/hr as obtained using field composition. Calibrated values of CC0 and CC1 and CC2 parameters were found as most optimized values to achieve target capacity. Finally, validation of calibrated parameter was performed by using different section of a multilane highway.

J	Pompigna, A; Rupi, F				Pompigna, Andrea; Rupi, Federico			Lane-Distribution Models and Related Effects on the Capacity for a Three-Lane Freeway Section: Case Study in Italy	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING PART A-SYSTEMS			English	Article						Freeway capacity; Freeway traffic; Lane-flow distribution; Fundamental diagram calibration	LOCALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION	Traffic flow, its characteristics, and road quality service are usually estimated by using aggregated and averaged data from multiple lanes; however, in real experiences, there is significant variability in traffic-flow parameters across the different freeway lanes. Among the numerous factors that affect traffic distribution are vehicular composition, driver behavior, regulations about passing and overtaking, lane discipline, and designated lanes. Because these factors are very specific, the models and values for traffic distribution in a multilane freeway segment are highly sensitive to their national context. This study starts from an analysis of the capacity of a three-lane test segment within the Italian freeway system, and then examines the manner in which the flow and density vary across the freeway lanes. The analysis is restricted to up-to-capacity conditions and nonlinear regression models of the distribution relationships are calibrated for each lane, for both flow and density ratios, as a function of the total flow. The nonhomogeneous use of freeway lanes in Italy can be qualified and quantified through the trends found in these ratios, and then compared with similar internationally focused studies. This provides a useful interpretation of driver behavior, and is also a reference for calibrating traffic models, supporting design and operational processes and the implementation of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) that are consistent with the national context.

On the basis of this assessment the implementation of active measures for reducing the probability of their actual occurrence is included. The intensity of traffic does not give a simple correlation with the number and the type of accidents, that relationship is more complex. Previous studies have been applied to motorways with six and more traffic lanes, and no studies have been carried out for four-lane motorways (with the driving and overtaking lane on one carriageway). This paper presents a new model for such motorways, the model is based on measuring values of parameters of traffic flow and external factors that affect the traffic flow. The degree of crash potential was brought to correlation with the existing statistical data on traffic accidents on the test section and traffic flow data. This model is important for experts to produce algorithms that manage variable message signs on highways.

J	Ma, XL; Luan, S; Du, BW; Yu, B				Ma, Xiaolei; Luan, Sen; Du, Bowen; Yu, Bin			Spatial Copula Model for Imputing Traffic Flow Data from Remote Microwave Sensors	SENSORS			English	Article						traffic flow imputation; spatial interpolation; spatial correlation; marginal distribution; copula model	NETWORK; COUNTS	Issues of missing data have become increasingly serious with the rapid increase in usage of traffic sensors. Analyses of the Beijing ring expressway have showed that up to 50% of microwave sensors pose missing values. The imputation of missing traffic data must be urgently solved although a precise solution that cannot be easily achieved due to the significant number of missing portions. In this study, copula-based models are proposed for the spatial interpolation of traffic flow from remote traffic microwave sensors. Most existing interpolation methods only rely on covariance functions to depict spatial correlation and are unsuitable for coping with anomalies due to Gaussian consumption. Copula theory overcomes this issue and provides a connection between the correlation function and the marginal distribution function of traffic flow. To validate copula-based models, a comparison with three kriging methods is conducted. Results indicate that copula-based models outperform kriging methods, especially on roads with irregular traffic patterns. Copula-based models demonstrate significant potential to impute missing data in large-scale transportation networks.

The micro-scale driving behaviors in rainy weather and possible vehicle rear-end and sideslip accidents are analyzed. An improved CA model of two lanes one-way freeway is presented, where some vehicle accidents will occur when the necessary conditions are simultaneously satisfied. The characteristics of traffic flow under different rainfall intensities are discussed and the accident probabilities are analyzed via the simulation experiments by using variable speed limit (VSL) and incoming flow control. The results indicate that the measures are effective especially during heavy rainstorms or short-time heavy rainfall.

Thus, the intelligent traffic monitoring system should be able to prevent this situation by integrating an illegally parked vehicle detection module. However, implementing such a module becomes more challenging due to road environments, such as weather conditions, occlusion, and illumination changing. Hence, this work addresses a method to implement an illegally parked vehicle detection based on the cumulative dual foreground differences from the short-and long-term background models, temporal analysis, vehicle detector, and tracking. The extensive experiments were conducted using both iLIDS and our proposed datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing with other methods. The results showed that the method is effective in detecting illegally parked vehicles and can be considered as part of the intelligent traffic monitoring system.

In this paper, we propose a distributed ATFM strategy to minimize the airport departure and arrival schedule deviations. The scheduling problem is formulated based on an en-route air traffic system model consisting of air routes, waypoints, and airports. A cell transmission flow dynamic model is adopted to describe the system dynamics under safety related constraints, such as the capacities of air routes and airports, and the aircraft speed limits. Our ATFM problem is formulated as an integer quadratic programming problem. To overcome the computational complexity associated with this problem, we first solve a relaxed quadratic programming problem by a distributed approach based on Lagrangian relaxation. Then a heuristic forward-backward propagation algorithm is proposed to obtain the final integer solution. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling strategy.

Distributed Scheduling and Cooperative Control for Charging of Electric Vehicles at Highway Service Stations	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Electric vehicles' charging; transportation networks; distributed consensus algorithm; cooperative control; dynamical systems	PLUG-IN HYBRID; INFRASTRUCTURE; OPTIMIZATION; NETWORKS; MODEL; TECHNOLOGIES; DEPLOYMENT; SYSTEMS	The increasing number of electric vehicles (EVs) on highways calls for the installment of adequate charging infrastructure. Since charging infrastructure has limited capacity, EVs need to wait at a charging station to get charged, and their waiting times may differ significantly from one location to another. This paper aims at developing a strategy to coordinate the queues among the charging stations, with only local information about traffic flows and the status of EV charging stations along a bidirectional highway, so that excessively long waiting times can be avoided. Specifically, a distributed algorithm is presented to schedule EV flows into neighboring charging stations, so that EVs are all appropriately served along the highway and that all the charging resources are uniformly utilized. In addition, a distributed decision making policy is developed to influence the aggregate number of EVs entering any given service station, so that each EV makes an appropriate decision (i.e., whether or not it should enter the next charging station) by contributing positively to meeting the desired queue length at service stations and by considering its own battery constraint. Performance improvement of the proposed strategy is illustrated via one of the highways in the United States, namely the Florida Turnpike.

To overcome this predicament, we propose a vehicle-assisted offloading (VAO) scheme, which exploits the vehicle queue stopping for the red light to offload data traffic from busy street intersection cells to their adjacent cells that are largely idle. The performance of VAO is theoretically analyzed by considering both the road traffic conditions and the communications between vehicles and pedestrians. Simulations with practical configurations have verified our analysis and demonstrated that the VAO is capable of achieving substantial performance gain.

J	Tan, F; Wei, D; Zhu, JQ; Xu, D; Yin, KX				Tan, Fei; Wei, Da; Zhu, Jianqi; Xu, Dong; Yin, Kexin			An aggressive car-following model in the view of driving style	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						fvehicle mobility model; traffic simulation; car-following model; driving style	FLUCTUATION; STATES	The complexity of the driving behavior restricts the realism of traffic simulation. This paper proposed that vehicle mobility models should be established according to diverse driving styles to further approximation of real driving behavior. With Krauss model represented, the conservative (driving style) of safe distance car-following model is analyzed. The analysis means that real vehicles can occasionally break the safe distance rule, and on average, real vehicle gap is slightly smaller than that in the Krauss model. An aggressive car-following model is proposed in the view of driving style. Simulation results show the new model can simulate aggressive driving style, which has significance to simulate traffic using diverse driving style models. Since it breaks the safe distance rule, the new model has the possibility of generating rear-end collisions when simulating. Drivers' characteristics, prediction behavior, the cause of accidents, and the effects of time granularity on a simulation are studied. The concept of " road black hole" is put forward, which is believed to reduce velocity of traffic flow.

By incorporating minimum safety separation time, it was demonstrated that the control of air traffic flow in the terminal control area can be regarded as the planning of different departure queues in each fix. The jet route control model for different scenarios were put forward by formulating various types of constraints emphasized in the air traffic control rules. The inherent relationships for different system variables were acquired and the proposed optimization models were applied to coordinate several different departure air traffic flows in the specified fixes. In addition, some key features of the presented system optimization model were discussed. The proposed max-plus system model has been validated using real traffic flow data and some relevant experimental results were reported. Moreover, the influence of different factors such as temperature, weight, as well as aircraft climbing mode on the system optimization performance were also analyzed which demonstrated the validation of the presented system model.

Specifically, (1) the crack zone in the concrete bridge is modeled by a damage function with three parameters, i.e. the length of damaged zone, the magnitude of the damage, and the variation of Young's modulus of the material; (2) a cellular automation (CA) based traffic flow model is adopted, which can capture the basic features of the probabilistic traffic flows using realistic traffic rules; (3) a three-dimensional (3D) vehicle model and a single vehicle model are each used to simulate the vehicles in the traffic flow for computational efficiency; and (4) the bridge and vehicle coupled equations are established by combining those for the bridge and vehicles using the displacement and interaction force relationship at the contact patches. The experimental and numerical investigations are conducted to validate the proposed modeling methodology. As an illustration, a prototype concrete bridge structure with partial damage is studied. Finally, parametric studies are conducted to study the effects of damage cracks, stochastic traffic flows, and surface roughness on the dynamic displacement, impact factor, impact force, and dynamic load coefficient of the bridge.

PCU is the number of passenger cars that are displaced by a single heavy vehicle of a particular type under prevailing roadway, traffic and control conditions. The aim of the present study is to develop more appropriate models for estimating the equivalency units of different vehicle types on multilane highways, considering the limitations of available methods. Estimation of equivalency units for vehicle types is described by developing speed models based on multiple non-linear regression approaches. The equivalency units estimated by using models are found to be realistic and logical under heterogeneous traffic flow conditions. The PCU values estimated by the multiple non-linear regression method are compared with and found to be relatively higher values than the values obtained by the dynamic PCU. The accuracy of the models is checked by comparing the observed values of speed with estimated speeds. The multiple non-linear regression approach is also used for estimating the equivalency units on six-lane divided highways. Results indicate that the proposed methodology can be used for estimation of equivalency units for vehicle types under mixed traffic conditions.

Based on these prices, the private traffic flows of user equilibrium model or stochastic user equilibrium model converge to the predicted flow derived by system optimum model. To obtain LPP, a bi-level optimization model is studied for two types of CBD. In the first type which is referred by minor CBD, a new mathematical model is proposed to find LPP. In the second type, a general form of CBD namely major CBD is considered and a new algorithm entitled HABIB is proposed to estimate LPP. To decrease the computation time, a multi-layer perceptron neural network is used to learn solutions made by HABIB algorithm. It is shown that the accuracy of the proposed methods is acceptable. Also, the sensitivity analysis is done to illustrate the stability of the results in the absence of sufficient training data. Furthermore, the relations between LPP, public transportation costs and demands are investigated.

Previous work mainly focuses on the prediction of congestion and analysis of traffic flows, while the congestion correlation between road segments has not been studied yet. In this paper, we propose a three-phase framework to explore the congestion correlation between road segments from multiple real world data. In the first phase, we extract congestion information on each road segment from GPS trajectories of over 10,000 taxis, define congestion correlation and propose a corresponding mining algorithm to find out all the existing correlations. In the second phase, we extract various features on each pair of road segments from road network and POI data. In the last phase, the results of the first two phases are input into several classifiers to predict congestion correlation. We further analyze the important features and evaluate the results of the trained classifiers through experiments. We found some important patterns that lead to a high/low congestion correlation, and they can facilitate building various transportation applications. In addition, we found that traffic congestion correlation has obvious directionality and transmissibility. The proposed techniques in our framework are general, and can be applied to other pairwise correlation analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A fast simulation algorithm for multiple moving bottlenecks and applications in urban freight traffic management	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Moving bottlenecks; LWR model; Semi-analytic algorithm; Urban freight traffic; Freight traffic management	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; KINEMATIC WAVES; BOUNDARY-CONDITIONS; LIGHTHILL-WHITHAM; RICHARDS MODEL; FLOW; HIGHWAY	Moving bottlenecks are moving capacity restrictions that affect traffic flows, and they can be used to describe the effects of buses and trucks in transportation networks. The computation of solutions associated with the presence of moving bottlenecks is complex, since they both influence and are influenced by surrounding traffic. In this study, we propose a fast numerical scheme that can efficiently compute the solutions to an arbitrary number of moving (and fixed) bottlenecks, for a stretch of road modeled by the Lighthil-lWhitham-Richards (LWR) model. Several different moving bottlenecks can be simulated endogenously all together by means of an algorithm based on a semi-analytic Lax-Hopf formula. Since the numerical scheme is semi-analytic and requires a very low number of operations, it can be employed for traffic estimation problems where fast and accurate solutions are required. We demonstrate the capabilities of the method by implementing two alternative traffic management strategies designed to minimize the negative impacts of trucks and buses in urban environments.

J	Qu, XB; Zhang, J; Wang, SA				Qu, Xiaobo; Zhang, Jin; Wang, Shuaian			On the stochastic fundamental diagram for freeway traffic: Model development, analytical properties, validation, and extensive applications	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Stochastic fundamental diagram; Speed distributions; Traffic control	SPEED-DENSITY RELATIONSHIP; THEORETICAL-ANALYSIS; TRAJECTORY DESIGN; FUNCTIONAL FORM; FLOW; APPROXIMATION; CALIBRATION; DEPENDENCY; TIME	In this research, we apply a new calibration approach to generate stochastic traffic flow fundamental diagrams. We first prove that the percentile based fundamental diagrams are obtainable based on the proposed model. We further prove the proposed model has continuity, differentiability and convexity properties so that it can be easily solved by Gauss Newton method. By selecting different percentile values from 0 to 1, the speed distributions at any given densities can be derived. The model has been validated based on the GA400 data and the calibrated speed distributions perfectly fit the speed-density data. This proposed methodology has wide applications. First, new approaches can be proposed to evaluate the performance of calibrated fundamental diagrams by taking into account not only the residual but also ability to reflect the stochasticity of samples. Secondly, stochastic fundamental diagrams can be used to develop and evaluate traffic control strategies. In particular, the proposed stochastic fundamental diagram is applicable to model and optimize the connected and automated vehicles at the macroscopic level with an objective to reduce the stochasticity of traffic flow. Last but not the least, this proposed methodology can be applied to generate the stochastic models for most regression models with scattered samples. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Efficient and fair system states in dynamic transportation networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Linear programming; Efficient and fair; System optimal; User equilibrium; Route choice; Departure time choice	TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM; VARIATIONAL INEQUALITY FORMULATION; USER EQUILIBRIUM FORMULATION; DEPARTURE TIME CHOICE; CONGESTED NETWORKS; TRANSMISSION MODEL; SOLUTION ALGORITHM; ELASTIC DEMAND; VARYING FLOWS; MARGINAL COST	This paper sets out to model an efficient and fair transportation system accounting for both departure time choice and route choice of a general multi-OD network within a dynamic traffic assignment environment. Firstly, a bi-level optimization formulation is introduced based on the link-based traffic flow model. The upper level of the formulation minimizes the total system travel time, whereas the lower level captures traffic flow propagation and the user equilibrium constraints. Then the bi-level formulation is relaxed to a linear programming formulation that produces a lower bound of an efficient and fair system state. An efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to obtain the exact solution. It only requires solving one linear program in one iteration. Further, it is shown that the number of iterations is bounded, and the output traffic flow pattern is efficient and fair. Finally, two numerical cases (including a single OD network and a multi-OD network) are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the algorithm. The results consistently show that the departure rate pattern generated from the algorithm leads to an efficient and fair system state, and the algorithm converges within two iterations across all test scenarios.

J	Yin, PH; Sun, Z; Jin, WL; Xin, J				Yin, Penghang; Sun, Zhe; Jin, Wen-Long; Xin, Jack			l(1)-minimization method for link flow correction	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Link flow correction; l(1)-minimization; Flow conservation law; Recoverability; Exact recovery; Correction bound	THRESHOLDING ALGORITHM; WAVES	A computational method, based on l(1)-minimization, is proposed for the problem of link flow correction, when the available traffic flow data on many links in a road network are inconsistent with respect to the flow conservation law. Without extra information, the problem is generally ill-posed when a large portion of the link sensors are unhealthy. It is possible, however, to correct the corrupted link flows accurately with the proposed method under a recoverability condition if there are only a few bad sensors which are located at certain links. We analytically identify the links that are robust to miscounts and relate them to the geometric structure of the traffic network by introducing the recoverability concept and an algorithm for computing it. The recoverability condition for corrupted links is simply the associated recoverability being greater than 1. In a more realistic setting, besides the unhealthy link sensors, small measurement noises may be present at the other sensors. Under the same recoverability condition, our method guarantees to give an estimated traffic flow fairly close to the ground-truth data and leads to a bound for the correction error. Both synthetic and real-world examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ponnu, B; Coifman, B				Ponnu, Balaji; Coifman, Benjamin			When adjacent lane dependencies dominate the uncongested regime of the fundamental relationship	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Traffic flow theory; Fundamental relationship; Flow-density relationship; Loop detectors; Highway traffic; HOV operations	EQUATIONS APPROACH; TRAFFIC-FLOW; SPEED; HIGHWAY; DENSITY; MODELS; WAVES	This paper presents an empirical study of the fundamental relationship between speed, v, and flow, q, (denoted vqFR) under low flow in the uncongested regime. Using new analytical techniques to extract more information from loop detector data, the vqFR from a time of day HOV lane exhibits high v that slowly drops as q increases. This curve arises after binning several million vehicles by q and only considering those bins with q < 1200 vph. A surprising thing happens when further binning the data by the adjacent lane speed (v2): the vqFR expands in to a fan of curves that decrease in magnitude and slope with decreasing v2. Yet each curve in the fan continues to exhibit uncongested trends, ranging from a flat curve consistent with recent editions of the Highway Capacity Manual to downward sloping curves. It is shown that this behavior was not due to the HOV operations per se, the same behavior also arises in the non-HOV period when the lane serves all vehicles and it is also observed at another facility without any HOV restrictions. This dependency on the adjacent lane is absent from most traffic flow theories. Taking a broader view, four different factors appear to limit the speed a driver takes: (i) the roadway geometry, (ii) the posted speed limit, (iii) the vehicle ahead (car following), and (iv) traffic conditions in the adjacent lane. Whichever constraint is most binding determines the driver's speed. While the first three constraints are found in the literature, this work contributes the fourth, as per above. When the speed limit is the most binding constraint the uncongested regime of the vqFR is roughly flat with a near constant speed over a wide range of q. When the roadway geometry is the binding constraint, e.g., due to the lack of speed limits, drivers are able to travel fast enough to be sensitive to the vehicle ahead and exhibit lower v as q increases. Car following is by definition in the congested regime and thus, beyond the scope of this paper. Finally, the present work shows that as the adjacent lane moves slower, the uncongested drivers choose speeds below the speed limit and once more exhibit lower v as q increases. Although the chosen v is below the speed limit, the drivers continue to exhibit behavior consistent with the uncongested regime. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Fazio, P; Tropea, M; Marano, S				Fazio, Peppino; Tropea, Mauro; Marano, Salvatore			Node Re-Routing and Congestion Reduction Scheme for Wireless Vehicular Networks	WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						802.11p; Congestion; DSRC; Traffic flow; VANET; WAVE	AD HOC NETWORKS; ROUTING PROTOCOL; GROUP MOTION; TIME	Recently, the interest of research is going to be focused on the emerging vehicular ad-hoc networks paradigm. In these networks, vehicles communicate with each other and have the possibility of exploiting a distributed approach, typical of ad-hoc networks, which allow mobile nodes (vehicles) to communicate with each other. Thanks to the different standards for this kind of network, such as DSRC, WAVE/IEEE802.11p, the researchers have the possibility of designing and developing new MAC and routing algorithms, trying to enhance the mobile users experience in the mobile environment. In this paper, the attention is focused on the optimization of traffic flowing in a vehicular environment with vehicle-2-roadside capability. The proposed idea exploits the information that is gathered by road-side units with the main aim of redirecting traffic flows (in terms of vehicles) to less congested roads, with an overall system optimization, also in terms of Carbon Dioxide emissions reduction.

An anisotropic continuum model for traffic assignment in mixed transportation networks	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Traffic assignment; Two-dimensional anisotropic continuum model; Finite element method; Urban traffic congestion	EQUILIBRIUM PROBLEM; ALGORITHMS	This work deals with a two-dimensional continuum model for the problem of congested traffic assignment in an urban transportation system consisting of a set of freeways superimposed over a dense street network. The formulation leads to a system of non-linear differential equations whose unknowns are given by the travel times from arbitrary points of the network to the corresponding destinations. The governing equations are appropriately solved by means of the Finite Element Method. Then, traffic flow on every link of the network can be obtained. Numerical examples are given in order to demonstrate the efficiency of the developed model. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Yang, HF; Dillon, TS; Chen, YPP				Yang, Hao-Fan; Dillon, Tharam S.; Chen, Yi-Ping Phoebe			Optimized Structure of the Traffic Flow Forecasting Model With a Deep Learning Approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS			English	Article						Deep learning; forecasting; neural network (NN) applications; stacked denoising autoencoders	NEURAL-NETWORK; PARALLEL FRAMEWORK; ARCHITECTURES; PREDICTION; ALGORITHM; VOLUME	Forecasting accuracy is an important issue for successful intelligent traffic management, especially in the domain of traffic efficiency and congestion reduction. The dawning of the big data era brings opportunities to greatly improve prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel model, stacked autoencoder Levenberg-Marquardt model, which is a type of deep architecture of neural network approach aiming to improve forecasting accuracy. The proposed model is designed using the Taguchi method to develop an optimized structure and to learn traffic flow features through layer-by-layer feature granulation with a greedy layerwise unsupervised learning algorithm. It is applied to real-world data collected from the M6 freeway in the U.K. and is compared with three existing traffic predictors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an optimized structure of the traffic flow forecasting model with a deep learning approach is presented. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed model with an optimized structure has superior performance in traffic flow forecasting.

The MPC controller was designed based on an extended discrete first-order model with a triangular fundamental diagram. In our previous work, the extended discrete first-order model was designed to reproduce the capacity drop and the propagation of jam waves, and it was validated with reasonable accuracy without the presence of VSLs. As VSLs influence traffic dynamics, the dynamics including VSLs needs to be validated, before it can be applied as a prediction model in MPC. For conceptual illustrations, we use two synthetic examples to show how the model reproduces the key mechanisms of VSLs that are applied by existing VSL control approaches. Furthermore, the model is calibrated by use of real traffic data from Dutch freeway A12, where the field test of a speed limit control algorithm (SPECIALIST) was conducted. In the calibration, the original model is extended by using a quadrangular fundamental diagram which keeps the linear feature of the model and represents traffic states at the under-critical branch more accurately. The resulting model is validated using various traffic data sets. The accuracy of the model is compared with a second-order traffic flow model. The performance of two models is comparable: both models reproduce accurate results matching with real data. Flow errors of the calibration and validation are around 10%. The extended discrete first-order model-based MPC controller has been demonstrated to resolve freeway jam waves efficiently by synthetic cases.

Assuming a homogeneously loaded vehicle network and the existence of a well-posed Network Fundamental Diagram (NFD), we describe a protected network throughout its aggregated dynamics including nonlinear exit flow characteristics. Within this framework of constrained optimal boundary flow gating, two main performance metrics are considered: (a) first, connected to the NFD, the concept of average network travel time and delay as a performance metric is defined; (b) second, at boundaries, we take into account additional external network queue dynamics governed by uncontrolled inflow demands. External queue capacities in terms of finite-link lengths are used as the second performance metric. Hence, the corresponding performance requirement is an upper bound of external queues. While external queues represent vehicles waiting to enter the protected network, internal queue describes the protected network's aggregated behavior. By controlling the number of vehicles joining the internal queue from the external ones, herewith a network traffic flow maximization solution subject to the internal and external dynamics and their performance constraints is developed. The originally non-convex optimization problem is transformed to a numerically efficiently convex one by relaxing the performance constraints into time-dependent state boundaries. The control solution can be interpreted as a mechanism which transforms the unknown arrival process governing the number of vehicles entering the network to a regulated process, such that prescribed performance requirements on travel time in the network and upper bound on the external queue are satisfied. Comparative numerical simulation studies on a microscopic traffic simulator are carried out to show the benefits of the proposed method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Such a system aims to configure and regulate vehicular mobility patterns to enhance in-road transportation safety and efficiency. To effectively function, the autonomous system must enable high-rate communications and rapid dissemination of vehicle-to-vehicle messaging flows. Instead of applying classical mobility models to capture human driver behaviors, the use of autonomously controlled driverless vehicles brings up another design dimensionality: the regulation and shaping of vehicular flows. The induced joint impact of the vehicular flow process on the message communications networking system, on the vehicular throughput rate, and on on-ramp waiting times for highway systems, has not been addressed by the existing studies. In this paper, we investigate the integrated design of these aspects. We synthesize and study methods that are used to optimally group autonomously controlled vehicles to travel along a highway in platoons. Vehicular formations are structured to yield effective autonomous mobility operation and to realize high-performance multihop dissemination of multiclass messaging flows. We then investigate an on-ramp traffic flow control mechanism that serves to regulate the admission of vehicles into the highway. We characterize the tradeoffs available to the system's designer in attaining high message communication throughput rates, accounting for time delays experienced by onramp waiting vehicles, while also striving to enhance the highway's capacity for accommodating high vehicular flow rate levels.

J	Liu, WR; Qin, GR; He, Y; Jiang, F				Liu, Weirong; Qin, Gaorong; He, Yun; Jiang, Fei			Distributed Cooperative Reinforcement Learning-Based Traffic Signal Control That Integrates V2X Networks' Dynamic Clustering	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Cooperative reinforcement learning; dynamic clustering algorithm; function approximation; traffic signal control; V2X networks	SYSTEM; SCHEME; TIME	With the acceleration of urbanization in the world, urban traffic congestion has become an urgent challenge in most cities. Adaptive traffic signal control is the most approved control method to solve the problem, and accurate real-time traffic information is critical to this solution. This paper presents distributed cooperative reinforcement learning-based traffic control that integrates V2X networks' dynamic clustering algorithm. To obtain traffic flow information accurately and instantaneously, it is important to improve the cluster stability in V2X networks. A dynamic clustering algorithm is proposed based on the enhanced affinity propagation. The proposed clustering algorithm introduces the initial cluster partition to maintain a proper cluster size and adds the lane and destination factors to improve the cluster's stability. The algorithm can provide efficient and accurate traffic state information to traffic signal controls. By integrating the clustering algorithm, a cooperative reinforcement learning control scheme is proposed to balance the traffic load. To address the tough dimensionality curse of reinforcement learning, a distributed mechanism for intersection cooperation is introduced, and a fast gradient-descent function approximation method is proposed to improve the controls' real-time performance. The proposed intelligent traffic control scheme that integrates the stable clustering algorithm can effectively improve the traffic throughput, reduce the average waiting time, and avoid congestion. Numerical simulations on real scenarios validate the performance of the proposed approach.

Many previous works on collision avoidance have only focused on the case for two consecutive vehicles using on-board sensors, which ignored the influence on upstream traffic flow. This paper proposes a novel coordinated collision avoidance (CCA) strategy for connected vehicles, which has potential to avoid collision and smooth the braking behaviors of multiple vehicles, leading to an improvement of traffic smoothness. Specifically, model predictive control (MPC) framework is used to formulate the CCA into an optimization problem, where the objective is to minimize the total relative kinetic energy density (RKED) among connected vehicles. Monte Carlo simulations are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed CCA strategy by comparison with other two strategies. Among all the three control strategies, the RKED based control strategy shows the best performance of collision avoidance, including the best crash prevention rates (99.2 % on dry asphalt road and 90.5 % on wet asphalt road) and the best control of distance headways between vehicles.

It is assumed that the system nonlinear functions and input gains are unknown for controller design. An adaptive fuzzy-neural network controller and an adaptive robust controller are applied to compensate for the unknown system nonlinearities and input gains, respectively. Moreover, to deal with the disturbances from random bounded off-ramp traffic volumes, a dead-zone like auxiliary error with a time-varying boundary layer is introduced as a bounding parameter. This proposed auxiliary error is also utilized to construct the adaptive laws without using the bound of the input gain. The traffic density tracking error is shown to converge along the axis of learning iteration to a residual set whose level of magnitude depends on the width of boundary layer. Besides, since the nice desired traffic densities designed for the coordinated control objective of the AILC for freeway traffic flow systems are generally unknown, the improved bacterial forging optimization (IBFO) algorithm is used to optimize the fitness function, which is constructed by the coordinated control objective including (1) minimum total travel time, (2) minimum on-ramp average waiting time, and (3) minimum changes of desired traffic densities. Finally, a computer simulation example is used to verify the learning performance of the proposed fuzzy-neural AILC for freeway traffic flow systems using IBFO-based desired traffic densities planning.

J	Alam, A; Hatzopoulou, M				Alam, Ahsan; Hatzopoulou, Marianne			Modeling Transit Bus Emissions Using MOVES: Comparison of Default Distributions and Embedded Drive Cycles with Local Data	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING PART A-SYSTEMS			English	Article						Transit bus; Emissions; Motor vehicle emission simulator (MOVES); Operating mode (opmode) distribution; Articulated bus; Global positioning system (GPS)	ALTERNATIVE FUELS	This study focuses on the comparison of operating mode distributions and other assumptions used in the estimation of transit bus emissions with the motor vehicle emission simulator (MOVES). The study area is the city of Montreal, Canada, where a single transit provider operates bus service along 220 routes. For this purpose, instantaneous speeds and passenger ridership data were collected onboard a total of 96 buses during the summer and fall of 2013. The data collection campaign covered eight bus routes in Montreal. The selected routes serve a range of corridor types capturing a variability in land use, road geometry, traffic flow, bus type, and transit service. Ultimately, the authors analyzed data from 3,702 road segments amounting to approximately 975.5 km (606 mi) with bus service. Significant differences between locally derived operating mode distributions and MOVES2014 default distributions were observed. The MOVES distributions assume a significantly larger portion of idling than that obtained from local data. The authors also investigated the drive cycle characteristics of different bus types and observed differences between standard and articulated buses, which are currently unaccounted for by MOVES. The findings illustrate the importance of collecting local bus data when estimating transit emissions. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Wider bicycle lanes can encourage users of electric bicycles (e-bikes) to ride within the lane by providing the necessary riding space, which will improve the safety and efficiency of overall multi-level heterogeneous traffic flow. An empirical cross-section design was obtained based on field observations of the riding characteristics of e-bike users at four road sections in Xi'an, China. Vehicle widths, the gaps between vehicles and additional security gaps were considered in order to optimise the design of the cross-section. The results indicate that users of e-bikes within heterogeneous traffic flow need more lateral space for safe riding. The cross-section of bicycle lanes should allow the completion of overtaking manoeuvres, and the results suggest the cross-section needs to be wider than 3 m and no less than 2.6 m. The recommendations of cross-sections with different physical separations were carefully calibrated in order to meet riding requirements. The findings of this study provide reference material for the design of bicycle lanes with consideration of e-bikes.

Locating alternative-fuel refueling stations on a multi-class vehicle transportation network	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Location; Refueling infrastructure; Transportation networks; Multi-class alternative fuel vehicles; 0-1 linear programming model	MODEL	The existing literature regarding the location of alternative fuel (AF) refueling stations in transportation networks generally assumes that all vehicles are capable of traveling the same driving range and have similar levels of fuel in their tanks at the moment they enter the network and when they exit it. In this article, we relax these assumptions and introduce a multi-class vehicle transportation network in which vehicles have different driving ranges and fuel tank levels at their origins and destinations. A 0-1 linear programming model is proposed for locating a given number of refueling stations that maximize the total traffic flow covered (in round trips per time unit) by the stations on the network. Through numerical experiments with the 2011 medium-and heavy-duty truck traffic data in the Pennsylvania Turnpike, we identify the optimal sets of refueling stations for AF trucks on a multi-class vehicle transportation network.

But their role in mixed traffic flow and their effects on cars have become important problems for transportation designers. Mixed traffic flow simulation model provides the designers an effective tool to acquire the relation between flow and density in a new design scheme, achieve solutions for optimal design features before implementation, and help to make the design more rational. Based on the electric bike-car mixed flow characteristics and social force model, this article proposes a microscopic model which can represent the behavior of electric bike-car mixed flow in road segment. First, the inner and outer forces determining the movement mechanism of electric bikes and cars were analyzed, respectively; second, we developed a modified social force model to describe the electric bikes and cars behaviors; third, the social force model was modified and extended for mixed traffic flow by considering the interactions between electric bikes and cars, lane-changing behavior, and conflict avoidance behavior. The interaction parameters of the social force-based model for electric bike-car mixed flow are estimated using empirical data. The established microscopic model can be used to estimate critical flow of separating vehicle and electric bike and determine proper electric bike lane width according to different electric bike requirements by simulating.

Plugins for violations of speeding, slow driving, and abrupt stopping were developed using Aimsun's API and SDK module. A safety analysis plugin for investigating probability of rear- end collisions was developed, and a method for analyzing collision risk is proposed. A Fuzzy C-mean Clustering algorithm was developed to identify high risk states in different road segments over time. Results of a simulation experiment based on the G15 Expressway in Shanghai showed that abrupt stopping had the greatest impact on increasing collision risk, and the impact of violations increased with traffic volume. The methodology allows for the evaluation and monitoring of risks, alerting of road hazards, and identification of hotspots, and could be applied to the operations of existing facilities or planning of future ones.

OPERATION OF 2+1 ROAD WITH HIGH SHARES OF HEAVY VEHICLES	ARCHIVES OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						2+1 road; passing; overtaking; traffic performance; traffic flow; microsimulation model; travel speed; heavy vehicles		The author investigated traffic flow quality on a new 2+1 long road bypass with an exceptionally high share of heavy vehicles in order to assess rational limits of heavy vehicle shares in traffic flow, dependent on the length of the 2+1 road and the number of passing segments in each direction. This paper presents the results of traffic flow quality analyses through the use of empirical and simulation methods for a single 2+1 road segment with additional passing lanes, as well as for the study of the entire section of the bypass - 2+1 road. Variables include analysis of travel speed distribution, platoon traffic, and amount of passing maneuvers. Results show that large passing demands lead to very high speeds (over 100 km/h) on segments with additional passing lanes. The conclusions include remarks related to the use and operation of 2+1 cross-sections with high shares of heavy vehicles.

Firstly, by using the well-known cell transmission model (CTM), the urban freeway network is modeled in the way of distributed systems. Secondly, based on the model, a decentralized observer is designed. With the help of the Lyapunov function and S-procedure theory, the observer gains are computed by using linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. So, the traffic densities of the whole road network can be estimated by the designed observer. Finally, this method is applied to the outer ring of the Beijing's second ring road and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach.

J	Roh, CG; Park, BJ; Kim, J				Roh, Chang-Gyun; Park, Bum-Jin; Kim, Jonghoon			Impact of Heavy Vehicles on Highway Traffic Flows: Case Study in the Seoul Metropolitan Area	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING PART A-SYSTEMS			English	Article						Heavy vehicles (HVs); Influence; Passenger car equivalents (PCEs); Highway	PASSENGER CAR EQUIVALENTS	Highway capacity manuals (HCM) have incorporated the effect of heavy vehicles (HVs) in the form of passenger car equivalents (PCEs) for estimating highway traffic conditions, which include the road's slopes, the length of the road, the geographical characteristics, and the ratio of HVs to other types of vehicles on the road. The PCEs of HVs are critical for designing, operating, and evaluating highways. In order to analyze the effects of HVs on highway traffic flow, the real-time automatic vehicle classification (AVC) data were collected for three different major highways (four-lane, six-lane, and eight-lane highways, respectively) in the Seoul metropolitan area for the 2 months from August to September 2011. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of HVs on traffic flows using real-time AVC data and to analyze the relationship among the average speed, the HV ratio, the flow rate, and the number of lanes. The findings revealed that the average speed decreased when the flow rate and HV ratio increased for the six-lane and the eight-lane highways. The average speed also decreased as the flow rate increased for the four-lane highway. However, the average speed stabilized when the HV ratio was in the range of 25-45% and recovered when the HV ratio exceeded 45%; this result implied a need to reexamine the existing methods of deriving the HV factors for the HCM.

J	Pandey, G; Rao, KR; Mohan, D				Pandey, Gaurav; Rao, K. Ramachandra; Mohan, Dinesh			Modelling vehicular interactions for heterogeneous traffic flow using cellular automata with position preference	JOURNAL OF MODERN TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						Cellular automata; Vehicular interaction rate; Position preference; Traffic flow modelling; Videographic survey	SIMULATION-MODEL; VEHICLES; RISK	This paper proposes and validates a modified cellular automata model for determining interaction rate (i.e. number of car-following/overtaking instances) using traffic flow data measured in the field. The proposed model considers lateral position preference by each vehicle type and introduces a position preference parameter beta in the model which facilitates gradual drifting towards preferred position on road, even if the gap in front is sufficient. Additionally, the model also improves upon the conventional model by calculating safe front and back gap dynamically based on speed and deceleration properties of leader and follower vehicles. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the effect of beta on vehicular interactions and the model was calibrated and validated using interaction rates observed in the field. Paired tests were conducted to determine the validity of the model in determining interaction rates. Results of the simulations show that there is a parabolic relationship between area occupancy and interaction rate of different vehicle types. The model performed satisfactorily as the simulated interaction rate between different vehicle types were found to be statistically similar to those observed in field. Also, as expected, the interaction rate between light motor vehicles (LMVs) and heavy motor vehicles (HMVs) were found to be higher than that between LMVs and three wheelers because LMVs and HMVs share the same lane. This could not be done using conventional CA models as lateral movement rules were dictated by only speeds and gaps. So, in conventional models, the vehicles would end up in positions which are not realistic. The position preference parameter introduced in this model motivates vehicles to stay in their preferred positions. This study demonstrates the use of interaction rate as a measure to validate microscopic traffic flow models.	[Pandey, Gaurav; Rao, K.

J	Yun, MP; Zhao, J; Zhao, JZ; Weng, XY; Yang, XG				Yun, Meiping; Zhao, Jing; Zhao, Jianzhen; Weng, Xuyan; Yang, Xiaoguang			Impact of in-vehicle navigation information on lane-change behavior in urban expressway diverge segments	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Diverge segments; In-vehicle navigation; Lane-changing behavior; Driving simulator	SIMULATOR EVALUATION; INJURY SEVERITY; DRIVERS; INTERSECTIONS; DECELERATION; PERFORMANCE; ROAD; AGE	Lane-changing behaviors frequently occur at upstream of the urban expressway off-ramp, which possibly cause bottleneck or accident. This paper studies how in-vehicle navigation information impacts lane-changing behavior at this urban expressway diverge segments with comparison to the traditional road signs by conducting a series of driving simulator experiments, in consideration of variation of the first provision time point and traffic flow density. Firstly, the driving simulator is validated by comparing data of lane-changing position and merging gap from both field survey and simulator. Then comparison study was performed for twelve scenarios which comprise four information provision design schemes under three different traffic flow density status. Lane changing characteristics are analyzed by selecting six indicators, which are lane-changing merging gap, lane changing position, lane change delay, lane-changing steering angle, lane-changing deceleration, and the safe distance of lane-changing. The results show that the impact of in-vehicle navigation information on lane changing behavior varies with traffic flow density and the time point of the first navigation information provided. The in-vehicle navigation information had significant positive impact on lane-changing safety under medium to high density condition. However, the effect is not significant under light density condition. Moreover, more improvement in operational safety and smooth could be gained when the in-vehicle navigation information is provided earlier within range of 2 km upstream of the exit gore.

Due to their high cost and a number of operational limitations, this study was to elaborate a new concept of traffic flow estimation based on data from acoustic sensors. The experimental study has been conducted on a roadside of Paris ring-road (peripherique boulevard) during 11.5 days. The obtained data has been processed with help of Support Vector Regression method. The performances of the proposed solution have been assessed against standard traffic flow measurements. Obtained result show that this approach is promising and has potential of usage as independent measurement system and as auxiliary unit for existing systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

These benefits are traditionally quantified by emission models, which in general account for vehicle speeds, traffic flows and emission coefficients. An alternative approach for approximating the environmental impact of traffic is developed. This approach finds the route that keeps the most balanced speed profile throughout the route, which contributes to fuel consumption reduction. The paper formulates an optimization problem that includes the described approach for the DNDP. The solution of the problem consists of projects that contribute the most to the generation of such "balanced speed routes". The paper illustrates the problem and the solution for a real-size network with a medium-size set of candidate projects.

J	Wang, JQ; Li, SW				Wang, Jianqiang; Li, Shiwei			Modeling and simulation of network traffic flow evolution based on incomplete information feedback strategies in the ATIS environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODELING SIMULATION AND SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING			English	Article						Traffic flow evolution; route-choice; road network; incomplete information; intelligent agent; simulation	ROUTE CHOICE; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS	Considering both the high complexity of urban traffic flow systems and the bounded rationality of travelers, providing traffic information to all travelers is an effective method to induce each individual to make a more rational route-choice decision. Within Advanced Traveler Information System (ATIS) working environment, temporal and spatial evolution processes of traffic flow in urban road networks are closely related to strategies of providing traffic information and contents of information. In view of the day-to-day route-choice situations, this study constructs original updating models of the cognitive travel time of travelers under four conditions, including not providing any route travel time, only providing the most rapid route travel time, only providing the most congested route travel time, and providing all the routes travel times. The disaggregate route-choice approach is adopted for simulation to reveal the relationship between the evolution process of network traffic flow and the strategy of providing traffic information. The simulation shows that providing traffic information to all travelers cannot improve the operational efficiency of road networks. It is noteworthy that an inappropriate information feedback strategy would lead to intense variation in various routes traffic flow. Compared with incomplete information feedback strategies, it is inefficient and superfluous to provide complete traffic information to all travelers.

The purpose of such a traffic model is to describe an obstruction in a road, such as a toll gate or a construction site. We consider here the concept of solutions introduced by Garavello and Goatin in 2011, which conserves the total number of cars flowing through the obstruction, but does not conserve the generalized momentum. We prove the existence of such solutions to the Cauchy problem by using the wavefront tracking method. We also compare our results with another concept of solutions introduced also by Garavello and Goatin in 2011 for the same model with a flux constraint. For this second formulation, Andreianov, Donadello, and Rosini had also proved the existence of solutions to the Cauchy problem.

We investigate the related influences on uniform traffic jam analytically and numerically. Based on control theory, the condition for no traffic jam is obtained analytically. Finally, simulations are carried out to verify the new traffic flow model. The theoretical and numerical results show that the related factors including the friction coefficient, radius of curvature, slope of the curved road and the parameter have major effects on the stability of traffic flow respectively.

The traffic dynamics is captured by an underlying kinematic wave model in Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. With traffic data collected through loop detectors and bus positioning devices, the control actions are carried out through adjusting signal timing plans according to short-term estimations of traffic flows and bus arrivals. We derive the optimality conditions of multi-objective control formulations and present an open loop solution algorithm. The proposed control system is applied to a test arterial developed based upon a real-world scenario in Central London, UK. It is found that the model is capable of regulating bus service reliability through utilising traffic signals while managing delays induced to surrounding traffic. The study generates new insights on managing bus service reliability in busy urban networks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Chow, Andy H.

A generic integrated feedback-based motorway traffic flow control concept is proposed in this paper. It is based on the combination and suitable extension of control algorithms and tools proposed or deployed in other studies, such as ramp metering or variable speed limit (VSL)-enabled cascade-feedback mainstream traffic flow control, and allows for consideration of multiple bottlenecks. The new controller enables coordination of ramp metering actions at a series of on-ramps, as well as integration with VSL control actions, toward a common control goal, which is bottleneck throughput maximization. While doing this, the approach considers a pre-specified (desired) balancing of the incurred delays upstream of the employed actuators, via a suitably designed knapsack problem. Despite the multitude of the offered configurations, options, and possibilities, the generic control algorithm remains simple, efficient, and suitable for field implementation. The control algorithm is demonstrated and evaluated using a validated macroscopic traffic flow model for a number of scenarios.

J	Mirge, V; Verma, K; Gupta, S				Mirge, Vaishali; Verma, Kesari; Gupta, Shubhrata			Dense traffic flow patterns mining in bi-directional road networks using density based trajectory clustering	ADVANCES IN DATA ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION			English	Article						Data mining; Traffic flow patterns mining; Trajectory patterns; Traffic control; Mobility mining	FUZZY; MODELS	Due to the rapid growth of wireless communications and positioning technologies, trajectory data have become increasingly popular, posing great challenges to the researchers of data mining and machine learning community. Trajectory data are obtained using GPS devices that capture the position of an object at specific time intervals. These enormous amounts of data necessitates to explore efficient and effective techniques to extract useful information to solve real world problems. Traffic flow pattern mining is one of the challenging issues for many applications. In a literature significant number of approaches are available to cluster the trajectory data, however the clustering has not been explored for trajectories pattern mining in bi-directional road networks. This paper presents a novel technique for excavating heavy traffic flow patterns in bi-directional road network, i.e. identifying divisions of the roads where the traffic flow is very dense. The proposed technique works in two phases: phase I, finds the clusters of trajectory points based on density of trajectory points; phase II, arranges the clusters in sequence based on spatiotemporal values for each route and directions. These sequences represent the traffic flow patterns. All the routes and sections exceeding a user specified minimum traffic threshold are marked as high dense traffic areas. The experiments are performed on synthetic dataset. The proposed algorithm efficiently and accurately finds the dense traffic in bi-directional roads. Proposed clustering method is compared with the standard k-means clustering algorithm for the performance evaluation.

J	Scarinci, R; Hegyi, A; Heydecker, B				Scarinci, Riccardo; Hegyi, Andreas; Heydecker, Benjamin			Definition of a merging assistant strategy using intelligent vehicles	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Intelligent Transport System (ITS); Active Traffic Management (ATM); Intelligent vehicle; Motorway merging; Ramp metering; Cooperative vehicle	ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; TRAFFIC-FLOW	In the area of active traffic management, new technologies provide opportunities to improve the use of current infrastructure. Vehicles equipped with in-car communication systems are capable of exchanging messages with the infrastructure and other vehicles. This new capability offers many opportunities for traffic management. This paper presents a novel merging assistant strategy that exploits the communication capabilities of intelligent vehicles. The proposed control requires the cooperation of equipped vehicles on the main carriageway in order to create merging gaps for on-ramp vehicles released by a traffic light. The aim is to reduce disruptions to the traffic flow created by the merging vehicles. This paper focuses on the analytical formulation of the control algorithm, and the traffic flow theories used to define the strategy. The dynamics of the gap formation derived from theoretical considerations are validated using a microscopic simulation. The validation indicates that the control strategy mostly developed from macroscopic theory well approximates microscopic traffic behaviour. The results present encouraging capabilities of the system. The size and frequency of the gaps created on the main carriageway, and the space and time required for their creation are compatible with a real deployment of the system. Finally, we summarise the results of a previous study showing that the proposed merging strategy reduces the occurrence of congestion and the number of late-merging vehicles. This innovative control strategy shows the potential of using intelligent vehicles for facilitating the merging manoeuvre through use of emerging communications technologies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Murca, MCR				Rocha Murca, Mayara Conde			A robust optimization approach for airport departure metering under uncertain taxi-out time predictions	AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Air traffic flow management; Air traffic control; Departure metering; Robust optimization	TRAFFIC FLOW MANAGEMENT; RUNWAY OPERATIONS	Airports are critical elements in the air transportation system in terms of traffic flow management. The high volume of operations along with the constraining airside capacity can exacerbate surface congestion and lead to increased flight delays and costs, especially during peak times. Surface traffic optimization is an alternative for alleviating congestion. However, the high level of uncertainty in actual operations can compromise the effectiveness of optimal policies. This paper presents a robust optimization approach for metering aircraft departures under uncertainty in the taxi-out process. A mixed integer linear programming model for runway sequencing and scheduling that incorporates uncertainty sets for the taxi-out time is proposed in order to dynamically determine an optimal and robust sequence and schedule of aircraft release from the gate. Actual operational data from Brasilia International Airport in Brazil is used to evaluate the effectiveness of departure metering at this airport. An assessment of benefits and trade-offs of introducing robustness is performed based on stochastic simulation of departure performance under different control strategies. The robust optimization approach shows positive impacts in protecting against uncertainty as it reduces runway delays and taxi-out times and increases takeoff time predictability.

Requiring only local information, distributed control schemes are scalable approaches to the coordination of multiple CAVs without using centralized communication and computation. From the perspective of multi-agent consensus control, this paper introduces a decomposition framework to model, analyze, and design the platoon system. In this framework, a platoon is naturally decomposed into four interrelated components, i.e., 1) node dynamics, 2) information flow network, 3) distributed controller, and 4) geometry formation. The classic model of each component is summarized according to the results of the literature survey; four main performance metrics, i.e., internal stability, stability margin, string stability, and coherence behavior, are discussed in the same fashion. Also, the basis of typical distributed control techniques is presented, including linear consensus control, distributed robust control, distributed sliding mode control, and distributed model predictive control.

With lane-specific measurements and lane-specific control, more measures are possible. Single frequency precise point positioning (PPP) is a newly developed and affordable technique to achieve an improved position accuracy compared with global positioning system (GPS) standalone positioning. GPS-PPP allows for sub-meter accurate positioning, in real time, of vehicles on a motorway. This paper tests this technique in real life; moreover, it presents a methodology to map the lanes on a motorway using data collected by this technique. The methodology exploits the high accuracy and the fact that the most driving is within a lane. In a field test, a GPS-PPP equipped vehicle drives a specific motorway stretch 100 times, for which the GPS-PPP trajectory data are collected. Using these data, the positions and the widths of different lanes are successfully estimated. Comparison with the ground truth shows a dm accuracy. With the parametrized lanes, vehicles can be tracked down to a lane with the GPS-PPP device.	[Knoop, Victor L.; de Bakker, Peter F.; Tiberius, Christian C. J.

Emerging cooperative technology offers an attractive alternative where only one road side unit per intersection is required, instead of several infrastructure sensors per lane. However, studies showed that traffic control with cooperative detection requires a penetration rate of at least 20% to function effectively. To show the potential of cooperative traffic control, this study presents three algorithms: (i) the SWARM control algorithm, which is designed to work with very low penetration rates; (ii) an extension to the adaptive control algorithm, ImFlow, which uses cooperative data for enhanced queue modelling; and (iii) an ImFlow extension to stabilise green planning to enable green light optimal speed advice. The results from micro-simulation show a 7.8% improvement for stops and delay time over traditional adaptive control for Swarm, and 14.9% for Cooperative ImFlow. Adding planning stabilisation reduced the average perceived change for end users from 9.0-2.3%, without performance loss for the overall traffic flow. This shows the large potential of cooperative traffic control.

J	Levin, MW				Levin, Michael W.			Congestion-aware system optimal route choice for shared autonomous vehicles	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Shared autonomous vehicles; Dynamic traffic assignment; Traffic flow; System optimal	A-RIDE PROBLEM; CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; TIME WINDOWS; HEURISTIC ALGORITHM; DELIVERY PROBLEM; KINEMATIC WAVES; TRANSPORTATION; HIGHWAY; PICKUP; NETWORKS	We study the shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) routing problem while considering congestion. SAVs essentially provide a dial-a-ride service to travelers, but the large number of vehicles involved (tens of thousands of SAVs to replace personal vehicles) results in SAV routing causing significant congestion. We combine the dial-a-ride service constraints with the linear program for system optimal dynamic traffic assignment, resulting in a congestion-aware formulation of the SAV routing problem. Traffic flow is modeled through the link transmission model, an approximate solution to the kinematic wave theory of traffic flow. SAVs interact with travelers at origins and destinations. Due to the large number of vehicles involved, we use a continuous approximation of flow to formulate a linear program. Optimal solutions demonstrate that peak hour demand is likely to have greater waiting and in-vehicle travel times than off-peak demand due to congestion. SAV travel times were only slightly greater than system optimal personal vehicle route choice. In addition, solutions can determine the optimal fleet size to minimize congestion or maximize service.

Traffic-related air pollutants in street canyons can adversely affect human health. In this study, an urban-scale traffic pollution dispersion model is developed considering street distribution, canyon geometry, background meteorology, traffic assignment, traffic emissions and air pollutant dispersion. In the model, vehicle exhausts generated from traffic flows first disperse inside street canyons along the micro-scale wind field generated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Then, pollutants leave the street canyon and further disperse over the urban area. On the basis of this model, the effects of canyon geometry on the distribution of NO,, and CO from traffic emissions were studied over the center of Beijing. We found that an increase in building height leads to heavier pollution inside canyons and lower pollution outside canyons at pedestrian level, resulting in higher domain-averaged concentrations over the area. In addition, canyons with highly even or highly uneven building heights on each side of the street tend to lower the urban-scale air pollution concentrations at pedestrian level. Further, increasing street widths tends to lead to lower pollutant concentrations by reducing emissions and enhancing ventilation simultaneously. Our results indicate that canyon geometry strongly influences human exposure to traffic pollutants in the populated urban area. Carefully planning street layout and canyon geometry while considering traffic demand as well as local weather patterns may significantly reduce inhalation of unhealthy air by urban residents.

J	Ma, DF; Luo, XQ; Wang, DH; Jin, S; Wang, FJ; Guo, WW				Ma, Dongfang; Luo, Xiaoqin; Wang, Dianhai; Jin, Sheng; Wang, Fujian; Guo, Weiwei			Lane-Based Saturation Degree Estimation at Signalized Intersections Using Travel Time Data	IEEE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MAGAZINE			English	Article							PREDICTION; SYSTEMS; NETWORKS; MODEL; TECHNOLOGY; ALGORITHM; PATTERNS	Saturation degree estimation is a vital problem of signal timing optimization. However, classic loop-detector-based algorithms are not capable to capture the severity of oversaturation, since detectors are located in front of stop lines, and also cannot distinguish the saturated degree in different lane groups if detectors are located at an upstream position. In this paper, we present a new method to estimate the lane-based saturation degree using travel times. The method is simple and mainly depends on the parameters of signal cycles and the corresponding virtual cycles. The virtual cycle parameters are extracted by analyzing the data on travel times using the K-mean cluster analysis. Then, two models for the traffic demand saturated degree (TDSD) and the effectively used green time saturation degree (EUGTSD) are presented based on the traffic flow conservation during one signal cycle and the corresponding virtual cycle. The new method can overcome the defects of loop-detector-based algorithms, and it can be used to optimize the TDSD and the EUGTSD simultaneously. Finally, the precision of the two types of models is evaluated using field survey data. The results show that the new method has a higher precision for the TDSD and the same accuracy level for the EUGTSD compared to the existing methods. The findings of this paper have potential applicability to signal control systems.

J	Machiani, SG; Jahangiri, A; Ahmadi, A				Machiani, Sahar Ghanipoor; Jahangiri, Arash; Ahmadi, Alidad			A Network-Wide Bilevel Optimization-Simulation Approach for Variable Speed Limit Systems to Improve Travel Time Reliability	ASCE-ASME JOURNAL OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY IN ENGINEERING SYSTEMS PART A-CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							GENETIC ALGORITHM; DESIGN	Traffic congestion is a serious challenge that urban transportation systems are facing. Variable speed limit (VSL) systems are one of the countermeasures to reduce traffic congestion and smooth traffic flow on roadways. The negative impacts of congestion, including road rage, air pollution, safety issues, and traffic delays, are well recognized. The impact of unexpected delays on road users is quantified through travel time reliability (TTR) measures. In this study, a bilevel optimization problem was introduced to determine location, speed limit reduction, start time, and duration of limited number of VSL signs while maximizing travel time reliability on selected critical paths on a network. The upper-level problem focuses on TTR optimization whereas the lower-level problem assigns traffic to the network using a dynamic traffic assignment simulation tool. A heuristic approach, simulated annealing, was used to solve the problem. The application of the methodology to a real roadway network is shown and results are discussed. The proposed methodology could assist traffic agencies in making proper decisions on how to allocate their limited resources to the network to maximize the benefits.

J	Li, SB; Cao, DN				Li, Shubin; Cao, Danni			Variable speed limit strategies' analysis with cell transmission model on freeway	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B			English	Article						Freeway; variable speed limit; cell transmission model; traffic control	DRIVERS BOUNDED RATIONALITY; TRAFFIC FLOW; TIME; BEHAVIOR; IMPACTS	Mainline freeway traffic flow control is one of the primary methods of traffic management, which can present the best network situation. In this paper, we integrate variable speed limit (VSL) strategy into the cell transmission model (CTM). Then the implementation of the integrated model on freeway traffic network is discussed. A novel optimal model of controlling freeway traffic flow is proposed for minimizing the total travelling time in the network. A solution algorithm is designed by using a simulation method. Considering the main purpose of the speed limit strategy is to control the mainstream flow, we compare the case where the VSL is used with the one without VSL. A simulation is implemented to show that the control strategy is efficient in describing system's dynamic performance and the dynamic speed limit strategy significantly alleviates congestion.

At single-lane roundabouts, the constraints to the vehicular trajectories imposed by the curvilinear geometric design and the driver's gap acceptance behaviour are expected to produce an impact of the heavy vehicles on the quality of traffic flow different from that produced on freeways and two-lane highways or other at-grade intersections. This is also because entering flow is opposed by the circulating flow which has priority and travels in an anticlockwise direction on a single-lane path around the central island. This paper addresses the question of how to estimate the passenger car equivalents for heavy vehicles on single-lane roundabouts. First, a comparison was performed between the empirical capacity functions based on a meta-analytic estimation of the critical and the follow up headways and the simulation outputs manually obtained for a single-lane roundabout built in Aimsun microscopic simulator. A genetic algorithm-based calibration procedure, therefore, was used to reach a better convergence between the simulation outputs and the empirical capacities. Based on the calibrated model, the passenger car equivalents were determined by comparing the capacity functions built for a fleet of passenger cars with the capacity functions calculated for different percentages of heavy vehicles. Differently from HCM 2010 which assumes a heavy vehicle to be equivalent to two passenger cars and sets as 2.0 the passenger car equivalents for heavy vehicles for roundabouts, a higher PCE effect would be expected on the quality of traffic conditions when the traffic stream contains a high number of heavy vehicles; this effect should be accounted for when calculating capacity and level-of-services.

J	Ma, MH; Liang, SD; Guo, H; Yang, JF				Ma, Minghui; Liang, Shidong; Guo, Hui; Yang, Jufen			Short-term traffic flow prediction using a self-adaptive two-dimensional forecasting method	ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Traffic flow prediction; parameter forecasting; self-adaptive forecasting; Kalman filtering	NEURAL-NETWORK; KALMAN FILTER; VOLUME; TIME	Short-term traffic volume forecasting is widely recognized as an important element of intelligent transportation systems, because the accuracy of predictive methods determines the performance of real-time traffic control and management to some extent. The goal of this article is to propose a two-dimensional prediction method using the Kalman filtering theory based on historical data. In the first dimension, using Kalman filtering, we predict the values of traffic flows based on data from the current day and historical data separately. The two predicted values are fused using an equation with weight coefficients where the weight coefficients can be generated in real time in the process of prediction. Accordingly, in the second dimension, using Kalman filtering again, we obtain the predicted value of weight coefficients. In addition, some extreme cases during the process of weight coefficient prediction are discussed, and solutions are proposed as well. The accuracy of the two-dimensional forecasting method is studied based on a set of performance criteria. Comparison of the results of different methods based on field test data of road networks shows that the proposed method outperforms the standard Kalman filtering method, and more accurate traffic flow prediction is obtained using the framework incorporating Fusion method 3 proposed in this article.

Performance Evaluation of Urban Links under Heterogeneous Traffic Condition	EUROPEAN TRANSPORT-TRASPORTI EUROPEI			English	Article						Delay; Planning time index; Congestion index; Travel time index; Regression model		Performance evaluation of roadway provides an information regarding quality of facilities and it reflects the satisfaction of the road users. Travel time based performance evaluation accounts the road user perception and traffic managers alike, provides information for the smooth flow on the roadway. The performance of vehicles under heterogeneous traffic condition is more complex compared to homogeneous traffic conditions. The present study aims to evaluate the performance of urban link under heterogeneous traffic conditions considering travel time based indices. Delay, planning time index, congestion index, and travel time index are the travel time based indices used for the performance evaluation of the urban link. Seven single carriage ways operating one way is selected as the study area. The data on roadway geometrics, traffic volume count and travel time on the selected urban links forms the data base for this study. Statistical analyses were carried out for the performance evaluation of urban link using travel time based indices. Models were developed and validated for the performance evaluation of the urban link by using the travel time based indices with variation in the characteristics of traffic flow rate. The research concludes that travel time based performance indices shows an exponential growth with traffic flow rate. The model developed in this study can be used to define the performance evaluation of urban link and the prior information about the performance indicators helps the road users to plan their trip well in advance.

CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW MODEL; CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; INTERRUPTION PROBABILITY; MERGE CONTROL; INTERSECTIONS; BEHAVIOR; FREEWAY; SIMULATIONS; INFORMATION	By the cellular automaton (CA) model, traffic behaviors of an intelligent two-route system with a work zone are studied. In the model, the two-route system consists of a double-lane (DL) and a single-lane (SL). Supposing a work zone exists on DL, a big traffic jam will be formed. For improving the system traffic flow, an intelligent vehicle (IV) which can change driving strategy on the basis of received real-time information has been introduced into the model. The simulation results indicate that the traffic condition can be improved and the area of the traffic jam can be reduced effectively if there are enough IVs. Moreover, if all of the vehicles are IVs, the traffic jam may disappear, and the system will be in free flow state.

The collected information provides insights into solving critical problems related to transportation planning, implementing safety countermeasures, and managing traffic flow efficiently. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) employs automated tools to collect traffic information from traffic video data. One of the important factors that influence cyclists safety is their counts. In comparison to other road users, such as cars and pedestrians, the automated cyclist data collection is relatively a new research area. In this work, we develop a vision-based method for gathering cyclist count data at intersections and road segments. We implement a robust cyclist detection method based on a combination of classification features. We implement a multi-object tracking method based on the Kernelized Correlation Filters (KCF) in cooperation with the bipartite graph matching algorithm to track multiple cyclists. Then, a trajectory rebuilding method and a trajectory comparison model are applied to refine the accuracy of tracking and counting. The proposed method is the first cyclist counting method, that has the ability to count cyclists under different movement patterns. The trajectory data obtained can be further utilized for cyclist behavioral modeling and safety analysis.

J	Oviedo-Trespalacios, O; Scott-Parker, B				Oviedo-Trespalacios, Oscar; Scott-Parker, Bridie			Footbridge usage in high-traffic flow highways: The intersection of safety and security in pedestrian decision-making	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						Overpass; Habit; Crossing; Colombia; Vulnerable road users; Human-infrastructure integration	ROAD CROSSING BEHAVIOR; INTENTIONS; SELF; PERCEPTIONS; VIOLATIONS; ATTITUDES; COLOMBIA; DRIVER; WALK; HOT	In the Decade of Action for Road Safety, the vulnerability of pedestrians to severe outcomes from road crash is well-recognised. This study explored the factors that are influential in pedestrians' decisions to cross a high-traffic highway in Barranquilla, Colombia, by using a footbridge over the highway, or by cutting across the highway in close proximity to a footbridge. Participants were recruited at each crossing (n = 105 footbridge, n = 105 ground; n = 117 males; M(SD) age = 23.28(5.98) years) and completed a paper survey exploring demographics, highway crossing behaviour, and attitudes regarding the safety and security of the crossing. Despite the majority of participants reporting the ground crossing was dangerous, and that the footbridge crossing was safe, one third of participants never or rarely (approximately 0% and 25% of the time) used the footbridge to cross the highway. Logistic regression revealed that the decision regarding the highway crossing mode (footbridge or ground) was predicted by (a) the frequency in which the footbridge is crossed, (b) the perception of footbridge security in relation to crime, (c) the perception of footbridge safety about traffic conflicts in general, (d) the proximity of the footbridge to the highway ground crossing, and (e) if the subject had experienced an injury during a previous highway crossing. The findings extend our understanding of pedestrian behaviour in crossing highways, not only in relation to the use of footbridges which separate both road user groups, but also ground crossings which place the pedestrians at significant risk especially those in areas with high traffic flow density. Moreover, the findings highlight the complexity involved in improving pedestrian road safety, particularly as the provision of an engineering solution (a footbridge) in close proximity to a high-risk zone (highway) is clearly not the only solution in the much larger road safety system.

The methodology combines ideas from transient aggregation-disaggregation techniques as well as transient network decomposition methods. The complexity of the proposed method is linear in the number of queues and is independent of the space capacities of the individual queues. This makes it a suitable approach for the analysis of large-scale networks. The transient joint distributions are validated versus simulation estimates. The model is then used to describe urban traffic dynamics and to address a dynamic traffic signal control problem. The signal plan analysis shows the added value of using joint distributional information, and more generally spatial-temporal between-link dependency information, to enhance urban traffic operations.

J	Yuan, K; Knoop, VL; Hoogendoorn, SP				Yuan, Kai; Knoop, Victor L.; Hoogendoorn, Serge P.			A Microscopic Investigation Into the Capacity Drop: Impacts of Longitudinal Behavior on the Queue Discharge Rate	TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						capacity drop; bounded acceleration; reaction time; analytical modeling	CAR-FOLLOWING THEORY; TRAFFIC FLOW MODEL; FREEWAY BOTTLENECKS; KINEMATIC WAVES; FEATURES; MERGES; OSCILLATIONS; RAMP	The capacity drop indicates that the queue discharge rate is lower than the free-flow capacity. Studies show that the queue discharge rate varies under different traffic conditions. Empirical data show that the queue discharge rate increases as the speed in congestion increases. Insights into the underlying behavioral mechanisms that cause these variable queue discharge rates can help minimize traffic delays and eliminate congestion. However, to our knowledge, few efforts have been devoted to testing impacts of traffic behaviors on the queue discharge rate. This paper tries to fill this gap. We investigate to what extent the acceleration spread and reaction time can influence the queue discharge rate. It is found that the (interdriver) acceleration spread does not reduce the queue discharge rates as much as found empirically. Modeling reaction time might be more important than modeling acceleration for capacity drop in car-following models. A speed-dependent reaction time mechanism for giving variable queue discharge rates is proposed. That is, decreasing reaction time as the speed in congestion increases can give the same queue discharge rate as found empirically. This research suggests that motivating drivers to speed up earlier could increase the queue discharge rate and thereby minimize delays.

J	Zheng, FF; van Zuylen, H; Liu, XB				Zheng, Fangfang; van Zuylen, Henk; Liu, Xiaobo			A Methodological Framework of Travel Time Distribution Estimation for Urban Signalized Arterial Roads	TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						urban traffic; travel time distribution; stochastic traffic processes; fixed-time control	NEURAL-NETWORKS; PREDICTION	Urban travel times are rather variable as a result of a lot of stochastic factors both in traffic flows, signals, and other conditions on the infrastructure. However, the most common way both in literature and practice is to estimate or predict only expected travel times, not travel time distributions. By doing so, it fails to provide full insight into the travel time dynamics and variability on urban roads. Another limitation of this common approach is that the effect of traffic measures on travel time reliability cannot be evaluated. In this paper, an analytical travel time distribution model is presented especially for urban roads with fixed-time controlled intersections by investigating the underlying mechanisms of urban travel times. Different from mean travel time models or deterministic travel time models, the proposed model takes stochastic properties of traffic flow, stochastic arrivals and departures at intersections, and traffic signal coordination between adjacent intersections into account, and therefore, is able to capture the delay dynamics and uncertainty at intersections. The queue spillback phenomenon is explicitly taken into account by applying shockwave theory in a probabilistic way. The proposed model was further validated with both VISSIM simulation data and field GPS data collected in a Chinese city. The results demonstrate that the travel time distributions derived from the analytical model can well represent those from VISSIM simulation. The comparison with field GPS data shows that the model estimated link and trip travel time distributions can also represent the field travel time distributions, though a small discrepancy can be observed in both middle range travel times and higher travel times.

A reactive dynamic user equilibrium model is extended to simulate network equilibrium problems for an urban area with multiple central business districts (CBDs). Each copy of traffic flow reactively makes route choice decisions to minimize the total travel cost from origin to destination, based on instantaneous traffic information from a radio broadcasting service or route guidance system. The elastic demand function for each copy of flow is associated with its total instantaneous travel cost. The model is solved by a cell-centered finite volume method for conservation lawequations and a fast sweeping method for Eikonal-type equations on unstructured grids. Numerical experiments for an urban traffic network with two CBDs are presented to verify the rationality of the model and the validity of the numerical method. The numerical results indicate that the model captures some macroscopic characteristics of two copies of flow interacting in time-varying urban transportation systems, e.g., the spatial distributions of the flow density and flux and the path choice behavior in response to elastic demand, and can describe traffic equilibrium phenomena, such as self-organization and traffic congestion build-up and dissipation.

However, compared with vast amounts of works on vehicle flow and pedestrian flow, the bicycle flow study currently lags behind. We have carried out experimental studies on bicycle flow on a 146 meters long circular road and on an on-ramp system. We present the fundamental diagram of bicycle flow and the trajectories of each bicycle on the circular road. We have analyzed the spatiotemporal evolution of bicycle flow and found that jams spontaneously form above a critical density of approximately 0.37 bicycles/m. For the on-ramp system, no capacity drop has been observed. The similarity and difference between bicycle flow and vehicle flow has been discussed. We propose a cellular automaton model of bicycle flow, and the simulation results are in agreement with the experiments.

Analysis of Traffic Statics and Dynamics in Signalized Networks: A Poincare Map Approach	TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						signalized double-ring network; signalized grid network; link queue model; switched affine system; Poincare map; stationary state; stability; macroscopic fundamental diagram; gridlock state; secant method	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; STABILITY	An understanding of traffic statics and dynamics is critical for developing effective and efficient control strategies for a signalized road network with turning movements, especially under oversaturated conditions. In this study, we first describe traffic dynamics in a signalized double-ring network with the link queue model, which is a space-continuous approximation of the network kinematic wave model, and rewrite it as a switched affine system, assuming a triangular traffic flow fundamental diagram. Then we define periodic density evolution orbits as stationary states in the network and introduce a Poincare map in densities, whose fixed points correspond to stationary states. With short cycle lengths and identical green times and retaining ratios in both rings, we are able to derive the closed form of the Poincare map, from which we can analytically solve stationary states and study their stability properties; it is found that a stationary state can be asymptotically stable, Lyapunov stable, or unstable. By defining the network flow-density relation in stationary states as the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD), we analytically derive an approximate closed-form formula for MFD with green ratios and retaining ratios as parameters. We confirm that in stationary states the network flow rate may not be uniquely defined, and the network can reach a gridlock state at relatively low densities. We also analyze the convergence patterns to asymptotically stable gridlock states with different retaining ratios and initial densities. With more general signal settings and retaining ratios, we develop a secant method to numerically solve the fixed points of the Poincare maps and plot the corresponding MFDs. Furthermore, numerical simulations are used to study traffic statics in a homogeneous signalized grid network; simulation results reveal a high level of similarity in traffic patterns between the signalized double-ring and grid networks and validate analytical insights obtained from the former. This study provides a springboard for future analytical and numerical studies on traffic statics and dynamics in more general signalized road networks.

As the traffic light at an upstream intersection change from red to green, the dispersive characteristics of these vehicles moving from upstream to the downstream were analyzed by assuming velocities of two platoon following a normal distribution pattern. The model aims at analyzing relationship between traffic flow, distance between adjacent intersections, and signaling time in order to achieve arterial green-wave synchronous coordination in both the bus and non-bus lanes. To facilitate coordination in a traffic signal control system, the number of vehicles forced to stop at the head of the platoon as well as the number of vehicles trapped at the tail of the platoon were determined and presented in a tabular form for use in the proposed traffic light coordination model. Finally, a numeric computation for the coordination of successive signals is presented to illustrate the validity of the proposed model.

Real-Time Traffic Flow Management Based on Inter-Object Communication: a Case Study at Intersection	MOBILE NETWORKS & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Internet of things; Connected vehicles; Process synchronization; Intelligent transportation systems; Real-time processing; Intersection management	PROTOCOLS; MODEL	Intersections become very congested when traffic volumes are high, creating inefficiency that results in user delay and frustration. There have been many approaches which focus on optimization signal of Traffic Light System and Vehicle Trajectory Analysis to improve traffic flow at intersection. However, to implement those approaches into reality become a challenges since real-time problem. In this study, inspired by recent advanced vehicle technologies, we propose an approach for traffic flow management at intersection. In particular, with the exploding at an enormous rate of Internet of Things (IoT), the connected object has been the most visible and familiar application. By this way, based on connected object, we design a model which communicating among objects to improve traffic flow at intersection with real time problem. Moreover, traffic congestion is also taken into consideration in case of high traffic volume. The simulation shows the potential results comparing with the existing traffic management system.

Speed-flow relationships for motorised vehicles have been widely studied, but those for heterogeneous bicycle flow have yet to be examined. This research thus aimed to develop speed-flow relationships for heterogeneous bicycle traffic flow, incorporating the factors of bicycle type and characteristics of cyclists such as percentages of electric bicycles (EBs), male cyclists, elderly cyclists and cyclists carrying loads. On the basis of field bicycle traffic data from 11 cycleway sections, three speed-flow relationships for different numbers of cycleway lanes were developed. The three models were further validated and used to examine the effects of bicycle type and characteristics of cyclists on the speed-flow relationships for bicycle traffic. The results showed that bicycle speed increases with the percentage of EBs on the cycleway, while the proportion of elderly cyclists has no significant effect on bicycle speed. Cyclists carrying loads and male cyclists have negative impacts on bicycle speed for a narrow width of cycleway. The findings of this study provide some countermeasures for bicycle planning and management.

Air traffic flow management under uncertainty using chance-constrained optimization	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Air traffic flow management; Chance-constrained optimization; Bernstein polynomial	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; GROUND-HOLDING PROBLEM	In order to efficiently balance traffic demand and capacity, optimization of Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) relies on accurate predictions of future capacity states. However, these predictions are inherently uncertain due to factors, such as weather. This paper presents a novel computationally efficient algorithm to address uncertainty in ATFM by using a chance-constrained optimization method. First, a chance-constrained model is developed based on a previous deterministic Integer Programming optimization model of ATFM to include probabilistic sector capacity constraints. Then, to efficiently solve such a large-scale chance-constrained optimization problem, a polynomial approximation-based approach is applied. The approximation is based on the numerical properties of the Bernstein polynomial, which is capable of effectively controlling the approximation error for both the function value and gradient. Thus, a first-order algorithm is adopted to obtain a satisfactory solution, which is expected to be optimal. Numerical results are reported in order to evaluate the polynomial approximation-based approach by comparing it with the brute-force method. Moreover, since there are massive independent approximation processes in the polynomial approximation-based approach, a distributed computing framework is designed to carry out the computation for this method. This chance-constrained optimization method and its computation platform are potentially helpful in their application to several other domains in air transportation, such as airport surface operations and airline management under uncertainties.

The generalized statistical traffic assignment (GESTA) model has a clear multi-level variance structure. Flow variance is analytically decomposed into three sources, O-D demands, route choices and measurement errors. Consequently, optimal decisions on roadway design, maintenance, operations and planning can be made using estimated probability distributions of link/path flow and system performance. The statistical equilibrium in GESTA is mathematically defined. Its multi-level statistical structure well fits large-scale data mining techniques. The embedded route choice model is consistent with the settings of O-D demands considering link costs that vary from day to day. We propose a Method of Successive Averages (MSA) based solution algorithm to solve for GESTA. Its convergence and computational complexity are analyzed. Three example networks including a large-scale network are solved to provide insights for decision making and to demonstrate computational efficiency. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Xu, Y; Dalmau, R; Prats, X				Xu, Yan; Dalmau, Ramon; Prats, Xavier			Maximizing airborne delay at no extra fuel cost by means of linear holding	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Air transportation; Linear holding; Speed reduction; Trajectory optimization; Air traffic flow management	CRUISE SPEED REDUCTION; AIR; MANAGEMENT; PROGRAMS	This paper introduces a linear holding strategy based on prior works on cruise speed reduction, aimed at performing airborne delay at no extra fuel cost, as a complementary strategy to current ground and airborne holding strategies. Firstly, the equivalent speed concept is extended to climb and descent phases through an analysis of fuel consumption and speed from aircraft performance data. This gives an insight of the feasibility to implement the concept, differentiating the case where the cruise flight level initially requested is kept and the case where it can be changed before departure in order to maximize the linear holding time. Illustrative examples are given, where typical flights are simulated using an optimal trajectory generation tool where linear holding is maximized while keeping constant the initially planned fuel. Finally, the effects of linear holding are thoroughly assessed in terms of the vertical trajectory profiles, range of feasible speed intervals and trade-offs between fuel and time. Results show that the airborne delay increases significantly with nearly 3-fold time for short-haul flights and 2-fold for mid-hauls to the cases in prior works. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper aims to evaluate the benefits of utilizing context-relevant information in the driving behavior assessment process (i.e. contextual driving behavior assessment approach). We use a Bayesian Network (BN) model that investigates the relationships between GPS driving observations, individual driving behavior, individual driving risks, and individual crash frequency. In contrast to prior studies without context information (i.e. non-contextual approach), the data used in the BN approach is a combination of contextual features in the surrounding environment that may contribute to crash risk, such as road conditions surrounding the vehicle of interest and dynamic traffic flow information, as well as the non-contextual data such as instantaneous driving speed and the acceleration/deceleration of a vehicle. An information-aggregation mechanism is developed to aggregates massive amounts of vehicle GPS data points, kinematic events and context information into drivel-level data. With the proposed model, driving behavior risks for drivers is assessed and the relationship between contextual driving behavior and crash occurrence is established. The analysis results in the case study section show that the contextual model has significantly better performance than the non-contextual model, and that drivers who drive at a speed faster than others or much slower than the speed limit at the ramp, and with more rapid acceleration or deceleration on freeways are more likely to be involved in crash events. In addition, younger drivers, and female drivers with higher VMT are found to have higher crash risk. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Consequently, preventing or reducing the occurrence of the capacity drop not only mitigates traffic congestion, but can also produce environmental and traffic safety benefits. In addressing this problem, the paper develops a novel bang-bang feedback control speed harmonization (SH) or Variable Speed Limit (VSL) algorithm, that attempts to prevent or delay the breakdown of a bottleneck and thus reduce traffic congestion. The novelty of the system lies in the fact that it is both proactive and reactive in responding to the dynamic stochastic nature of traffic. The system is proactive because it uses a calibrated fundamental diagram to initially identify the optimum throughput to maintain within the SH zone. Furthermore, the system is reactive (dynamic) because it monitors the traffic stream directly upstream of the bottleneck to adjustment the metering rate to capture the dynamic and stochastic nature of traffic. The steady-state traffic states in the vicinity of a lane-drop bottleneck before and after applying the SH algorithm is analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in alleviating the capacity drop. We demonstrate theoretically that the SH algorithm is effective in enhancing the bottleneck discharge rate. A microscopic simulation of the network using the INTEGRATION software further demonstrates the benefits of the algorithm in increasing the bottleneck discharge rate, decreasing vehicle delay, and reducing vehicle fuel consumption and CO2 emission levels. Specifically, compared with the base case without the SH algorithm, the advisory speed limit increases the bottleneck discharge rate by approximately 7%, reduces the overall system delay by approximately 20%, and reduces the system-wide fuel consumption and CO2 emission levels by 5%.

J	Ding, H; Guo, F; Zheng, XY; Zhang, WH				Ding, Heng; Guo, Fang; Zheng, Xiaoyan; Zhang, Weihua			Traffic guidance-perimeter control coupled method for the congestion in a macro network	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Traffic congestion; Macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD); Traffic flow; Traffic guidance; Perimeter control	FUNDAMENTAL DIAGRAM; URBAN	Macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) describes the macro relationship between a network vehicle density and a network space mean flow, without requiring the mastery of complex origin to destination data. Thus, MFD provides an opportunity for the macro control of urban road network. However, most of the existing MFD control methods ignore the active role of traffic guidance in solving congestion problems. This study presents a traffic guidance-perimeter control coupled (TGPCC) method to improve the performance of macroscopic traffic networks. The method considers the optimal cumulative volume of a network as the goal and establishes a programming function according to the network equilibrium rule of traffic flow amongst multiple MFD sub-regions, which regards the minimum delay of network, as the objective. The Logit model for the compliance rate of driver route guidance is established by the stated preference survey. Moreover, the perimeter control (PC) method is proposed for adjusting the phase split of intersections. Finally, three schemes, namely, the TGPCC, PC and the method without PC and guidance are tested on a network with four well-defined MFD sub-regions. Results show that the TGPCC addresses the issue of congestion and decreases the total delay accordingly. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Flotterod, G; Osorio, C				Flotterod, G.; Osorio, C.			Stochastic network link transmission model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article							KINEMATIC WAVES; TRAFFIC FLOW; TIME; EFFICIENT; APPROXIMATION; CONGESTION; QUEUES; ALGORITHMS	This article considers the stochastic modeling of vehicular network flows, including the analytical approximation of joint queue-length distributions. The article presents two main methodological contributions. First, it proposes a tractable network model for finite space capacity Markovian queueing networks. This methodology decomposes a general topology queueing network into a set of overlapping subnetworks and approximates the transient joint queue-length distribution of each subnetwork. The subnetwork overlap allows to approximate stochastic dependencies across multiple subnetworks with a complexity that is linear in the number of subnetworks. Additionally, the network model maintains mutually consistent overlapping subnetwork distributions. Second, a stochastic network link transmission model (SLTM) is formulated that builds on the proposed queueing network decomposition and on the stochastic single-link model of Osorio and Flotterod (2015). The SLTM represents each direction of a road and each road intersection as one queueing subnetwork. Three experiments are presented. First, the analytical approximations of the queueing-theoretical model are validated against simulation-based estimates. An experiment with intricate traffic dynamics and multi-modal joint distributions is studied. The analytical model captures most dependency structure and approximates well the simulated network dynamics and joint distributions. Even for the considered simple network, which consists of only eight links, the proposed subnetwork decomposition yields significant gains in computational efficiency: It uses less than 0.0025% of the memory that is required by the use of a full network model. Second and third, the proposed SLTM is illustrated with a linear test network adopted from the literature and a more general topology network containing a diverge node and a merge node. Time-dependent probabilistic performance measures (occupancy uncertainty bands, spillback probabilities) are presented and discussed. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The majority of the current navigation systems are based on static traffic information. Building on mobile crowdsensing technology, the authors propose context-aware traffic estimation and navigation system (CANS), a context-aware system that can estimate traffic state without any requirement for expensive infrastructure. Using only available equipment, it can provide dynamic navigation service to drivers. The proposed system consists of three main components: local traffic estimation, global traffic aggregation, and navigation. In this system, vehicles estimate local traffic state using vehicular contextual information including speed and acceleration by relying on fuzzy logic, and transmit the information to the urban server. The server integrates the received local traffic information from different vehicles and estimates the global traffic state, providing the traffic-aware navigation system to drivers. CANS performance is evaluated for an urban scenario in a traffic flow in Birjand, Iran. The experiment is conducted for evaluating CANS in both traffic congestion estimation and navigation. The results show an accurate estimation of traffic states along urban roads. Compared with previous approaches, CANS overrides them for its reduced travel time.

They control the movement of traffic on urban streets by determining the appropriate signal timing settings. Due to the stochastic nature of the traffic flow, deciding on the best signal timing settings is a computationally complex problem, with the result that traditional analytical methods have been found to be inadequate in dealing with real world scenarios. This issue has already been tackled using computational intelligence algorithms such as the genetic algorithm (GA). However, despite good results, GA may experience slow convergence, especially when dealing with constrained optimisation problems. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive memetic algorithm (MA) for optimising signal timings in real world urban road networks using traffic volumes derived from induction loop detectors. The proposed MA combines the strengths of GA with the exploitation power of a local search algorithm, in an adaptive manner, so as to accelerate the search process and generate high quality solutions. In this work, we propose two important techniques for improving the performance of a traditional MA. First, we use a systematic neighbourhood based simple descent algorithm as a local search to effectively exploit the search space around GA solutions. Second, to achieve a proper balance between the exploration of GA and the local search algorithm, we propose an indicator scheme to control the local search application based on the diversity and the quality of the search process. The proposed MA was tested in two different case studies for the cities of Brisbane, Australia, and Plock, Poland, using the well-known microscopic traffic simulator, AIMSUN. Results demonstrate that our MA is better than GA and traditional fixed-time traffic signal settings. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By means of the numerical simulation the following conclusions are obtained herewith: 1. Velocity disturbance propagation in traffic flow is caused by the speed adaptation among vehicles. 2. In free flow phase, very fewer vehicles are affected by the velocity disturbance and the effect can be dissipated quickly thus the time of disturbance in a single vehicle is quite shorter. On the contrary, the impact duration time of the disturbance on a single vehicle is longer in synchronous flow phase, thus, it will affect more vehicles accordingly. 3. Under the free flow phase, the continuous deceleration behavior of a high speed vehicle to adapt the preceding car with slow speed can cause the reduction of the driver's sensitivity, lead to the vehicle over-deceleration and aggravate the effects of velocity perturbations While in the synchronous flow phase, though the reaction delay caused by the driver's sensitivity reduction can induce speed wave dissolving in essence, it increases the impact of disturbance on the traffic flow. 4. The large acceleration and deceleration tendency of an aggressive driver in the free flow phase always increase the influence of the velocity disturbance, while a conservative driver often weakens the influence. However, in the synchronized flow, since the high traffic density and the synchronization between vehicles is very strong, also the main factor which affects the driver's speed choice is the distance among vehicles, therefore the effect of a driver's behavior tendency to the spread of velocity perturbation is not obvious under this state.

J	Yang, HF; Wu, Z				Yang, Haifei; Wu, Zhong			Effect of novice driver's car-following characteristic on roadway segment capacity	ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Novice driver; roadway segment; capacity; car-following; adjustment factor	EXPERIENCE; ACCIDENTS; TIME	The presence of significant proportion of novice drivers greatly affects traffic flow performance due to their poor driving skills. The primary objective of this study was to develop adjustment factors to evaluate the impacts of novice driver's car-following characteristic on roadway segment capacity. On-road experiments were conducted for measuring the car-following behavioral data associated with novice and experienced drivers. Comparative analyses were conducted. It was found that novice drivers preferred keeping significantly larger spacing and headways than experienced drivers did. Linear regression analyses were conducted to relate travel speeds to spacing and headways. Adjustment factors were developed to quantitatively evaluate the effects of novice drivers' car-following behaviors on roadway segment capacity. It was found that as the proportion of novice drivers in the traffic stream increased, the reduction rate of capacity had the same trend of increasing. The presence of novice drivers may result in up to 13% of capacity reduction when traffic flow composed entirely of novice drivers traveling with an average speed of 90 km/h. The validity of implementing the novice driver adjustment factor was tested against measured data. The results of validation determined that the proposed adjustment factors improve the estimation accuracy of roadway segment capacity.

Methods This study explores a Heckman selection model of the crash rate and severity simultaneously at different levels and a two-step procedure is used to investigate the crash rate and severity levels. The first step uses a probit regression model to determine the sample selection process, and the second step develops a multiple regression model to simultaneously evaluate the crash rate and severity for slight injury/kill or serious injury (KSI), respectively. The model uses 555 observations from 262 signalized intersections in the Hong Kong metropolitan area, integrated with information on the traffic flow, geometric road design, road environment, traffic control and any crashes that occurred during two years. Results The results of the proposed two-step Heckman selection model illustrate the necessity of different crash rates for different crash severity levels. Conclusions A comparison with the existing approaches suggests that the Heckman selection model offers an efficient and convenient alternative method for evaluating the safety performance at signalized intersections.

A control signal including the velocity difference between the considered vehicle and the vehicle in front is taken into account. The control theory method is applied into analysis of the stability condition for the model. Numerical simulations are implemented to prove that the stability of the traffic flow strengthens effectively with an increase of the radius of curved road, and the control signal can suppress the traffic congestion. The results are in good agree with the theoretical analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, it is quite challenging to develop an efficient and robust forecasting model due to the inherent randomness and large variations of traffic flow. Recently, the stacked autoencoder has been proven promising for traffic flow forecasting but still exists some drawbacks in certain conditions. In this paper, a training samples replication strategy is introduced to train a series of stacked autoencoders and an adaptive boosting scheme is proposed to ensemble the trained stacked autoencoders to improve the accuracy of traffic flow forecasting. Furthermore, sufficient experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposal. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A Differential Evolution Based Multiclass Vehicle Detector and Classifier for Urban Environments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SWARM INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						Differential Evolution; Hough Transform; Vehicle Classification; Video Analytics	TRACKING; MODEL; SEGMENTATION; EXTRACTION; OBJECTS	Video analytics is emerging as a high potential area supplementing intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) with wide ranging applications from traffic flow analysis to surveillance. Object detection and classification, as a sub part of a video analytical system, could potentially help transportation agencies to analyze and respond to traffic incidents in real time, plan for possible future cascading events, or use the classification data to design better roads. This work presents a specialized vehicle classification system for urban environments. The system is targeted at the analysis of vehicles, especially trucks, in urban two lane traffic, to empower local transportation agencies to decide on the road width and thickness. The main thrust is on the accurate classification of the vehicles detected using an evolutionary algorithm. The detector is backed by a differential evolution (DE) based discrete parameter optimizer. The authors show that, though employing DE proves expensive in terms of computational cycles, it measurably improves the accuracy of the classification system.

Traffic flow behavior at a single lane traffic circle	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Cellular automata; traffic circle; phase diagram; gridlock; density profiles	T-SHAPED INTERSECTION; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; ROUNDABOUT; MODEL	In this paper, we propose a stochastic cellular automata (CA) model to study traffic dynamic at a single-lane traffic circle of N entry/exit points. The boundaries are controlled by the injecting rates alpha(1), alpha(2) and the extracting rate beta. Both the cases with and without the splitter islands of width L-sp are considered. The phase diagrams in the space (alpha(1)beta) are constructed and the density profiles are also investigated. The variation of the phase diagram with the traffic circle size (L), the number of entry point (N), and the time needed for drivers to change their exit willingly (T-exit) is studied. The results show that the phase diagram in both cases consists essentially of three phases namely free flow, congestion and gridlock. However, the large sized traffic circle shows better performance in the free flow phase, in contrary, the increase of N enlarges the congestion and the gridlock phases. We have also found that the decrease of T-exit enhances the traffic flow situation in the traffic circle. Furthermore, as the L-sp increases, the free flow phase enlarges while the congestion and gridlock ones shrink.

The linear stability analysis reveals that the time length of driver's memory has an important effect on stability of traffic flow. The factor will lead to the occurrence of traffic congestion. Three typical nonlinear wave equations including Burgers, Korteweg-de Vries and modified Korteweg-de Vries equation are derived to describe the evolution of density wave for traffic flow in three different regions, which are stable, meta-stable and unstable region, respectively. The simulations are given to illustrate and clarify the analytical results. The results indicate that the time length of driver's memory has a negative effect upon stability of traffic flow.

An Approach to an Insular Self-contained Waste Management System with the Aim of Maximizing Recovery While Limiting Transportation Costs	WASTE AND BIOMASS VALORIZATION			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on the Environmental and Technical Implications of Construction with Alternative Materials (WASCON) - Resource Efficiency in Construction	JUN 10-12, 2015	Santander, SPAIN	GER Res Grp, Univ Cantabria, Green Engn & Resources		Waste; GIS; Island; Transportation; Cost	LOCATION; DISPOSAL; MODEL; GIS; LOGISTICS; MCDA	This study is focused on definition of the typology, capacity and location of waste treatment and disposal facilities for use in both present and future management scenarios on the larger Mediterranean islands, using Sicily as a case study. Following estimation of the amount of waste produced in Sicily and the proposal of a pathway aimed at rapidly achieving the 50% recovery target established by the European Union, a series of progressive and alternative scenarios for the management of residual waste have been proposed and analyzed by means of the software platform TransCad in terms of "facility location" and "minimum-cost flow" problems. The cost of transportation was calculated as the sum of different cost components related to distance traveled, staff involved, and vehicle used to collect waste, including fuel costs, tire costs, road tax and truck maintenance costs. The different scenarios were critically compared in terms of transportation costsAnalysis of traffic flows allowed us to ascertain the general framework of increased traffic elicited by the proposed scenarios and assess the impact caused by an increase in "trucks per day" along three critical sections of the road network in Sicily. Overall transportation costs corresponded to approximately 10% of treatment/disposal costs for all scenarios, highlighting therefore how transportation costs should not be over-inflated or used to condition public acceptance as to the location, size and typology of the facilities.

Based on the platform of the network traffic flow modelling, the traffic through the worksite and its adjacent road links is evaluated. Thus, maintenance arrangements at a worksite can be optimized considering the overall network performance. In addition, genetic algorithms are used for maintenance planning in order to find the best maintenance arrangements for the worksites. The key variables in the optimization model involve the starting time of maintenance works during the day, their duration, the duration of the break during the maintenance work and traffic signal controls at the worksite.

Unfortunately, individuals with disabilities are often overlooked due to the lack of available data. The purpose of this study was to measure the individual pedestrian walking behaviors of individuals with disabilities through controlled video tracking experiments of heterogeneous crowds in various walking facilities; including passageways, right and oblique corners, doorways, bottlenecks, and stairs. The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of conducting experimental research on pedestrian walking behavior involving individuals with and without disabilities, including automated video tracking methods, data collection, logistical issues, processing methods, and lessons learned from conducting a large-scale study. The findings support future large-scale experiments related to the pedestrian walking behavior of individuals with disabilities. The results can be used to calibrate and validate pedestrian traffic flow models capturing the behaviors and interactions of crowds which include different types of individuals with disabilities.

J	Cueto, JL; Petrovici, AM; Hernandez, R; Fernandez, F				Luis Cueto, Jose; Petrovici, Alina Mihaela; Hernandez, Ricardo; Fernandez, Francisco			Analysis of the Impact of Bus Signal Priority on Urban Noise	ACTA ACUSTICA UNITED WITH ACUSTICA			English	Article							ANNOYANCE; EVENTS; MODEL; COORDINATION; PERCEPTION; EMISSIONS; NUMBER	The integration of transportation and the environment in the same strategy creates numerous advantages for local governments, which is probably the reason why the enhancement of city bus services is one of the most recommended action plans to reduce urban traffic noise. The major potential of smart solutions for public transportation lies in providing much of these enhancement options through technology, not only via traditional techniques such as systematically extending the road infrastructure. Unfortunately, many of these solutions need to be carefully analyzed before their application to a real case, among other reasons because of the possibility of creating unintended side effects. In this study, we make use of 'ad-hoe' Bus Signal Priority (BSP) strategies, designed to be applied to a transit corridor to achieve the best compromise between the efficiency and attractiveness of the bus service. VISSIM microscopic traffic flow simulation is used first as a platform to test the proposed strategies through the indirect estimation of the space/time behavior of the noise emissions along the traffic network. Buses travel times are also estimated, as punctuality in the service is the precondition for the introduction of any other measure aimed at persuading drivers to leave their cars at home.

J	Jin, YD; Zhou, J; Shi, ZK; Zhang, HL; Wang, CP				Jin, Yue-Dan; Zhou, Jie; Shi, Zhong-Ke; Zhang, Hai-Liang; Wang, Chao-Ping			Lattice hydrodynamic model for traffic flow on curved road with passing	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS			English	Article						Traffic flow; Nonlinear analysis; Chaotic jam; Curved road	JAMMING TRANSITION; DRIVERS ANTICIPATION; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; VELOCITY; STATES; WAVES; JAMS	In order to investigate the effect of passing upon traffic flow on curved road, in this paper, an extended one-dimensional lattice hydrodynamic model for traffic flow on curved road with passing is proposed. The stability condition is obtained by the use of linear stability analysis. The result of stability analysis shows that passing behavior plays an important role in influencing the stability of traffic flow as well as radian of curved road. The nonlinear wave equations including Burgers, Korteweg-de Vries and modified Kortewegde Vries equations are derived to describe the nonlinear traffic behavior in different regions, respectively. The analytical results show that reducing the coefficient of passing may enhance the stability of traffic flow. Jamming transition occurs between uniform flow and kink jam when the coefficient of passing is less than the critical value. When the coefficient of passing is larger than the critical value, jamming transition occurs from uniform flow to irregular wave through chaotic phase with decreasing sensitivity parameter. In addition, compared with other segments of curved road, traffic flow with passing easily becomes unstable and complicated at the entrance and exit of curved road, especially at the entrance of curved road. The numerical simulations are given to illustrate and clarify the analytical results.

The critical condition for traffic flow is derived, and density waves occur in traffic flow because of the small disturbance. Near the neutral stability line, nonlinear analysis is taken to derive the KdV-Burgers equation for describing the density wave, and one of the solutions is given. Numerical simulation is carried out to show the local traffic described by the model.

J	Bai, L; Liu, P; Chan, CY; Li, ZB				Bai, Lu; Liu, Pan; Chan, Ching-Yao; Li, Zhibin			Estimating level of service of mid-block bicycle lanes considering mixed traffic flow	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						E-bike; E-scooter; Bicycle; Bicycle lane; Level of service	ELECTRIC BICYCLES; MODEL; AGE; DRIVERS; USERS; CHINA	The primary objective of the study was to identify the factors that influenced the comfort perception of e-bike, e-scooter and bicycle riders in mid-block bicycle lanes on urban streets and to estimate the bicycle level of service (BLOS) of a mid-block bicycle lane with mixed two-wheeled traffic. Data were collected at thirty locations on thirty different streets in Nanjing area in China. Pearson's Chi-square tests were conducted to make comparisons of the comfort perception among different cyclist groups. The factors that significantly affected the comfort perception of the cyclists included the age of the cyclists, the type of two-wheeled vehicles, the volume of two-wheeled vehicles, the width of mid-block bicycle lanes, the proportions of e-bikes and e-scooters in two-wheeled vehicles, the physical separation between motorized, bicycle and pedestrian lanes, the slope of bicycle lanes, the roadside access points and the roadside land use. Ordered probit models were developed to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of different contributing factors on the comfort perception of the riders of e-bikes, e-scooters and bicycles. The results showed that compared to the riders of bicycles, the riders of e-bikes and e-scooters were more likely to perceive a poor comfort level. The comfort perception of the cyclists increased with an increase in the width of the mid-block bicycle lane, whereas it decreased with an increase in the volume of two-wheeled vehicles. The proportions of e-bikes and e-scooters in two wheeled vehicles negatively affected the comfort perception of the cyclists. In addition, the presence of physical separation between the motorized, bicycle and pedestrian lanes significantly increased the comfort perception of the cyclists. With the comfort perception models, a procedure was developed and insights were gained to help transportation professionals estimate the BLOS of a mid-block bicycle lane with mixed two-wheeled traffic.

J	Ye, PJ; Wen, D				Ye, Peijun; Wen, Ding			Optimal Traffic Sensor Location for Origin-Destination Estimation Using a Compressed Sensing Framework	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Traffic sensor location; traffic flow estimation; compressed sensing	MATRIX ESTIMATION; SELECTION; MODEL; OBSERVABILITY; OPTIMIZATION; INFERENCE; QUALITY	A series of flow estimation problems, especially origin-destination estimation, involves optimally locating sensors on a transportation network to measure traffic counts. As compressed sensing (CS) provides a new method to solve the estimation problem, its sensor location strategy needs to be researched in order to facilitate the reconstruction. This paper first points out that the accurate flow recovery is difficult by introducing a necessary condition, and then categorizes the location determination into two cases: sensor number with restriction and without restriction. For both cases, we elucidate their theoretical foundations of locating methods and propose an algorithm based on column coherence minimization, which optimally facilitates the reconstruction for CS framework. Numerical experiments indicate that the selected sensor locations fit the flow recovery and the proposed algorithm, compared with other methods, can lead to a slightly better result under certain observations.

As a discrete event system model, timed Petri nets (TPNs) are used in this paper to formally define two kinds of behaviors: non-jam-induced driving behavior and jam-induced one. In order to systematically assess the performances of both behaviors, a new urban traffic network model is built: a cell transmission model is used to depict the road link traffic that is consistent with the kinematic property of traffic flow, and TPNs are used to model the behaviors and the conflicting traffic flow at the intersection. Some simulation results are given to evaluate the impact of driving behavior on the traffic delay.

Based on the method of characteristics, some properties of the positive solutions are derived for the hyperbolic initial boundary value problems. The dissipative boundary condition in terms of linear inequalities is proven to be not only sufficient but also necessary under an extra assumption on the velocities of the hyperbolic systems. An application to control of the freeway traffic modeled by the Aw-Rascle traffic flow equation illustrates and motivates the theoretical results. The boundary control strategies are designed by integrating the on-ramp metering with the mainline speed limit. Finally, the proposed feedback laws are tested under simulation, first in the free-flow case and then in the congestion mode, which show adequate performance to stabilize the local freeway traffic.

It is not unreasonable to think that CV technology may have a far-reaching impact, even to the genesis of a completely new traffic pattern. To this end, the literature has yet to address the routing behavior of the CVs, namely traffic assignment problem (TAP) (perhaps it is assumed, they ought to follow the traditional shortest possible paths, known as user equilibrium [UE]). It is possible that real-time data could be derived from the vehicles' communications that in turn could be used to achieve a better traffic circulation. In this article, we propose a mathematical formulation to ensure the CVs are seeking the system optimal (SO) principles, while the remainder continue to pursue the old-fashioned UE pattern. The model is formulated as a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP). This article contributes to the literature in three distinct ways: (i) mathematical formulation for the CVs' routing, stated as a mixed UE-SO traffic pattern, is proposed; (ii) a variety of realistic features are explicitly considered in the solution to the TAP including road capacity, elastic demand, multiclass and asymmetric travel time; and (iii) formal proof of the existence and uniqueness of the solutions are also presented. The proposed methodology is applied to the networks of Sioux-Falls and Melbourne.

J	Duret, A; Yuan, YF				Duret, Aurelien; Yuan, Yufei			Traffic state estimation based on Eulerian and Lagrangian observations in a mesoscopic modeling framework	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Traffic state estimation; Data assimilation; LWR model; Mesoscopic model; Eulerian observation; Loop data; Lagrangian observation; Probe data; Traffic monitoring; Traffic forecasting	KINEMATIC WAVES; VARIATIONAL FORMULATION; EQUATIONS; FLOW	The paper proposes a model-based framework for estimating traffic states from Eulerian (loop) and/or Lagrangian (probe) data. Lagrangian-Space formulation of the LWR model adopted as the underlying traffic model provides suitable properties for receiving both Eulerian and Lagrangian external information. Three independent methods are proposed to address Eulerian data, Lagrangian data and the combination of both, respectively. These methods are defined in a consistent framework so as to be implemented simultaneously. The proposed framework has been verified on the synthetic data derived from the same underlying traffic flow model. Strength and weakness of both data sources are discussed. Next, the proposed framework has been applied to a freeway corridor. The validity has been tested using the data from a microscopic simulator, and the performance is satisfactory even for low rate of probe vehicles around 5%. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Omer, I; Kaplan, N				Omer, Itzhak; Kaplan, Nir			Using space syntax and agent-based approaches for modeling pedestrian volume at the urban scale	COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS			English	Article						Agent-based model; Space syntax; Pedestrian volume modeling	NATURAL MOVEMENT; TRAFFIC FLOW; ENVIRONMENT; DESIGN	Contemporary pedestrian volume models are constructed mainly within the space syntax framework with the help of Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA). Although these models predict the distribution of pedestrian volumes in the network with considerable success, they exhibit difficulties in predicting pedestrian movement in some contexts and in accounting for the combined effect of the street network structure and land-use patterns. In this paper we present an agent-based (AB) pedestrian volume model at the urban scale within the space syntax framework. The model was constructed by incorporating transformed basic components of the MRA-based space syntax model to agents' spatial behavior. The AB and MRA models were implemented in two city centers that differ in their urban growth and morphological characteristics. The suggested AB model demonstrated superiority over the MRA model in predicting pedestrian movement when the correspondence between the street network's structure, land uses and pedestrian movement was relatively low and less consistent.

Communication with a roadside unit allows the computation and transmission of optimized trajectories to the equipped vehicles. These vehicles then carry out the trajectories and resume normal operation once they cease communication with the roadside controller. A tool was developed to simulate and carry out the merging algorithm, while interfacing with the optimization software LINGO. A hypothetical merging segment was simulated to evaluate the effectiveness of the merging algorithm, and its performance is compared to conventional vehicle operation. During uncongested conditions the algorithm is able to reduce travel time, increase average travel speed and improve throughput. The capacity of the merge segment is directly related to the safe time gap selected to run the algorithm. Once capacity is reached, queuing forms on both the ramp and mainline segments upstream of the merge area. The algorithm provides safe merging operations during this congested traffic state.

J	Pilko, H; Mandzuka, S; Baric, D				Pilko, Hrvoje; Mandzuka, Sadko; Baric, Danijela			Urban single-lane roundabouts: A new analytical approach using multi-criteria and simultaneous multi-objective optimization of geometry design, efficiency and safety	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Urban single-lane roundabout; Geometry design; Traffic (operational) efficiency; Traffic safety; Analytic hierarchy process; Simultaneous multi-objective optimization; Sensitivity analysis	CAPACITY MODELS; SPEED; PREDICTION	Building safe and effective roundabouts requires optimizing traffic (operational) efficiency (TE) and traffic safety (TS) while taking into account geometric factors, traffic characteristics and local constraints. Most existing simulation-based optimization models do not simultaneously optimize all these factors. To capture the relationship among geometry, efficiency and safety, we put forward a model formulation in this paper. We present a new multi-criteria and simultaneous multi-objective optimization (MOO) model approach to optimize geometry, TE and TS of urban unsignalized single-lane roundabouts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model that uses the multi-criteria decision making method known as analytic hierarchy process to evaluate and rank traffic parameters and geometric elements of urban single-lane roundabouts. The model was built based on comprehensive review of the research literature and existing roundabout simulation software, a field survey of 61 civil and traffic expert engineers in Croatia, and field studies of roundabouts in the Croatian capital city of Zagreb. We started from the basis of Kimber's capacity model, HCM2010 serviceability model, and Maycock and Hall's accident prediction model, which we extended by adding sensitivity analysis and powerful MOO procedures of the bounded objective function method and interactive optimization. Preliminary validation of the model was achieved by identifying the optimal and most robust of three geometric alternatives (V.1-V.3) for an unsignalized single-lane roundabout in Zagreb, Croatia. The geometric parameters in variant V.1 had significantly higher values than in the existing design V.0, while approaches 1 and 3 in variant V.2 were enlarged as much as possible within allowed spatial limits and Croatian guidelines, reflecting their higher traffic demand. Sensitivity analysis indicated that variant V.2 showed the overall highest TE and TS across the entire range of traffic flow demand and pedestrian crossing flow demand at approaches. At the same time, the number of predicted traffic accidents was similar for all three variants, although it was lowest overall for V.2. The similarity in predicted accident frequency for the three variants suggests that V.2 provides the greatest safety within the predefined constraints and parameter ranges explored in our study. These preliminary results suggest that the proposed model can optimize geometry, TE and TS of urban single-lane roundabouts. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The effect of side motion in the dynamics of interacting molecular motors	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT			English	Article						driven diffusive systems; exclusion processes; molecular motors; stochastic particle dynamics	TRAFFIC FLOW; EXCLUSION PROCESSES; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; SYSTEMS; KINESIN; MODELS	To mimic the collective motion of interacting molecular motors, we propose and discuss an open two-lane symmetrically coupled interactive TASEP model that incorporates interaction in the thermodynamically consistent fashion. We study the effect of both repulsive and attractive interaction on the system's dynamical properties using various cluster mean field analysis and extensive Monte Carlo simulations. The interactions bring correlations into the system, which were found to be reduced due to the side motion of particles. We produce the steady-state phase diagrams for symmetrically split interaction strength. The behavior of the maximal particle current with respect to the interaction energy E is analyzed for different coupling rates and interaction splittings. The results suggest that for strong coupling and large splittings, the maximal flow of the motors occurs at a weak attractive interaction strength which matches with the known experimental results on kinesin motor protein.

Thereby, we obtain a mixed traffic flow cellular automaton model with the effect of acceleration on the imported lane. Through analyzing the results of numerical simulation, it is found that the maximum queue length and the volatility of acceleration have a great influence on the intersection lane mixed traffic flow with the different time of fixed signal cycles and considerably on traffic arriving strength within a certain range. When the intensity is in specific range, the longer the fixed signal cycle, the shorter the maximum queue length, and the greater the volatility of acceleration, which has smaller queue jam affecting the intersection lane mixed traffic flow. Meanwhile, the improved model can reproduce the evolution and propagation characteristics of gathering-dissipating of the traffic wave in the intersection lane mixed traffic flow.

J	Yan, Y; Zhang, S; Tang, JJ; Wang, XF				Yan, Ying; Zhang, Shen; Tang, Jinjun; Wang, Xiaofei			Understanding characteristics in multivariate traffic flow time series from complex network structure	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow; Principal component analysis; Complex network; Statistical properties; Traffic states	SIGNAL CONTROL; MODEL; TRANSITION; PREDICTION	Discovering dynamic characteristics in traffic flow is the significant step to design effective traffic managing and controlling strategy for relieving traffic congestion in urban cities. A new method based on complex network theory is proposed to study multivariate traffic flow time series. The data were collected from loop detectors on freeway during a year. In order to construct complex network from original traffic flow, a weighted Froenius norm is adopt to estimate similarity between multivariate time series, and Principal Component Analysis is implemented to determine the weights. We discuss how to select optimal critical threshold for networks at different hour in term of cumulative probability distribution of degree. Furthermore, two statistical properties of networks: normalized network structure entropy and cumulative probability of degree, are utilized to explore hourly variation in traffic flow. The results demonstrate these two statistical quantities express similar pattern to traffic flow parameters with morning and evening peak hours. Accordingly, we detect three traffic states: trough, peak and transitional hours, according to the correlation between two aforementioned properties. The classifying results of states can actually represent hourly fluctuation in traffic flow by analyzing annual average hourly values of traffic volume, occupancy and speed in corresponding hours.

J	Brown, AE; Taylor, BD; Wachs, M				Brown, Anne E.; Taylor, Brian D.; Wachs, Martin			The Boy Who Cried Wolf? Media Messaging and Traveler Responses to "Carmageddon" in Los Angeles	PUBLIC WORKS MANAGEMENT & POLICY			English	Article						traveler responses; road closures; messaging; exceptional events		One of the most heavily traveled freeways in the United States closed for construction over weekends in 2011 and 2012. Some public officials publicized the closures by appealing to civic pride whereas others threatened nightmarish delays they dubbed "Carmageddon." In 2011, contrary to many media predictions, traffic flowed freely at volumes far below normal levels. Our analysis finds that travelers did not switch routes, modes, or trip timing, but instead forewent thousands of trips. Travel behavior changes were far more modest and mixed during the second closure in 2012. Although the lack of traffic problems surprised many public officials, we find traveler responses to both events congruent with past research. Traveler responses to the first event were more dramatic but short-lived, while more modest but durable responses to the second event suggest that travelers learned from, and were perhaps jaded by, the histrionics surrounding the first closure.

Evaluating the robustness effects of infrastructure projects based on their topological and geometrical roadway designs	TRANSPORT POLICY			English	Article						Robustness; Incidents; Number of lanes; Hard shoulder; Parallel road structure; Weaving sections	TRAFFIC FLOW; URBAN FREEWAYS; CAPACITY; SAFETY; CRASH; LINKS; SEGMENTS; NETWORK	When infrastructures projects are evaluated, it is not only important to evaluate them with models that represent the average daily situation, but also to evaluate them in case of irregular situations like incidents. This becomes especially relevant when various project alternatives are expected to show significantly different scores in case of incidents. Project alternatives and their road sections have different topological and geometrical characteristics. The focus of this paper is on the following characteristics: hard shoulders, the number of lanes, parallel road structures and weaving sections. The main question that this paper addresses is how these network characteristics affect both the risk of different types of incidents occurring and the effects of those incidents on the network performance (robustness). In order to answer this question, analytical examples are presented for small theoretical networks that give insight into how the selected characteristics affect the total delay caused by incidents and its dependence on the traffic volume, capacity, severity and duration of incidents. A marginal simulation based method is presented that can be used to compute the robustness effects of project alternatives, given their geometrical and topological characteristics, on a network level. A case study for an infrastructure project in the Netherlands is presented that illustrates how the robustness effects of infrastructure projects can be computed given their topological and geometrical characteristics.

A multi-class model-based control scheme for reducing congestion and emissions in freeway networks by combining ramp metering and route guidance	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Freeway networks; Integrated control; Ramp metering; Route guidance; Predictive feedback controller; Traffic emissions	TRAFFIC FLOW; PREDICTIVE CONTROL; FUEL CONSUMPTION; OPTIMIZATION; DISPERSION; SPEED	The paper proposes a multi-class control scheme for freeway traffic networks. This control scheme combines two control strategies, i.e. ramp metering and route guidance, in order to reduce the total time spent and the total emissions in a balanced way. In particular, the ramp metering and route guidance controllers are feedback predictive controllers, i.e. they compute the control actions not only on the basis of the measured system state, but also on the basis of the prediction of the system evolution, in terms of traffic conditions and traffic emissions. Another important feature of the controllers is that they have a multi-class nature: different classes of vehicles are considered and specific control actions are computed for each class. Since the controllers are based on a set of parameters that need to be tuned, the overall control framework also includes a module to properly determine the gains of the controllers. The simulation analysis reported in the paper shows the effectiveness of the proposed control framework and, in particular, the possibility of implementing control policies that are specific for each vehicle type.

In this paper, on the basis of the new emerging technologies of Internet of Things, we introduce a new approach for smart traffic light control at intersection. In particular, we firstly propose a connected intersection system where every objects such as vehicles, sensors, and traffic lights will be connected and sharing information to one another. By this way, the controller is able to collect effectively and mobility traffic flow at intersection in real-time. Secondly, we propose the optimization algorithms for traffic lights by applying algorithmic game theory. Specially, 2 game models (which are Cournot Model and Stackelberg Model) are proposed to deal with difference scenarios of traffic flow. In this regard, based on the density of vehicles, controller will make real-time decisions for the time durations of traffic lights to optimize traffic flow. To evaluate our approach, we have used Netlogo simulator, an agent-based modeling environment for designing and implementing a simple working traffic. The simulation results shows that our approach achieves potential performance with various situations of traffic flow.

Complex spatiotemporal interactions between the target road segment and other road segments can provide important information for the accurate forecasting. Meanwhile, spatiotemporal variable selection and traffic flow prediction should be solved in a unified framework such that they can benefit from each other. In this article, we propose a novel sparse hybrid genetic algorithm by introducing sparsity constraint and real encoding scheme into genetic algorithm in order to optimize short-term traffic flow prediction model based on least squares support vector regression. This method can integrate spatiotemporal variable selection, parameter selection as well as traffic flow prediction in a unified framework, indicating that the goodness, that is, contribution, of selected spatiotemporal variables and optimized parameters directly depends on the final traffic flow prediction accuracy. The real-world traffic flow data are collected from 24 observation sites located around the intersection of Interstate 205 and Interstate 84 in Portland, OR, USA. The experimental results show that the proposed sparse hybrid genetic algorithm-least square support vector regression prediction model can produce better performance but with much fewer spatiotemporal variables in comparison with other related models.

While the zones and the road networks connecting them are fixed in space, traffic flows between pairs of zones are dynamic through the day. Understanding these dynamics in real time is crucial for real time traffic planning in the city. In this paper, we use real time traffic flow data to generate dense functional correlation matrices between zones during different times of the day. Then, we derive optimal sparse representations of these dense functional matrices, that accurately recover not only the existing road network connectivity between zones, but also reveal new latent links between zones that do not yet exist but are suggested by traffic flow dynamics. We call this sparse representation the time-varying effective traffic connectivity of the city. A convex optimization problem is formulated and used to infer the sparse effective traffic network from time series data of traffic flow for arbitrary levels of temporal granularity. We demonstrate the results for the city of Doha, Qatar on data collected from several hundred bluetooth sensors deployed across the city to record vehicular activity through the city's traffic zones. While the static road network connectivity between zones is accurately inferred, other long range connections are also predicted that could be useful in planning future road linkages in the city. Further, the proposed model can be applied to socio-economic activity other than traffic, such as new housing, construction, or economic activity captured as functional correlations between zones, and can also be similarly used to predict new traffic linkages that are latently needed but as yet do not exist. Preliminary experiments suggest that our framework can be used by urban transportation experts and policy specialists to take a real time data-driven approach towards urban planning and real time traffic planning in the city, especially at the level of administrative zones of a city.

J	Meersman, H; Nazemzadeh, M				Meersman, Hilde; Nazemzadeh, Marzieh			The contribution of transport infrastructure to economic activity: The case of Belgium	CASE STUDIES ON TRANSPORT POLICY			English	Article						Transport infrastructure investment; Economic growth; Openness of economy	FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT; CLUSTERS; COINTEGRATION; SYSTEM; SPACE	The role of the expansion of transport infrastructure in stimulating economic growth in developed countries is not straightforward. This can lead to debates concerning public investments in transport infrastructure especially when public funds are scarce and the demand for investments is high in social sectors such as education, health and social care. However, it is hard to generalise the potential growth impact of transport infrastructure as it can differ over regions and will be affected by the presence or absence of other drivers of economic growth. As a case the situation in Belgium is considered. It is a small, open economy which is highly integrated into the world economy and facing a considerable growth in passenger, but especially in freight transport. Its geographical position and the presence or proximity of important ports and airports in combination with a dense road and rail network makes it one of the gateways of Europe. The transport and logistics sector generates considerable employment and added value. However, the dense population, the concentration of public administration in Brussels and the large amount of transit freight flows result in a large pressure on the existing transportation infrastructure which becomes more and more congested. The large traffic flows generate negative external effects for people, planet and profit. Opponents of further expansion of especially ports, airports, and roads often focus on the negative external effects on people and the planet as they call into question the positive effects on profit and economic growth. Based on aggregate growth modelling and a causality test, some error-correction models are estimated using annual data for Belgium. They reveal that for Belgium GDP per capita is not only positively impacted by traditional indicators such as the openness of the Belgian economy, the rate of investment as a whole, and technological change, but also by the length of the motorways, the rail network and the investments in port infrastructure. As a consequence the evaluation of new transport infrastructure projects should take into account this contribution to economic growth. (C) 2017 World Conference on Transport Research Society.

J	Bocewicz, G; Banaszak, Z; Nielsen, I				Bocewicz, Grzegorz; Banaszak, Zbigniew; Nielsen, Izabela			Delivery-flow routing and scheduling subject to constraints imposed by vehicle flows in fractal-like networks	ARCHIVES OF CONTROL SCIENCES			English	Article						transport network; fractal structure; declarative modeling; multimodal process; delivery flow; vehicles flow		The problems of designing supply networks and traffic flow routing and scheduling are the subject of intensive research. The problems encompass the management of the supply of a variety of goods using multi-modal transportation. This research also takes into account the various constraints related to route topology, the parameters of the available fleet of vehicles, order values, delivery due dates, etc. Assuming that the structure of a supply network, constrained by a transport network topology that determines its behavior, we develop a declarative model which would enable the analysis of the relationships between the structure of a supply network and its potential behavior resulting in a set of desired delivery-flows. The problem in question can be reduced to determining sufficient conditions that ensure smooth flow in a transport network with a fractal structure. The proposed approach, which assumes a recursive, fractal network structure, enables the assessment of alternative delivery routes and associated schedules in polynomial time. An illustrative example showing the quantitative and qualitative relationships between the morphological characteristics of the investigated supply networks and the functional parameters of the assumed delivery-flows is provided.

The study presents a new method to predict crash likelihood with traffic data collected by discrete loop detectors as well as the web-crawl weather data. Matched case-control method and support vector machines (SVMs) technique were employed to identify the risk status. The adaptive synthetic over-sampling technique was applied to solve the imbalanced dataset issues. Random forest technique was applied to select the contributing factors and avoid the over-fitting issues. The results indicate that the SVMs classifier could successfully classify 76.32% of the crashes on the test dataset and 87.52% of the crashes on the overall dataset, which were relatively satisfactory compared with the results of the previous studies. Compared with the SVMs classifier without the data, the SVMs classifier with the web-crawl weather data increased the crash prediction accuracy by 1.32% and decreased the false alarm rate by 1.72%, showing the potential the potential value of the massive web weather data. Mean impact value method was employed to evaluate the variable effects, and the results are identical with the results of most of previous studies. The emerging technique based on the discrete traffic data and web weather data proves to be more applicable on real-time safety management on freeways.

Green Navigation systems have a great potential to reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions from traffic. This research evaluates the impacts of different percentages of green drivers on traffic, CO2, and NOx over the entire Madrid Region. A macroscopic traffic model was combined with an enhanced macroscopic emissions model and a GIS (Geographic Information Systems) to simulate emissions on the basis of average vehicle speeds and traffic intensity at the link level. NOx emissions are evaluated, taking into account not only the exhaust emissions produced by transport activity, but also the amount of the population exposed to these air pollutants. Results show up to 10.4% CO2 and 13.8% NOx reductions in congested traffic conditions for a 90% penetration of green drivers; however, the population's exposure to NOx increases up to 20.2%. Moreover, while traffic volumes decrease by 13.5% for the entire region, they increase by up to 16.4% downtown. Travel times also increase by 28.7%. Since green drivers tend to choose shorter routes through downtown areas, eco-routing systems are an effective tool for fighting climate change, but are ineffective to reduce air pollution in dense urban areas.

A total of 72 composite girder bridges with various spans, number of lanes, loading mode, and bridge type are analyzed with time-varying static load FEA method by ANSYS, and the probability models of vehicle load effects at arbitrary-time point are developed. Based on these probability models, in accordance to the principle of the same exceeding probability, the multi-lane transverse reduction factor of these composite girder bridges and the relationship between the multi-lane transverse reduction factor and the span of bridge are determined. Finally, the multi-lane transverse reduction factor obtained is compared with those from AASHTO LRFD, BS5400, JTG D60 or Eurocode. The results show that the vehicle load effect at arbitrary-time point follows lognormal distribution. The two-, three-, and four-lane transverse reduction factors calculated by using FEA method and probability respectively range between 0.781 and 1.027, 0.616 and 0.795, 0.468 and 0.645. Furthermore, a correlation between the FEA and AASHTO LRFD, BS5400, JTG D60 or Eurocode transverse reduction factors is made for composite girder bridges. For the two-, three-, and four-lane bridge cases, the Eurocode code underestimated the FEA transverse reduction factors by 27%, 25% and 13%, respectively. This underestimation is more pronounced in short-span bridges. The AASHTO LRFD, BS5400 and JTG D60 codes overestimated the FEA transverse reduction factors. The FEA results highlight the importance of considering span length in determining the multi-lane transverse reduction factors when designing two-lane or more composite girder bridges. This paper will assist bridge engineers in quantifying the adjustment factors used in analyzing and designing multi-lane composite girder bridges.

J	Stoilova, K; Stoilov, T; Ivanov, V				Stoilova, Krasimira; Stoilov, Todor; Ivanov, Vladimir			Bi-Level Optimization as a Tool for Implementation of Intelligent Transportation Systems	CYBERNETICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Bi-level optimization; hierarchical multilevel systems; transportation; traffic control	BILEVEL MODEL; NETWORK	The Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is used as a term for integrating requirements and functionalities towards transportation systems, which in urban environment raises complex exploitation and control problems. Important part of the ITS is the control which has to be applied for traffic flows. The control processes are strongly linked with requirements and targets for optimization of the transportation behavior. The paper applies new optimization formal description of control by bi-level optimization. Except the trivial traffic lights control, the bi-level formalization allows additional traffic characteristics to be defined like maximal/minimal values. The paper defines, solves and provides numerical simulations for minimization of the vehicle queues in front of the traffic lights. Such bi-level optimization problem is applied simultaneously for maximization the traffic flows on arterial and important directions of the urban transportation network. The formal description of the bi-level problem is provided. The results of the bi-level control have been compared with the cases of single optimization of the vehicles queues. The simulation results prove that the bi-level problem gives benefits satisfying an additional goal, which improves additional characteristic of the transport behavior. The bi-level optimization formalism can be used as a tool for implementation of integration of ITS control policies.

In this framework connected vehicles are treated as discreet entities, which can be controlled microscopically so that they can then influence and control overall traffic streams in a macroscopic sense. To establish the connection between the individual vehicle behavior (microscopic entities) and overall macroscopic traffic streams, we propose to use Mean Field Games theory. We then highlight the formulation and design of control objectives using the proposed mathematical framework. Following that, we study the effect of varying penetration levels of V2X communication enabled vehicles on the efficiency of traffic flow. We use total entropy of the system as a measure of traffic flow efficiency. We also design control of traffic network via controlling the connected vehicles microscopically. A microscopic simulation is also performed in the end to validate the proposed framework and control algorithm.

The model can accommodate high-dimensional, non-linear and non-normal time series and enables local and parallel computation by decomposing the multivariate problem into separate, simpler sub-problems of lower dimensions. The advantages of the new model are illustrated by forecasting traffic network flows and also modelling gene expression data from transcriptional networks.

However, it is a daunting task for large graphs. It is necessary to design an aggregate statistical measurement to measure the degree of matching at the coarse grained level between two large graphs. This work presents a novel contribution with the proposal of an aggregate statistical measurement of the matching between two large networks at the macro topological structure level. In the viewpoint of strategic planning application, decision makers want to know whether the road infrastructure network meets the traffic flow network at the macro level rather than the micro level. The macro topological structure of the graph is described by a partition of all the vertices by the singular value decomposition based on the weighted vertexpath incidence matrix. The topological structure matching measurement (TSMM) of the two graphs is defined as the degree of similarity between two partitions. As a case study, the TSMM is considered between the road network and the traffic flow network for Shanghai. The result is 0.2129, which shows that the two networks mismatch to a certain degree. This, agreeing with the current situation of the traffic congestion in Shanghai, suggests the improvement in the urban traffic.

Studies of vehicle overtaking dynamics and its influence on traffic flow at a bidirectional road	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Cellular automata; bidirectional; overtaking; phase diagram; inter-lane correlation	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; SIMULATION; DIAGRAM; MODEL	For the purposes of optimizing traffic flow composed of different types of vehicles, it is important to understand the interactions between them. This paper proposes a cellular automata model to investigate a bidirectional two-lane traffic flow under the periodic boundary condition. The vehicle flux and the phase diagrams of the system in the (rho(1), rho(2)) space are constructed by applying two different overtaking models (symmetric, asymmetric). The inter-lane correlation and the overtaking frequency are also studied. The simulation results show that the variation of the density of one lane has an apparent influence on the traffic of the adjacent lane. Furthermore, it is found that the phase diagram on both models is classified into several regions. Thus, for the symmetric model, as the overtaking probability increases, the traffic on the system becomes better. Likewise, the results also indicate that the asymmetric model can effectively enhance the traffic capacity and alleviate the congested state.

J	Kong, DW; Guo, XC; Wu, DX				Kong, Dewen; Guo, Xiucheng; Wu, Dingxin			The influence of heavy vehicles on traffic dynamics around on-ramp system: Cellular automata approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Traffic dynamics; cellular automata; on-ramp system; heavy vehicle	MODEL; FLOW; LANE; CAR; BEHAVIOR; TRUCK	Although the on-ramp system has been widely studied, the influence of heavy vehicles is unknown because researchers only investigate the traffic dynamics around on-ramp system under homogeneous traffic conditions, which is different in real-world settings. This paper uses an improved cellular automaton model to study the heterogeneous traffic around on-ramp system. The forward motion rules are improved by considering the differences of driving behavior in different vehicle combinations. The lane change rules are improved by reflecting the aggressive behavior in mandatory lane changes. The phase diagram, traffic flow, capacity and spatial-temporal diagram are analyzed under the influences of heavy vehicles. The results show that by increasing the percentage of heavy vehicles, there will be more severe traffic congestion around on-ramp system, lower saturated flow and capacity. Also, the interactions between main road and on-ramp have been investigated. Increasing the percentage of heavy vehicles at the upstream of the conflict area on the main road or restricting heavy vehicles on the outside lane of the main road will deteriorate the performance of on-ramp. While the main road will have better performance as the percentage of heavy vehicles on the on-ramp increases when the on-ramp inflow rate is not low.

Although existing approaches based on ramp metering have improved the overall efficiency of on-ramps, their performance is still far below the theoretical capacity. The recently proposed detecting technology of autonomous vehicles (AVs) provides an alternative for maximizing the merging efficiency by developing and using appropriate controllers for AVs. In this paper, we develop a cooperative intelligent driver model in order to examine the system performance under different proportions of AVs. The results show that, with a proper vehicle-to-vehicle controlling mechanism, an increasing percentage of AVs will reduce the total travel time and smooth traffic oscillations.

Considering the obvious heterogeneity that is reflected in the numerous ways that travelers adopt ATIS information and choose routes, the lognormal distribution is adopted to describe the heterogeneity of travelers' rationality degree. Introducing habitual factors of traveler route choice, modeling ideas of Multi-Agent and Mixed Logit are utilized to construct the day-to-day evolution model of network traffic flow, which is based on the value difference of travelers' cognitive travel time. Furthermore, an integrated simulation algorithm based on the Monte Carlo method is specially designed to solve the previous evolution model. The simulation indicates that a lower individual difference and a higher rationality degree would lead to a more obvious aggregation phenomenon of network traffic flow and inefficiency of operation in road networks.

J	Memoli, S; Cantarella, GE; de Luca, S; Di Pace, R				Memoli, Silvio; Cantarella, Giulio E.; de Luca, Stefano; Di Pace, Roberta			Network signal setting design with stage sequence optimisation	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Network signal setting design; Scheduled synchronisation; Stage based methods; Macroscopic traffic flow modelling; Meta-heuristics	TRAFFIC CONTROL; ROUTE CHOICE; MODEL; INTERSECTION	One of the most straightforward short term policies to mitigate urban traffic congestion is control through traffic lights at a single junction or network level. Existing approaches for single junction Signal Setting Design (SSD) can be grouped into two classes: Stage-based or Phase-based methods. Both these approaches take the lane marking layouts as exogenous inputs, but lane-based optimisation method may be found in literature, even though for isolated signal-controlled junctions only. The Network Signal Setting Design (NSSD) requires that offsets are introduced; a traffic flow model is also needed to compute total delay. All existing methods for NSSD follow a stage-based approach; these methods do not allow for stage matrix optimisation: it is shown that explicit enumeration of stage sequences is only practicable for very small networks. This paper focuses on Network Signal Setting Design introducing the so-called scheduled synchronisation that includes green scheduling, green timing and coordination into one optimisation problem. The paper proposes a stage-based method to solve such a problem, as an extension of the synchronisation method and the traffic flow model proposed in Cantarella et al. (2015): first a set of candidate stages is defined for each junction, then the stage sequences, the stage lengths and the offsets are optimised all together. To the authors' knowledge, no other one-step optimisation method is available in literature for scheduled synchronisation. Results of the proposed method to a small network were compared with those from explicit enumeration of all stage sequences; results for a larger network are also discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zheng, YN; Elefteriadou, L				Zheng, Yinan; Elefteriadou, Lily			A model of pedestrian delay at unsignalized intersections in urban networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Pedestrian delay; Renewal theory; Urban networks	SINGLE-LANE ROUNDABOUTS; HEADWAY DISTRIBUTION	Delay is an important performance measure for pedestrian crossings considering their interactions with other road users. This study provides an improved analytical model to mathematically estimate pedestrian delay using renewal theory, which considers driver yielding and vehicle platooning. A generalized model is first provided to accommodate different traffic flow and driver behavior assumptions. Then the proposed model is developed on the basis of a mixture of free traffic and platooned traffic with consideration of driver yielding behaviors to better replicate field conditions in an urban setting. A second application using the HCM 2010 assumptions is also derived to compare it to the HCM 2010 model. Lastly, field data were collected and used for validation from two locations: Gainesville, FL and Washington, D.C. A simulation via MATLAB is performed to evaluate the model results for a variety of cases. The comparisons to the field data as well as the simulation confirm the applicability and accuracy of the proposed model.

This growth rate has caused a negative impact on the smooth flow of traffic system. The aim of this paper is to provide a solution to facilitate the car-based commuters to pick the route with minimal bottlenecks and to minimize the distance to reach the destination. The proposed solution is to manage and control the traffic system in the city of Islamabad. The current traffic data collection system in Islamabad and other urban areas does not provide timely and reliable data that can be useful to the Regional Transportation Authority for planning activities. To overcome this problem, our approach is based on collecting the missing data using a custom-built mobile app. Our system analyses and manipulates the collected information based on artificial neural network scheme that can indicate the bottlenecks for each route and predicts the shortest route based on the user's severity levels. To validate our proposed approach, we tested six different randomly selected routes in Islamabad with different bottlenecks.

J	Guclu, OE; Cetek, C				Guclu, Orhan Ertugrul; Cetek, Cem			Analysis of aircraft ground traffic flow and gate utilisation using a hybrid dynamic gate and taxiway assignment algorithm	AERONAUTICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						airport capacity management; aircraft parking position assignment; aircraft ground movement planning; fast-time simulation modelling; hybrid dynamic system	AIRPORT TERMINALS; SIMULATION	The rapid increase in the demand for air transportation over the last four decades has led to serious capacity problems for both the airside and landside components of major airports. The efficient management of existing airside resources seems to be the most effective and practical approach to overcome these capacity and traffic flow problems. Although integrated management of aircraft parking position assignments and ground movement planning processes are vital for the effective use of resources and for efficient operations, the current practice is that these processes are handled separately by different agents. This study proposes a hybrid dynamic system, an integrated methodology of taxi path and gate assignment using a knowledge-based decision-making approach to model effectively time-variant and realistic operational features of aircraft gate management and route planning. The model assigns the most suitable parking positions with minimum taxi time and taxi delay among a reduced solution set, satisfying pre-defined decision criteria as well as monitoring ground movements and, if necessary, reassigning new taxi paths and parking positions in real time. Both the proposed integrated methodology and the separate gate assignment and ground management operations currently in use were implemented, analysed and compared in a fast-time simulation model of Istanbul Ataturk Airport (LTBA). The hybrid dynamic assignment model provided significant improvements in taxi times, ground delays and gate utilisation.

The complex traffic flow at road intersections makes the prediction of traffic noise challenging. In this paper, a dynamic traffic noise simulation method based on microscopic traffic simulation is used to study the traffic noise near roundabout and signalized intersections. A vehicle noise emission model that considers the effect of acceleration is established using an experimental method. The accuracy of the model is verified by comparison with measured data. Traffic noise near roundabout and signalized intersections under different traffic volume levels is simulated, and the results are compared. Some significant relations between traffic noise and traffic volume are obtained, and the mechanisms are analyzed. The results show that traffic noise reaches an upper limit when traffic is saturated, and the noise energy contribution of the exit lane is far greater than that of the entrance lane.

The basic objective of this study is to use simple and practical models to analyze traffic accidents, employing similar factors used by studies conducted in developed countries. The data collected at 107 road segments between the years 2008 and 2010 in Eskisehir (Turkey), include accidents with fatalities and injuries. Two sets of models have been developed: the first set uses binary logit models of traffic safety and the second set uses count data regression models to estimate occurrences of different accident types. Both sets consider three accident types: pedestrian-vehicle, vehicle-vehicle, and all accidents combined. Explanatory variables used in those models are derived from ambient land use characteristics, road segment properties, and traffic flow characteristics. Based on the results and our accompanying discussion, we outlined three types of direct policy implications. First, public transit should be regulated by relocating public transportation stations and by taking safety measures around stations. Second, traffic conditions and street networks should be improved by coordinating urban planning, street design, and transportation planning activities. Third, land use decisions should be reviewed focusing on taking precautions in areas associated with accident-increasing variables, rather than changing mixed land uses to monotonous land uses.

This has led to an increase in the level of road noise and a stronger impact on the quality of the environment. Noise pollution generated by means of transport represents one of the most important types of pollution with negative effects on a population's health in large urban areas. As a consequence, tolerable limits of sound intensity for the comfort of inhabitants have been determined worldwide and the generation of sound maps has been made compulsory in order to identify the vulnerable zones and to make recommendations how to decrease the negative impact on humans. In this context, the present study aims at presenting a GIS spatial analysis model-based methodology for identifying and mapping zones vulnerable to noise pollution. The developed GIS model is based on the analysis of all the components influencing sound propagation, represented as vector databases (points of sound intensity measurements, buildings, lands use, transport infrastructure), raster databases (DEM), and numerical databases (wind direction and speed, sound intensity). Secondly, the hourly changes (for representative hours) were analysed to identify the hotspots characterised by major traffic flows specific to rush hours. The validated results of the model are represented by GIS databases and useful maps for the local public administration to use as a source of information and in the process of making decisions.

F.; van Arem, Bart			Driving Characteristics and Adaptive Cruise Control - A Naturalistic Driving Study	IEEE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MAGAZINE			English	Article							TRAFFIC FLOW EFFICIENCY; CONTROL ACC; IMPACT	With the increasing number of vehicles equipped with Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), it becomes important to assess its impact on traffic flow efficiency, in particular with respect to capacity and queue discharge rate. Simulation studies and surveys suggest that ACC has both positive and negative effects on traffic flow, but empirical evidence on this topic is scarce. A naturalistic driving study has been conducted with 8 participants who drove their own ACC-equipped vehicle during their regular trips on freeways for a period of 4 to 5 weeks. We measured spacing, headway, speed, acceleration, lane use, and the number of lane changes, and compared these between ACC On and ACC Off in different traffic states, for a total of 48 hours of driving data. Results show that with ACC On, average spacing and headways were larger, whereas standard deviations were smaller. Larger headways can be assumed to reduce capacity, whereas more constant spacing, headway, speed, and acceleration indicate more stable traffic. With ACC On, drivers performed 36% fewer lane changes in saturated traffic, resulting in increased use of either the faster or the slower lane, depending on the driver. Furthermore we found that headways were smaller with ACC On than ACC Off when only selecting accelerations below -0.5m/s(2) and above 0.5m/s(2), which is the opposite of the overall finding. The latter result suggests that ACC has an important limitation: a lack of anticipation. On the other hand, the smaller headways with ACC On during acceleration indicate an increased queue discharge rate.

Modelling Dependence between Traffic Noise and Traffic Flow through An Entropy-Copula Method	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						acoustic measurement; traffic noise; entropy; copula; multivariate analysis; uncertainty	WATER-RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; INFORMATION-THEORY; PREDICTION; DISTRIBUTIONS; SIMULATION; TESTS; RIVER	In this study, an entropy-copula method is proposed for modelling dependence between traffic volume and traffic noise on the Trans-Canada Highway (#1 highway of Canada) in the City of Regina based on a series of field experiment measurements. The proposed entropy-copula method combines the maximum entropy and copula methods into a general framework. The marginal distributions of traffic volume and traffic noise are estimated through the principle of maximum entropy (POME) theory, and the joint probabilities are derived through the Gaussian and Student t copulas. The underlying assumptions of the coupled entropy-copula method are that: i) the entropy variables are mutually independent from each other, and ii) the marginal distributions of traffic flow and traffic noise are continuous. The proposed method is applied to two field experiment sites on the Trans-Canada Highway. Based on the K-S and A-D tests and RMSE value, the entropy method shows well performance in quantifying the probability distributions of traffic volume and traffic noise. Meanwhile, both the Gaussian and Student t copulas can well model the joint probability distributions of the traffic volume and traffic noise at the both experiment sites, which is demonstrated by the Cramer von Mises statistics and the RMSE value. Furthermore, the conditional CDFs of the traffic noise at the two experiment sites are derived based on the established copulas with respect to different traffic volume scenarios. These conditional CDFs indicate positive structures between traffic volume and traffic noise at the both experiment sites. The conditional PDFs of the traffic noise under different traffic flow scenarios are also generated, indicating the potential reduction effect of traffic noise due to the decrease of the traffic volume. This proposed approach can quantify the dependence between traffic flow and traffic noise, and reveal the inherent uncertain relationship between these two variables. Moreover, the obtained results can provide useful information for traffic noise reduction through traffic flow management.	[Huang, K.; Dai, L.

Deep learning for short-term traffic flow prediction	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Traffic Flows; Deep Learning; Trend filtering; Sparse linear models	TRAVEL-TIME PREDICTION; NEURAL-NETWORK; SERIES MODELS; SPACE	We develop a deep learning model to predict traffic flows. The main contribution is development of an architecture that combines a linear model that is fitted using l(1) regularization and a sequence of tanh layers. The challenge of predicting traffic flows are the sharp non-linearities due to transitions between free flow, breakdown, recovery and congestion. We show that deep learning architectures can capture these nonlinear spatio-temporal effects. The first layer identifies spatio-temporal relations among predictors and other layers model nonlinear relations. We illustrate our methodology on road sensor data from Interstate I-55 and predict traffic flows during two special events; a Chicago Bears football game and an extreme snowstorm event. Both cases have sharp traffic flow regime changes, occurring very suddenly, and we show how deep learning provides precise short term traffic flow predictions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Spacial and dynamic energy demand of the E39 highway - Implications on electrification options	APPLIED ENERGY			English	Article						Power; Electricity consumption; Case study; Electric vehicle; Modelling; Road	POWER-TO-GAS; ELECTRICITY SYSTEM; LIQUID FUELS; VEHICLES; IMPACTS; STORAGE; CYCLE	The aims of this study were to investigate how the energy demand from transportation on a road varies over time and with location, and to identify the impacts from electrification of the road on the stationary electricity system, assuming different electrification options and drivetrains. European highway route 39 (E39) in western Norway is used as a case study. A vehicle model, together with an analysis of detailed traffic data was used to estimate the energy and power demands for transportation work on E39. This study shows that a road with the characteristics of E39 exhibits large variation in the spatial and time distributions of its energy and power demands. The yearly electricity demand for E39, assuming a full electrification of the current traffic flow is comparable to that of a larger industry, such that the peak power demand for the dimensioning hour of the regional electricity system could be increased by 1-2% if static or electric road systems is applied. However, if all the main roads in Norway were installed with electric road systems, the corresponding peak power increase is 7%. In comparison, if instead using an indirect strategy for electrification of transportation via for instance hydrogen or synthetic diesel, the annual electricity demand for E39 would increase even further, albeit with the possibility to distribute such demand both geographically area and in time compared to electric road systems or static charging.

Traffic evacuation time under nonhomogeneous conditions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INJURY CONTROL AND SAFETY PROMOTION			English	Article						evacuation; time; urban; traffic; nonhomogeneous; street	NETWORK	During many manmade and natural crises such as terrorist threats, floods, hazardous chemical and gas leaks, emergency personnel need to estimate the time in which people can evacuate from the affected urban area. Knowing an estimated evacuation time for a given crisis, emergency personnel can plan and prepare accordingly with the understanding that the actual evacuation time will take longer. Given the urban area to be evacuated, street widths exiting the area's perimeter, the area's population density, average vehicle occupancy, transport mode share and crawl speed, an estimation of traffic evacuation time can be derived. Peak-hour traffic data collected at three, midblock, Mumbai sites of varying geometric features and traffic composition were used in calibrating a model that estimates peak-hour traffic flow rates. Model validation revealed a correlation coefficient of +0.98 between observed and predicted peak-hour flow rates. A methodology is developed that estimates traffic evacuation time using the model.

KdV cnoidal waves in a traffic flow model with periodic boundaries	PHYSICA D-NONLINEAR PHENOMENA			English	Article						KdV; Traffic flow; Cnoidal waves; Periodic boundaries	NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; DENSITY WAVES; MODULATION; EQUATION; SOLITON; JAMS	An optimal-velocity (OV) model describes car motion on a single lane road. In particular, near to the boundary signifying the onset of traffic jams, this model reduces to a perturbed Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation using asymptotic analysis. Previously, the KdV soliton solution has then been found and compared to numerical results (see Muramatsu and Nagatani [1]). Here, we instead apply modulation theory to this perturbed KdV equation to obtain at leading order, the modulated cnoidal wave solution. At the next order, the Whitham equations are derived, which have been modified due to the equation perturbation terms. Next, from this modulation system, a family of spatially periodic cnoidal waves are identified that characterise vehicle headway distance. Then, for this set of solutions, we establish the relationship between the wave speed, the modulation term and the driver sensitivity. This analysis is confirmed with comparisons to numerical solutions of the OV model. As well, the long-time behaviour of these solutions is investigated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wu, CX; Zhang, P				Wu, Chun-Xiu; Zhang, Peng			Solitary wave solution to a class of higher-order viscous traffic flow model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B			English	Article						Higher-order traffic flow model; reduction perturbation method; KdV solitary wave; WENO scheme	DIAGRAM	Traveling waves of a class of higher-order traffic flow models with viscosity are studied with the reduction perturbation method, which leads to the well-known Kortweg de Vries equation and the approximate solitary wave solution to the model. The fifth-order accuracy weighted essentially nonoscillatory scheme is adopted for comparison between the analytical and numerical results. The numerical tests show that the solitary wave evolves with little deformation of its profile and that a globally perturbed equilibrium traffic state is able to evolve into a profile similar to that of a solitary wave, which is identified by the same total number of vehicles on the ring road. These results are compared with those in the literature and demonstrate that the approximation to the model is more accurate.

J	Wei, FL; Wang, ZY; Lu, J				Wei, Fulu; Wang, Zhenyu; Lu, Jian			Exploring factors contributing to lane changes during left turns on quadruple left-turn lanes at signalized intersections	ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Quadruple left-turn lanes; lane-changing rate; lane-changing interval selection; traffic capacity; traffic safety	BEHAVIOR; WAVES; MODEL; FLOW	Quadruple left-turn lanes are employed gradually at some major intersections in Jilin, China. At these intersections, frequent lane changes during left turns of vehicles can lead to vastly disordered traffic operations. In this study, the factors contributing to lane changes during left turn behaviors at quadruple left-turn lane intersections were interpreted based on a field survey. In total, data on 192 green intervals and 550 individual lane-change behaviors were collected in Changchun, Jilin Province. A lane-changing rate model was established to predict the rate of lane changes during left turns. In addition, an interval selection model was built to estimate the probability of lane changes during left turn (from inside to outside only) for an individual vehicle using logistic regression. The two models provide insights to assess the traffic conditions of quadruple left-turn lane at intersections. The results of this study suggest that weaving distance, initial lane, traffic flow rate, and percentage of large vehicles significantly contribute to lane changes during left turn. Based on the identified factors, safety countermeasures to reduce lane changes during left turn behaviors are proposed.

The numerical results show that our model is prominently safer than the FVD (full velocity difference) model, i.e., our model is better than the FVD model from the perspective of the traffic safety, which shows that each driver should consider his two safety distances during his driving process.

However, because traffic data is difficult to collect, previous studies have usually focused on the physical topology of subway systems, whereas few studies have considered the characteristics of traffic flows through the network. Therefore, in this paper, we present a multi-layer model to analyze traffic flow patterns in subway networks, based on trip data and an operation timetable obtained from the Beijing Subway System. We characterize the patterns in terms of the spatiotemporal flow size distributions of both the train flow network and the passenger flow network. In addition, we describe the essential interactions between these two networks based on statistical analyses. The results of this study suggest that layered models of transportation systems can elucidate fundamental differences between the coexisting traffic flows and can also clarify the mechanism that causes these differences.

Vehicular cloud computing has great potential to change the contemporary vehicular communication paradigm. Explicitly, the underutilized resources of vehicles can be shared with other vehicles to manage traffic during congestion. These resources include but are not limited to storage, computing power, and Internet connectivity. This study reviews current traffic management systems to analyze the role and significance of vehicular cloud computing in road traffic management. First, an abstraction of the vehicular cloud infrastructure in an urban scenario is presented to explore the vehicular cloud computing process. A taxonomy of vehicular clouds that defines the cloud formation, integration types, and services is presented. A taxonomy of vehicular cloud services is also provided to explore the object types involved and their positions within the vehicular cloud. A comparison of the current state-of-the-art traffic management systems is performed in terms of parameters, such as vehicular ad hoc network infrastructure, Internet dependency, cloud management, scalability, traffic flow control, and emerging services. Potential future challenges and emerging technologies, such as the Internet of vehicles and its incorporation in traffic congestion control, are also discussed. Vehicular cloud computing is envisioned to have a substantial role in the development of smart traffic management solutions and in emerging Internet of vehicles.

J	Ermagun, A; Chatterjee, S; Levinson, D				Ermagun, Alireza; Chatterjee, Snigdhansu; Levinson, David			Using temporal detrending to observe the spatial correlation of traffic	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FLOW; PREDICTION; MULTIVARIATE; NETWORK; VOLUME	This empirical study sheds light on the spatial correlation of traffic links under different traffic regimes. We mimic the behavior of real traffic by pinpointing the spatial correlation between 140 freeway traffic links in a major sub-network of the Minneapolis-St. Paul freeway system with a grid-like network topology. This topology enables us to juxtapose the positive and negative correlation between links, which has been overlooked in short-term traffic forecasting models. To accurately and reliably measure the correlation between traffic links, we develop an algorithm that eliminates temporal trends in three dimensions: (1) hourly dimension, (2) weekly dimension, and (3) system dimension for each link. The spatial correlation of traffic links exhibits a stronger negative correlation in rush hours, when congestion affects route choice. Although this correlation occurs mostly in parallel links, it is also observed upstream, where travelers receive information and are able to switch to substitute paths. Irrespective of the time-of-day and day-of-week, a strong positive correlation is witnessed between upstream and downstream links. This correlation is stronger in uncongested regimes, as traffic flow passes through consecutive links more quickly and there is no congestion effect to shift or stall traffic. The extracted spatial correlation structure can augment the accuracy of short-term traffic forecasting models.

The antipersistence of traffic flow time series has been found for many data sets, but its relevance for congestion has been overseen. Based on empirical data from motorways in Germany, we study how antipersistence of traffic flow time-series impacts the duration of traffic congestion on a wide range of time scales. We find a large number of short-lasting traffic jams, which implies a large risk for rear-end collisions.

Consensus-Based Cooperative Control Based on Pollution Sensing and Traffic Information for Urban Traffic Networks	SENSORS			English	Article						air pollution monitoring; cooperative systems; discrete event systems; traffic sensing; urban traffic network		Nowadays many studies are being conducted to develop solutions for improving the performance of urban traffic networks. One of the main challenges is the necessary cooperation among different entities such as vehicles or infrastructure systems and how to exploit the information available through networks of sensors deployed as infrastructures for smart cities. In this work an algorithm for cooperative control of urban subsystems is proposed to provide a solution for mobility problems in cities. The interconnected traffic lights controller (TLC) network adapts traffic lights cycles, based on traffic and air pollution sensory information, in order to improve the performance of urban traffic networks. The presence of air pollution in cities is not only caused by road traffic but there are other pollution sources that contribute to increase or decrease the pollution level. Due to the distributed and heterogeneous nature of the different components involved, a system of systems engineering approach is applied to design a consensus-based control algorithm. The designed control strategy contains a consensus-based component that uses the information shared in the network for reaching a consensus in the state of TLC network components. Discrete event systems specification is applied for modelling and simulation. The proposed solution is assessed by simulation studies with very promising results to deal with simultaneous responses to both pollution levels and traffic flows in urban traffic networks.

This study proposes a minimum investment model for optimal traffic network sensor layout, which considers the spatial distribution characteristics of traffic information, homogeneity of various link locations, and total project costs. The model divides a road network into link sections and network nodes and determines the key points. Through segmentation, the model simplifies the network optimisation problem into a multi-section optimisation problem, and the model is tested and validated in a field test for a typical road network consisting of an expressway and several arterial roads in Beijing. It is shown that the proposed model effectively solves the network sensor location problem for traffic information acquisition. While comprehensive and reliable traffic information is obtained at any given location in the road network to meet the practical engineering requirements, this model produces sensor layout strategies with minimum cost, and provides guidance for engineering applications in the field. Finally, by analysing the sensitivity of model parameters, some recommended sensor layout strategies are proposed to reduce the investment cost and provide a decision-making basis for traffic information acquisition implementation and fine traffic management.

J	Wang, LB; Jiang, PW				Wang, Ling-bo; Jiang, Pei-wen			Numerical computation for vibration characteristics of long-span bridges with considering vehicle-wind coupling excitations based on finite element and neural network models	JOURNAL OF VIBROENGINEERING			English	Article						long-span bridges; vehicle-bridge-wind coupling vibration; CA random traffic flow; fluctuation wind time-history; neural network model; finite element model	STEEL BRIDGES; FLUCTUATIONS	CA (Cellular Automaton) model was applied to the simulation of random traffic flow to develop a model considering the randomness of traffic flow and apply it to wind-vehicle-bridge coupling vibration. Finite element and neural network models were adopted respectively to numerically compute the vibration characteristics of bridges under wind and vehicle loads, verify the correctness of model. Subspace iteration method was used for the modal analysis of bridges. Natural frequencies of the top 8 orders were 0.21 Hz, 0.27 Hz, 0.36 Hz, 0.45 Hz, 0.56 Hz, 0.66 Hz, 0.87 Hz and 1.02 Hz respectively. The vibration frequency of the long-span bridge was consistent with the vibration characteristics of large-scale complex structures. Natural modes mainly reflected the torsion and bending of main beam and the swinging vibration of side and main towers. Fluctuation wind time-history presented periodic characteristics. The maximum and minimum values of fluctuation wind were about 20 m/s and -20 m/s respectively. The target and simulation values of power spectral density of wind speed were basically the same in change trend, which indicated that the fluctuation wind time-history computed in this paper was reliable. The model of dense traffic flow based on CA more truly described the running status like accelerating, decelerating and changing lanes of vehicles on the bridge, also contained the density information of vehicles and more truly reflected traffic characteristics. Vibration accelerations of the long-span bridge were symmetrically distributed. Vibration acceleration of central position in the left main span was the largest and near 50 cm/s(2); vibration acceleration on the main tower was the smallest. The curve of vibration displacement with considering wind loads presented some fluctuations, while the vibration displacement of bridges without considering wind loads was very smooth. In addition, the amplitude of vibration displacement without considering wind loads moved laterally towards the left compared with that with considering wind loads. Therefore, wind loads must be considered when the vibration characteristics of the long-span bridge were computed. Otherwise, the accuracy of computational results would be reduced. It only took 0.5 hours to use neural network to predict the vibration acceleration of the long-span bridge. In the case of the same computer performance, it took 5 hours to use finite element model to predict the vibration acceleration of the long-span bridge. The advantage of neural network model in predicting the performance of large-scale complex structures like a long-span bridge could be obviously found. In the future, we will consider using neural network model to systematically study and optimize the long-span bridge.

Through the study of the existing traffic flow prediction model, road traffic flow control model with the slope of the change rate is proposed. The model can find out abnormal point from the traffic flow time series by the use of the slope change rate, and it can analyse this trend of traffic flow changes for control purposes of traffic flow.

J	Osorio, C; Selvam, KK				Osorio, Carolina; Selvam, Krishna Kumar			Simulation-Based Optimization: Achieving Computational Efficiency Through the Use of Multiple Simulators	TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						simulation-based optimization; stochastic traffic simulation; traffic signal control	URBAN-TRANSPORTATION PROBLEMS; TRAFFIC FLOW	Transportation agencies often resort to the use of traffic simulation models to evaluate the impacts of changes in network design or network operations. They often have multiple traffic simulation tools that cover the network area where changes are to be made. These multiple simulators may differ in their modeling assumptions (e.g., macroscopic versus microscopic), in their reliability (e.g., quality of their calibration), as well as in their modeling scale (e.g., city-scale versus regional-scale). The choice of which simulation model to rely on, let alone of how to combine their use, is intricate. A larger-scale model may, for instance, capture more accurately the local-global interactions; yet may do so at a greater computational cost. This paper proposes an optimization framework that enables multiple simulation models to be jointly and efficiently used to address continuous urban transportation optimization problems. We propose a simulation-based optimization algorithm that embeds information from both a high-accuracy low-efficiency simulator and a low-accuracy high-efficiency simulator. At every iteration, the algorithm decides which simulator to evaluate. This decision is based on an analytical approximation of the accuracy loss as a result of running the lower-accuracy model. We formulate an analytical expression that is based on a differentiable and computationally efficient to evaluate traffic assignment model. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm with a traffic signal control problem on both a small network and a city network. We show that the proposed algorithm identifies signal plans with excellent performance, and can do so at a significantly lower computational cost than when systematically running the high-accuracy simulator. The proposed methodology contributes to enable large-scale high-resolution traffic simulation models to be used efficiently for simulation-based optimization. More broadly, it enables the use of multiple simulation models that may differ, for instance, in their scale, their resolution, or their computational costs, to be used jointly for optimization.

In this study, the effect of live load on simply supported bridges was investigated by considering these parameters. The parameters namely weight, speed, longitudinal following space, and vehicle occupancy ratio on different driving lanes are considered using different numerical models. Then, the random traffic flow is simulated using Monte Carlo method based on Nan-xi Yangzi River Bridge's weigh-in-motion system data. Finite element models are established for six types of simply supported beam bridges with the span ranging from 6 to 40 m and transient analysis is simulated under the traffic loading. Subsequently, the maximum value distribution of live load for lifetime is obtained for the collected data by the method of extrapolation. This study shows that the mean value of the live load for the simply supported beam bridges under a random traffic flow is lower than the permissible design load as per American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials; however, it is higher than the permissible design load as per BS5400, and it is 0.82 times the Highway-I standard load.

A virtual spring is used to describe the storage and release of psychological potential energy. Under the aforementioned conditions, we established a macroscopic traffic flow model with conservation law. Each parameter in the new model is physically meaningful and explicit. Additionally, the model can fit field data consistently well, both in free-flow and congested situations. The results of this paper prove the rationality of the energy conservation concept in traffic flow, which improves the understanding of traffic flow and provides a new theoretical foundation.

Toward Mitigating Phantom Jam Using Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Terms-Intelligent transportation systems; phantom jams; three-phase traffic theory; traffic jams; vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication	ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; 3-PHASE TRAFFIC THEORY; CONGESTION; MODEL; FLOW; DESIGN; IMPACT	Traffic jams often occur without any obvious reasons such as traffic accidents, roadwork, or closed lanes. Under moderate to high traffic density, minor perturbations to traffic flow (e.g., a strong braking motion) are easily amplified into a wave of stop-and-go traffic. This is known as a phantom jam. In this paper, we aim to mitigate phantom jams leveraging the three-phase traffic theory and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. More specifically, an efficient phantom jam control protocol is proposed in which a fuzzy inference system is integrated with a V2V-based phantom jam detection algorithm to effectively capture the dynamics of traffic jams. Per-lane speed difference under traffic congestion is taken into account in the protocol design, so that a phantom jam is controlled separately for each lane, improving the performance of the proposed protocol. We implemented the protocol in the Jist/SWAN traffic simulator. Simulations with artificially generated traffic data and real-world traffic data collected from vehicle loop detectors on Interstate 880, California, USA, demonstrate that our approach has by up to 9% and 4.9% smaller average travel times (at penetration rates of 10%) compared with a state-of-the-art approach, respectively.

Comparing traffic state estimators for mixed human and automated traffic flows	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Traffic state estimation; Automated vehicles; Second order traffic flow model	ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; PARTICLE FILTER; KALMAN FILTER; HIGHWAY; VEHICLES; SYSTEMS; WAVES	This article addresses the problem of modeling and estimating traffic streams with mixed human operated and automated vehicles. A connection between the generalized Aw Rascle Zhang model and two class traffic flow motivates the choice to model mixed traffic streams with a second order traffic flow model. The traffic state is estimated via a fully nonlinear particle filtering approach, and results are compared to estimates obtained from a particle filter applied to a scalar conservation law. Numerical studies are conducted using the Aimsun micro simulation software to generate the true state to be estimated. The experiments indicate that when the penetration rate of automated vehicles in the traffic stream is variable, the second order model based estimator offers improved accuracy compared to a scalar modeling abstraction. When the variability of the penetration rate decreases, the first order model based filters offer similar performance. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Suen, JY; Navlakha, S				Suen, Jonathan Y.; Navlakha, Saket			Using Inspiration from Synaptic Plasticity Rules to Optimize Traffic Flow in Distributed Engineered Networks	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							SPIKE; CONVERGENCE; DEPRESSION; ALGORITHMS; NEURONS	Controlling the flow and routing of data is a fundamental problem in many distributed networks, including transportation systems, integrated circuits, and the Internet. In the brain, synaptic plasticity rules have been discovered that regulate network activity in response to environmental inputs, which enable circuits to be stable yet flexible. Here, we develop a new neuro-inspired model for network flow control that depends only on modifying edge weights in an activity-dependent manner. We show how two fundamental plasticity rules, long-term potentiation and long-term depression, can be cast as a distributed gradient descent algorithm for regulating traffic flow in engineered networks. We then characterize, both by simulation and analytically, how different forms of edge-weight-update rules affect network routing efficiency and robustness. We find a close correspondence between certain classes of synaptic weight-update rules derived experimentally in the brain and rules commonly used in engineering, suggesting common principles to both.

Scenario-based analysis of traffic-related PM2.5 concentration: Lisbon case study	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						PM2.5 concentration; Scenarios; Urban policies; Modeling; LEZ; Cordon toll	LOW-EMISSION ZONES; AIR-POLLUTION; PARTICULATE MATTER; HEALTH; EXPOSURE; QUALITY; FINE	Air quality in urban centers constitutes a challenge ahead for most cities. For this reason, the objective of this research work was to evaluate the impacts of changing traffic-related parameters on particulate matter (PM) concentration for several hierarchical street levels using real-world data for the city of Lisbon, Portugal. For that purpose, 2014 data regarding meteorological conditions, traffic volumes, typical vehicle speed, and a vehicle representative of the fleet was used in an air quality dispersion model (CALINE4). The available data allowed building a baseline case for several streets that are representative of the traffic circulation conditions in Lisbon, which was compared with different scenarios: hypothetical introduction of a cordon toll (S1.1 to S1.4) and the implementation of a low emission zone (S2.1 and 2.2). The results indicate that reductions on PM2.5 concentrations from 5 to 42 % may be obtained from the implementation of the scenarios. Overall, this study demonstrates that modeling tools based on real-world data can provide a good approach to study urban policies regarding traffic-related PM exposure. Additionally, implementation of such measures requires an integrated strategy that enables proper enforcement and monitoring, as well as an adequate management of traffic flows between the implementation boundaries.

SesToCross is based on a semantic expert system devoted to the intelligent management of crossroads without requiring any centralized reasoning process. SesToCross gives intelligence to each vehicle involved in the cross-road applying an ontology (CrossRoad) implemented at every single vehicle, providing a common semantic over a global and distributed architecture. SesToCross recommends, in real time, to the drivers the best choice to cross safely the intersection in an intuitive, simple, and informative, but not distractive, way. SesToCross is described, developed, and validated on real circumstances and scenarios.

The electricity demand at each charging/swapping facility is influenced by the arrival rates and charging requests of electric vehicles, which further depends on the spatial distribution of traffic flows over the entire transportation system. We consider the impact of the road congestion on route choices of vehicles from a system-level perspective. The traffic flow pattern in steady state is characterized by the Wardrop user equilibrium. We consider the PDN load perturbation caused by the traffic demand uncertainty, and propose a robust dispatch method that maintains the feasibility of an alternating current power flow constraints. By applying the convex relaxation to nonlinear branch power flow equations, the proposed model yields a two-stage robust convex optimization problem with an implicit uncertainty set. Moreover, a decomposition framework is proposed, in which the first phase determines the uncertainty set of electricity demand by solving two traffic assignment problems associated with the extreme scenarios, and the second phase solves a two-stage robust second-order cone program following a delayed constraint generation framework. Several issues regarding the scalability and conservatism are elaborated. Case studies corroborate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed method.

J	Wen, TH; Chin, WCB; Lai, PC				Wen, Tzai-Hung; Chin, Wei-Chien-Benny; Lai, Pei-Chun			Understanding the topological characteristics and flow complexity of urban traffic congestion	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic congestion; PageRank algorithm; Network topology; Mobility	TRANSPORTATION; CENTRALITY; MODELS	For a growing number of developing cities, the capacities of streets cannot meet the rapidly growing demand of cars, causing traffic congestion. Understanding the spatial temporal process of traffic flow and detecting traffic congestion are important issues associated with developing sustainable urban policies to resolve congestion. Therefore, the objective of this study is to propose a flow-based ranking algorithm for investigating traffic demands in terms of the attractiveness of street segments and flow complexity of the street network based on turning probability. Our results show that, by analyzing the topological characteristics of streets and volume data for a small fraction of street segments in Taipei City, the most congested segments of the city were identified successfully. The identified congested segments are significantly close to the potential congestion zones, including the officially announced most congested streets, the segments with slow moving speeds at rush hours, and the areas near significant landmarks. The identified congested segments also captured congestion-prone areas concentrated in the business districts and industrial areas of the city. Identifying the topological characteristics and flow complexity of traffic congestion provides network topological insights for sustainable urban planning, and these characteristics can be used to further understand congestion propagation.

This paper deals with the user equilibrium (UE) problems for the mixed BEVs and traditional gasoline vehicles (GVs) in transportation networks with battery swapping stations and road grade constraints. Under the assumption that electricity consumption rate is not affected by traveling speed or traffic flow, a nonlinear minimization model in terms of path flows is first formulated by incorporating effects of road grade on the electricity consumption rate. The battery swapping action based paths are defined for BEVs in the represented network to facilitate the model building with flow dependent dwell time at the battery swapping stations. The Frank-Wolfe (F-W) algorithm, where descent direction is found by the multi-label method in a pseudo-polynomial time, is adopted to solve the model. Moreover, the aforementioned assumption about the flow independent electricity consumption rate is then relaxed and a system of inequalities has been proposed to formulate the UE conditions. For the nonlinear minimization model, two numerical examples are presented to assess the propose model and algorithm, as well as to analyze the impact of usable battery capacity, BEVs' market share and some attributes of battery swapping stations on the equilibrium link flows and/or swapping flows. The system of inequalities is exactly solved for a small network by path enumeration to demonstrate the non-uniqueness of UE link flow solutions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We develop a macroscopic heterogeneous traffic flow model. This model considers interplay of multiple vehicle classes, each of which is assumed to possess homogeneous car-following behavior and vehicle attributes. We propose the concepts of road capacity split and perceived equivalent density for each class to model both lateral and longitudinal cross-class interactions across neighboring cells. Rather than leveraging hydrodynamic analogies, it establishes pragmatic cross-class interaction rules aspired by capacity allocation and approximate inter-cell fluxes. This model generalizes the classical Cell Transmission Model (CTM) to three types of traffic regimes in general, i.e. free flow, semi-congestion, and full congestion regimes. This model replicates prominent empirical characteristics exhibited by mixed vehicular flow, including formation and spatio-temporal propagation of shockwaves, vehicle overtaking, as well as oscillatory waves. Those features are validated against numerical experiments and the NGSIM 1-80 data. Realistic class-specific travel times can be computed from this model efficiently, which demonstrates the feasibility of applying this multi-class model to large-scale real-world networks.

J	Ma, Z; Xie, JB; Qi, X; Xu, YM; Sun, J				Ma, Zian; Xie, Jianbo; Qi, Xiao; Xu, Yiming; Sun, Jian			Two-Dimensional Simulation of Turning Behavior in Potential Conflict Area of Mixed-Flow Intersections	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							SOCIAL FORCE MODEL; SHARED SPACE; PEDESTRIANS; VEHICLE	The potential conflict area of intersection is the space where conflicting traffic flows pass through in the same signal phase. At this area, turning vehicles interact with most traffic flows, which introduce complex features including variation of trajectories and shared-priority phenomenon. The traditional one-dimensional simulation oversimplifies these features with lane-based assumption. This study integrates the modified social force model with behavior decision and movement constraints to reproduce the two-dimensional turning process. The method is framed into a three-layered mathematical model. First, the decision layer dynamically makes decision for turning patterns. Then the operation layer uses the modified social force model to initially generate vehicle movements. Finally, the constraint layer modifies the vehicular motion with vehicle dynamics constraints, boundary of intersection and the collision avoidance rule. The proposed model is validated using trajectories of left-turn vehicles at a real-world mixed-flow intersection with nonprotected signal phases, resulting in a more realistic simulation than previous methods. The distributions of decision points and travel time in simulation are compared with the empirical data in statistics. Moreover, the spatial distribution of simulated trajectories is also satisfactory.

J	Tang, TQ; Zhang, J; Liu, K				Tang, Tie-Qiao; Zhang, Jian; Liu, Kai			A speed guidance model accounting for the driver's bounded rationality at a signalized intersection	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Speed guidance; Bounded rationality; Fuel consumption; Emissions	CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; CHAIN-REACTION CRASH; TRAFFIC FLOW MODEL; LATTICE MODEL; ROUTE CHOICE; CONTINUUM MODEL; BEHAVIOR; IRREGULARITY; SEQUENCE; JAMS	In this paper, we propose a speed guidance model to explore the influences of the drivers' bounded rationality on the vehicle's fuel consumption and emissions during the whole process of the vehicle passing through the signalized intersection. In the proposed speed guidance model, we apply three parameters (i.e., the response time, acceptance threshold value and execution level) to quantify the driver's bounded rationality. In the numerical tests, we use the signalized intersection (consisting of the Xinan Road and the Wuyi Road in Dalian, China) as the simulation scenario, the Vissim to describe the vehicle's movement and the MOVES (motor vehicle emission simulator) to explore the vehicle's fuel consumption and emissions. The numerical results show that the driver's bounded rationality has prominent effects on the vehicle's fuel consumption and emissions, but the impacts are directly dependent on each parameter of the driver's bounded rationality.

Xiao, H. J. Huang and T. Q. Tang, Mod. Phys. Lett. B 30 (2016) 1650325] to study the effects of road conditions on the electricity consumption of electric vehicular flow during the evolutions of shock, rarefaction wave and small perturbation. The numerical results indicate that road conditions have negative influences on the electricity consumption during the evolutions of shock and rarefaction wave (i.e. the electricity consumption increases when road conditions become better) and positive impacts on the electricity consumption during the evolution of small perturbation when the traffic flow is unstable (i.e. the electricity consumption produces oscillation, but its amplitude decreases when road conditions become better).

Factors influencing vessel traffic flow possess diverse features such as hierarchy, uncertainty, nonlinearity, complexity, and interdependency. To reveal the impact mechanism of the factors influencing vessel traffic flow, a hierarchical model and a coupling model are proposed in this study based on the interpretative structural modeling method. The hierarchical model explains the hierarchies and relationships of the factors using a graph. The coupling model provides a quantitative method that explores interaction effects of factors using a coupling coefficient. The coupling coefficient is obtained by determining the quantitative indicators of the factors and their weights. Thereafter, the data obtained from Port of Tianjin is used to verify the proposed coupling model. The results show that the hierarchical model of the factors influencing vessel traffic flow can explain the level, structure, and interaction effect of the factors; the coupling model is efficient in analyzing factors influencing traffic volumes. The proposed method can be used for analyzing increases in vessel traffic flow in waterway transportation system.

The linear stability condition is derived corresponding to the prevision of headway in moving. The modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation is deduced through the nonlinear analysis. The kink-antikink soliton solution of the mKdV equation can interpret the urban traffic jams near the critical point under the prevision of vehicle headway. Moreover, it is clear that the prevision of headway effect did improve the stability of urban traffic flow since the traffic jams are alleviated efficiently by taking into account the prevision of headway term in numerical simulations, which are consistent with the theoretical analysis.

J	Kumar, P; Krinshnanunni; Arkatkar, S; Joshi, G				Kumar, Pallav; Krinshnanunni; Arkatkar, Shriniwas; Joshi, Gaurang			Examining Microscopic and Macroscopic Traffic Flow Parameters at Diverging Section on Multilane Urban Roads in India	EUROPEAN TRANSPORT-TRASPORTI EUROPEI			English	Article						Heterogeneous traffic; diverging section; time headway distribution; speed distribution; speed-flow relationship		The paper studies traffic flow parameters at diverging section on an urban multilane road in India. The diverging section on multi lane urban roads or national highways in India, is mostly supplemented with a flyover at its downstream. The purpose of providing flyover is that there is provision for vehicles to make U-turn and merge to traffic flowing in different direction. Therefore, for merging manoever, flyover is on upstream side. This study is targeted on studying microscopic and macroscopic traffic flow characteristics at diverging section. For that purpose, videographic survey of traffic flow was done using two cameras on urban multilane road in Delhi. Spot speed data were also collected at upstream and downstream of diverging section using speed radar gun, simultaneously. From the extracted traffic video, flow, headway and speed data were analyzed. It was found that shoulder side lanes have significant proportion of vehicles from all categories because of diverging operation. Speed data was found to be normally distributed across all lanes. Moreover, spot-speed study was conducted at the upstream of diverging (100 m upstream) as well as at the location of diverging section. It showed significant reduction in speeds of different vehicle categories over the section due to presence of diverging operation. Based on fitting of various distribution patterns on headway, it was also found that headway data is either following log-normal or GEV distribution. But, log-normal distribution could not fit for observed headway data for all four lanes in one direction (for eight-lane divided carriageway). Therefore, it was decided to opt for GEV distribution and comparison of observed vs theoretical pattern was plotted on same set of axes. It was found that the difference in shape, scale and location parameters of GEV for Lane 1 (lane closure to median) was minimum and Lane 3 (adjacent to shoulde side lane) was maximum, which shows vehicles from Lane 1 are least affected due to diverging operation, whereas vehicles from Lane-3 are most affected due to diverging manoever. Further, to monitor the change in boundary condition, especially capacity value, speed-flow relationships are compared for with-diverging and withoiut-diverging sections on same roadway. The comparison of speed-flow plots on same set of axes reflects that diverging maneuver of vehicles shows reduction in capacity of about 12%. The findings from this study could be useful for operational analysis and development of simulation model at diverging sections of similar type on multilane urban roads in India.

J	Nguyen-Phuoc, DQ; Currie, G; De Gruyter, C; Young, W				Nguyen-Phuoc, Duy Q.; Currie, Graham; De Gruyter, Chris; Young, William			New method to estimate local and system-wide effects of level rail crossings on network traffic flow	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY			English	Article						Traffic congestion; Level crossing; Travel time; Delay	GRADE CROSSINGS; HIGHWAY; MODEL	This paper makes local and aggregate estimates of the effects of 152 level crossings in the Melbourne metropolitan area, Australia on traffic congestion in the morning peak period (7 am-9 am). A new method, including micro-simulation of a range of rail crossing configurations, is used to inform a network model which makes aggregate estimates of impacts on all traffic. Relationships between train frequency and percentage change in vehicle travel time and volume were identified. These equations can predict change in travel time/traffic flow caused by rail level crossings based on rail crossing closures and train frequency. Overall, Melbourne's level crossings result in an average increase in travel time of 16.1% for vehicle traffic on links with a level crossing. However on average a level crossing reduces the volume of vehicles on these links by 5.9% as a result of traffic diversion. These values are higher in middle suburbs where train arrivals and crossing closure times at level crossings are more frequent. The aggregate effect of all 152 level rail crossings on all traffic in Melbourne is a travel time change from 1.81 to 1.82 min/km (an increase of around 03%). The number of congested links in Melbourne increases by 0.9% while the total delay increases by 0.7%. These network wide effects are not large compared to localised effects because road links affected directly by crossings represent a very small part of the overall network. Additionally, network effects also include traffic diversion impacts which will counteract some of the immediate impacts on a localised scale. However, it is significant that the very small element of the system can have even a measurable effect on aggregate traffic congestion. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For example, the pavement was simplified as a rigid base and the deformation of pavement was ignored. However, the action of deck pavement on the vibration of vehicles or bridges should not be neglected. This study is mainly focused on establishing a new methodology fully considering the effects of bridge deck pavement, probabilistic traffic flows, and varied road roughness conditions. The bridge deck pavement was modeled as a boundless Euler-Bernoulli beam supported on the Kelvin model; the typical traffic flows were simulated by the improved Cellular Automaton (CA) traffic flow model; and the traffic-pavement-bridge coupled equations were established by combining the equations of motion of the vehicles, pavement, and bridge using the displacement and interaction force relationship at the contact locations. The numerical studies show that the proposed method can more rationally simulate the effect of the pavement on the vibrations of bridge and vehicles.

Then we apply this framework to model traffic flow over an urban freeway network by embedding the Cell Transmission Model (CTM) into the DGHA. With a modeling procedure, we adopt a dual digraph of road network structure to describe the road topology, use linear hybrid automata to describe multi-modes of dynamic densities in road segments and transform the nonlinear expressions of the transmitted traffic flow between two road segments into piecewise linear functions in terms of multi-mode switchings. This modeling procedure is modularized and rule-based, and thus is easily-extensible with the help of a combination algorithm for the dynamics of traffic flow. It can describe the dynamics of traffic flow over an urban freeway network with arbitrary topology structures and sizes. Next we analyze mode types and number in the model of the whole freeway network, and deduce a Piecewise Affine Linear System (PWALS) model. Furthermore, based on the PWALS model, a multi-mode switched state observer is designed to estimate the traffic densities of the freeway network, where a set of observer gain matrices are computed by using the Lyapunov function approach. As an example, we utilize the PWALS model and the corresponding switched state observer to traffic flow over Beijing third ring road. In order to clearly interpret the principle of the proposed method and avoid computational complexity, we adopt a simplified version of Beijing third ring road. Practical application for a large-scale road network will be implemented by decentralized modeling approach and distributed observer designing in the future research.

Group-based approach to predictive delay model based on incremental queue accumulations for adaptive traffic control systems	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Incremental queue accumulations; Lane-based control delay; Kalman filter; Adjustment factors; Rolling horizon approach	SATURATED SIGNAL SYSTEMS; LANE-BASED OPTIMIZATION; REAL-TIME ESTIMATION; LENGTH CONSTRAINTS; ROUTE-CHOICE; EXISTENCE; EQUILIBRIUM; ALGORITHM; CAPACITY; DYNAMICS	In this study, we develop a mathematical framework to estimate lane-based incremental queue accumulations with group-based variables and a predictive model of lane-based control delay. Our objective is to establish the rolling horizon approach to lane-based control delay for group-based optimization of signal timings in adaptive traffic control systems. The challenges involved in this task include identification of the most appropriate incremental queue accumulations based on group-based variables for individual lanes to the queueing formation patterns and establishment of the rolling horizon procedure for predicting the future components of lane-based incremental queue accumulations in the time windows. For lane-based estimation of incremental queue accumulations, temporal and spatial information were collected on the basis of estimated lane-based queue lengths from our previous research to estimate lane-based incremental queue accumulations. We interpret the given signal plan as group-based variables, including the start and duration of the effective green time and the cycle time. Adjustment factors are defined to identify the characteristics of the control delay in a specific cycle and to clarify the relationship between group-based variables and the temporal information of queue lengths in the proposed estimation method. We construct the rolling horizon procedure based on Kalman filters with appropriate time windows. Lane-based queue lengths at an inflection point and adjustment factors in the previous cycle are used to estimate the adjustment factors, arrival rates, and discharge rates in the next cycle, in which the predictive computation is performed in the current cycle. In the simulations sets and the case study, the proposed model is robust and accurate for estimation of lane-based control delay under a wide range of traffic conditions. Adjustment factors play a significant role in increasing the accuracy of the proposed model and in classifying queueing patterns in a specific cycle. The Kalman filters enhance the accuracy of the predictions by minimizing the error terms caused by the fluctuation in traffic flow. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Jin, WL				Jin, Wen-Long			A Riemann solver for a system of hyperbolic conservation laws at a general road junction	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Network kinematic wave model; Cell transmission model flux functions; Riemann solver; Stationary states; Critical demand level; Invariant junction model	TRAFFIC FLOW; MODEL; NETWORK; GODUNOV; SCHEMES; WAVES	The kinematic wave model of traffic flow on a road network is a system of hyperbolic conservation laws, for which the Riemann solver is of physical, analytical, and numerical importance. In this paper, we present a new Riemann solver at a general network junction in the demand-supply space. In the Riemann solutions, traffic states on a link include the initial, stationary, and interior states, and a discrete Cell Transmission Model flux function in interior states is used as an entropy condition, which is consistent with fair merging and first-in-first-out diverging rules. After deriving the feasibility conditions for both stationary and interior states, we obtain a set of algebraic equations, and prove that the Riemann solver is well-defined, in the sense that the stationary states, the out-fluxes of upstream links, the in-fluxes of downstream links, and kinematic waves on all links can be uniquely solved. In addition, we show that the resulting global flux function in initial states is the same as the local one in interior states. Hence we presents a new definition of invariant junction models, in which the global and local flux functions are the same. We also present a simplified framework for solving the Riemann problem with invariant junction flux functions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Jin, WL				Jin, Wen-Long			On the stability of stationary states in general road networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Network kinematic wave model; Stationary states; Map in critical demand levels; Criticality of junctions; Stability	TRAFFIC FLOW; KINEMATIC WAVES; HIGHWAY; STATICS	In [Jin, W.-L., 2015. On the existence of stationary states in general road networks. Transportation Research Part B 81, 917-929.], with a discrete map in critical demand levels, it was proved that there exist stationary states for the kinematic wave model of general road networks with constant origin demands, route choice proportions, and destination supplies. In this study we further examine the stability property of stationary states with the same map, and the results will help us to understand the long-term trend of a network traffic system. We first review a network kinematic wave model and properties of stationary states on a link, define the criticality of junctions in stationary states, and discuss information propagation in stationary states on links and junctions. We then present the map and examine information propagation in the map. We apply the map to analytically study the stability of stationary states on ring roads and diverge-merge networks with circular information propagation and compare them with results obtained from the Poincare map [Jin, W.-L., 2013. Stability and bifurcation in network traffic flow: A Poincare map approach. Transportation Research Part B 57, 191-208]. We further study the stability property of general stationary states in a grid network. We find that the stability of fixed points of the map is the same as that of stationary states in a network, and the new approach is more general than the Poincare map approach. We conclude the study with future directions and implications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, two cases of perimeter control inputs are considered: coupled and decoupled control. For both cases, the explicit formulations of the optimal feedback control policies and proofs of optimality are provided for three criteria. The proofs are based on the modified Krotov-Bellman sufficient conditions of optimality, where the upper and lower bounds of state variables are calculated.

To alleviate bottleneck situations, one of the important strategies is to control input rate to suit the state of the road. In this study, we propose an effective velocity control of traveling particles, in which the particle velocity depends on the state of a bottleneck. To analyze our method, we modify the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) and introduce a slow-to-start rule, which we refer to as controlled TASEP in the present paper. Flow improvement is verified in numerical simulations and theoretical analyses by using controlled TASEP.

First, an improved two-lane lattice hydrodynamic traffic flow model is proposed, which is capable of avoiding vehicles backward moving in original lattice hydrodynamic model. Then, the deterministic and stochastic on-ramps are designed and mapped into the new lattice model to reproduce the empirical phenomena. For the stochastic case, many empirical congested patterns are reproduced, such as moving localized cluster, triggered stop-and-go traffic (TSG), pinned localized cluster (PLC), oscillating congested traffic (OCT) and homogeneous congested traffic. For the deterministic case, a number of combination patterns of HST, PLC, TSG and OCT are found. Taken together, these results suggest that the present model is able to predict the congested traffic patterns.

Automated and Cooperative Vehicle Merging at Highway On-Ramps	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Connected and automated vehicles; cooperative driving; cooperative merging control; highway on-ramps; merging highways; vehicle coordination	MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; ALGORITHM; SYSTEMS	Recognition of necessities of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is gaining momentum. CAVs can improve both transportation network efficiency and safety through control algorithms that can harmonically use all existing information to coordinate the vehicles. This paper addresses the problem of optimally coordinating CAVs at merging roadways to achieve smooth traffic flow without stop-and-go driving. We present an optimization framework and an analytical closed-form solution that allows online coordination of vehicles at merging zones. The effectiveness of the efficiency of the proposed solution is validated through a simulation, and it is shown that coordination of vehicles can significantly reduce both fuel consumption and travel time.

Our approach does not rely on traditional expensive infrastructures, but rather on advanced machine learning algorithms. It takes images from traffic cameras at a limited number of locations and estimates the traffic over the entire road network. Our approach features two main algorithms. The first is a probabilistic vehicle counting algorithm fromlow-quality images that falls into the category of unsupervised learning. The other is a network inference algorithm based on an inverse Markov chain formulation that infers the traffic at arbitrary links from a limited number of observations.

A smart, accurate and rapid method was developed specifically for fixed grid sources and receivers(S-R), which consisted of the precomputed S-R attenuations in off-line, dynamic traffic noise simulation in real time and a database to connect two parts together. In off-line part, beam tracing approach was used to simulate sound propagation among buildings, taking multiple reflections and diffractions into consideration. Firstly, the spatial subdivision was used to subdivide 2D space into a series of order triangles, and then beam tracing algorithm recursively traced beams through these triangles, which was represented by beam tree data structure. In real-time part, the dynamic simulation of traffic provides time-variant input of traffic flow parameters to vehicle emission model, which was then assigned to the nearest source. After deducing S-R attenuations from database, dynamic immissions at grid receivers are obtained by summing up sources inside their circular viewport. Therefore, the outputs (L-n, Leq and LNP) were available to assess the noise pollution levels on a spatial and temporal scale. A part of Zhujiang New Town in Guangzhou was chosen as a validation area, measurement results were in general good agreement with simulations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Soriguera, F; Martinez, I; Sala, M; Menendez, M				Soriguera, Francesc; Martinez, Irene; Sala, Marcel; Menendez, Monica			Effects of low speed limits on freeway traffic flow	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Variable speed limits; Freeway capacity; Traffic homogeneity; Lane flow distribution; Lane changing	OPTIMAL COORDINATION; BOTTLENECKS; MODEL; FEATURES; RAMP; PART	Recent years have seen a renewed interest in Variable Speed Limit (VSL) strategies. New opportunities for VSL as a freeway metering mechanism or a homogenization scheme to reduce speed differences and lane changing maneuvers are being explored. This paper examines both the macroscopic and microscopic effects of different speed limits on a traffic stream, especially when adopting low speed limits. To that end, data from a VSL experiment carried out on a freeway in Spain are used. Data include vehicle counts, speeds and occupancy per lane, as well as lane changing rates for three days, each with a different fixed speed limit (80 km/h, 60 km/h, and 40 km/h). Results reveal some of the mechanisms through which VSL affects traffic performance, specifically the flow and speed distribution across lanes, as well as the ensuing lane changing maneuvers. It is confirmed that the lower the speed limit, the higher the occupancy to achieve a given flow. This result has been observed even for relatively high flows and low speed limits. For instance, a stable flow of 1942 veh/h/lane has been measured with the 40 km/h speed limit in force. The corresponding occupancy was 33%, doubling the typical occupancy for this flow in the absence of speed limits. This means that VSL strategies aiming to restrict the mainline flow on a freeway by using low speed limits will need to be applied carefully, avoiding conditions as the ones presented here, where speed limits have a reduced ability to limit flows. On the other hand, VSL strategies trying to get the most from the increased vehicle storage capacity of freeways under low speed limits might be rather promising. Additionally, results show that lower speed limits increase the speed differences across lanes for moderate demands. This, in turn, also increases the lane changing rate. This means that VSL strategies aiming to homogenize traffic and reduce lane changing activity might not be successful when adopting such low speed limits. In contrast, lower speed limits widen the range of flows under uniform lane flow distributions, so that, even for moderate to low demands, the under-utilization of any lane is avoided. These findings are useful for the development of better traffic models that are able to emulate these effects. Moreover, they are crucial for the implementation and assessment of VSL strategies and other traffic control algorithms. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Existing MPC approaches that are based on the second-order traffic flow models suffer from high computation load due to the non-linear and non-convex optimization formulation. In recent years, simplified MPC approaches which are based on discrete first-order traffic flow models have attracted more and more attention because they are beneficial for real-time applications. In literature, the type of traffic jam resolved by these approaches is limited to the standing queue in which the jam head is fixed at the bottleneck. Another type of traffic jam known as the jam wave, has been neglected by the discrete first-order model-based MPC approaches. To fill this gap, we develop a fast MPC approach based on a more accurate discrete first-order model. The model keeps the linear property of the classical discrete first-order model, meanwhile takes traffic flow features of jam waves propagation into consideration. A classical non-linear MPC and a recently proposed linear MPC are compared with the proposed MPC in terms of computation speed and jam wave resolution by a benchmark problem. Simulation results show that the proposed MPC resolves the jam wave with a real-time feasible computation speed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The NDP is often cast in a bilevel programming problem which is known to be NP-hard. In this study, we tackle a special case of the NDP where the decision variables are integers. A variety of exact solutions has been proposed for the discrete NDP, but due to the combinatorial complexity, the literature has yet to address the problem for large-size networks, and accounting for the multimodal and multiclass traffic flows. To this end, the bilevel problem is solved by branch-and-bound. At each node of the search tree, a valid lower bound based on system optimal (SO) traffic flow is calculated. The SO traffic flow is formulated as a mixed integer, non-linear programming (MINLP) problem for which the Benders decomposition method is used. The algorithm is coded on a hybrid and synchronized platform consisting of MATLAB (optimization engine), EMME 3 (transport planning module), MS Access (database), and MS Excel (user interface). The proposed methodology is applied to three examples including Gao's network, the Sioux-Falls network, and a real size network representing the city of Winnipeg, Canada. Numerical tests on the network of Winnipeg at various budget levels have shown promising results.

The stability condition is analysed under which the traffic system is steady running. When our scheme is applied to the discrete car-following model, the stability region could be enlarged effectively. Through simulation, we can obtain the result that our model exhibits a better effect that suppresses traffic jams compared with previous congestion control methods, and simulation outcomes are consistent with the theoretical derivation results. Because of considering information factor of multi-preceding vehicles, our controller is useful for investigation of intelligent transportation systems.

The proposed model is based on the optimal velocity function by taking into account two additional stimuli generated by adjacent pedestrians, i.e., the lateral and longitudinal headways between the observed car and the preceding pedestrian. By using the linear stability theory, this paper first derives the stability condition and plots the neutral stability curves with the model-related parameters. Then through the reductive perturbation method, we obtain the soliton solution of the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation near the critical point and depict the coexisting curve which divides the traffic flow state into three types (i.e., stable, metastable and unstable state) along with the corresponding neutral stability curve. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model can effectively characterize traffic following behaviors under the mixed-pedestrian-vehicle situation.

Wireless monitoring and tracking system for vehicles: A study case in an urban scenario	SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY			English	Article						Smart city; Smart Traffic; Urban traffic monitoring; Wireless monitoring systems; Traffic tracking systems; Traffic forecast; Traffic analysis	NEURAL-NETWORKS; TERM; PREDICTION	This paper describes the application of a Wireless Traffic Monitoring and Tracking system in the Spanish city of Granada, as an approach for addressing important tasks in the field of Smart Traffic. To this end, several nodes of the so-called MOBYWIT system have been deployed at important urban points. They collect real-time vehicles' movement information based on Bluetooth signals detection. The gathered data have been processed in several ways, showing some of the applications that the system has, such as the composition of Origin/Destination matrices, the computation of accurate displacement times, or the estimation of real traffic in short terms by means of Time Series Forecast. The obtained results validate the system and proves its value as a tool for the urban traffic flow monitoring, analysis and prediction, which could be used as a part of an intelligent transportation system.

The Winter Model - A new way to calculate socio-economic costs depending on winter maintenance strategy	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Winter Model; Winter road maintenance; Winter strategy; Socio-economic cost		The project "Winter Model" started at the beginning of the 2000s. The idea was to try and predict the consequences of different Winter maintenance strategies and to calculate the associated socio-economic costs. It is now possible to calculate and validate the impact that different winter maintenance measures have on road users, road authorities and local communities. This paper contains results of the first complete Winter Model calculations using existing conditions. Comparisons with different road classification standards have been carried out in order to determine the effect they have on socio-economic costs. Road classification standards dictate how much snow should fall before a maintenance action is initiated and how long it should take until the action is completed. Socio-economic costs increased for all comparisons when reductions in the classification standard were applied. As an example of how costs can vary: the scenario is a salted road using a combined plough and salt spreader where the allowed time to complete the action is 4 h that is changed to an unsalted road with an allowed time to complete the action of 5 h. Both scenarios have an action start criteria of 2 cm deep snow, and an annual average daily traffic flow of 2000. Comparison results show that the change from salted to unsalted road saves the most cost due to a reduction in salt use and required actions. However, the increased time to complete the action will result in slightly longer travel times and accident costs will increase by 24.2%. The extended action hour affect fuel consumption in a positive way, for example, consumption decreases slightly due to driving more often at lower speeds on unclear roads. By lowering the road classification standard like in this example, total socio-economic costs increased by 3.5%. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Population-Level Exposure to Particulate Air Pollution during Active Travel: Planning for Low-Exposure, Health-Promoting Cities	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Article							PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; URBAN FORM; LAND-USE; RESPIRATORY HEALTH; BUILT ENVIRONMENT; TERM EXPOSURE; BLACK CARBON; IMPACT; BENEFITS; TRANSPORTATION	BACKGROUND: Providing infrastructure and land uses to encourage active travel (i.e., bicycling and walking) are promising strategies for designing health-promoting cities. Population-level exposure to air pollution during active travel is understudied. OBJECTIVES: Our goals were a) to investigate population-level patterns in exposure during active travel, based on spatial estimates of bicycle traffic, pedestrian traffic, and particulate concentrations; and b) to assess how those exposure patterns are associated with the built environment. METHODS: We employed facility-demand models (active travel) and land use regression models (particulate concentrations) to estimate block-level (n=13,604) exposure during rush-hour (1600-1800 hours) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. We used the model-derived estimates to identify land use patterns and characteristics of the street network that are health promoting. We also assessed how exposure is correlated with indicators of health disparities (e.g., household income, proportion of nonwhite residents). Our work uses population-level rates of active travel (i. e., traffic flows) rather than the probability of walking or biking (i. e., "walkability" or "bikeability") to assess exposure. RESULTS: Active travel often occurs on high-traffic streets or near activity centers where particulate concentrations are highest (i. e., 20-42% of active travel occurs on blocks with high population-level exposure). Only 2-3% of blocks (3-8% of total active travel) are "sweet spots" (i.e., high active travel, low particulate concentrations); sweet spots are located a) near but slightly removed from the city-center or b) on off-street trails. We identified 1,721 blocks (similar to 20% of local roads) where shifting active travel from high-traffic roads to adjacent low-traffic roads would reduce exposure by similar to 15%. Active travel is correlated with population density, land use mix, open space, and retail area; particulate concentrations were mostly unchanged with land use. CONCLUSIONS: Public health officials and urban planners may use our findings to promote healthy transportation choices. When designing health-promoting cities, benefits (physical activity) as well as hazards (air pollution) should be evaluated.

J	Gonzalez, D; Perez, J; Milanes, V				Gonzalez, David; Perez, Joshue; Milanes, Vicente			Parametric-based path generation for automated vehicles at roundabouts	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Roundabouts; Automated vehicles; Path planning; Intelligent transportation systems		Urban environments are becoming more and more complex because several factors as consecutive crossroads or lanes changes. These scenarios demand specific infrastructures i.e. roundabouts, for improving traffic flow compared with traditional intersections. A roundabout removes timeouts associated with traffic lights at crossroads and trajectory conflicts among drivers. However, it is a challenging scenario for both humans and automated vehicles. This work presents a path planning method for automated vehicle driving at roundabouts. The proposed system achieves a G(1) continuous path, minimizing curvature steps to increase smoothness, dividing the driving process in three stages: entrance maneuver, driving within the roundabout and exit maneuver. Parametric equations are generated to deal with automated roundabout driving. This approach allows a real time planning considering two-lane roundabouts, taking different exits. Tests in simulated environments and on our prototype platform Cybercar validate the system on real urban environments, showing the proper behavior of the system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Traffic flow parameters such as speed, density, and volume extracted from UAV-based traffic videos are critical for traffic state estimation and traffic control and have recently received much attention from researchers. However, different from stationary surveillance videos, the camera platforms move with UAVs, and the background motion in aerial videos makes it very challenging to process for data extraction. To address this problem, a novel framework for real-time traffic flow parameter estimation from aerial videos is proposed. The proposed system identifies the directions of traffic streams and extracts traffic flow parameters of each traffic stream separately. Our method incorporates four steps that make use of the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) tracker, k-means clustering, connected graphs, and traffic flow theory. The KLT tracker and k-means clustering are used for interest-point-based motion analysis; then, four constraints are proposed to further determine the connectivity of interest points belonging to one traffic stream cluster. Finally, the average speed of a traffic stream as well as density and volume can be estimated using outputs from previous steps and reference markings. Our method was tested on five videos taken in very different scenarios. The experimental results show that in our case studies, the proposed method achieves about 96% and 87% accuracy in estimating average traffic stream speed and vehicle count, respectively. The method also achieves a fast processing speed that enables real-time traffic information estimation.

In particular, the deterministic Nelder-Mead algorithm, a stochastic genetic algorithm and the stochastic cross-entropy method are utilized to estimate the parameter values of the METANET model for a particular freeway site, using real traffic data. The resulting models are validated using various traffic data sets and the optimization algorithms are evaluated and compared with respect to the accuracy of the produced validated models as well as the convergence speed and the required computation time. The validation results showed that all utilized optimization algorithms were able to converge to robust model parameter sets, albeit achieving different performances considering the convergence speed and the required computation time.

The basic model for straight road is extended for the curved road and the characteristics of driver's behavior is incorporated in the lattice model. The extended model is investigated theoretically by the means of linear stability analysis and the effect of curved road and intensity of influence of driver's behavior on the traffic flow stability is examined. Through nonlinear stability analysis, the modified Korteweg-de Vries (MKdV) equation near the critical point is derived to describe the evolution properties of traffic density waves by applying the reductive perturbation method. Furthermore, the numerical simulation is carried out to validate the theoretical results which indicates that the curved road has a negative influence on the stability of the traffic flow. It is also seen that the traffic jam on a curved road can be suppressed efficiently via taking into account aggressive drivers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Spatiotemporal traffic dynamics are converted to images describing the time and space relations of traffic flow via a two-dimensional time-space matrix. A CNN is applied to the image following two consecutive steps: abstract traffic feature extraction and network-wide traffic speed prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by taking two real-world transportation networks, the second ring road and north-east transportation network in Beijing, as examples, and comparing the method with four prevailing algorithms, namely, ordinary least squares, k-nearest neighbors, artificial neural network, and random forest, and three deep learning architectures, namely, stacked autoencoder, recurrent neural network, and long-short-term memory network. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other algorithms by an average accuracy improvement of 42.91% within an acceptable execution time. The CNN can train the model in a reasonable time and, thus, is suitable for large-scale transportation networks.

Comparative Evaluation of Density Estimation Methods on Different Uninterrupted Roadway Facilities: Few Case Studies in India	TRANSPORTATION IN DEVELOPING ECONOMIES			English	Article						Density; Expressways; National highway; Urban arterial road; Uncongested regime; Congested regime; Fundamental relationship; Cumulative plots; Edie's definition	COUNTS; MODEL	Traffic density is one of the fundamental macroscopic characteristics and it is of prime importance when assessment of a facility has to be done based on both users as well as planner's perspective. According to the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), USA, for expressways and multilane roads, the Level-of-Service (LoS) has been defined taking density as the governing factor. Density is treated as the fundamental macroscopic spatial parameter of traffic flow, as it directly indicates the quality of traffic and ease with which one can drive. The present research study focuses on applicability of density estimation methods on multi-class, heterogeneous, non-lane based Indian traffic condition. In this research study, mid-block road sections namely, on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, Ahmedabad-Vadodara Expressway, National Highway (NH)-8 and urban arterial road in Chennai are considered. The expressways are the highest class of roads in Indian road network with different roadway, traffic conditions and with access control facilities. Delhi-Gurgoan Expressway is eight-lane divided facility and Ahemdabad -Vadodara Expressway is four-lane divided with 2.6 m paved shoulder. On the other hand, selected section on National Highway (NH8) is four-lane divided road. Real traffic data was collected through video-graphic survey on all these roads with different traffic conditions. HCVs (Heavy Commercial Vehicles) and MCVs (Multi-axle Commercial Vehicles) were the major traffic composition in congested regime. Thus, the present study focuses on the comparison of density estimation methods on different roadway and traffic conditions. The three methods to be employed for the purpose of estimating traffic density on the study section are: (1) using traffic flow fundamental equation relating speed, flow and density, HCM definition (2) using Cumulative input-output Plots (Input-Output method) (3) Eddie's (x, t) method. This paper aims to empirically quantify the difference in the density estimation based on the aforementioned methods. Assuming input-output provides theoretical density, the errors in the estimation of density using fundamental equation under different traffic flow conditions are also quantified. In spite of growing body of literature disputing about the effectiveness and applicability of various density estimation methods, the key finding from this research indicates that all three abovementioned methods works very well under uncongested traffic flow condition. However, for oversaturated traffic conditions the density estimation using fundamental relationship has errors, primarily due to errors in estimation of the space mean speed since the vehicles which persisted within trap length for period longer than time-interval under consideration are not incorporated in the calculation, which is not the case for other two methods. Moreover, the research study concludes that smaller trap length (< 100 m) can have errors in estimation of density values as compared to actual density values. The findings are useful for condition assessment of traffic flow for design and operation purposes.

J	Das, S; Maurya, AK				Das, Sanhita; Maurya, Akhilesh Kumar			Time Headway Analysis for Four-Lane and Two-Lane Roads	TRANSPORTATION IN DEVELOPING ECONOMIES			English	Article						Time headway; Heterogeneous traffic; Vehicle-pair; Visibility; Headway distribution		Study of vehicle time headways has been a subject to many aspects of traffic flow studies because time headway between any two successive vehicles is considered as an important parameter affecting capacity, safety, delay, driver behavior and level of service of a transportation system. Although a large number of studies exist in the field of time headway modelling, there is still a paucity of research related to time headway distribution study in two-lane bidirectional roads and four-lane divided roads with respect to varying flow rate levels. The present paper intends to study the variations in time headway distributions for four flow levels (0-600, 600-1200, 1200-1800 and 1800-2400 PCU/h) for different two-lane and four-lane roads in Assam, with traffic data collected from video-recorders. It is further aimed to investigate the differences in headway maintaining behavior of vehicles in morning hours and in evening hours (in presence of headlights) when the flow rates for the analyzed periods are comparable. Also vehicle-type specific headway analysis is conducted for two-lane bidirectional roads. The result of this paper not only identifies the difference in time headway distributions of mixed vehicular flow for different flow levels but also captures the differences in vehicle-type specific headways and headway maintaining behavior of vehicles when the headlights of vehicles are turned on. Results of the study can be used as an input in practical applications, especially for developing micro-simulation models and also can be used in capacity estimation, safety analysis, etc.	[Das, Sanhita; Maurya, Akhilesh Kumar] Indian Inst Technol Guwahati, Dept Civil Engn, Gauhati 781039, Assam, India	Maurya, AK (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Guwahati, Dept Civil Engn, Gauhati 781039, Assam, India.	sanhi.das25@gmail.com; maurya@iitg.ernet.in		Das, Sanhita/0000-0002-1199-6398	CSIR-Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), New Delhi under the Supra Institutional Network Project (SINP) category as part of the 12th Five Year Plan Period (FYP)	The authors acknowledge the opportunity to present the research work that forms the basis of this article at the 14th World Conference on Transport Research held at Shanghai, China from 10 to 15 July 2016.

(2006) simulates traffic according to Lighthill-Whitham-Richards theory with a very small numerical error, yet only supports triangular fundamental diagrams. This paper relaxes that restriction in two steps. Firstly, we extend the model to handle any continuous concave fundamental diagram, and prove that this extension is still consistent with Lighthill-Whitham-Richards theory. Secondly, we extend the theory and model to handle a capacity drop, explicitly looking into the handling of both the onset and release of congestion. The final model is still first-order and suitable for general networks. Numerical examples show that it qualitatively improves on the original model due to uniquely featuring complex traffic patterns including stop-and-go waves, with crisp shockwaves between traffic states, as well as acceleration fans.

J	Pradhan, P; Venkitasubramaniam, P				Pradhan, Parth; Venkitasubramaniam, Parv			Stealthy Attacks in Dynamical Systems: Tradeoffs Between Utility and Detectability With Application in Anonymous Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY			English	Article						Undetectable attacks; privacy; K-L divergence; anonymity; admissible length	FUNDAMENTAL LIMITATIONS	Cyber physical systems which integrate physical system dynamics with digital cyber infrastructure are envisioned to transform our core infrastructural frameworks, such as the smart electricity grid, transportation networks, and advanced manufacturing. This integration, however, exposes the physical system functioning to the security vulnerabilities of cyber communication. Both scientific studies and real-world examples have demonstrated the impact of data injection attacks on complex systems, including the Internet, the smart electricity grid, and air traffic systems. In this paper, an abstract theoretical framework is proposed to study data injection/modification attacks on Markov modeled dynamical systems from the perspective of an adversary. Typical data injection attacks focus on one shot attacks by adversary and the non-detectability of such attacks under static assumptions. In this paper, we study dynamic data injection attacks where the adversary is capable of modifying a temporal sequence of data and the physical controller is equipped with prior statistical knowledge about the data arrival process to detect the presence of an adversary. The goal of the adversary is to modify the arrivals to minimize a utility function of the controller while minimizing the detectability of his presence as measured by the K-L divergence between the prior and posterior distribution of the arriving data. The tradeoff between these two metrics-controller utility and the detectability cost-is studied analytically for different underlying dynamics. The proposed framework is then applied to a practical problem in data networks where a router tries to hide the path of traffic flow from timing analysis by an active adversary who can modify the timing of an incoming packet stream. This problem is studied from the adversary perspective wherein the goal is to balance two costs-the adversary's detectability cost measured by the K-L divergence and the network privacy cost measured by the maximum length of the packet stream whose paths can be hidden by a memory limited router.

J	Qi, L; Zheng, ZY; Gang, LH				Qi, Le; Zheng, Zhongyi; Gang, Longhui			A cellular automaton model for ship traffic flow in waterways	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Cellular automaton; Ship traffic flow; Waterway; Spatial-logical mapping model; Ship domain	VEHICLE FLOWS; DOMAIN; CAR; TRANSITION; SIMULATION; CRITERION	With the development of marine traffic, waterways become congested and more complicated traffic phenomena in ship traffic flow are observed. It is important and necessary to build a ship traffic flow model based on cellular automata (CAs) to study the phenomena and improve marine transportation efficiency and safety. Spatial discretization rules for waterways and update rules for ship movement are two important issues that are very different from vehicle traffic. To solve these issues, a CA model for ship traffic flow, called a spatial-logical mapping (SLM) model, is presented. In this model, the spatial discretization rules are improved by adding a mapping rule. And the dynamic ship domain model is considered in the update rules to describe ships' interaction more exactly. Take the ship traffic flow in the Singapore Strait for example, some simulations were carried out and compared. The simulations show that the SLM model could avoid ship pseudo lane-change efficiently, which is caused by traditional spatial discretization rules. The ship velocity change in the SLM model is consistent with the measured data. At finally, from the fundamental diagram, the relationship between traffic ability and the lengths of ships is explored. The number of ships in the waterway declines when the proportion of large ships increases. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The stability condition of this model is obtained by using the linear stability analysis. The phase diagram can be divided into three regions classified as the stable, the metastable and the unstable ones. The theoretical result shows that the average headway plays an important role in improving the stabilization of traffic system. The mKdV equation near the critical point is derived to describe the evolution properties of traffic density waves by applying the reductive perturbation method. Furthermore, through the simulation of space-time evolution of the vehicle headway, it is shown that the traffic jam can be suppressed efficiently with taking into account the average headway effect, and the analytical result is consistent with the simulation one.

Traffic gridlock on a honeycomb city	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; STATISTICAL PHYSICS; FLOW; PATTERNS; NETWORK; CELLS; JAM	Inspired by an old and almost in oblivion urban plan, we report the behavior of the Biham-Middleton-Levine (BML) model-a paradigm for studying phase transitions of traffic flow-on a hypothetical city with a perfect honeycomb street network. In contrast with the original BML model on a square lattice, the same model on a honeycomb does not show any anisotropy or intermediate states, but a single continuous phase transition between free and totally congested flow, a transition that can be completely characterized by the tools of classical percolation. Although the transition occurs at a lower density than for the conventional BML, simple modifications, like randomly stopping the cars with a very small probability or increasing the traffic light periods, drives the model to perform better on honeycomb lattices. As traffic lights and disordered perturbations are inherent in real traffic, these results question the actual role of the square gridlike designs and suggest the honeycomb topology as an interesting alternative for urban planning in real cities.

J	Yan, DH; Luo, Y; Yuan, M; Lu, NW				Yan, Donghuang; Luo, Yuan; Yuan, Ming; Lu, Naiwei			Lifetime fatigue reliability evaluation of short to medium span bridges under site-specific stochastic truck loading	ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Fatigue reliability; probabilistic modeling; response surface method; stochastic traffic flow; overloading; weigh-in-motion	RESPONSE-SURFACE APPROACH; DETAILS; DESIGN; MODELS; SYSTEM	Bridges are vulnerable to the fatigue damage accumulation caused by traffic loading over the service period. A continuous growth in both the vehicle weight and the traffic volume may cause a safety hazard to existing bridges. This study presented a computational framework for probabilistic modeling of the fatigue damage accumulation of short to medium span bridges under actual traffic loading. Stochastic truck-load models were simulated based on site-specific weigh-in-motion measurements. A response surface method was utilized to substitute the time-consuming finite element model for an efficient computation. A case study of a simply supported bridge demonstrated the effectiveness of the computational framework. Numerical results show that the simulated fatigue stress spectrum captures the probability density functions of the heavy traffic loading. The equivalent fatigue stress range increases mostly linearly in the good road roughness condition with the growth of the gross vehicle weight. The vehicle type and the road roughness condition affect the stress range. The influence of the driving speed on the equivalent stress range is non-monotonic. The bridge fatigue reliability has a considerable increase even under a relatively high overload limit. It is anticipated that the proposed computational framework can be applied for more types of bridges.

This system models main roads in city traffics, intersecting with perpendicular streets. We explore basic properties of the system, in particular dependence of the vehicular flow on the parameters of signalization as well as the system size and the car density. We investigate various types of the spatial distribution of the vehicular density, and show existence of a shock profile. We also measure waiting time behind traffic lights, and examine its relationship with the traffic flow.

J	Sun, YC; Olaru, D; Smith, B; Greaves, S; Collins, A				Sun, Yuchao; Olaru, Doina; Smith, Brett; Greaves, Stephen; Collins, Andrew			Road to autonomous vehicles in Australia: an exploratory literature review	ROAD & TRANSPORT RESEARCH			English	Review							TRAFFIC FLOW; SYSTEMS; OPPORTUNITIES; CHALLENGES; ATTITUDES; MODEL	Autonomous vehicle technology and its potential effects on traffic and daily activities is a popular topic in the media and in the research community. It is anticipated that AVs will reduce accidents, improve congestion, increase the utility of time spent travelling and reduce social exclusion. However, knowledge about the way in which AVs will function in a transport system is still modest and a recent international study showed a lower familiarity with AVs in Australia compared to the USA and UK. Attitudes towards fully automated driving (or higher levels of autonomy) range from 'excitement' to 'suspicion'. The breadth of feelings may be due to the low level of awareness or reflect polarising attitudinal positions. Whilst experts appear to be more confident about the adoption of AV technology in the near future, public acceptance is key to AVs' market success. Hence, research that examines local contexts and opinions is needed. This paper reviews existing scholarly work and identifies gaps and directions for future developments, with a focus on the Australian context. The review will address the following broad categories: investigation of AV features and mobility models, implications for road traffic and connectivity to infrastructure (especially in low to medium density urban areas), public attitudes and concerns, travel behaviour and demand, potential business models, and policy implications.

In this study, we employ the use of three bicycles travelling in unison to sample concentrations of ultrafine particles (UFPs), carbon monoxide (CO) and fine particulate matter (PM1.0) at three different distances from the traffic flow, in a central city park area of Christchurch, New Zealand. Similar research has been done using stationary equipment, but this may not accurately represent exposure differences while moving with a stream of vehicles. Three cyclists were equipped with a set of identical instruments and rode continuously along a road, the road's sidewalk (7 m away) and an off-road path (19 m away), for a total of 6 h and 45 min, over 5 afternoon sampling runs during fall. Data were analysed in the form of linear mixed-effects models, with cyclist position (distance from edge of nearest traffic lane), wind speed, and temperature, having statistically significant effects on mean exposures (p < 0.05). Mean exposure to UFPs and CO were approximately 20-30% (p < 0.01) lower at the sidewalk and 40-50% lower at the path, than at the road (p < 0.01). These results highlight the potential exposure benefits of segregating cycle ways, which helps inform city planning. Separating cycle lanes on key routes could help reduce cyclists' cumulative intake of pollutants, especially on heavily-trafficked roads. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, developing speed models is a challenging task, especially in the context of developing countries like India where vehicles with diverse static and dynamic characteristics use the same right of way. Here, the traffic composition plays a significant role in determining vehicular speed. Determination of passenger car units (PCU), which is required to convert heterogeneous traffic flow to its homogeneous equivalent, also requires speed of different types of vehicles at varying traffic conditions and traffic volumes on the road. In this context, the present research is carried out to examine the effects of traffic volume and its composition on speed and PCU factors for individual types of vehicles under mixed traffic conditions. Classified traffic-volume and speed data were collected at six-lane divided arterial sections in New Delhi and categorized speed models developed adopting a kriging approximation technique, an alternative for commonly used regression. A novel algorithm for selecting the optimal correlation function in kriging has also been proposed in this paper. Developed speed models are validated with the data set of another location kept aside for this purpose, and the predicted speeds show a good agreement to the observed ones. Predicted speeds are then used to estimate PCU factors for each vehicle category. Finally, the proposed models are utilized to evaluate the effects of traffic volume and its composition on speed and PCU of different vehicle categories. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Nawrin, S; Rahman, MR; Akhter, S				Nawrin, Sadia; Rahman, Md Rahatur; Akhter, Shamim			Exploreing K-Means with Internal Validity Indexes for Data Clustering in Traffic Management System	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic Management System (TMS); Data Clustering; K-means; Hierarchical Clustering; Cluster Validation		Traffic Management System (TMS) is used to improve traffic flow by integrating information from different data repositories and online sensors, detecting incidents and taking actions on traffic routing. In general, two decision making systems-weights updating and forecasting are integrated inside the TMS. The models need numerous data sets for making appropriate decisions. To determine the dynamic road weights in TMS, four (4) different environmental attributes are considered, which are directly or indirectly related to increase the traffic jam-rain fall, temperature, wind, and humidity. In addition, peak hour is taken as an additional attribute. Usually, the data sets are classified by instinct method. However, optimum classification on data sets is vital to improve the decision accuracy of the TMS. Collected data sets have no class label and thus, cluster based unsupervised classifications (partitioning, hierarchical, grid-based, density-based) can be used to find optimum number of classifications in each attribute, and expected to improve the performance of the TMS. Two most popular and frequently used classifiers are hierarchical clustering and partition clustering. K-means is simple, easy to implement, and easy to interpret the clustering results. It is also faster, because the order of time complexity is linear with the number of data. Thus, in this paper we are going to demonstrate the performance of partition k-means and hierarchical k-means with their implementations by Davies Boulder Index (DBI), Dunn Index (DI), Silhouette Coefficient (SC) methods to outline the optimal number classifications (features) inside each attribute of TMS data sets. Subsequently, the optimal classes are validated by using WSS (within sum of square) errors and correlation methods. The validation results conclude that k-means with DI performs better in all attributes of TMS data sets and provides more accurate optimum classification numbers. Thereafter, the dynamic road weights for TMS are generated and classified using the combined k-means and DI method.

J	Wuthishuwong, C; Traechtler, A				Wuthishuwong, Chairit; Traechtler, Ansgar			Consensus-based local information coordination for the networked control of the autonomous intersection management	COMPLEX & INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article						Autonomous intersection management; Autonomous vehicle; Vehicle to infrastructure communication; Infrastructure to infrastructure communication; Discrete time consensus algorithm; Traffic model	VEHICLES	Autonomous intersection management (AIM) will be a future method for improving traffic efficiency in the urban area. Instead of using the traffic signal control like nowadays, it uses wireless communication with autonomous vehicles to support the management of road traffic more safely and efficiently. A single AIM shows an exceptional performance in managing traffics at an intersection. However, it could not be represented a traffic in the real world, which is composed of multiple intersections. We show that coordination of traffic information among vehicles and infrastructures is an essential part of macroscopic traffic management. Coordination of traffic information among the network of AIMs is the key to improve the overall traffic flow throughout the network not only has an optimal flow in some intersections and very heavy traffic in others. In this paper, we introduce the distributed control to a graph-based intersection network to control traffic in a macroscopic level. Vehicle to infrastructure and infrastructure to infrastructure communication are used to exchange the traffic information between a single autonomous vehicle to the network of autonomous intersections. We implement a discrete time consensus algorithm to coordinate the traffic density of an intersection with its neighborhoods and determine the control policy to maximize a traffic throughput of each intersection as well as stabilizing the overall traffic in the network. We use the Greenshields traffic model to define the boundary condition of various traffic flows to the corresponded traffic density and velocity. Our proposed method represents the ability to maintain traffic flow rate of each intersection without having a back up traffic. As well, every intersection operates under the uncongested flow condition. The simulation results of the graph-based networked control of a multiple autonomous intersection showed that the overall traffic flow in the network achieves up to higher than using traffic signal system.

The effect of curb parking on road capacity and traffic safety	EUROPEAN TRANSPORT RESEARCH REVIEW			English	Article						Traffic engineering; Curb parking; Capacity; Traffic safety; Conflict; Gap acceptance theory	ON-STREET PARKING	Purpose In order to explore the effect of curb parking on dynamic traffic and formulate some reasonable and effective traffic management measures, the effects on capacity and traffic safety are studied. Methods Four road segments with curb parking were selected as the investigation location. Several traffic characteristics and parameters were then investigated and counted, including traffic flow volume, speed, headway and traffic conflict. Based on a reduction of lane effective width and the Gap Acceptance Theory, two effect models describing curb parking and road capacity were constructed. Considering the factors involved in motor vehicle conflicts (such as non-motor vehicle lane distribution and stopping sight distance), the effects of curb parking on both motor vehicle and non-motor vehicle traffic safetywas analyzed, as well as pedestrian crossing safety. This case study analyzes both the capacity and traffic safety of all four investigation segments. Results Results show that the lane effective width of road segment with curb parking significantly influences the road capacity and impacts the traffic flow volumes of the parking lane and its adjacent lane. Conclusions Curb parking significantly effects traffic operation safety; however, it can be improved by implementing traffic safety management measures.	[Cao, Y.; Zuo, Z.

J	Wang, HT; Wen, H; Yi, F; Zhu, HS; Sun, LM				Wang, Hongtao; Wen, Hui; Yi, Feng; Zhu, Hongsong; Sun, Limin			Road Traffic Anomaly Detection via Collaborative Path Inference from GPS Snippets	SENSORS			English	Article						road anomaly detection; path inference; tensor decomposition	NAVIGATION	Road traffic anomaly denotes a road segment that is anomalous in terms of traffic flow of vehicles. Detecting road traffic anomalies from GPS (Global Position System) snippets data is becoming critical in urban computing since they often suggest underlying events. However, the noisy and sparse nature of GPS snippets data have ushered multiple problems, which have prompted the detection of road traffic anomalies to be very challenging. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage solution which consists of two components: a Collaborative Path Inference (CPI) model and a Road Anomaly Test (RAT) model. CPI model performs path inference incorporating both static and dynamic features into a Conditional Random Field (CRF). Dynamic context features are learned collaboratively from large GPS snippets via a tensor decomposition technique. Then RAT calculates the anomalous degree for each road segment from the inferred fine-grained trajectories in given time intervals. We evaluated our method using a large scale real world dataset, which includes one-month GPS location data from more than eight thousand taxicabs in Beijing. The evaluation results show the advantages of our method beyond other baseline techniques.

However, current evacuation models largely overlook the complexity of household behavior leading to oversimplified traffic assignments and, as a result, inaccurate evacuation clearance times in the network. In this paper, we present a high fidelity multi- agent simulation model called A-RESCUE (Agent-based Regional Evacuation Simulator Coupled with User Enriched behavior) that integrates the rich activity behavior of the evacuating households with the network level assignment to predict and evaluate evacuation clearance times. The simulator can generate evacuation demand on the fly, truly capturing the dynamic nature of a hurricane evacuation. The simulator consists of two major components: household decision-making module and traffic flow module. In the simulation, each household is an agent making various evacuation related decisions based on advanced behavioral models. From household decisions, a number of vehicles are generated and entered in the evacuation transportation network at different time intervals. An adaptive routing strategy that can achieve efficient network-wide traffic measurements is proposed. Computational results are presented based on simulations over the Miami- Dade network with detailed representation of the road network geometry. The simulation results demonstrate the evolution of traffic congestion as a function of the household decision-making, the variance of the congestion across different areas relative to the storm path and the most congested O-D pairs in the network. The simulation tool can be used as a planning tool to make decisions related to how traffic information should be communicated and in the design of traffic management policies such as contra-flow strategies during evacuations.

The traffic is differentiated by the destination (i.e. Lagrangian flow) and different flow groups are assumed to satisfy the first-in-first-out (FIFO) condition at each junction. The queuing in the network is assumed to be contained at each junction node and spill-back to the previous junction is ignored. We show that this model leads to a well-posed problem for computing the dynamics of the system and prove that the solution is unique through a mathematical derivation of the model properties. The framework is then used to analytically prescribe the delays at each junction of the network and across any sub-path, which is the main contribution of the article. This is a critical requirement when solving control and optimization problems over the network, such as system optimal network routing and solving for equilibrium behavior. In fact, the framework provides analytical expressions for the delay at any node or sub-path as a function of the in flow at any upstream node. Furthermore, the model can be solved numerically using a very simple and efficient feed forward algorithm. We demonstrate the versatility of the framework by applying it to two example networks, a single path of multiple bottlenecks and a diverge junction with complex junction dynamics.

Design Assessment of Short-Span Steel Bridges	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Steel bridge; Short-span bridge; Live load; Seismic demands	MODEL	The assessment of four short-span steel bridges from 24 to 42 m under local overloaded trucks and ground motion records are presented and discussed. Bridges were virtually located in Mexico, and so the vehicular live loads, earthquake loads due to local seismicity, and other local loads were adapted in the design. A realistic condition of the local design truck for Mexico was selected from survey traffic flows reported for local highways. Nonlinear dynamic analyses were carried out using seven historical records associated with the largest vertical intensities from subduction earthquakes in Mexico. The results are intended to evaluate the local practice, which frequently adopts the current AASHTO LRFD Specifications in the absence of an official local design code for bridge structures. This research pretends to provide design recommendations for short-span steel bridges in Mexico, in particular for those related to the influence of local seismicity and overloaded vehicular loading in local highways. Results achieved from the strength and serviceability limit states indicate that the design of the steel plate girders is controlled by the gravity load combination, rather than the combination with both horizontal and vertical ground motion records. Due to disparities in the total vehicular weight, bridges designed for the HL-93 load required by AASTHO are not safe for the overloaded T3-S2-R4 truck that is critical in Mexico. The discrepancies in reliability are minor for the shorter-span bridges due to variances in the number of axes and the total length, but become higher as the span length increases.

Jeffrey			Fine-tuning ADAS algorithm parameters for optimizing traffic safety and mobility in connected vehicle environment	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS); Driver behavior modeling; Microscopic traffic flow modeling; Traffic safety and mobility optimization	COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM; DRIVER ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS; REAR-END COLLISION; BEHAVIOR	Under the Connected Vehicle environment where vehicles and road-side infrastructure can communicate wirelessly, the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) can be adopted as an actuator for achieving traffic safety and mobility optimization at highway facilities. In this regard, the traffic management centers need to identify the optimal ADAS algorithm parameter set that leads to the optimization of the traffic safety and mobility performance, and broadcast the optimal parameter set wirelessly to individual ADAS-equipped vehicles. Once the ADAS-equipped drivers implement the optimal parameter set, they become active agents that work cooperatively to prevent traffic conflicts, and suppress the development of traffic oscillations into heavy traffic jams. Measuring systematic effectiveness of this traffic management requires am analytic capability to capture the quantified impact of the ADAS on individual drivers' behaviors and the aggregated traffic safety and mobility improvement due to such an impact. To this end, this research proposes a synthetic methodology that incorporates the ADAS-affected driving behavior modeling and stateof-the-art microscopic traffic flow modeling into a virtually simulated environment. Building on such an environment, the optimal ADAS algorithm parameter set is identified through a multi-objective optimization approach that uses the Genetic Algorithm. The developed methodology is tested at a freeway facility under low, medium and high ADAS market penetration rate scenarios. The case study reveals that fine-tuning the ADAS algorithm parameter can significantly improve the throughput and reduce the traffic delay and conflicts at the study site in the medium and high penetration scenarios. In these scenarios, the ADAS algorithm parameter optimization is necessary. Otherwise the ADAS will intensify the behavior heterogeneity among drivers, resulting in little traffic safety improvement and negative mobility impact. In the high penetration rate scenario, the identified optimal ADAS algorithm parameter set can be used to support different control objectives (e.g., safety improvement has priority vs. mobility improvement has priority).

J	Tan, J; Wang, LF				Tan, Jun; Wang, Lingfeng			Real-Time Charging Navigation of Electric Vehicles to Fast Charging Stations: A Hierarchical Game Approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID			English	Article						Charging navigation; charging station; electric vehicle (EV); game theory; traffic flow	DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT; NASH EQUILIBRIA	This paper proposes an integrated electric vehicle (EV) charging navigation framework, which takes into consideration the impacts from both the power system and transportation system. The proposed framework links the power system with transportation system through the charging navigation of massive EVs. It benefits the two systems by attracting EVs to charge at off-peak hours and saving the time of EV owners with real-time navigation. Based on the formulated framework, a hierarchical game approach is proposed in this paper to effectively navigate EVs to electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). At the upper level of the hierarchical game, a non-cooperative game is proposed to model the competition between EVCSs. Based on the pricing strategies obtained from the non-cooperative game, multiple evolutionary games are formulated at the lower level to evolve EVs' strategies in choosing EVCSs. The simulation results show that the proposed integrated charging navigation approach is effective in improving both the reliability of the power distribution grid and economic profits of the charging stations.

J	Vitello, G; Alongi, A; Conti, V; Vitabile, S				Vitello, Giuseppe; Alongi, Alfonso; Conti, Vincenzo; Vitabile, Salvatore			A Bio-Inspired Cognitive Agent for Autonomous Urban Vehicles Routing Optimization	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COGNITIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Autonomous urban vehicles routing optimization; cellular metabolism; cognitive agent; vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs).	METABOLIC NETWORKS; AUTHENTICATION SCHEME; PRIVACY; PATHWAYS; SECURITY; MODELS	Autonomous urban vehicle prototypes are expected to be efficient even in not explicitly planned circumstances and dynamic environments. The development of autonomous vehicles for urban driving needs real-time information from vehicles and road network to optimize traffic flows. In traffic agent-based models, each vehicle is an agent, while the road network is the environment. Cognitive agents are able to reason on the perceived data, to evaluate the information obtained by reasoning, and to learn and respond, preserving their selfsufficiency, independency, self-determination, and self-reliance. In this paper, a bio-inspired cognitive agent for autonomous urban vehicles routing optimization is proposed. The use of selected bio-inspired analyzing techniques, which are commonly employed to investigate the topological and functional features of a metabolic network, allows the agent to analyze the structural aspects of a road network, find its extreme pathways and outline the balanced flow combinations. This approach optimizes traffic flows over network, minimizes road congestions, and maximizes the number of autonomous vehicles reaching their destination target. Agent behavior has been tested using data coming from Palermo urban road network, Italy, while the adopted bio-inspired analysis techniques have been compared with the A* literature algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the approach permits to find a better global routing optimization solution. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that metabolic mechanisms involved in a cell survival process have been used to design a congestion solution.

J	Abdi, A; Rad, HB; Azimi, E				Abdi, Ali; Rad, Hamid Bigdeli; Azimi, Ehsan			Simulation and analysis of traffic flow for traffic calming	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-MUNICIPAL ENGINEER			English	Article						safety & hazards; traffic engineering; transport management	SPEED	This paper evaluates the use of traffic calming as an option to address the high road casualties caused by speeding in Iran. The aim is to reduce the speed of motor vehicles to improve road safety and the quality of life. In this study, a part of Shahrara Street in Tehran that has speed humps installed is modelled in Aimsun software. The results suggest that calming the street leads to the reduced speed of vehicles and traffic volume on that street. However, it also results in reduced capacity of the street; thus, calming devices, including speed humps, should be placed at appropriate distances to each other to achieve an appropriate overall level of service, balancing speed and road safety benefits against capacity. In this research, a distance between speed humps of between 200 and 400 m is recommended.

Virtual instrument to obtain an optimal linear model for piezoelectric elements involved in road traffic energy harvesting	COMPUTER STANDARDS & INTERFACES			English	Article						Virtual instrument; LabVIEW; Energy harvesting; Piezoelectric elements; Test bench	VIBRATION	A new Virtual Instrument (VI) system is presented in this paper. The VI is designed to obtain the linear electrical models of the piezoelectric elements involved in energy harvesting applications in road traffic environments. The system, the modelling and the verification methodology are described in this paper, comparing the obtained results. The piezoelectric devices under test (PD UT) are mechanically driven by a test bench, which simulates the effect of heavy or light vehicles passing over a lane in a real road. Parameters such as the traffic flow rate and vehicle speed are configurable. In addition, the VI system controls the specific hardware designed to store the energy with different harvesting topologies. The VI system described in this paper is able to parameterize the test and to control both the test bench and the harvesting hardware. It also conditions and measures electrical signals from the PDUT, and obtains the electrical model of the pietoelectric element. Using this model it is possible to scale both the number of elements and find the optimal topology needed to harvest the required energy by an electronic load.	[Jimenez, F.

The function of the lower model is to recognize where the incident congestion exists, based on an adaptive neural network, whose inputs are traffic flow, velocity and density. The outputs of the lower model are the section number where the congestion occurs and the ramp number which should be controlled. If there is congestion, the upper model would be activated. The function of the upper model is to calculate the control strategy. The required control ramp number from the lower model would be transmitted to the upper model together with the real-time state of controlled section. The upper model would calculate the ramp-metering ratio for each required ramp by minimizing the main time cost, total average queue length and equity index. In order to describe the traffic state more accurately, a tailored traffic model for urban freeway in China is established in the upper model to get the prediction, which considers the speed-limited value on main roadway, and corrects the calculation method of traffic flow state on origin point and exit ramp. The simulation results show the double model is effective to control the incident congestion induced by aggressive behavior.

A nested logit model is employed to analyze the charging preference of the individual consumer (EV owner) and predict the aggregated charging demand at the charging stations. The EV charging industry is modeled as an oligopoly where the entire market is dominated by a few charging service providers (oligopolists). At the beginning of each planning stage, an optimal placement policy for each service provider is obtained through analyzing strategic interactions in a Bayesian game. To derive the optimal placement policy, we consider both the transportation network graph and the electric power network graph. A simulation software-the EV Virtual City 1.0-is developed using Java to investigate the interactions among the consumers (EV owner), the transportation network graph, the electric power network graph, and the charging stations. Through a series of experiments using the geographic and demographic data from the city of the San Pedro District of Los Angeles, CA, USA, we show that the charging station placement is highly consistent with the heatmap of the traffic flow. In addition, we observe a spatial economic phenomenon that service providers prefer clustering instead of separation in the EV charging market.

J	Wei, W; Wu, L; Wang, JH; Mei, SW				Wei, Wei; Wu, Lei; Wang, Jianhui; Mei, Shengwei			Expansion Planning of Urban Electrified Transportation Networks: A Mixed-Integer Convex Programming Approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION			English	Article						Electric vehicle (EV); electrified transportation network (ETN); expansion planning; interdependency; Nesterov user equilibrium (NUE); power distribution network (PDN)	VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS; DISTRIBUTION-SYSTEMS; HIGH PENETRATION; PLACEMENT; COORDINATION; FORMULATION; DEPLOYMENT; REDUCTION; MODEL	/ Electric vehicles (EVs) have been widely acknowledged as one effective solution to alleviate the fossil fuel shortage and environmental pressure in modern metropolises. To foster the large-scale integration of EVs, transportation electrification is becoming an emerging trend. This paper proposes a comprehensive model for the expansion planning of urban electrified transportation networks (ETNs), which determines the best investment strategies for the TN and the power distribution network (PDN) simultaneously, including the sites and sizes of new lanes, charging facilities, distribution lines, and local generators. The steady-state distribution of traffic flow in the TN is characterized by the Nesterov user equilibrium (NUE). The operating condition of the PDN is described by linearized branch power flow equations. To consider the interdependency between the TN and PDN created by the charging behavior of EVs, the power demand of on-road charging facility is assumed to be proportional to the traffic flow it carries. The expansion planning model is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program with NUE constraints. In order to retrieve a global optimal solution, it is further transformed into an equivalent mixedinteger convex program through duality theory and techniques of integer algebra; no approximation error is involved. Case studies on a test ETN corroborate the proposed model and method.

This paper presents a periodic switching control method for an automated vehicle platoon to minimize the overall fuel consumption. Considering the nonlinearity of switching operation, the concept of bounded stability for a platoon of vehicles is defined to replace conventional internal stability and string stability. The distributed servo loop controller based on dual-pulse-and-glide operation is designed for each vehicle, wherein a sectionalized switching map is adopted for proper mode selection. It is proved that such a control method achieves bounded stability for the homogeneous platoon, with the range error of each follower being exactly confined within a predefined central region. The simulation validation shows that this method can save the overall fuel consumption up to 21.8% in comparison with conventional linear quadratic controllers. In addition, it also has desirable robustness with respect to the dynamical heterogeneity in the platoon, i.e., the deviation of intervehicle states from a predefined central region increases approximately linearly with respect to the growth of platoon heterogeneity.

J	Li, SE; Guo, QQ; Xin, L; Cheng, B; Li, KQ				Li, Shengbo Eben; Guo, Qiangqiang; Xin, Long; Cheng, Bo; Li, Keqiang			Fuel-Saving Servo-Loop Control for an Adaptive Cruise Control System of Road Vehicles With Step-Gear Transmission	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Adaptive cruise control (ACC); automated vehicle; car-following; eco-driving; fuel economy	POWER MANAGEMENT; CONSUMPTION; MINIMIZE; STRATEGY; DRIVEN; TRUCKS; CAR; BUS	Fuel consumption of fossil-based road vehicles is significantly affected by the way vehicles are driven. The same is true for automated vehicles with longitudinal control. This paper presents a periodic servo-loop longitudinal control algorithm for an adaptive cruise control (ACC) system to minimize fuel consumption in car-following scenarios. The fuel-saving mechanism of pulse-and-glide (PnG) operation is first discussed for the power-train with internal combustion engine and step-gear transmission. The servo-loop controller is then designed based on a periodic switching map for real-time implementation and adjusted with a range-bounded feedback regulator to enhance the robustness to model mismatch. Simulations in both uniform and natural traffic flows demonstrate that this algorithm achieves a significant fuel-saving benefit in automated car-following scenarios up to 8.9% in naturalistic traffic flow (when coasting at neutral gear), compared with a linear quadratic (LQ) controller. Meanwhile, its intervehicle range is preferably bounded so that the negative impact on safety and traffic smoothness is contained.

J	Hu, WB; Yan, LP; Wang, H; Du, B; Tao, DC				Hu, Wenbin; Yan, Liping; Wang, Huan; Du, Bo; Tao, Dacheng			Real-time traffic jams prediction inspired by Biham, Middleton and Levine (BML) model	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Traffic jam; BML model; Prediction; Real-time; Urban traffic network	INTELLIGENT; PERFORMANCE; SYSTEMS	Urban traffic jams severely affect many cities around the world. Therefore, there is an urgent need for accurate prediction of traffic jams in real time. With many existing approaches, it is difficult to obtain favorable results for dynamic and uncertain traffic flows in urban networks. This paper proposes a real-time traffic jam prediction method based on a two-dimension cellular automaton model inspired by the well-known Biham, Middleton and Levine (BML) model. The proposed model combines the simplicity and high efficiency of the BML model with real urban traffic networks. Our work can be divided into two parts: (1) the proposal of a practical approach for mapping the urban traffic topological structure into a modified BML (M-BML) model, and (2) the development of a novel strategy to deal with different cells of the M-BML model, especially conflict points and fuzzy points, which facilitates the recognition of real traffic jams at intersections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that real urban traffic road networks are directly mapped into a descriptive model for jam prediction. Extensive experiments confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed M-BML model in predicting traffic jams in dynamic and uncertain real urban traffic networks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

J	Tang, TQ; Yi, ZY; Lin, QF				Tang, Tie-Qiao; Yi, Zhi-Yan; Lin, Qing-Feng			Effects of signal light on the fuel consumption and emissions under car-following model	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Car-following model; Fuel consumption; Emissions; Signal light; Green split	TRAFFIC FLOW MODEL; VT-MICRO; VEHICLE; OPTIMIZATION; TRANSITION; SEQUENCE; MINIMIZE; STATES; SPEED	In this paper, a car-following model is utilized to study the effects of signal light on each vehicle's fuel consumption, CO, HC and NOx. The numerical results show that each vehicle's fuel consumption and emissions are influenced by the signal light and that the effects are related to the green split of the signal light and the vehicle's time headway at the origin, which can help drivers adjust their micro driving behavior on the road with a signal light to reduce their fuel consumption and emissions.
