J	Nagatani, T				Nagatani, Takashi			Modified circle map model for complex motion induced by a change of shuttle buses	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Shuttle bus; Transportation; Nonlinear map; Circle map; Chaos; Fluctuation	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW; MACRO MODEL; ROUTE; SCHEDULE; PHYSICS; SYSTEM; STATES	We investigate the dynamic behavior of shuttle buses when passengers switch to another bus B on route B from bus A on route A. By switching from bus A to bus B, the outflow of passengers from route A (inflow of passengers into route B) changes to the periodic inflow of a square wave. The dynamics of the shuttle buses with the change is described by the modified circle map model. The bus schedule and control are closely related to the dynamics. The motion of shuttle buses depends on the inflow rate, its period, and moving time ratio. The shuttle bus displays such complex behavior as periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic motions.

Stochastic cell transmission model for traffic network with demand and supply uncertainties	TRANSPORTMETRICA A-TRANSPORT SCIENCE			English	Article						stochastic cell transmission model; traffic density; queue length; signal delay; probabilistic distribution; spillback		This article extends the stochastic cell transmission model (SCTM) to simulate traffic flows on networks with stochastic demand and supply. The SCTM divides a roadway segment into cells and accepts the means and variances of stochastic travel demand and supply functions as exogenous inputs, and produces the corresponding cell traffic densities over time. This article defines the rules of flow propagation for freeway corridors, traffic merges/diverges and signalised junctions based on a kind of link-node model. In the numerical studies, we simulate the proposed model with a hypothetical network. We apply the SCTM to estimate the queues and delays at signalised intersections. Compared with some well-known delay and queue estimation formulas, e.g. Webster, Beckmann, McNeil and Akcelik, the results show good consistency between the SCTM and these formulas. In addition, the SCTM describes the temporal behaviour of the queue and delay distributions at signalised junctions with stochastic supply functions and (non-stationary) arrivals.	[Zhong, R.

Due to the dynamic nature of traffic passing through signalised intersections, this study sets out to investigate a dynamic modelling platform that can accurately and efficiently estimate delay and emissions for signalised intersections. Specifically, we study dynamic traffic models that can produce the speed profile of traffic, including the car-following model, the point-queue model (PQM), the shockwave model (SWM), and the cell-transmission model, and apply them for both delay and emissions estimation. The methods for emissions estimation from the SWM, the PQM, and the cell-transmission model are newly developed in this study. We then apply these models to an actual signalised road network in Hong Kong. This paper then compares the performances of these different models vis-a-vis their accuracy and computational requirements.

However, current models are usually based on the fact that vehicles travel in the middle of a single lane and make a lateral movement only when the driver wants to change lane. They are incapable of describing driving behavior in a complex traffic environment with a lot of lateral separations which may cause traffic flow to be unstable on a single lane. In order to solve the problem, in this paper we first build up the equations of motion based on target steering angle (TSA) and then establish a series of rules for determining TSA by considering the lateral separation characteristics between the follower and the leader. Finally a new vehicular behavior model is developed. The properties of the model are investigated by simulating two scenarios. It is found that the proposed model is capable of describing complex phenomena which cannot be described by existing models and explaining the perturbation caused by bus near bus stations. The results also imply that this model with taking the lateral separation characteristic into account greatly enhances the effectiveness of vehicular behavior.

Smart street lighting management	ENERGY EFFICIENCY			English	Article						Lighting efficiency; Energy management systems; Adaptive control; Neural network models	TRAFFIC-FLOW PREDICTION	In this work, we propose a new street lighting energy management system in order to reduce energy consumption. The key idea we want to accomplish is that of "energy on demand" meaning that energy, in this case light, is provided only when needed. In order to achieve this goal, it is critical to have a reliable demand model, which in the case of street lighting turns out to be a traffic flow rate forecasting model. In order to achieve this goal, several methods on the 1-h prediction have been compared and the one providing the best results is based on artificial neural networks. Moreover, several control strategies have been tested and the one which gave the best energy savings is the adaptive one we carried out. Experimentation has been carried out on real data and the study shows that with the proposed approach, it is possible to save up to 50 % of energy compared to no regulation systems.

Cellular automata on FPGA for real-time urban traffic signals control	JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING			English	Article						Traffic signals; Cellular automata; FPGA; Real-time control	STATISTICAL PHYSICS; VLSI IMPLEMENTATION; LAVA FLOWS; MODEL; SIMULATION; SYSTEM; TOOL	Among different traffic features, the urban traffic has received a lot of attention due to the ongoing traffic congestion as a result of increased car usage, population growth, and changes in population density. In urban networks, the vehicles flow differs when compared with highways flow because of the freeway's low speed limit but mostly because of the traffic lights control. In this paper, a real-time hardware implemented bio-inspired model for traffic lights control is presented. The proposed model arrives from Cellular Automata (CAs), which have been proven very flexible and powerful computational traffic models, in that they are able to capture all previously mentioned basic phenomena that occur in traffic flows. The resulting CA model was hardware implemented on FPGA to take full advantage of the inherent parallelism of the CAs and to support the function of an advanced electronic system able to provide real-time adaptive control of traffic lights designed to consider traffic conditions for the whole intersections. The analytical results, obtained by application of the aforementioned FPGA CA processor are found in excellent agreement with the numerical simulations.	[Kalogeropoulos, G.; Sirakoulis, G.

Modeling space-time inhomogeneities with the kinematic wave theory	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Space-time inhomogeneity; Kinematic wave (LWR) model; Variational formulation; Coordinate translation; Capacity drop; Multi-lane traffic	TRAFFIC FLOW; VARIATIONAL FORMULATION	In this paper, we are concerned with modeling space-time inhomogeneities with the kinematic wave (LWR) model. The notion of space-time inhomogeneity refers to the fact that governing laws of traffic, essentially dictated by fundamental diagrams (FD), differ from each other in distinct space-time regions. Such a scenario is common when exogenous inputs, e.g. a group of slowly moving vehicles, emerge in the modeling process. We will prove the well-posedness of this class of problems. More importantly, we show that if the boundary delineating two neighboring regions is continuous and has bounded speed, this problem can be greatly simplified by introducing a piecewise linear approximation to the boundary. In particular, we utilize the variational formulation of the kinematic wave model and prove that this approximation results in uniformly bounded errors in cumulative flow N which are proportional to the L-infinity deviation of the approximation. The numerical solution of this simplified problem is well understood, and this result means that a kinematic wave model with space-time inhomogeneity can be solved accurately with any existing Godunov type scheme. Finally, using the inhomogeneous LWR model, we explain the capacity drop as a natural result of space-time inhomogeneity. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Li, Jia; Zhang, H.

J	Xu, CC; Tarko, AP; Wang, W; Liu, P				Xu, Chengcheng; Tarko, Andrew P.; Wang, Wei; Liu, Pan			Predicting crash likelihood and severity on freeways with real-time loop detector data	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Crash severity; Real-time safety management; Crash risk prediction; Sequential logit model; Freeway	ACCEPTANCE CHARACTERISTICS; INJURY SEVERITY; MODELS; SPEED; PARAMETERS; SAFETY; RISK	Real-time crash risk prediction using traffic data collected from loop detector stations is useful in dynamic safety management systems aimed at improving traffic safety through application of proactive safety countermeasures. The major drawback of most of the existing studies is that they focus on the crash risk without consideration of crash severity. This paper presents an effort to develop a model that predicts the crash likelihood at different levels of severity with a particular focus on severe crashes. The crash data and traffic data used in this study were collected on the 1-880 freeway in California, United States. This study considers three levels of crash severity: fatal/incapacitating injury crashes (KA), non-incapacitating/possible injury crashes (BC), and property-damage-only crashes (PDO). The sequential logit model was used to link the likelihood of crash occurrences at different severity levels to various traffic flow characteristics derived from detector data. The elasticity analysis was conducted to evaluate the effect of the traffic flow variables on the likelihood of crash and its severity. The results show that the traffic flow characteristics contributing to crash likelihood were quite different at different levels of severity. The PDO crashes were more likely to occur under congested traffic flow conditions with highly variable speed and frequent lane changes, while the KA and BC crashes were more likely to occur under less congested traffic flow conditions. High speed, coupled with a large speed difference between adjacent lanes under uncongested traffic conditions, was found to increase the likelihood of severe crashes (KA). This study applied the 20-fold cross-validation method to estimate the prediction performance of the developed models. The validation results show that the model's crash prediction performance at each severity level was satisfactory. The findings of this study can be used to predict the probabilities of crash at different severity levels, which is valuable knowledge in the pursuit of reducing the risk of severe crashes through the use of dynamic safety management systems on freeways.

Platoon-based macroscopic model for intelligent traffic flow	TRANSPORTMETRICA B-TRANSPORT DYNAMICS			English	Article						platoon operation; intelligent vehicles; generalised force model; macroscopic traffic model; linear instabilities	ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; STABILITY; INSTABILITY; SIMULATION; SCHEME	This paper proposes a macroscopic model to describe the dynamics of intelligent traffic flow where intelligent vehicles are driving closer to each other than manual vehicles and operating in a form of many platoons each of which contains several vehicles. The model is developed from a car-following model which allows us to obtain well tractable macroscopic equations for such platoon-based traffic operation. A linear stability diagram is constructed from the developed model based on the linear stability method for a certain model parameter set. It is found analytically that platoon-based driving behaviour of intelligent vehicles enhances the stabilisation of traffic flow with respect to a small perturbation. Numerical simulation of an open freeway with an on-ramp bottleneck supports our analytical results. We have argued that the newly developed macroscopic model will provide a better insight into the dynamics of intelligent traffic flow.

To control the traffic flow, a traffic signalization light operating for a fixed-time scheme is placed in the middle of the street. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to calculate various model characteristics. Essentially, we investigate the formation of the cars queue behind traffic light dependence on the duration of green light T-g, injecting and extracting probabilities alpha and beta, respectively. Two phases of average training queues were found. Besides, the dependence of car accident probability per site and per time step on T-g, alpha and beta is computed.

J	Celikoglu, HB				Celikoglu, Hilmi Berk			Reconstructing freeway travel times with a simplified network flow model alternating the adopted fundamental diagram	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Forecasting; Network flows; Two-phase fundamental diagram; Mesoscopic simulation	VEHICLE-ROUTING PROBLEM; TRANSPORTATION; ALGORITHM; FORMULATION; SIMULATION	The present study summarises the travel time reconstruction performance of a network flow model by explicitly analysing the adopted fundamental diagram relation under congested and un-congested traffic patterns. The incorporated network flow model uses a discrete meso-simulation approach in which the anisotropic property of traffic flow and the uniform acceleration of vehicle packets are explicitly considered. The flow performances on link-route dynamics have been derived by reasonably alternating the adopted two-phase, i.e., congested and un-congested, fundamental relation of traffic flow. The linear speed-density relation with the creeping speed assumption is substituted with the triangular flow-density relation in order to investigate the performance of the network flow model in varying flow patterns. Applying the anisotropic mesoscopic model, the measure of travel time is obtained as a link performance from a simplified dynamic network loading process. Travel time reconstruction performance of the network flow model is sought considering the actual measures that are obtained by a probe vehicle, in addition to reconstructions by a macroscopic network flow model. The main improvements on travel time reconstruction process are encountered in terms of the computation load within the explicit analyses by the alternation of adopted two-phase fundamental diagram. Although the accuracies of the flow model with the adoption of two different fundamental diagrams are hard to differentiate, the computational burden of the simulation process by the triangular fundamental diagram is found to be considerably different.

J	Zheng, L; Zhong, SQ; Ma, SF				Zheng, Liang; Zhong, Shiquan; Ma, Shoufeng			Towards the bi-directional cellular automaton model with perception ranges	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Cellular automaton; Synchronized flow; Perception range; Brake light; Honk stimulation	SINGLE-VEHICLE DATA; TRAFFIC FLOW; HIGHWAY; STABILITY	The traditional cellular automaton (CA) model assumes that drivers only receive information from the preceding vehicles, e.g. the brake light information. However, in reality, drivers not only perceive information from downstream but can also get upstream information, e.g. the honk stimulation. The CA model involving traffic information from downstream and upstream is called the bi-directional CA model here. Meanwhile, with the introduction of Connected Vehicle Technologies, the perception range of drivers is expected to significantly increase which can lead to more informed driving behavior. Such an impact cannot be easily modeled by traditional one-directional CA models. In this study, the perception ranges of both the brake light effect and honk stimulation are introduced into the bi-directional CA model. Fundamental diagrams and spatial-temporal diagrams are then analyzed and two methods, i.e. the traffic flow interruption effect and microscopic analysis of time series data, are utilized to distinguish the synchronized traffic flow. Further numerical results illustrate that the perception range and slow-to-start sensitivity threshold are two important factors to reproduce the synchronized flow, and consideration of the honk information and the larger perception range both benefit the stability of traffic flow, which implies the potential significance of the application of Connected Vehicle Technologies.

J	Zhao, PJ; Chapman, R; Randal, E; Howden-Chapman, P				Zhao, Pengjun; Chapman, Ralph; Randal, Edward; Howden-Chapman, Philippa			Understanding Resilient Urban Futures: A Systemic Modelling Approach	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						city resilience; climate change; urban processes; systemic approach; sea-level rise	TRAVEL	The resilience of cities in response to natural disasters and long-term climate change has emerged as a focus of academic and policy attention. In particular, how to understand the interconnectedness of urban and natural systems is a key issue. This paper introduces an urban model that can be used to evaluate city resilience outcomes under different policy scenarios. The model is the Wellington Integrated Land Use-Transport-Environment Model (WILUTE). It considers the city (i.e., Wellington) as a complex system characterized by interactions between a variety of internal urban processes (social, economic and physical) and the natural environment. It is focused on exploring the dynamic relations between human activities (the geographic distribution of housing and employment, infrastructure layout, traffic flows and energy consumption), environmental effects (carbon emissions, influences on local natural and ecological systems) and potential natural disasters (e.g., inundation due to sea level rise and storm events) faced under different policy scenarios. The model gives insights that are potentially useful for policy to enhance the city's resilience, by modelling outcomes, such as the potential for reduction in transportation energy use, and changes in the vulnerability of the city's housing stock and transport system to sea level rise.

J	Boyce, D; Xie, J				Boyce, David; Xie, Jun			Assigning user class link flows uniquely	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Static user-equilibrium traffic assignment; Multi-class link flows; Condition of proportionality; Order of assigned trip matrices	TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT; ROUTE FLOWS; ALGORITHM	Static user-equilibrium traffic assignment, the standard method for predicting traffic flows on urban road networks, is based on the principle that drivers choose their own least cost routes from their origins to their destinations. This principle may be formally described by user-equilibrium conditions, which correspond to the optimal solution to a nonlinear minimization problem. Although the total flows on links of the road network are uniquely determined by this formulation, multiple user-class link flows, as well as route flows, are not. Nevertheless, professionals frequently use class link flows output by their software for project evaluation, and class route flows to perform select link analyses. These applications may result in misleading findings, for example, in scenario analyses. An additional assumption may be imposed to determine these user class link flows and route flows uniquely. A possible assumption is the condition of proportionality, namely that the proportion of vehicles on each of two alternative, equal-cost segments (sequences of links) should be the same regardless of their user class, origin or destination. This paper compares two assignments in which the order of the car and truck trip matrices was specified as car followed by truck, and truck followed by car. Although the total link flows for the two assignments are effectively equal, substantial differences exist between the user class link flows determined by the different orderings of the matrices. Post-processing to impose the condition of proportionality on the class O-D flows removes about 90% of these differences. Analyses of class link flows of cars and trucks before and after imposing the condition of proportionality for one of these assignments reveal that about half of all links experience differences in user class flows, ranging up to +/- 300 vph. These findings offer insights into the magnitude of the differences arising from the non-uniqueness of class link flows, and identify which links are subject to differences. Imposing the condition of proportionality in multi-class traffic assignments is recommended in travel forecasting practice. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we introduce a fast technique to reconstruct traffic flows from in-road sensor measurements or procedurally generated data for interactive 3D visual applications. Our algorithm estimates the full state of the traffic flow from sparse sensor measurements (or procedural input) using a statistical inference method and a continuum traffic model. This estimated state then drives an agent-based traffic simulator to produce a 3D animation of vehicle traffic that statistically matches the original traffic conditions. Unlike existing traffic simulation and animation techniques, our method produces a full 3D rendering of individual vehicles as part of continuous traffic flows given discrete spatio-temporal sensor measurements. Instead of using a color map to indicate traffic conditions, users could visualize and fly over the reconstructed traffic in real time over a large digital cityscape.

Accordingly, this research proposes an Equivalent Link traffic State Model (ELSM) to meet this requirement. ELSM combines both advantages of Vertical Queue Model (VQ) and Horizontal Queue Model (HQ). On one hand, the structure of ELSM is similar to VQ; on the other hand, queue dynamics at any moment along the link can be available through deriving three "characteristic points" of each cycle based on shock wave theory. Thus spatial variation of vehicle queue can be obtained. As a result, common traffic performance indexes such as delay, stops and queue length can be directly obtained in addition to the microscopic level variables such as vehicle trajectories and travel time. It is shown that with the increasing of numerical resolution, the results of CTM (Cell Transmission Model) gradually converge to ELSM.

Chaotic nonlinear dynamics approach is now the most powerful tool for scientists to deal with complexities in real cases, and neural networks and neuro-fuzzy models are widely used for their capabilities in nonlinear modeling of chaotic systems more than the traditional methods. As mentioned, the traffic flow conditions caused the forecasting values of traffic flow to lack robustness and accuracy. In this paper, the traffic flow forecasting is analyzed with emotional concepts and multi-agent systems (MASs) points of view as a new method in this field. The findings enabled the researchers to develop a newly object-oriented method of forecasting traffic flow. Its architecture is based on a temporal difference (TD) Q-learning with a neuro-fuzzy structure, which is the nonparametric approach. The performance of TD Q-learning is improved by emotional learning. The proposed method on the present conditions and the action of the system according to the criteria could forecast traffic signals so that the objectives are reached in minimum time. The ability of presented learning algorithm to prospect gains from future actions and obtain rewards from its past experiences allows emotional TD Q-learning algorithm to improve its decisions for the best possible actions. In addition, to study in a more practical situation, the neuro-fuzzy behaviors could be modeled by MAS. The proposed method (intelligent/nonparametric approach) is compared by parametric approach, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) method, which is implemented by multi-layer perceptron neural networks and called ARIMANN. Here, the ARIMANN is updated by backpropagation and temporal difference backpropagation for the first time. The simulation results revealed that the studied forecaster could discover the optimal forecasting by means of the Q-learning algorithm. Difficult to handle through parametric and classic methods, the real traffic flow signals used for fitting the algorithms is obtained from a two-lane street I-494 in Minnesota City.

J	Lo, SC				Lo, Shih-Ching			Expectation-maximization based algorithm for pattern recognition in traffic speed distribution	MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING			English	Article						Signal processing; Pattern recognition; Gaussian mixture; Multiclass users traffic flow; Expectation-maximization algorithm	EM ALGORITHM; FLOW; MODEL; WAVES	Understanding driving behavior is a complicated research topic. To describe accurate speed, flow and density of a multiclass users traffic flow, an adequate model is needed. Mostly, user-classes are categorized by vehicle type characteristics. However, driving behavior is also influenced by drivers and socio-economic characteristics. Categorizing user-class by vehicle type may not reflect multiclass users traffic flow properly. On the other hand, driving behavior is studied through tracking trace of individual vehicles, experimenting in a driving simulator or inquiring by questionnaire generally. It costs a lot and may produce bias because of the design of the questionnaire or experiment. Therefore, a new method, which is based on a pattern recognition technique, is proposed to classify driving behavior in multiclass users traffic flow. In this study, the speed is considered as the result of driving behavior and the speed distribution on a road is assumed to be a mixture of Gaussian distributions. According to the assumptions, the expectation-maximization algorithm is employed to train and classify different user-classes. With this method, an economical and automatic way for traffic data processing and parameter extraction is obtained. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wei, P; Cao, Y; Sun, D				Wei, P.; Cao, Y.; Sun, D.			Total unimodularity and decomposition method for large-scale air traffic cell transmission model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Air traffic flow management; Cell transmission model; Total unimodularity; Large-scale transportation network	GROUND-HOLDING PROBLEM; FLOW MANAGEMENT PROBLEM; DECISION-MAKING MODEL; EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS; OPTIMIZATION; PROGRAMS; AIRLINES; WORKLOAD	In an earlier work, Sun and Bayen built a Large-Capacity Cell Transmission Model for air traffic flow management. They formulated an integer programming problem of minimizing the total travel time of flights in the National Airspace System of the United States subject to sector capacity constraints. The integer program was relaxed to a linear program for computational efficiency. In this paper the authors formulate the optimization problem in a standard linear programming form. We analyze the total unimodular property of the constraint matrix, and prove that the linear programming relaxation generates an optimal integral solution for the original integer program. It is guaranteed to be optimal and integral if solved by a simplex related method. In order to speed up the computation, we apply the Dantzig-Wolfe Decomposition algorithm, which is shown to preserve the total unimodularity of the constraint matrix. Finally, we evaluate the performances of Sun and Bayen's relaxation solved by the interior point method and our decomposition algorithm with large-scale air traffic data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yildirimoglu, M; Geroliminis, N				Yildirimoglu, Mehmet; Geroliminis, Nikolas			Experienced travel time prediction for congested freeways	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Congestion maps; Travel times; Freeway; Prediction; Traffic flow	TRAFFIC-STATE ESTIMATION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MODEL; IDENTIFICATION	Travel time is an important performance measure for transportation systems, and dissemination of travel time information can help travelers make reliable travel decisions such as route choice or departure time. Since the traffic data collected in real time reflects the past or current conditions on the roadway, a predictive travel time methodology should be used to obtain the information to be disseminated. However, an important part of the literature either uses instantaneous travel time assumption, and sums the travel time of roadway segments at the starting time of the trip, or uses statistical forecasting algorithms to predict the future travel time. This study benefits from the available traffic flow fundamentals (e.g. shockwave analysis and bottleneck identification), and makes use of both historical and real time traffic information to provide travel time prediction. The methodological framework of this approach sequentially includes a bottleneck identification algorithm, clustering of traffic data in traffic regimes with similar characteristics, development of stochastic congestion maps for clustered data and an online congestion search algorithm, which combines historical data analysis and real-time data to predict experienced travel times at the starting time of the trip. The experimental results based on the loop detector data on Californian freeways indicate that the proposed method provides promising travel time predictions under varying traffic conditions.

Researchers have used statistical analysis, numerical modelling using Newtonian Mechanics, and micro simulation models to assess roads safety performance. In this study, these three methods are combined to improve the assessment of safety at road locations compared to previous works. Micro simulation forms the basis of the framework while statistical and numerical models using Newtonian Mechanics are the other models utilised and embedded into the micro simulation model. The input into the micro simulation model is general traffic conditions and its output is a measure of road safety performance. The framework consists of two main components. The first component is associated to the estimation of the number and severity of conflicts from general traffic flow inputs. The second component is an estimation of the expected injury severity of individuals, involving in the conflict, should the simulated conflict lead to a crash. The Australian Crash In-Depth Study (ANCIS) database is used to estimate the statistical and numerical model parameters. The modelling framework is applied to an intersection in Melbourne, Australia and its associated safety performance results are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The linear stability condition of two-lane traffic is derived with the multi-anticipation effect term by linear stability analysis, which shows that the stable region enlarges with the number of multi-anticipation sites increasing. Nonlinear analysis near the critical point is carried out to obtain kink-antikink soliton solution of the mKdV equation with the multi-anticipation effect term. Numerical simulation also shows that the multi-anticipation effect can suppress the traffic jam efficiently with lane changing in two-lane system.

The energy dissipation model for traffic flow is derived. Simulations are carried out to examine the energy dissipation in traffic flow on a curved road with friction coefficient and radii of curvature. Results analysis show that the total energy dissipation increases with an increase in the friction coefficient and radii of curvature. Moreover, the energy dissipation rate varies with the density and road length, which is in good agreement with the real traffic situations.

J	Tsekeris, T; Geroliminis, N				Tsekeris, Theodore; Geroliminis, Nikolas			City size, network structure and traffic congestion	JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS			English	Article						City size; Land use; Transport network; Traffic congestion dynamics; Macroscopic fundamental diagram	URBAN SPATIAL STRUCTURE; MIXED LAND-USE; MODEL; HYPERCONGESTION; DENSITY; CITIES	This paper presents an alternative approach for analyzing the relationship between land use and traffic congestion by employing the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). The MFD is an empirically observed relationship between traffic flow and traffic density at the level of an urban region, including hypercongestion, where flow decreases as density increases. This approach is consistent with the physics of traffic and allows the parsimonious modeling of intra-day traffic dynamics and their connection with city size, land use and network characteristics. The MFD can accurately measure the inefficiency of land and network resource allocation due to hypercongestion, in contrast with existing models of congestion. The findings reinforce the 'compact city' hypothesis, by favoring a larger mixed-use core area with greater zone width, block density and number of lanes, compared to the peripheral area. They also suggest a new set of policies, including the optimization of perimeter controls and the fraction of land for transport, which constitute robust second-best optimal strategies that can further reduce congestion externalities.

Exploring the processes governing roadside pollutant concentrations in urban street canyon	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Street canyon; Roadside pollution prediction; Noise (dB(B)); Statistical analysis; Traffic congestion indicator	TRAFFIC NOISE; NEURAL-NETWORKS; AIR-POLLUTION; PREDICTION; DISPERSION; MODELS; CITY	This paper describes an in-depth analysis to investigate the huge variation in the measured roadside air-pollutant concentrations of carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide in terms of the traffic flow levels, the orientation of the street to the prevailing wind, the wind speed, temperature and barometric pressure. The work has attempted to develop generic parameters that can be applied to other urban areas. However, in the absence of a measure of congestion at the site in Palermo (Italy), the methodological approach proposed used the simultaneous noise measurements, in units of decibels (B), to help parameterise a generic congestion indicator in terms of the traffic flow. The potential transferability of the approach was demonstrated for a site in Marylebone Road, London (UK), given the similarity of the two study sites, canyon shape, traffic characteristics and road orientation. The results showed that, within the range of data available, noise levels could be used as a proxy for flow change on the shoulders of the peak hour and hence congestion and a generic relationship with factors statistically significant at 99 % confidence allows roadside concentrations due to traffic to be estimated with a regression coefficient of R (2) = 0.73 (R = 0.85). The research demonstrates that whilst there are indeed underlying relationships that can explain the roadside concentrations based on traffic and meteorological conditions, evidence is presented that confirms the complexity of the physical and chemical processes that govern roadside concentrations.

J	Knorr, F; Schreckenberg, M				Knorr, Florian; Schreckenberg, Michael			The comfortable driving model revisited: traffic phases and phase transitions	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT			English	Article						cellular automata; traffic and crowd dynamics; traffic models	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; PATTERNS; STATES	We study the spatiotemporal patterns resulting from different boundary conditions for a microscopic traffic model and contrast them with empirical results. By evaluating the time series of local measurements, the local traffic states are assigned to the different traffic phases of Kerner's three-phase traffic theory. For this classification we use the rule-based FOTO-method, which provides 'hard' rules for this assignment. Using this approach, our analysis shows that the model is indeed able to reproduce three qualitatively different traffic phases: free flow (F), synchronized traffic (S), and wide moving jams (J). In addition, we investigate the likelihood of transitions between the three traffic phases. We show that a transition from free flow to a wide moving jam often involves an intermediate transition: first from free flow to synchronized flow and then from synchronized flow to a wide moving jam. This is supported by the fact that the so-called F -> S transition (from free flow to synchronized traffic) is much more likely than a direct F -> J transition. The model under consideration has a functional relationship between traffic flow and traffic density. The fundamental hypothesis of the three-phase traffic theory, however, postulates that the steady states of synchronized flow occupy a two-dimensional region in the flow density plane. Due to the obvious discrepancy between the model investigated here and the postulate of the three-phase traffic theory, the good agreement that we found could not be expected. For a more detailed analysis, we also studied vehicle dynamics at a microscopic level and provide a comparison of real detector data with simulated data of the identical highway segment.

J	Peng, GH				Peng, Guanghan			A new lattice model of the traffic flow with the consideration of the driver anticipation effect in a two-lane system	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS			English	Article						Traffic flow; Lattice model; Driver anticipation effect; Two-lane system	MODIFIED KDV EQUATION; JAMMING TRANSITION; HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL	In this paper, a new lattice model of the traffic flow is proposed with the consideration of the driver anticipation effect for a two-lane system. The linear stability condition is derived by employing linear stability analysis. The analytical result shows that the driver anticipation effect can improve the stability of the traffic flow in a two-lane system. The mKdV equation near the critical point is obtained to describe the propagating behavior of a traffic density wave with the perturbation method.

J	Woelki, M				Woelki, Marko			Density-feedback control in traffic and transport far from equilibrium	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							MODEL; FLOW; STATES	A bottleneck situation in one-lane traffic flow is typically modelled with a constant demand of entering cars. However, in practice this demand may depend on the density of cars in the bottleneck. The present paper studies a simple bimodal realization of this mechanism to which we refer to as density-feedback control (DFC): If the actual density in the bottleneck is above a certain threshold, the reservoir density of possibly entering cars is reduced to a different constant value. By numerical solution of the discretized viscid Burgers equation a rich stationary phase diagram is found. In order to maximize the flow, which is the goal of typical traffic-management strategies, we find the optimal choice of the threshold. Analytical results are verified by computer simulations of the microscopic totally asymmetric exclusion process with DFC.

J	Yao, J; Huang, JY; Chen, GR; Xu, WS				Yao Jing; Huang Jing-Yi; Chen Guan-Rong; Xu Wei-Sheng			A new coupled-map car-following model based on a transportation supernetwork framework	CHINESE PHYSICS B			English	Article						traffic flow; coupled map car-following model; inter-vehicle communication; supernetwork	SYSTEM	A new car-following model is proposed by considering information from a number of preceding vehicles with inter-vehicle communication. A supernetwork architecture is first described, which has two layers: a traffic network and a communication network. The two networks interact with and depend on each other. The error dynamic system around the steady state of the model is theoretically analyzed and some nonjam criteria are derived. A simple control signal is added to the model to analyze the criteria of suppressing traffic jams. The corresponding numerical simulations confirm the correctness of the theoretical analysis. Compared with previous studies concerning coupled map models, the controlled model proposed in this paper is more reasonable and also more effective in the sense that it takes into account the formation of traffic congestion.

Predicting reduced visibility related crashes on freeways using real-time traffic flow data	JOURNAL OF SAFETY RESEARCH			English	Article						Real-time crash prediction; Freeways; Reduced visibility; Random Forests; Matched case-control logistic regression		Objectives: The main objective of this paper is to investigate whether real-time traffic flow data, collected from loop detectors and radar sensors on freeways, can be used to predict crashes occurring at reduced visibility conditions. In addition, it examines the difference between significant factors associated with reduced visibility related crashes to those factors correlated with crashes occurring at clear visibility conditions. Method: Random Forests and matched case-control logistic regression models were estimated. Results: The findings indicated that real-time traffic variables can be used to predict visibility related crashes on freeways. The results showed that about 69% of reduced visibility related crashes were correctly identified. The results also indicated that traffic flow variables leading to visibility related crashes are slightly different from those variables leading to clear visibility crashes. Impact on Industry: Using time slices 5-15 minutes before crashes might provide an opportunity for the appropriate traffic management centers for a proactive intervention to reduce crash risk in real-time.

The traffic flow surface is analyzed with respect to the three 2-dimensional coordinate systems arising in the space of vehicle number, time and distance. In each case, the solution to the initial and boundary value problems are presented. Explicit solution methods and examples are shown for the triangular flow-density diagram case. This unveils new models and shows how a number of existing models are cast as special cases. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Integrated fuzzy signal and ramp-metering at a diamond interchange	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article							LOGIC-CONTROLLER	We propose a fuzzy logic control for the integrated signal operation of a diamond interchange and its ramp meter, to improve traffic flows on surface streets and motorway. This fuzzy logic diamond interchange (FLDI) comprises of three modules: fuzzy phase timing (FPT) module that controls the green time extension of the current phase, phase logic selection (PLS) module that decides the next phase based on the pre-defined phase sequence or phase logic and, fuzzy ramp-metering (FRM) module that determines the cycle time of the ramp meter based on current traffic volumes and conditions of the surface streets and the motorways. The FLDI is implemented in Advanced Interactive Microscopic Simulator for Urban and Non-Urban Network Version 6 (AIMSUN 6), and compared with the traffic actuated signal control. Simulation results show that the FLDI outperforms the traffic-actuated models with lower system total travel time, average delay, and improvements in downstream average speed and average delay.

By estimating from Cellular Floating Vehicle Data (CFVD) is more cost-effective, and easier to acquire than traditional ways. In this paper, this study proposes a novel approach to evaluate the relation of normal location update, call arrivals, traffic flow, and traffic density. Moreover, the traffic speed is estimated by the proposed approach according to CFVD. In the simulation, this study compares the real traffic information with the estimated traffic information by Vehicle Detector (VD). The experiment results show that the accuracy of traffic speed estimation is 92.92%. Therefore, the proposed approach can be used to estimate traffic speed from CFVD for ITS. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Celikoglu, HB				Celikoglu, Hilmi Berk			Flow-Based Freeway Travel-Time Estimation: A Comparative Evaluation Within Dynamic Path Loading	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Simulation; traffic flow; travel time	NETWORK; MODEL; FORMULATION; SYSTEM	This paper investigates the performance of a flow model in providing efficient travel-time estimation for varying flow patterns of freeway traffic by adopting a two-phase fundamental diagram. The model follows a discrete-packet-based mesoscopic simulation approach that explicitly considers both the anisotropic property of traffic flow in packet state updating and the uniform speed differentiation of vehicle packets at each discrete time step. The measure of travel time is obtained as a link performance resulting from a simplified dynamic network loading process. The spatiotemporal flow propagation on a selected freeway segment is simulated comparatively by incorporating both the proposed model and a linear-travel-time-function-based link performance model. Performance of the flow model in travel-time estimation is sought, considering actual measures obtained by a probe vehicle. The main improvement on estimating the travel-time process is that the employed model considers different speed and acceleration levels on different discrete time intervals and satisfies the anisotropy property by consistently simulating flow propagation within the dynamic network modeling frame. In contrast to the vast data need and computational burden of trajectory-based methods, the employed flow-based model requires only the time-varying inflow profiles to estimate spatially and temporally varying travel times by artificially segmenting freeway routes.

J	Lippi, M; Bertini, M; Frasconi, P				Lippi, Marco; Bertini, Matteo; Frasconi, Paolo			Short-Term Traffic Flow Forecasting: An Experimental Comparison of Time-Series Analysis and Supervised Learning	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Intelligent transportation systems; support vector machines; traffic forecasting	NEURAL-NETWORKS; PREDICTION; MODELS; REGRESSION; LIKELIHOOD; VOLUME	The literature on short-term traffic flow forecasting has undergone great development recently. Many works, describing a wide variety of different approaches, which very often share similar features and ideas, have been published. However, publications presenting new prediction algorithms usually employ different settings, data sets, and performance measurements, making it difficult to infer a clear picture of the advantages and limitations of each model. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we review existing approaches to short-term traffic flow forecasting methods under the common view of probabilistic graphical models, presenting an extensive experimental comparison, which proposes a common baseline for their performance analysis and provides the infrastructure to operate on a publicly available data set. Second, we present two new support vector regression models, which are specifically devised to benefit from typical traffic flow seasonality and are shown to represent an interesting compromise between prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. The SARIMA model coupled with a Kalman filter is the most accurate model; however, the proposed seasonal support vector regressor turns out to be highly competitive when performing forecasts during the most congested periods.

J	Xiao, CZ; Cao, JX; Wang, ZY				Xiao, Chong Zi; Cao, Jin Xin; Wang, Zheng Yu			A new concept of occupancy: Dynamic time occupancy	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Occupancy; Dynamic time occupancy; Traffic flow; Average time gaps; Minimum safety distance	DENSITY-ESTIMATION; NETWORKS	Occupancy is widely used in traffic flow theory. As a static parameter, however, the traditional occupancy cannot provide a comprehensive description of traffic performance. Based on previous studies, given the minimum safety distance between two adjacent vehicles in the same lane, the dynamic space occupancy (DSO) is redefined and a new parameter, namely the dynamic time occupancy (DTO), is proposed in this paper. It is found that the reaction time and the average time gaps are equivalent under congested condition, and this results in an equivalence relationship between the DTO model and the average time gaps model. Also, a new congested traffic fundamental diagram is derived, which is similar to the triangular traffic flow model. The analysis of a large set of the field data shows that DTO is always equal or close to 1 under congested condition. It is found that the reaction time has a great influence on highway capacity when DTO equals 1, and this may be useful for the capacity analysis or improvement. Different from the traditional static occupancy, DTO is a dynamic parameter that can provide a more fitting description of the occupying relationship between vehicles and highways.

In addition different results have been sometimes obtained regarding the effects of traffic and geometry on crashes in road tunnels. However, most research has focused on tunnels where traffic and geometric conditions, as well as driving behaviour, differ from those in Italy. Thus, in this paper crash prediction-models that had not yet been proposed for Italian road tunnels have been developed. For the purpose, a 4-year monitoring period extending from 2006 to 2009 was considered. The tunnels investigated are single-tube ones with unidirectional traffic. The Bivariate Negative Binomial regression model, jointly applied to non-severe crashes (accidents involving material-damage only) and severe crashes (fatal and injury accidents only), was used to model the frequency of accident occurrence. The year effect on severe crashes was also analyzed by the Random Effects Binomial regression model and the Negative Multinomial regression model. Regression parameters were estimated by the Maximum Likelihood Method. The Cumulative Residual Method was used to test the adequacy of the regression model through the range of annual average daily traffic per lane. The candidate set of variables was: tunnel length (L), annual average daily traffic per lane (AADT(L)), percentage of trucks (%Tr), number of lanes (N-L), and the presence of a sidewalk. Both for non-severe crashes and severe crashes, prediction-models showed that significant variables are: L, AADT(L), %Tr, and N-L. A significant year effect consisting in a systematic reduction of severe crashes over time was also detected. The analysis developed in this paper appears to be useful for many applications such as the estimation of accident reductions due to improvement in existing tunnels and/or to modifications of traffic control systems, as well as for the prediction of accidents when different tunnel design options are compared.

Since Makkah is situated in an arid region and is a very busy city due to its religious importance in the Muslim world, PM10 concentrations here exceed the international and national air quality standards set for the protection of human health. The main aim of this paper is to model PM10 concentrations with the aid of meteorological variables (wind speed, wind direction, temperature, and relative humidity) and traffic related air pollutant concentrations (carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and lag_PM10 concentrations), which are measured at the same location near Al-Haram (the Holy Mosque) in Makkah. A Generalized Additive Model was developed for predicting hourly PM10 concentrations. Predicted and observed PM10 concentrations are compared, and several metrics, including the coefficients of determination (R-2 = 0.52), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 84), Fractional Bias (FB = -0.22) and Factor of 2 (FAC2 = 0.88), are calculated to assess the performance of the model. The results of these, along with a graphical comparison of the predicted and observed concentrations, show that model is able to perform well. While effects of all the covariates were significant (p-value < 0.01), the meteorological variables, such as temperature and wind speed, seem to be the major controlling factors with regard to PM10 concentrations. Traffic related air pollutants showed a weak association with PM10 concentrations, suggesting road traffic is not the major source of these. No modeling study has been published with regards to air pollution in Makkah and thus this is the first work of this kind. Further work is required to characterize road traffic flow, speed and composition and quantify the contribution of each source, which is part of the ongoing project for managing the air quality in Makkah.

Forecasting Multivariate Road Traffic Flows Using Bayesian Dynamic Graphical Models, Splines and Other Traffic Variables	AUSTRALIAN & NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF STATISTICS			English	Article						cubic splines; dynamic linear model; headway; linear multiregression dynamic model; occupancy; speed; state space models		Traffic flow data are routinely collected for many networks worldwide. These invariably large data sets can be used as part of a traffic management system, for which good traffic flow forecasting models are crucial. The linear multiregression dynamic model (LMDM) has been shown to be promising for forecasting flows, accommodating multivariate flow time series, while being a computationally simple model to use. While statistical flow forecasting models usually base their forecasts on flow data alone, data for other traffic variables are also routinely collected. This paper shows how cubic splines can be used to incorporate extra variables into the LMDM in order to enhance flow forecasts. Cubic splines are also introduced into the LMDM to parsimoniously accommodate the daily cycle exhibited by traffic flows.The proposed methodology allows the LMDM to provide more accurate forecasts when forecasting flows in a real high-dimensional traffic data set. The resulting extended LMDM can deal with some important traffic modelling issues not usually considered in flow forecasting models. Additionally, the model can be implemented in a real-time environment, a crucial requirement for traffic management systems designed to support decisions and actions to alleviate congestion and keep traffic flowing.

Traffic, weather, and crash data used in this paper were obtained from the I-880N freeway in California, United States. The random forest (RF) technique was conducted to select the variables that affect crash risk under uncongested and congested traffic conditions. The GP model was developed for each traffic state based on the candidate variables that were selected by the RF technique. The traffic flow characteristics that contribute to crash risk were found to be quite different between congested and uncongested traffic conditions. This paper applied the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to evaluate the prediction performance of the developed GP model for each traffic state. The validation results showed that the prediction performance of the GP models were satisfactory. The binary logit model was also developed for each traffic state using the same training data set. The authors compared the ROC curve of the GP model and the binary logit model for each traffic state. The GP model produced better prediction performance than did the binary logit model for each traffic state. The GP model was found to increase the crash prediction accuracy under uncongested traffic conditions by an average of 8.2% and to increase the crash prediction accuracy under congested traffic conditions by an average of 4.9%.

Integrated macroscopic traffic flow, emission, and fuel consumption model for control purposes	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Traffic flow models; Emission models; Fuel consumption models; Macroscopic models; METANET; VT-micro	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; ACCELERATION; SPEED	Traffic control approaches based on on-line optimization require fast and accurate integrated models for traffic flow, emission, and fuel consumption. In this context, one may want to integrate macroscopic traffic flow models with microscopic emission and fuel consumption models, which can result in shorter simulation times with fairly accurate estimates of the emissions and fuel consumption. In general, however, macroscopic traffic flow models and microscopic emission and fuel consumption models cannot be integrated with each other. We provide a general framework to integrate these two kinds of models. We illustrate the approach by considering the macroscopic traffic flow model METANET(1) and the microscopic emission and fuel consumption model VT-micro,(2) resulting in the so called the "VT-macro" model. Moreover, we characterize analytically the error introduced by the VT-macro model relative to the original VT-micro model. We further present an empirical analysis of the error and the computation time based on calibrated models of the Dutch A12 freeway. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Zegeye, S.

People Matching for Transportation Planning Using Texel Camera Data for Sequential Estimation	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS			English	Article						Multiple measurements; people matching; texel camera; trellis optimization	RECOGNITION; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; SEARCH	This paper addresses automatic people matching in the dynamic setting of public transportation, such as a bus, as people enter and then at some later time exit from a doorway. Matching a person entering to the same person exiting at a later time provides accurate information about individual riders, such as how long a person is on a bus and the associated stops the person uses. At a higher level, matching exits to previous entry events provides information about the distribution of traffic flow across the whole transportation system. The proposed techniques may be applied at any gateway where the flow of human traffic is to be analyzed. For the purpose of associating entry and exit events, a trellis optimization algorithm is used for sequence estimation, based on multiple texel camera measurements. Since the number of states in the trellis exponentially grows with the number of persons currently on the bus, a beam search pruning technique is employed to manage the computational and memory load. Experimental results using real texel camera measurements show 96% matching accuracy for 68 people exiting a bus in a randomized order. In a bus route simulation where a true traffic flow distribution is used to randomly draw entry and exit events for simulated riders, the proposed sequence estimation algorithm produces an estimated traffic flow distribution, which provides an excellent match to the true distribution.

Existing time headway distribution models have focused on the behavior of general vehicles. We examine the distribution of sampled vehicle headway (e.g., probes) on both single and multiple lane highway traffic streams. This study is divided into three parts: an empirical study, a simulation analysis, and an analytical derivation. The empirical study uses probe data obtained from Houston, Texas that was collected as part of the Automatic Vehicle Identification system of the Houston Transtar system. In the empirical study, a shifted negative exponential distribution was found to give the closest fit for both single and multiple lane cases. We found that if the volume level of the probes is low, regardless of the volume level of general vehicles, the headway of the probes followed a shifted negative exponential distribution. In the simulation study, we found that the time headway of probes does not necessarily follow the time headway distribution of general vehicles. Rather, it depends on many variables such as the volume level of general vehicles, the market penetration of probe vehicles, and the number of lanes. However, when the volume level of general vehicles is low, the headway of probes tends to follow the shifted negative exponential distribution at all levels of market penetration, together with the general vehicles. We analytically proved that if the time headway of general vehicles follows the shifted negative exponential distribution, then the time headway of the probes is the same as that of the general vehicles.

J	Gupta, AK				Gupta, Arvind Kumar			A SECTION APPROACH TO A TRAFFIC FLOW MODEL ON NETWORKS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Traffic; macroscopic model; section model; network; simulation	SHOCK-WAVES; OPTIMIZATION	The development of real time traffic flow models for urban road networks is of paramount importance for the purposes of optimizing and control of traffic flow. Motivated by the modeling of road networks in last decade, this paper proposes a different and simplified approach, known as section approach to model road networks in the framework of macroscopic traffic flow models. For evaluation of the traffic states on a single road, an anisotropic continuum GK-model developed by [Gupta and Katiyar, J. Phys. A 38, 4069 (2005)] is used as a single-section model. This model is applied to a two-section single lane road with points of entry and exits. In place of modeling the effect of off- and on-ramps in the continuity equation, a set of special boundary condition is taken into account to treat the points of entry and exit. A four-section road network comprised of two one-lane roads is also modeled using this methodology. The performances of the section approaches are investigated and obtained results are demonstrated over simulated data for different boundary conditions.

J	Srivastava, A; Geroliminis, N				Srivastava, Anupam; Geroliminis, Nikolas			Empirical observations of capacity drop in freeway merges with ramp control and integration in a first-order model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Capacity drop; First-order models; Freeway merges; Ramp metering	TRAFFIC FLOW; REQUIEM; WAVES	An accurate density monitoring along a stretch of a freeway, especially under congested time-variant conditions is necessary to evaluate congestion levels, understand complex traffic phenomena and develop efficient control strategies. In the first part of the paper (i) we show empirical evidence from freeway-ramp merges in Twin Cities freeway system, in favor of the capacity drop phenomenon, (ii) we provide a methodology based on phase diagrams to quantitatively estimate the level of the drop, (iii) we show that the level of the drop depends on the ratio of mainline vs. ramp flow and (iv) we investigate whether implementation of control strategies has an effect on the value of capacity drop. In the second part of the paper, we develop a methodology to estimate densities with space and time based on data from loop detectors, by integrating the capacity drop. The methodology is based on solving a flow conservation differential equation (using LWR theory) with intermediate (internal) freeway mainline boundaries, which is faster and more accurate from approaches using only external boundaries. To capture the capacity drop phenomenon into the first-order model we utilize a fundamental diagram with two values of capacity and we provide a memory-based methodology to choose the appropriate value in the numerical solution of the problem with a Godunov scheme. Results compared with real data and micro-simulation of a long freeway stretch show that this model produces more reliable and accurate results than previous theories. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Two kinds of vehicles are introduced. The asymmetric lane changing rules in the slowdown section and the lane squeezing behaviors near the merging point are taken into account. Under the periodic boundary condition, the numerical simulations are performed, which shows that the asymmetric lane changing rules, especially the lane squeezing behaviors influence the current distribution of right and left lanes in the slowdown section. And an interesting phenomenon of ratio inversion appears. Besides, the jam queue can also be affected by the length and the speed limit of section B obviously.

J	Yousif, S; Al-Obaedi, J; Henson, R				Yousif, Saad; Al-Obaedi, Jalal; Henson, Ralph			Drivers' Lane Utilization for United Kingdom Motorways	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Flow distribution; Heavy-goods vehicles; Narrow lanes; Traffic microsimulation		Lane utilization represents how the rate of traffic flow is distributed among the available number of lanes in a given section. This utilization or split is affected by several factors, including traffic flow rates and the presence and amount of heavy-goods vehicles (HGVs) within the traffic. It is important to study lane utilization because it is one of the input parameters for any traffic microsimulation models, which are increasingly being used to assess and suggest solutions for traffic problems. This paper uses two sources of data to model lane utilization-motorway incident detection and automatic signaling (MIDAS) data and individual-vehicles raw data. The latter source of data is specifically used to model how HGVs are distributed between motorway lanes as flow increases because MIDAS data do not specify the proportions of HGVs by lanes. Because the data used to develop the models in this paper are based on a relatively large set of data (compared with those represented by older models), one could argue that these models are more representative of current lane utilization on United Kingdom motorways. The development of lane-utilization models for HGV traffic will help in providing more realistic predictions of traffic behavior when represented by microsimulation models and in assessing such commercial vehicles using the lanes when it comes to pavement design.

J	Zeng, XS; Zhang, YL				Zeng, Xiaosi; Zhang, Yunlong			Development of Recurrent Neural Network Considering Temporal-Spatial Input Dynamics for Freeway Travel Time Modeling	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							TRAFFIC FLOW; PREDICTION; LINK; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS	The artificial neural network (ANN) is one advance approach to freeway travel time prediction. Various studies using different inputs have come to no consensus on the effects of input selections. In addition, very little discussion has been made on the temporalspatial aspect of the ANN travel time prediction process. In this study, we employ an ANN ensemble technique to analyze the effects of various input settings on the ANN prediction performances. Volume, occupancy, and speed are used as inputs to predict travel times. The predictions are then compared against the travel times collected from the toll collection system in Houston. The results show speed or occupancy measured at the segment of interest may be used as sole input to produce acceptable predictions, but all three variables together tend to yield the best prediction results. The inclusion of inputs from both upstream and downstream segments is statistically better than using only the inputs from current segment. It also appears that the magnitude of prevailing segment travel time can be used as a guideline to set up temporal input delays for better prediction accuracies. The evaluation of spatiotemporal input interactions reveals that past information on downstream and current segments is useful in improving prediction accuracy whereas past inputs from the upstream location do not provide as much constructive information. Finally, a variant of the state-space model (SSNN), namely time-delayed state-space neural network (TDSSNN), is proposed and compared against other popular ANN models. The comparison shows that the TDSSNN outperforms other networks and remains very comparable with the SSNN. Future research is needed to analyze TDSSNN's ability in corridor prediction settings.

J	Baskar, LD; De Schutter, B; Hellendoorn, H				Baskar, Lakshmi Dhevi; De Schutter, Bart; Hellendoorn, Hans			Optimal routing for automated highway systems	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Automated highway systems; Routing; Optimal control	MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; TRAFFIC FLOW; OPTIMAL COORDINATION; MOTORWAY NETWORKS	We present a routing guidance approach that can be used in Automated Highway Systems (AHS). We consider automated highway systems in which intelligent vehicles organised in platoons drive to their destination, controlled by a hierarchical control framework. In this framework there are roadside controllers that provide speed and lane allocation instructions to the platoons. These roadside controllers typically manage single stretches of highways. A collection of highways is then supervised by so-called area controllers that mainly take care of the route guidance instructions for the platoons and that also coordinate the various roadside controllers in their area. In this paper we focus on the optimal route choice control problem for the area controllers. In general, this problem is a non-linear integer optimisation problem with high computational requirements, which makes the problem intractable in practice. Therefore, we first propose a simplified but fast simulation model to describe the flows of platoons in the network. Next, we show that the optimal route choice control problem can be approximated by a mixed-integer linear problem. Later, we describe a new METANET-like model to describe the flow of platoons in the AHS. With a simple case study we illustrate that both approaches result in a balanced trade-off between optimality and computational efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

From the viewpoint of dynamical systems, the steady-state problem of the systems can be formulated as a singularly perturbed problem. Using the geometric singular perturbation method, we establish the existence of stationary waves for both the inviscid and viscous systems. The inviscid stationary waves contain smooth waves and discontinuous transonic waves. Both waves admit viscous profiles for the viscous systems. Then we consider the linearized eigenvalue problem of the systems along smooth stationary waves. Applying the technique of center manifold reduction, we show that any one of the supersonic smooth stationary waves is spectrally unstable.

J	Abramson, G; Semeshenko, V; Iglesias, JR				Abramson, Guillermo; Semeshenko, Viktoriya; Iglesias, Jose Roberto			Cooperation and Defection at the Crossroads	PLOS ONE			English	Article							CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW	We study a simple traffic model with a non-signalized road intersection. In this model the car arriving from the right has precedence. The vehicle dynamics far from the crossing are governed by the rules introduced by Nagel and Paczuski, which define how drivers behave when braking or accelerating. We measure the average velocity of the ensemble of cars and its flow as a function of the density of cars on the roadway. An additional set of rules is defined to describe the dynamics at the intersection assuming a fraction of drivers that do not obey the rule of precedence. This problem is treated within a game-theory framework, where the drivers that obey the rule are cooperators and those who ignore it are defectors. We study the consequences of these behaviors as a function of the fraction of cooperators and defectors. The results show that cooperation is the best strategy because it maximizes the flow of vehicles and minimizes the number of accidents. A rather paradoxical effect is observed: for any percentage of defectors the number of accidents is larger when the density of cars is low because of the higher average velocity.

J	Apolloni, A; Poletto, C; Colizza, V				Apolloni, Andrea; Poletto, Chiara; Colizza, Vittoria			Age-specific contacts and travel patterns in the spatial spread of 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic	BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						H1N1 pandemic; Host heterogeneities; Spatial spread; Age structure; Mobility; Mathematical modeling	SOCIAL CONTACTS; INFECTION PERIOD; MIXING PATTERNS; HUMAN MOBILITY; EPIDEMIC; TRANSMISSION; DISEASE; VIRUS; A(H1N1); NETWORK	Background: Confirmed H1N1 cases during late spring and summer 2009 in various countries showed a substantial age shift between importations and local transmission cases, with adults mainly responsible for seeding unaffected regions and children most frequently driving community outbreaks. Methods: We introduce a multi-host stochastic metapopulation model with two age classes to analytically investigate the role of a heterogeneously mixing population and its associated non-homogeneous travel behaviors on the risk of a major epidemic. We inform the model with demographic data, contact data and travel statistics of Europe and Mexico, and calibrate it to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic early outbreak. We allow for variations of the model parameters to explore the conditions of invasion under different scenarios. Results: We derive the expression for the potential of global invasion of the epidemic that depends on the transmissibility of the pathogen, the transportation network and mobility features, the demographic profile and the mixing pattern. Higher assortativity in the contact pattern greatly increases the probability of spatial containment of the epidemic, this effect being contrasted by an increase in the social activity of adults vs. children. Heterogeneous features of the mobility network characterizing its topology and traffic flows strongly favor the invasion of the pathogen at the spatial level, as also a larger fraction of children traveling. Variations in the demographic profile and mixing habits across countries lead to heterogeneous outbreak situations. Model results are compatible with the H1N1 spatial transmission dynamics observed. Conclusions: This work illustrates the importance of considering age-dependent mixing profiles and mobility features coupled together to study the conditions for the spatial invasion of an emerging influenza pandemic. Its results allow the immediate assessment of the risk of a major epidemic for a specific scenario upon availability of data, and the evaluation of the potential effectiveness of public health interventions targeting specific age groups, their interactions and mobility behaviors. The approach provides a general modeling framework that can be used for other types of partitions of the host population and applied to different settings.

J	Sugiyama, N; Nagatani, T				Sugiyama, Naoki; Nagatani, Takashi			Multiple-vehicle collision in traffic flow by a sudden slowdown	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Self-driven many-particle system; Vehicular dynamics; Collision; Safety; Phase diagram	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; DIFFERENCE MODEL; DYNAMICAL MODEL; LATTICE MODEL; CAR; PHYSICS	We study the multiple-vehicle collision when a vehicle decelerates suddenly in a single-lane traffic flow. The extended optimal velocity model is used for the vehicular motion to take into account the relative velocity. If a vehicle slows down suddenly and the following vehicle does not decelerate successfully, it crashes into the vehicle ahead with a residual speed and the crash may induce more collisions. The number of crumpled vehicles depends on the initial headway, the sensitivity, the initial velocity, and the relative velocity. We derive the region map (phase diagram) for the multiple-vehicle collision. The dependence of the multiple-vehicle collision on the density, sensitivity, and relative velocity is shown.

J	Qiao, WX; Haghani, A; Hamedi, M				Qiao, Wenxin; Haghani, Ali; Hamedi, Masoud			A Nonparametric Model for Short-Term Travel Time Prediction Using Bluetooth Data	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Bluetooth Detection; Nonparametric Model; Travel Time Prediction	TRAFFIC FLOW PREDICTION; VOLUME	Reliable travel time prediction enables both users and system controllers to be well informed of the future conditions on roadways. This in turn helps with informed pre-trip plans and effective traffic control strategies. This article studies short-time travel time prediction for stochastic freeway applications using real time Bluetooth travel time data. A set of four prediction models including historical average, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Kalman filter, and K-nearest neighbors (KNN), are implemented. A modified nonparametric model KNN-T is proposed that considers the traffic pattern features to enhance the basic KNN model with trend adjustment. The results of the prediction performances of each model from the case studies are investigated and reported. Results indicated that both nonparametric models, the basic KNN and KNN-T, outperformed the historical average, ARIMA, and Kalman filter models by decreasing the MAPE more than 10% for the all-day period and 20% for peak-hour periods in prediction accuracy. The proposed KNN-T model displayed 2.5% to 4.8% decrease in MAPE than KNN model for all-day and peak-hour periods, respectively, indicating that the KNN-T model captures not only the value but also the time-varying trend, which would lead to a more precise match with the future traffic conditions.

J	Sarvi, M				Sarvi, Majid			Freeway weaving phenomena observed during congested traffic	TRANSPORTMETRICA A-TRANSPORT SCIENCE			English	Article						freeway weaving section; weaving manoeuvre micro-simulation; congested traffic flow; psychophysical modelling; freeway weaving modelling; active weaving bottleneck	SIMULATION	This article focuses on modelling the acceleration-deceleration behaviour of drivers during freeway weaving manoeuvres, under heavy traffic conditions. The term heavy traffic conditions' refers to the period which is fully congested, i.e. queues reside on both freeway and ramp approaches and there is no exogenous flow restriction from downstream of the weaving section (active weaving bottleneck). Data capturing a wide range of microscopic information were collected using video-recording and image processing techniques. The data was collected at two weaving sections on urban freeways in Tokyo and Melbourne. These data provided the fundamental information for investigating the drivers weaving behaviour. A theoretical framework for modelling weaving driver acceleration-deceleration behaviour is presented. The framework uses a stimuli-response psychophysical concept as in its basic formulation. The collected data are used to calibrate the proposed model. A particular feature of the proposed model is that it captures the acceleration-deceleration behaviour of drivers during the entire process of weaving manoeuvre. The results indicate that on average a 0.72s time gap exists before weaving drivers respond to stimuli. It is found that the surrounding freeway vehicles significantly affect the weaving vehicle acceleration behaviour. Finally, the proposed model was implemented in a traffic simulation and tested using independent data to demonstrate the capability of the proposed model.

J	Sheu, JB				Sheu, Jiuh-Biing			Microscopic traffic behaviour modelling and simulation for lane-blocking arterial incidents	TRANSPORTMETRICA A-TRANSPORT SCIENCE			English	Article						incident-induced traffic modelling; lane changing; microscopic traffic simulation	REAL-TIME PREDICTION; BLOCKAGE	Incident-induced driver behaviour modelling is essential to analyse non-recurrent traffic congestion problems. However, such research is inadequate in such areas as traffic flow prediction, traffic simulation and incident management. This article presents microscopic lane traffic models to characterise incident-induced driver behaviour including car following and lane changing conducted under conditions of lane-blocking arterial incidents. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed models, a specific microscopic traffic simulation program embedded with the proposed incident-induced lane traffic behaviour models is tested by comparing simulation data with video-based incident data collected from five incident events. Preliminary test results indicate that the proposed microscopic traffic behaviour models permit not only reproducing incident-induced traffic behaviour but also characterising incident effects on lane traffic phenomena.

J	Matsumoto, S; Kawashima, H				Matsumoto, Shuichi; Kawashima, Hironao			Fundamental Study on Effect of Preceding Vehicle Information on Fuel Consumption Reduction of a Vehicle Group	JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS			English	Article						Driving simulator (DS); eco-driving; intelligent transport systems (ITS); traffic flow		It is a concern that eco-driving vehicles, because their driving behavior differs from other vehicles due to e. g. e-start, may inhibit smooth traffic flow. Therefore, it is necessary to study the cooperative eco-driving done by a vehicle group, putting "vehicle-to-vehicle communication" and "road-to-vehicle communication" into perspective. Based on these factors, this study aimed to: 1) Analyze fuel consumption rates and driving behaviors of more than one vehicle following an Eco-Driving vehicle. 2) Examine the effect of information on the fuel consumption rate of the preceding vehicles on the following vehicles. As a result, the following findings were obtained: 1) By providing information to multiple following vehicles, the fuel consumption rate of the second vehicle was not lowered, while that of the third one was. 2) It is possible that, when information on fuel consumption of a preceding vehicle is provided to the following one, an inter-vehicular distance is shortened during deceleration to contribute to smooth traffic flow. From the above results, it is suggested that, when targeting a vehicle group, sharing the information on preceding vehicles is effective.

J	Assadi, H; Emmerich, H				Assadi, Hamid; Emmerich, Heike			Intelligent driving in traffic systems with partial lane discipline	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B			English	Article							MODEL; FLOW; TRANSITION	It is a most common notion in traffic theory that driving in lanes and keeping lane changes to a minimum leads to smooth and laminar traffic flow, and hence to increased traffic capacity. On the other hand, there exist persistent vehicular traffic systems that are characterised by habitual disregarding of lane markings, and partial or complete loss of laminar traffic flow. Here, we explore the stability of such systems through a microscopic traffic flow model, where the degree of lane-discipline is taken as a variable, represented by the fraction of drivers that disregard lane markings completely. The results show that lane-free traffic may win over completely ordered traffic at high densities, and that partially ordered traffic leads to the poorest overall flow, while not considering the crash probability. Partial order in a lane-free system is similar to partial disorder in a lane-disciplined system in that both lead to decreased traffic capacity. This could explain the reason why standard enforcement methods, which rely on continuous increase of order, often fail to incur order to lane-free traffic systems. The results also provide an insight into the cooperative phenomena in open systems with self-driven particles.

Cell transmission model based traffic signal timing in oversaturated conditions	JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY			English	Article						oversaturated flow; conditional cell transmission model; traffic signal timing; spillback; blockage	CONTROL FORMULATION; ARTERIALS; INTERSECTIONS	In order to investigate enhancements to cell transmission model (CTM) as a tool for traffic signal timing in oversaturated conditions, randomly distributed saturation flow rates and arrival rates were used instead of constant values to simulate traffic flow movement, estimate the average delay of the network and search for an optimal traffic signal timing plan. A case study was given to demonstrate that the proposed methodology can capture unique phenomena in oversaturated conditions such as forward wave, spillback and lane entrance blockage. The results show that CTM underestimates travel time by 25% when compared to Simtraffic, while the enhanced CTM underestimates by only 3%. A second case study shows that a dynamic signal timing plan is superior to a fixed signal timing plan in the term of average delay.

In order to study the influence of urban morphometry on flow and dispersion of vehicular fine particulate matter emissions, in the summer of 2008 field measurements were performed in major arterials located in five Southern Californian cities with different building geometries. In each city, local mean wind, turbulence, virtual temperature, roadside DustTrak Fine Particles (DTFP) concentration, and traffic flow data were collected in 2-hr measurement periods during morning and evening rush hours and lighter midday traffic, over a period of 3 days. The calculated MoninObukhov length, L, suggests that near-neutral and slightly unstable conditions were present at both street and roof levels. The nondimensional forms of turbulent wind and temperature fluctuations show that the data at street level within the urban canopy can be represented using the MoninObukhov similarity theory. Generalized additive models were applied to analyze the impact of meteorological and traffic-related variables on fine particle concentrations at street level. Compared to other variables, urban-scale background concentrations were the most important variables in all five models. The results confirmed that turbulent mixing in urban areas dominated the variation of roadside particle concentrations regardless of urban geometry. The distance from the local sites to the nearby monitoring stations affected model performance when urban-scale concentrations were used to predict middle-scale concentrations by generalized additive models (GAMs). A radius of influence for background concentrations was 610 km. There were also relationships between concentration and other variables affecting the local components of the concentrations, such as wind direction, sensible heat flux, and vertical wind fluctuation, although the influences were much weaker.

J	Parry, K; Hazelton, ML				Parry, Katharina; Hazelton, Martin L.			Bayesian inference for day-to-day dynamic traffic models	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Markov; MCMC; Network; Statistical linear inverse problem; Transportation; Tree	ORIGIN-DESTINATION MATRICES; ASSIGNMENT MODEL; TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS; EQUILIBRIUM	There is significant current interest in the development of models to describe the day-today evolution of traffic flows over a network. We consider the problem of statistical inference for such models based on daily observations of traffic counts on a subset of network links. Like other inference problems for network-based models, the critical difficulty lies in the underdetermined nature of the linear system of equations that relates link flows to the latent path flows. In particular, Bayesian inference implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods requires that we sample from the set of route flows consistent with the observed link flows, but enumeration of this set is usually computationally infeasible. We show how two existing conditional route flow samplers can be adapted and extended for use with day-to-day dynamic traffic. The first sampler employs an iterative route-by-route acceptance-rejection algorithm for path flows, while the second employs a simple Markov model for traveller behaviour to generate candidate entire route flow patterns when the network has a tree structure.

Distinguishing from traditional method, we introduce a dynamic weighted network model with evolutional size and weight. Additionally, the expected strength allocation vector of the model consists of a deterministic component reflecting preferential attachment and a random component, which can characterize the realistic network better. In this paper, we obtain the degree and strength distributions of the weighted network and we conclude that the network has scale-free characteristics.

A model of spatial queue is defined to characterize dynamic traffic flow and queuing formation in network links. Network users simultaneously choose departure time and travel route to minimize the travel cost including journey time and unpunctuality penalty. Using some necessary conditions of the dynamic user equilibrium, dynamic network flows are obtained exactly on some networks with typical structure. Various effects of queue spillover are discussed based on the results of these networks, and some new paradoxes of link capacity expansion have been found as a result of such effects. Analytical and exact results in these typical networks show that ignoring queuing length may generate biased solutions, and the link storage capacity is a very important factor concerning the performance of networks.

J	Hadiuzzaman, M; Qiu, TZ; Lu, XY				Hadiuzzaman, Md.; Qiu, Tony Z.; Lu, Xiao-Yun			Variable Speed Limit Control Design for Relieving Congestion Caused by Active Bottlenecks	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Variable speed limit; METANET; Cell transmission model; Microsimulation; Model predictive control	SYSTEM	Variable speed limit (VSL) can be used on freeways to manage traffic flow with the goal of improving capacity. To achieve this objective, it is necessary that both speed and density dynamics be represented accurately. In this study, to deeply understand the effectiveness of VSL control, an analytical model was developed to represent drivers' response to updated speed limits and macroscopic speed dynamical change with respect to changeable speed limits. Specifically, to model the freeway links having VSL control, the fundamental diagram (FD) was replaced with the VSL control variable in the relaxation term of the METANET. This modification led to the speed control variable appearing linearly, which is preferable for online computation. The density dynamics are based on the cell transmission model (CTM), which is introduced to estimate the transition flow among successive links with some practical constraints. It also offers flexibility in designing active bottleneck in which there is a capacity drop once feeding flow exceeds its capacity. To exploit this benefit, a modification was introduced in the FD of the density dynamics. A VSL control strategy was proposed that explicitly considers traffic characteristics at active bottleneck and its upstream-downstream segments. It can control traffic flow into any type of active bottleneck. Then, the proposed traffic dynamics with the control strategy are implemented in a freeway corridor using the model predictive control (MPC) approach. The analysis was carried out in the calibrated microsimulation model, VISSIM, within a scenario in which shock waves were present. The microsimulation model functions as a proxy for the real-world traffic system. This study reveals that, in terms of mobility, VSL is mostly effective during congestion periods.

J	Ahmad, SS; Aziz, N				Ahmad, Sheikh Saeed; Aziz, Neelam			Spatial and temporal analysis of ground level ozone and nitrogen dioxide concentration across the twin cities of Pakistan	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Nitrogen dioxide (NO2); Ozone (O-3); Passive sampling; Spatial interpolation; Climatic variables; Twin Cities (Rawalpindi and Islamabad); Pakistan	TRAFFIC AIR-POLLUTION; DIFFUSION TUBES; NO2; O-3; SAMPLERS; DESIGN; SITES; YIELD; SO2	The analyses presented in this paper include the concentration levels of NO2 and O-3 measured during 2 successive years in twin cities (Rawalpindi and Islamabad) of Pakistan from November 2009 to March 2011. NO2 was determined using the passive sampling method, while ozone was determined by Model 400E ozone analyzer. The average NO2 and O-3 concentration in twin cities of Pakistan was found to be 44 +/- 6 and 18.2 +/- 1.24 ppb, respectively. Results indicate that the concentration of NO2 and O-3 show seasonal variations. Results also depict that NO2 and O-3 concentration levels are high in areas of intense traffic flow and congestion. Rawalpindi has more elevated levels of NO2 and O-3 as compared to the Islamabad due to the narrow roads, enclosing architecture of road network and congestion. Climatic variables also influenced the NO2 and O-3 concentration, i.e., temperature is positively related with O-3, while negatively related with NO2, relative humidity is directly related with NO2 and inversely related with O-3, whereas rainfall show negative association with both NO2 and O-3 concentration. Comparing the results with WHO standards reveals that NO2 concentration levels at all the sampling points are above the permissible limit, while ozone concentration is still lower than the WHO standards. Thus, there is a need to take appropriate steps to control these continuously increasing levels of NO2 and O-3 before they become a serious hazard for the environment and people living in those areas.

J	Celikoglu, HB				Celikoglu, Hilmi Berk			An Approach to Dynamic Classification of Traffic Flow Patterns	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							FUNCTION NEURAL-NETWORK; EXTENDED KALMAN FILTER; WORK ZONE CAPACITY; KINEMATIC WAVES; MODEL; TIME; PREDICTION; DELAY; REPRESENTATION; ALGORITHM	Analyses on the dynamics of traffic flow, ranging from intersection flows to network-wide flow propagation, require accurate information on time-varying local traffic flows. To effectively determine the flow performance measures and consequently the congestion indicators of segmented road pieces, the ability to process such data in real time is out of the question. In this article, a dynamic approach to specify flow pattern variations is proposed mainly concentrating on the incorporation of neural network theory to provide real-time mapping for traffic density simultaneously in conjunction with a macroscopic traffic flow model. To deal with the noise and the wide scatter of raw flow measures, a filtering is applied prior to modeling processes. Filtered data are dynamically and simultaneously input to processes of neural density mapping and traffic flow modeling. The classification of flow patterns over the fundamental diagram, which is dynamically plotted with the outputs of the flow modeling subprocess, is obtained by considering the density measure as a pattern indicator. Densities are mapped by selected neural approximation method for each simulation time step considering explicitly the flow conservation principle. Simultaneously, mapped densities are matched over the fundamental diagram to specify the current corresponding flow pattern. The approach is promising in capturing sudden changes on flow patterns and is open to be utilized within a series of intelligent management strategies including especially nonrecurrent congestion effect detection and control.

J	Zadeh, ASM; Rajabi, MA				Zadeh, Abbas Sheikh Mohammad; Rajabi, Mohammad Ali			Analyzing the effect of the street network configuration on the efficiency of an urban transportation system	CITIES			English	Article						Urban transportation network; Spatial configuration; Centrality measure; Traffic equilibrium	CENTRALITY; HIERARCHIES; MOVEMENT; PATHS	This paper proposes a new specialized centrality measure to quantify the importance and the contribution amount of each street in an urban transportation network. Contrary to the previous general centrality measures (e.g., degree, betweenness, and closeness), this measure considers three important vehicular traffic characteristics: street capacity restrictions, the dominant pattern of travel demands, and the traffic-flow equilibrium. Applying the developed centrality measure to simulated networks shows that traffic flows more efficiently in urban networks with "small-world" configurations, where a certain number of shortcut links and locally clustered streets are allowed. However, with regular grid networks, the application of the proposed measure shows little efficiency. This outcome suggests that the regular grid is not suitable as a base structure in urban planning. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Most of the existing studies propose evaluation methods that use simulation tools to assess the sustainability of different transportation policies. Although there are some recent studies, considering the sustainability dimension and the resulting policies through mathematical programming models is still an open research area. In this study, we focus on controlling the gas emissions for the environmental sustainability and propose several mathematical programming models that incorporate the measurements of gas emissions over a traffic network. We de fine emission functions in terms of the traffic flow so that the accumulated emission amounts can be modeled accurately, particularly in case of congestion. Using these emission functions, we introduce alternate objective functions and develop optimization models under various policies which are based on the well-known toll pricing and capacity enhancement. The proposed models both reflect the route choice decisions of the network users and the decisions of the transportation managers that aim at making the transport systems more sustainable through the policies of interest. We conduct a computational study on a well-known testing network and present numerical results to evaluate the proposed alternate models. We conclude that simultaneously applying the toll pricing and capacity enhancement policies is in general more effective in serving the travel demand and reducing the emission amounts compared to implementing these policies individually.

J	Jin, YF; Hu, HY				Jin, Yanfei; Hu, Haiyan			Stabilization of traffic flow in optimal velocity model via delayed-feedback control	COMMUNICATIONS IN NONLINEAR SCIENCE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION			English	Article						Optimal velocity model; Traffic jam; Delayed-feedback control; Delay-independent stability	CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; BIFURCATIONS; CONGESTION; PHYSICS; JAMS	Traffic jams may occur due to various reasons, such as traffic accidents, lane reductions and on-ramps. In order to suppress the traffic congestion in an optimal velocity traffic model without any driver's delay taken into account, a delayed-feedback control of both displacement and velocity differences is proposed in this study. By using the delay-independent stability criteria and the H-infinity-norm, the delayed-feedback control can be determined to stabilize the unstable traffic flow and suppress the traffic jam. The numerical case studies are given to demonstrate and verify the new control method. Furthermore, a comparison is made between the new control method and the method proposed by Konishi et al. [K. Konishi, M. Hirai, H. Kokame, Decentralized delayed-feedback control of an optimal velocity traffic model, Eur. Phys. J.B 15 (2000) 715-722]. The results show that the new control method makes the traffic flow more stable and improves the control performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By analyzing the characteristics of ordinary vehicles in giving way to emergency vehicles, the rules for changing lanes are modified. Computer numerical simulation results indicate that an emergency vehicle without changing lanes can enhance speed with density lower than 0.1, while its speed can be enhanced by changing lane with density greater than 0.1. Meanwhile, vehicle speed and density within a certain range around emergency vehicles are lower than the road section average velocity and average density. The passage way of emergency vehicle that facilitate lane change causes less interference than that of an emergency vehicle which is unable to change lane. The study found that the physical characteristics of traffic flow when there are emergency vehicles are significantly different from routine traffic flow. Emergency vehicles can facilitate their passage by changing lanes at a medium or high density.

Under the Hong Kong Planning Standards and Guidelines, a standard of 70 dB(A), measured as L-A10 (1 hour), has been set for road traffic noise. The Calculation of Road Traffic Noise (CRTN) method has been adopted in Hong Kong to estimate such noise. This study first examined and evaluated the accuracy of this method in predicting traffic noise at different floor levels of a building in Hong Kong. Traffic noise was measured at different floor levels, and both the predicted and measured L-A10 showed a similar trend: the higher the floor level, the lower the traffic noise level. The predicted L-A10 at the building facade, however, tended to be overestimated with a mean difference of +2.6 dB(A) between the predicted and measured results. A correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.8167 between the predicted and the measured L-A10 indicates that the predicted levels correlated closely with the measured levels. Second, traffic flow measurements were also recorded at four different locations. The results indicate that the predicted L-A10 at all floor levels of the four buildings in these four locations exceeded the benchmark of 70 dB(A) when no roadside barrier was in place. The noise level reduction after installing the barrier varied from 17 dB(A) to 0.2 dB(A) at different floor levels of the four buildings. The CRTN is therefore a useful tool in predicting and controlling traffic noise levels at different floor levels at the planning stage.

Distributed modeling strategies can be utilized to reduce the computational effort. In this paper, we present a MapReduce-based approach to processing distributed data to design a MapReduce framework of a traffic forecasting system, including its system architecture and data-processing algorithms. The work presented here can be applied to many traffic forecasting systems with models requiring a learning process (e. g., the neural network approach). We show that the learning process of the forecasting model under our framework can be accelerated from a computational perspective. Meanwhile, model fusion, which is the key problem of distributed modeling, is explicitly treated in this paper to enhance the capability of the forecasting system in data processing and storage.

J	Mu, TT; Jiang, JM; Wang, Y				Mu, Tingting; Jiang, Jianmin; Wang, Yan			Heterogeneous Delay Embedding for Travel Time and Energy Cost Prediction Via Regression Analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Delay embedding (DE); energy cost prediction; regression analysis; spectral embedding; travel time prediction	DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION; TRAFFIC FLOW; REAL-TIME; MODELS	In this paper, we study travel time and energy cost prediction at any future departure time for a targeted road segment and vehicle. These two prediction tasks play an important part in the design of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) that can automatically manage battery charging, energy saving, and route planning for fully electric vehicles. Compared with the fundamental problem of travel time prediction, which usually learns from the historical and current data of travel time itself, energy cost prediction is a more complex problem that involves multiple context conditions and vehicle status measured by various time-invariant and time-variant data. We define a general learning problem based on multiple time-invariant and time-variant inputs to unify these two prediction tasks. To solve the defined learning problem, we propose heterogeneous delay embedding (HDE), which extracts an informative feature space for regression analysis and aims at achieving satisfactory prediction for any future departure time. The proposed HDE first categorizes the historical and current data of a time-variant measurement into different types, then incorporates different delay settings for embedding multiple types of time-series data, and finally removes redundant information and noise from the generated features using orthogonal locality preserving projection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for both short-and long-term predictions of travel time and energy cost.

J	Zhao, HT; Mao, HY				Zhao Han-Tao; Mao Hong-Yan			Cellular automaton simulation of muti-lane traffic flow including emergency vehicle	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						traffic flow; cellular automaton; emergency vehicle	MAXIMUM-SPEED VEHICLES; MODEL	Based on the analysis of urban road traffic flow affected by emergency vehicle, a muti-lane cellular automaton model is established. Three characteristic variables are introduced to modify the lane change rules, including the give-way state variable, the affected areas of police siren and the safe distance for mandatory lane change. Numerical simulation results indicate that lane number and hybrid vehicle scale factor have a great influence on vehicle speed and lane change number in low-density range. And the parameter setting for affected areas of police siren changes the lane change number within a certain range. Meanwhile, the parameter of safe distance for mandatory lane change mainly affects emergency vehicle speed and lane change number.

Layering residential peer networks and geospatial building networks to model change in energy saving behaviors	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						Energy efficiency; Geospatial networks; Multi-layer network system; Networks; Peer networks; Simulation; Social network analysis	ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION; TOPOLOGY	Complex human or engineered network systems can be examined as a series of coexisting layers. A variety of dynamic perturbations, such as information flows across computer networks, traffic flows across transportation networks and the spread of energy saving practices across human networks, have been treated separately as single networks in previous research. However, because these phenomena often consist of human networks interacting with engineered networks, analyzing the properties of the multi-layer network systems may provide more accurate insights. In this paper, we examine a multi-layer network system to provide insight into the diffusion of energy consumption practices through peer networks within and across residential buildings. We introduce a new model-the Layered Network Model-that treats that treats a residential peer network and a geospatial building network as a single, layered network. We compare this model to a previously published Multi-Layer Interactive Network Model by simulating diffusion through a real multi-layer network system consisting of a residential peer network and a geospatial building network from three experimental data-sets. We found our model to be more accurate and efficient, hence contributing an efficient mathematical model and set of simulation algorithms that accurately capture the post-perturbation response of a layered, residential peer network and a geospatial building network.

J	Yang, D; Jin, P; Pu, Y; Ran, B				Yang, Da; Jin, Peter (Jing); Pu, Yun; Ran, Bin			Safe distance car-following model including backward-looking and its stability analysis	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B			English	Article							TRAFFIC FLOW MODEL; STATISTICAL PHYSICS; SIMULATION; DYNAMICS; INFORMATION; CONGESTION; SYSTEMS; WAVES	The focus of this paper is the car-following behavior including backward-looking, simply called the bi-directional looking car-following behavior. This study is motivated by the potential changes of the physical properties of traffic flow caused by the fast developing intelligent transportation system (ITS), especially the new connected vehicle technology. Existing studies on this topic focused on general motors (GM) models and optimal velocity (OV) models. The safe distance car-following model, Gipps' model, which is more widely used in practice have not drawn too much attention in the bi-directional looking context. This paper explores the property of the bi-directional looking extension of Gipps' safe distance model. The stability condition of the proposed model is derived using the linear stability theory and is verified using numerical simulations. The impacts of the driver and vehicle characteristics appeared in the proposed model on the traffic flow stability are also investigated. It is found that taking into account the backward-looking effect in car-following has three types of effect on traffic flow: stabilizing, destabilizing and producing non-physical phenomenon. This conclusion is more sophisticated than the study results based on the OV bi-directional looking car-following models. Moreover, the drivers who have the smaller reaction time or the larger additional delay and think the other vehicles have larger maximum decelerations can stabilize traffic flow.

J	Mohaymany, AS; Babaei, M				Mohaymany, A. Shariat; Babaei, M.			Optimal resource allocation in urban transportation networks considering capacity reliability and connectivity reliability: a multi-objective approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Network design; Resource allocation; Multi-objective programming; Urban transportation networks; Connectivity reliability; Capacity reliability	DESIGN PROBLEM; ROAD NETWORK; DEMAND; ALGORITHMS; SCHEME; MODEL	Since the 1990:9, network reliability has been considered as a new index for evaluating transportation networks under uncertainty. A large number of studies have been revealed in the literature in this field, which are mostly dedicated to developing relevant measures that can be utilized for the evaluation of vulnerable networks under different sources of uncertainty, such as daily traffic flow fluctuations, natural disasters, weather conditions, and so fourth. This paper addresses the resource allocation problem in vulnerable transportation networks, in which multiple performance reliability measures should be met at their desired levels, while the overall cost of upgrading links 'performances should be minimized simultaneously. For this purpose, a new approach has been considered to formulate the two well-known performance measures, connectivity and capacity reliability, along with their application in a bi-objective nonlinear mixed integer goal programming model. In order to take into account the uncertain conditions of supply, links' capacities have been assumed to be random variables and follow normal distribution functions. A computationally efficient method has been developed that allows calculating the network-wise performance indices simply by means of a set of functions of links' 'performance reliabilities. Using this approach, as the performance reliability of links are themselves functions of the random links' capacities, they can be simply calculated through numerical integration. To achieve desirable levels for both connectivity reliability and capacity reliability (as network-wise performance reliability measures) two distinct objectives have been considered. One of the objectives seeks to maximize each of the measures regardless of what is happening to the other objective function which minimizes the budget. Since optimization models with two conflicting objectives cannot be solved directly, the well-known goal attainment multi-objective decision-making (MODM) approach has been adapted to formulate the model as a single objective model. Then the resultant single objective model has been solved through the generalized gradient method, which is a straightforward solution algorithm coded in existing commercial software such as MATIAB programming software. To show the applicability of the proposed model, numerical results are provided for a simple network.

J	Lv, W; Song, WG; Liu, XD; Ma, J				Lv, Wei; Song, Wei-guo; Liu, Xiao-dong; Ma, Jian			A microscopic lane changing process model for multilane traffic	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow; Lane-changing process; Experimental observation; Simulation	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; SIMULATION; FLOW; BEHAVIOR; VEHICLE; RULES; HIGHWAY	In previous simulations lane-changing behavior is usually assumed as an instantaneous action. However, in real traffic, lane changing is a continuing process which can seriously affect the following cars. In this paper, a microscopic lane-changing process (LCP) model is clearly described. A new idea of simplifying the lane-changing process to the car-following framework is presented by controlling fictitious cars. To verify the model, the results of flow, lane-changing frequency, and single-car velocity are extracted from experimental observations and are compared with corresponding simulation. It is found that the LCP model agrees well with actual traffic flow and lane-changing behaviors may induce a 12%-18% reduction of traffic flow. The results also reflect that most of the drivers on the two roads in a city are conservative but not aggressive to change lanes. Investigation of lane-changing frequency shows that the largest lane-changing frequency occurs at a medium density range from 15 vehs km(-1) lane(-1) to 35 vehs km(-1) lane(-1). It also implies that the lane-changing process might strengthen velocity variation at medium density and weaken velocity variation at high density. It is hoped that the idea of this study may be helpful to promote the modeling and simulation study of traffic flow. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Traffic flow harmonization in expressway merging	PERSONAL AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING			English	Article						AmI technology; Data-driven simulation; Driver-vehicle interaction; Traffic flow optimization; Expressway merging; Cognitive workload; Driver's mental capabilities; VibraSeat	MICROSCOPIC SIMULATION; AMI TECHNOLOGY; MODEL	Steering a vehicle is a task increasingly challenging the driver in terms of mental resources. Reasons for this include the increasing volume of road traffic and a rising quantity of road signs, traffic lights, and other distractions at the roadside (such as billboards), to name a few. The application of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, in particular if taking advantage of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) technology, can help to increase the perceptivity of a driver, leading as a direct consequence to more relaxed mental stress of the same. One situation where we see potential in the application of such a system are merging areas on the expressway where two or more varying traffic streams converge into a single one. In order to reduce cognitive liabilities (in this work expressed as panic or anger), drivers are exposed to while merging, we have developed two behavioral rules. The first ("increased range of perception") enables drivers to change early upstream into a spare lane, allowing the merging traffic to join into mainline traffic at reduced conflicts, the second ("inter-car distance management" in the broader area of merging) provide drivers with recommendations of when and how to change lanes at the best. From a technical point of view, the "VibraSeat" a in-house developed car seat with integrated tactile actuators, is used for delivering information about perception range and inter-car distances to the driver in a way that does not stress his/her mental capabilities. To figure out possible improvements in its application in real traffic and at a meaningful scale, cellular automaton-based simulation of a specific section of Madrid expressway M30 was performed. Results from the data-driven simulation experiments on the true to scale model indicate that AmI technology has the potential to increase road throughput or average driving speed and furthermore to decrease the panic of drivers while merging into an upper (the main) lane.

Assessment of variations in benzene concentration produced from vehicles and gas stations in Tehran using GIS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Air pollution; Volatile organic compounds; Traffic; Photo ionization detector; Inverse distance weight	VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; AIR-POLLUTION EXPOSURE; POPULATION EXPOSURE; PERSONAL EXPOSURE; RISK-ASSESSMENT; AMBIENT LEVELS; HONG-KONG; QUALITY; ATMOSPHERE; EMISSIONS	This study investigates the variations of benzene concentration levels in district 1, situated in the north part of Tehran, capital of Iran. Thirty-three stations in five categories, namely roadsides, busy roads, residential areas, traffic intersections, and the vicinity of gas stations, were monitored during the rush hours in the afternoon once a week over a period of 1 year. Accordingly, benzene concentration levels were measured and predicted by inverse distance weight model. The recorded benzene concentration levels were then compared with those reported in other parts of the world. According to the results, the annual concentration levels of benzene was 13.85 ppb for roads with heavy traffic flow, 14.98 ppb for traffic intersections, 29.01 ppb for the vicinity of the gas stations, 3.26 ppb for residential areas, and 9.97 ppb for roadsides. The concentration of benzene in the vicinity of the gas station sampling point was higher than in the other stations, and at all locations was found to be so much more than the standard concentration levels (1.56 ppb) prescribed by Environmental Protection Agency for the ambient air quality. The results of the study revealed that the benzene concentration levels in Tehran are distinctly more than its standard level.

J	Xu, JX; Zhao, XJ; Srinivasan, D				Xu, Jianxin; Zhao, Xinjie; Srinivasan, Dipti			On optimal freeway local ramp metering using fuzzy logic control with particle swarm optimisation	IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article							CONVERGENCE	In this study, the problem of optimal freeway local ramp metering is address by using fuzzy logic control (FLC)-based ramp metering. The objective of optimal freeway local ramp metering is to minimise a weighted total-time spent-(WTTS)-based cost function, which measures the performance of freeway local ramp metering in terms of the WTTS by vehicles on both the freeway mainstream and on-ramp link. A simple and efficient local ramp metering algorithm based on Takagi-Sugeno type FLC algorithm is proposed. The input membership functions of the FLC controller are predefined, and human expert knowledge on freeway traffic flow behaviours is utilised to reduce the size of fuzzy rule base. The consequent parameters are fine-tuned by particle swarm optimisation and microscopic traffic simulations. Simulation studies with PARAMICS traffic simulation platform show the potential of the proposed approach in obtaining the optimal freeway local ramp metering strategies to strike a balance between traffic conditions on the mainstream and the on-ramp link.

J	Jang, K; Kang, S; Seo, J; Chan, CY				Jang, Kitae; Kang, Sanghyeok; Seo, Jongwon; Chan, Ching-Yao			Cross-Section Designs for the Safety Performance of Buffer-Separated High-Occupancy Vehicle Lanes	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article						High-occupancy vehicles; Traffic accidents; Traffic safety; Regression analysis	ACCIDENTS; POISSON; MODELS	This study proposes a methodology to determine the optimal cross-sectional design of a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) facility for safety performance by evaluating the effects of each relevant design element on safety and tradeoffs among multiple design variables. This aspect of geometric design is critical because it is often difficult to acquire sufficient right-of-way for retrofitting HOV lanes to existing freeway systems with recommended cross-sectional design. Detailed collision data of concurrent-flow buffer-separated HOV lanes, along with their geometric features and traffic flow data, were analyzed to establish collision predictive models by injury types for HOV and the adjacent general-purpose lanes. These models were used to determine the set of cross-sectional design elements that minimizes the expected collision occurrences. As a case study, a real freeway corridor where a conversion from contiguous to buffer-separated types was recently completed was selected to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. The evaluation through this case study shows that the proposed methodology is useful in determining the cross-sectional design of HOV facilities for safety based on selective use of available geometric space.

J	Zhao, H; Yan, XD; Gao, ZY				Zhao, Hui; Yan, Xuedong; Gao, Ziyou			Transportation serviceability analysis for metropolitan commuting corridors based on modal choice modeling	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Commuting corridors; Park and ride; Transportation serviceability; Modal choice behavior; Stochastic equilibrium	LINEAR MONOCENTRIC CITY; RIDE FACILITIES; PARK; EQUILIBRIUM; BOTTLENECK; TRANSIT; CONGESTION; SYSTEM; INDEX; TRIPS	Major commuting corridors in metropolitan areas generally comprise multiple transportation modes for commuters, such as transit (subways or buses), private vehicles, or park-and-ride combinations. During the morning peak hour, the commuters would choose one of the available transportation modes to travel through the corridors from rural/suburban living Areas to urban working areas. This paper introduces a concept of transportation serviceability to evaluate a transportation mode's service status in a specific link, route, road, or network during a certain period. The serviceability can be measured by the possibility that travelers choose a specific type of transportation service at a certain travel cost. The commuters' modal-choice possibilities are calculated using a stochastic equilibrium model based on general travel cost. The modeling results illustrate how transportation serviceability is influenced by background traffic flow in a corridor, value of comfort for railway mode, and parking fee distribution.

J	Zhang, LL; Garoni, TM; de Gier, J				Zhang, Lele; Garoni, Timothy M.; de Gier, Jan			A comparative study of Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams of arterial road networks governed by adaptive traffic signal systems	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Macroscopic fundamental diagram; Traffic signal system; Simulation		Using a stochastic cellular automaton model for urban traffic flow, we study and compare Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams (MFDs) of arterial road networks governed by different types of adaptive traffic signal systems, under various boundary conditions. In particular, we simulate realistic signal systems that include signal linking and adaptive cycle times, and compare their performance against a highly adaptive system of self-organizing traffic signals which is designed to uniformly distribute the network density. We find that for networks with time-independent boundary conditions, well-defined stationary MFDs are observed, whose shape depends on the particular signal system used, and also on the level of heterogeneity in the system. We find that the spatial heterogeneity of both density and flow provide important indicators of network performance. We also study networks with time-dependent boundary conditions, containing morning and afternoon peaks. In this case, intricate hysteresis loops are observed in the MFDs which are strongly correlated with the density heterogeneity. Our results show that the MFD of the self-organizing traffic signals lies above the MFD for the realistic systems, suggesting that by adaptively homogenizing the network density, overall better performance and higher capacity can be achieved.

J	Pantaleoni, E				Pantaleoni, Eva			Combining a road pollution dispersion model with GIS to determine carbon monoxide concentration in Tennessee	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Traffic; Modeling; GIS; Carbon monoxide; EPA	LAND-USE REGRESSION; URBAN AIR-POLLUTION; DAILY MORTALITY; OZONE; PARTICULATE; EXPOSURE; ASSOCIATION; PATTERNS; CHILDREN; INDICATORS	The purpose of this paper is to develop an air pollution model that is independent from pollution monitoring sites and highly accurate through space and time. Total carbon monoxide concentration is computed with the use of traffic flow data, vehicle speed and dimensions, emission rates, wind speed, and temperature. The data are interpolated using a geographic information system universal kriging technique, and the end results produce state level air pollution maps with high local accuracy. The model is validated against Environment Protection Agency (EPA) pollution data. Overall, the model has 71 % agreement with EPA, overestimating values of carbon monoxide for less than 1 ppm. The model has three advantages over already assessed air pollution models. First, it is completely independent of any air pollution monitoring stations; thus, possible temporary or permanent unreliability or lack of the data is avoided. Second, being based on a 5,710 traffic count network, the problem of remote places coverage is avoided. Third, it is based on a straightforward equation, where minimal preprocessing of traffic and climatic data is required.

J	Peng, GH				Peng, Guanghan			A new lattice model of two-lane traffic flow with the consideration of optimal current difference	COMMUNICATIONS IN NONLINEAR SCIENCE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION			English	Article						Traffic flow; Lattice model; Optimal current difference	JAMMING TRANSITION; HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL; EQUATION; KDV	In this paper, a new lattice model of traffic flow is proposed with the consideration of the optimal current difference for two-lane system. The linear stability condition is derived through linear stability analysis, which shows that the optimal current difference term can improve the stability of traffic flow. The mKdV equation is obtained through nonlinear analysis. Thus the space of traffic flow is divided into three regions: the stable region, the metastable region and the unstable region respectively. Moreover, numerical simulation confirms that the traffic jam can be suppressed efficiently by considering the optimal current difference effect in extended lattice model of two-lane traffic flow.

In the model, drivers have to enter the road with a shorter trip-time indicated on the information board, by making a turn at the intersection if necessary. The movement of drivers induces various traffic states, which are classified into six phases as a function of the car density. The dynamics of the traffic is expressed as the return map in the density-flow space, and analyzed on the basis of the car configuration on the roads. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Nagatani, T				Nagatani, Takashi			Nonlinear-map model for bus schedule in capacity-controlled transportation	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Bus schedule; Transportation; Shuttle bus; Nonlinear map; Complex motion; Chaos	TRAFFIC FLOW; PHYSICS	We study the schedule of shuttle buses in the transportation system controlled by capacity. The bus schedule is closely related to the dynamic motion of buses. We present the nonlinear-map model for the dynamics of shuttle buses. The motion of shuttle buses depends on the inflow rate. The dependence of the fixed points on the inflow is derived. The dynamic transitions occur with increasing the value of inflow rate. At the dynamic transition point, the motion of buses changes from a stable state to an unstable state and vice versa. The shuttle buses display periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic motions in the unstable state. In the unstable state, the number of riding passengers fluctuates complexly with varying trips. The bus schedule is governed by the complex motion of buses. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, C; Quddus, M; Ison, S				Wang, Chao; Quddus, Mohammed; Ison, Stephen			A spatio-temporal analysis of the impact of congestion on traffic safety on major roads in the UK	TRANSPORTMETRICA A-TRANSPORT SCIENCE			English	Article						traffic congestion; road traffic accidents; spatial autocorrelation; spatio-temporal analysis; random-effect negative binomial models; Bayesian hierarchical spatial models	BAYESIAN-APPROACH; SPATIAL-ANALYSIS; VEHICLE; MODEL; GEOMETRICS; FATALITIES; CRASHES; DRIVER; FLOW	A spatio-temporal analysis has been conducted aiming to explore the relationship between traffic congestion and road accidents based on the data on the M25 motorway and its surrounding major roads in England during the period 2003-2007. It was hypothesised that increased traffic congestion may be beneficial to road safety as the number of fatal/killed and serious injury (KSI) accidents would be less due to the low average speed when congestion is present. If this is confirmed, then it poses a potential dilemma for transport policy makers. A series of classical count outcome models (random-effects negative binomial models) and spatial models using a full Bayesian hierarchical approach have been developed in this study in order to examine whether congestion has any effect on the frequency of accidents. The results suggest that increased traffic congestion is associated with more KSI accidents and traffic congestion has little impact on slight injury accidents. This may be due to the higher speed variance among vehicles within and between lanes and erratic driving behaviour in the presence of congestion. In addition, traffic speeds even within congested situations are likely to be relatively high on major roads compared to other parts of the road network. Certain strategies are then proposed to optimise traffic flow which would be beneficial to both congestion and accident reduction.

Thus, this paper addresses the impact of the number of lanes on the platoon dispersion of traffic flow in low-friction conditions. A well-adopted dispersion model is used to reflect the platoon dispersion. The platoon dispersion factor of the model is then recalibrated using data on road segments with different numbers of lanes. The data are obtained from a comprehensive survey taken at several locations on the arterial streets of Changchun and Hangzhou city, China, where each direction of road segment has two, three, four, or five lanes. The statistical results verify that the number of lanes does have an evident effect on the platoon dispersion factor a: when the number of lanes grows from two to five, the value of a decreases significantly; meanwhile, the slope of the function curve between a and the normalized flow becomes larger.

J	Schnetzler, B; Louis, X				Schnetzler, Bernard; Louis, Xavier			Anisotropic second-order models and associated fundamental diagrams	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th Triennial Symposium on Transportation Analysis (TRISTAN)	JUN 20-25, 2010	Tromso, NORWAY			Macroscopic traffic flow model; Second-order model; Fundamental diagram; Traffic mixture; Vehicle length	TRAFFIC FLOW; WAVES	According to Banks [Investigation of some characteristics of congested flow. Transportation Research Record, 1999], traffic heterogeneity explains the data scattering on the flow-density plane and positive transferences within the congested phase (a transference is a line connecting adjacent points in the time series). This heterogeneity results from a traffic mixture, made up of various vehicles and drivers, or different traffic conditions such as meteorological conditions. This paper only deals with traffic mixture and more particularly with vehicle classes such as passenger car and truck, which are correlated to the vehicle length. When considering a macroscopic model, the mean vehicle length, which is measured by sensors, is associated with the truck percentage. Then the Generic Second Order Model (GSOM) by Lebacque [Generic second-order traffic flow modeling. Proceedings of the 17th International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory, 2007] provides a rigorous mathematical framework for traffic heterogeneity modeling. The added value in this paper is that admissible invariants which characterize generic fundamental diagrams, possibly depending on the mean vehicle length, are interpreted and debated. Aw-Rascle-Zhang's [Resurrection of second-order models of traffic flow. SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics, 2000] [A non equilibrium traffic model devoid of gas-like behavior. Transportation Research Part B 36, 2002] and Colombo's [A 2 x 2 hyperbolic traffic flow model. Mathematical and Computer Modeling 35, 2002] anisotropic models are deeply analyzed from a traffic point of view. At last an extended GSOM equation system provides a full parameterization of fundamental diagrams which is needed to traffic heterogeneity modeling. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In particular, their cooperative nature makes them fairly inefficient when working with a reduced number of partners. This situation typically corresponds to the deployment stage, during which only a few vehicles cooperate. This time period cannot be avoided when pushing a new system to the market. We are interested in two features that are important for this kind of system: traffic jam detection and traffic alert transmission. For the first feature, we present a theoretical model that anticipates the proportion of equipped vehicles that allows an acceptable level of traffic jam detection, and we validate this model by simulation. For the second feature, we examine two ways to improve the system behaviour when the proportion of equipped vehicles is very low; their efficiency is tested through simulation. This study is innovative because the simulation platform we developed can take into account the directional behaviour of wireless communications in urban context for a low computational cost.

Firstly, a calculation method for the occupancy per cycle under different traffic conditions were presented, based on the relationship between the three basic traffic flow parameters, speed, traffic flow and density. Secondly, the times at which the stopping and starting waves approach a loop detector were confirmed using the traffic wave models modified by a kinematic equation. Then, the threshold of occupancy, which characterizes the appearance of spillovers, was determined by the premise that the stopping and starting waves had the same speed. At last, the accuracy and usability of the new method were verified by VISSIM simulation, using the ratio of misjudgment as the evaluation index. The results show that the ratio of misjudgment of the new method is about 11.36% compared to 17.65% of the previous method.

A primary observation is that, for the intersection studied, only a small percentage of pedestrians appear to comply with the pedestrian signal indication, with the vast majority of pedestrians exhibiting gap-seeking behavior, crossing when a gap is available, regardless of the signal indication. This results in potentially significant over-estimates of wait time if high pedestrian signal compliance rates are assumed. A second notable observation is that the pedestrian crossing behavior is strongly related to the cross-street traffic queue clearance time and subsequent traffic flow. Capturing this interaction significantly enhances the models' ability to reflect the observed field performance.

Application of genetic algorithms for joint optimization of signal setting parameters and dynamic traffic assignment for the real network data	RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS			English	Article						Signal optimization; Equilibrium; Traffic assignment; Simulation; Network; Genetic algorithms	EXISTENCE	This paper presents the joint optimization of signal setting parameters and dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) traffic assignment for the congested urban road network. The simulation-based approach is employed to obtain the DUE condition for the case of multiple-origin multiple-destination traffic flows. The dynamic traffic assignment simulation program (DTASP), developed in C language is used to assign the traffic dynamically on the road network, whereas method of successive averages (MSA) is modified and used to arrive at the DUE condition. The artificial intelligence technique of genetic algorithms (GAs) is applied to obtain the optimal signal setting parameters and path flow distribution factor for DUE condition. The methodology developed in such a way that joint optimization of signal setting parameters with DUE is obtained. The proposed method is applied to the real network data of Fort Area of Mumbai city comprising of 17 nodes and 56 unidirectional links with 72 Origin Destination pairs, where all the 17 nodes are signalized intersections. The traffic flow condition for the optimized signal setting parameters is considerably improved compared to the existing signal settings. The results prove that the GA is an effective technique to solve the joint optimization problem for the real network data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Varia, H.

J	Guo, F; Krishnan, R; Polak, J				Guo, Fangce; Krishnan, Rajesh; Polak, John			A computationally efficient two-stage method for short-term traffic prediction on urban roads	TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						short-term traffic prediction; SSA; GM; SARIMA	SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION; VOLUME; MODEL; FLOW	Short-term traffic prediction plays an important role in intelligent transport systems. This paper presents a novel two-stage prediction structure using the technique of Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) as a data smoothing stage to improve the prediction accuracy. Moreover, a novel prediction method named Grey System Model (GM) is introduced to reduce the dependency on method training and parameter optimisation. To demonstrate the effects of these improvements, this paper compares the prediction accuracies of SSA and non-SSA model structures using both a GM and a more conventional Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) prediction model. These methods were calibrated and evaluated using traffic flow data from a corridor in Central London under both normal and incident traffic conditions. The prediction accuracy comparisons show that the SSA method as a data smoothing step before the application of machine learning or statistical prediction methods can improve the final traffic prediction accuracy. In addition, the results indicate that the relatively novel GM method outperforms SARIMA under both normal and incident traffic conditions on urban roads.

J	Tsapakis, I; Heydecker, BG; Cheng, T; Anbaroglu, B				Tsapakis, Ioannis; Heydecker, Benjamin G.; Cheng, Tao; Anbaroglu, Berk			How tube strikes affect macroscopic and link travel times in London	TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						public strikes; tube; macroscopic travel times; link travel times; urban roadway network performance	MASS-TRANSIT STRIKE; BEHAVIOR; MILEAGE; BIAS; RISK	The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the five strikes on the London Underground (metro) rail system, which occurred in 2009 and 2010, on macroscopic and road link travel times. A consequence of these strikes was an increase in road traffic flows above usual levels. This provides an opportunity to observe the operation of the road network under unusually high flows. The first objective involves the examination of strike effects on inbound (IT) and outbound traffic (OT) within central, inner and outer London. Travel time data obtained from automatic number plate recognition cameras are used within the first part of the analysis. The second more detailed objective was to investigate in spatio-temporal effects on travel times on five road links. Correlation analyses and general linear models are developed using both traffic flow and travel time data. According to the results of the study, the morning IT had approximately twice as much delay as the OT. Central London experienced the highest delays, followed by inner and outer London. As would be expected, the unique full-day strike in 2009 yielded the worst impact on the network with the highest percentage increase in total travel time (60%) occurring during the morning peak in the IT in inner London. The results from the link-level analysis showed statistical significance amongst the examined links indicating heterogeneous effects from one link to another. It was also found that travel time changes may be more effectively captured through time-of-day terms compared to hourly traffic flows.

M.; Wang, Hao			Spontaneous phase transition from free flow to synchronized flow in traffic on a single-lane highway	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; MODELS; DYNAMICS; STATES	Traffic flow complexity comes from the car-following and lane-changing behavior. Based on empirical data for individual vehicle speeds and time headways measured on a single-lane highway section, we have studied the traffic flow properties induced by pure car-following behavior. We have found that a spontaneous sudden drop in velocity could happen in a platoon of vehicles when the velocity of the leading vehicle is quite high (similar to 70 km/h). In contrast, when the velocity of the leading vehicle in a platoon slows down, such a spontaneous sudden drop of velocity has not been observed. Our finding indicates that traffic breakdown on a single-lane road might be a phase transition from free flow to synchronized flow (F. S transition). We have found that the flow rate within the emergent synchronized flow can be either smaller or larger than the flow rate in the free flow within which the synchronized flow propagates. Our empirical findings support Kerner's three-phase theory in which traffic breakdown is associated with an F -> S transition.

J	Wang, J; Wang, L				Wang, Jian; Wang, Ling			Congestion analysis of traffic networks with direction-dependant heterogeneity	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic networks; Complex networks; Congestion; Heterogeneity	COMPLEX NETWORKS; DYNAMICS; TRANSPORTATION	Traffic flow directionality and network weight asymmetry are widespread notions in traffic networks. This paper investigates the influence of direction-dependant heterogeneity on traffic congestion. To capture the effect of the link directionality and link weight asymmetry, the heterogeneity indexes of complex networks and the traffic flow model are introduced. The numerical results show that the critical value of heterogeneity determines congestion transition processes. The congestion degree increases with heterogeneity when the network heterogeneity is at a subcritical region. A network is more tolerant of congestion if the heterogeneity of the network is smaller or larger than the critical value. Furthermore, when heterogeneity reaches the critical value, the average number of accumulated vehicles arrives at the maximum and the traffic flow is under a serious congestion state. A significant improvement on the tolerance to congestion of traffic networks can be nude if the network heterogeneity is controlled within a reasonable range. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In the velocity design the look-ahead system considers several information of the road sections ahead of the vehicle. By incorporating road information about the geometrical characteristics and traffic of the oncoming road sections, e.g. speed limits, road slopes, road curvature and traffic mean speed it is possible to alter the velocity of the vehicle in advance. Such way, the longitudinal energy required by the vehicle motion can be reduced significantly. The main novelty of the paper is the adaptation of forward traffic mean speed and safe cornering velocity in the look-ahead control algorithm. It is demonstrated in real data simulation that with the proposed method significant amount of fuel can be saved and the safety of the vehicle motion can also be enhanced.

Investigating the influence of highway traffic flow condition on pollutant emissions using driving simulators	AIR POLLUTION XXI	WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment		English	Proceedings Paper	21st International Conference on Modelling, Monitoring and Management of Air Pollution	2013	Siena, ITALY	Wessex Inst Technol, Univ W England, Univ Siena, Int Journal Sustainable Dev & Planning, WIT Transact Ecol & Environm		emission factors; emission models; driving simulator; driver's behaviour	VALIDATION	In the last 20 years the attention of international organizations towards air pollution has been improved, leading to definition of laws and regulations. In order to evaluate strategies and policies, forecasting tools have been adopted by institutions. Currently, the estimation of traffic emissions is based on static models, in which the amount of pollutant is computed as a function of average parameters obtained on a single road stretch. The well-known traffic increase of recent years has significantly changed the actual flow conditions, producing a strong rise of interferences. As this facet affects the operating condition of each vehicle, the use of a standard emission model at high traffic interference can lead to some inaccuracies. In such cases, instantaneous emission models introduce deeper capabilities; essentially, the pollutant prediction is directly tied to the engine vehicle operation point in reallike traffic condition. This second modelling approach has been adopted in the current work. A complete lumped parameter vehicle model has been built to be used as a virtual on-road emission/fuel consumption test unit. Investigations have highlighted the dependence of emission level and fuel consumption on drivers' behaviour; indeed, the analysis took advantage of the experiments carried out in the virtual reality laboratory: on a typical highway geometry, characterized by a dual lane carriageway with three lanes each, three different flow conditions have been simulated. Once the relationship between highway interference level and drivers' behaviour has been evidenced (in terms of emissions and fuel consumption), a relation between highway interference level and emissions/fuel consumption has been highlighted. Finally, in order to assess the differences between static and instantaneous emission models, a comparative analysis has been carried out.	[De Blasiis, M.

The implementation of such a financial program has dramatically increased fuel taxes - about 82% for unleaded and 31% for diesel - also producing a serious impact on road traffic demand. Starting from the above framework, this paper describes the main outcomes of a study aimed at identifying, assessing and forecasting the effects of fuel prices and tax changes on traffic flows along a 365 km toll motorway corridor project connecting Athens to Tsakona, in the South-West of the Peloponnese.

This problem can be formulated with an (asymmetric) equilibrium assignment model. In this paper we study the problem and the corresponding equilibrium model and compare several solution algorithms proposed in the literature. All algorithms were tested on a real-scale network with different demand levels and a different number of signalised intersections. Numerical results show that differences in computing times among algorithms are significant when the network is highly congested and there are many signalised intersections. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Traffic intensities doubled on the roads (of 2nd. or 3rd. class) on surveyed areas during the last five years, in extreme cases of the morning traffic peak vehicles spend about 50% of total drive in congestions. The offer of transit (public transport) has non adequate development in suburb areas as well. The passenger car transport has low average occupancy rate app. 1.3 persons per car. These conclusions result from long term traffic surveys carried out on the selected localities of suburb settlements up to 20(km) of radial distance from the Prague city centre. The quantification of transport environmental impacts of observed area requires not only accept the proportion of increased intensities but it is necessary to take into account a progressive influence of increased drive transience of traffic flows and congestions. That is why the traffic surveys were carried out simultaneously with experimental drives done by vehicles with measurement equipment to map emission production and fuel consumption in the suburb areas. Results confirm expectations that the higher rate of suburb populating increases vehicles' fuel consumption and consequently emission impacts. The important influencing factor is the quality of transport infrastructure and its control, including road horizontal and vertical profile shape.

A dynamic environment is made up of static and moving obstacles. Each moving vehicle acts as a dynamic obstacle for other moving vehicle. There by increasing the network congestion. It is shown that the game theoretic model effectively helps to construct a navigation graph for each moving vehicle and computes collision free geometric path in a 2-D and 3-D work space. In this study (i) the problem of Network congestion is addressed by using the concept of Multi-Agents where, the transportation network is depicted as a non-deterministic, non-cooperative n - person game and (ii) the computation of collision free geometric path by using a 2 player non-deterministic game which detects the dynamic obstacles based on the observation made by the object sensor, computes all the possible geometric paths and selects the optimal path for the vehicle to travel in a 2-D and 3-D workspace (iii) Cooperative game theory model to resolve traffic congestion at a merge using the concepts of Time-Division Multiple Access(TDMA) data slot that propagates through the a transportation channel (iv) Construction of the multi-agent navigation graph online taking into consideration only the obstacles affecting the query.

In grey forecast modeling, the smoothness of the data sequence has a significant impact on the modeling accuracy of GM (1,1) model. According to the present theories of buffer operators and some already existed weakening buffer operators, we proposed some new weakening buffer operators and prove their correctness. Meanwhile, they were compared with the existing weakening buffer operators in prediction effectiveness in traffic flow forecasting. The results shows the validity of new weakening buffer operators in enhancing the forecast accuracy of grey forecast model.

Furthermore, conflicts or coordination problems of intersecting or merging flows are considered as well. Making assumptions regarding the permeability of the intersection as a function of the conflicting flows and the queue lengths, we find self-organized oscillations in the flows similar to the operation of traffic lights.

Here, elements of signal control are discussed, based on the minimization of overall travel times or vehicle queues. Interestingly, we find different operation regimes, some of which involve a "slower-is-faster effect", where a delayed switching reduces the average travel times. These operation regimes characterize different ways of organizing traffic flows in urban road networks. Besides the optimize-one-phase approach, we discuss the procedure and advantages of optimizing multiple phases as well. To improve the service of vehicle platoons and support the self-organization of "green waves", it is proposed to consider the price of stopping newly arriving vehicles.

These models are able to describe the dynamical behavior in a network accurately. On the other hand, for large scale networks often strongly simplified dynamics or even static descriptions of the flow have been widely used for traffic flow or supply chain management due to computational reasons. In this paper, a unified presentation highlighting connections between the above approaches are given and furthermore, a hierarchy of dynamical models is developed including models based on partial differential equations and nonlinear algebraic equations or even combinatorial models based on linear equations. Special focus is on optimal control problems and optimization techniques where combinatorial and continuous optimization approaches are discussed and compared.

In order to adapt to the needs for traffic guidance and signal control, a short-time traffic flow RBF neural network model combination prediction method based on wavelet de-nosing processing is put forward. First, the traffic flow data are decomposed and reconstructed by using the wavelet transform technique. Then Under the intensive analysis the characteristics of short-time traffic flow, the low frequency outline signal and high frequency detail signal are fitted respectively by using two different RBF neural network models, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed to train RBF neural network. The confirmation analysis is carried on with traffic flow data from typical roads in some city urban districts. The results show that the precision of combination prediction method is significantly improved.

Various models are developed to understand single-lane traffic, multilane traffic and lane-changing behavior. To realize dynamic traffic management, a rapid and robust traffic CA procedure is necessary. Generally, traffic CA models are proposed based on NaSch model, which is proposed by Nagel and Schreckenberg and is named after their abbreviations of names. The model is a four-step procedure. In this study, sensitivity of single-lane traffic flow is examined by NaSch model. According to the results, sensitivity decreases with density increases. The transient sensitivity is larger than steady-state sensitivity in the increasing profile; hence, transient simulation is still necessary. The transient sensitivity is equal to steady-state sensitivity in the decreasing profile. Although the sensitivity varies with density, the trend is stable and predictable.

In the spatial structure of this model, the intersections does not take the faulty hypothesis that vehicles fly over them freely. The lanes are described by one dimensional cellular automata. The intersections are described by two dimensional cellular automata, But a m-legged intersection is decomposed into C-m(2) of logical independent cells chains which are modeled by the multilevel Cellular Automata networks overlapped in vertical. At the micro networks dynamics, the basic state equations of Cellular Automata for traffic system are developed, and the complex networks dynamics equations are also developed in this research. The urban traffic behavior is simulated by iterations based on the updating procedure of system involvement for continuous ticks of the clock. Then a example is applied to illustrate the practical use of the multilevel cellular automata networks model. the simulation results shows the simulation is consisted on the theoretical.

The current technologies that support vehicular travel like wired sensors, inductive loops, surveillance camera etc., are expensive and also require high maintenance cost. Further the accuracy of these devices also depends on environment conditions. The typical traditional approaches attempt to optimize traffic lights control for a particular density and configuration of traffic. However, the major disadvantage of using these techniques is that the dynamic behavior of traffic densities and configurations change is difficult to model constantly. Traffic seems to be an adaptation problem rather than an optimization problem. This paper therefore tries to address the above issue, and hence we propose algorithms which perform adaptive traffic light control using a wireless sensor network setup. The paper aims at analyzing methods to build an intelligent system that can blend and support some of the existing technologies of traffic control and therefore reduce the average waiting time of vehicles on a junction. The proposed algorithms are adaptive to traffic flow at any intersection point of roads. Simulations of the real-life traffic scenarios are conducted in a simulated platform called Green Light District Simulator (GLD) to generate graph average waiting time versus cycles. The results generated show that the proposed method is effective for the traffic control in a real road intersection.	[Srivastava, Juhi R.; Sudarshan, T. S.

If flow conditions that make an accident more likely can be reliably predicted in real time, it would be possible to use this information to take preventive measures, such as changing variable speed limits before an accident happens. The system uses case-based reasoning, an artificial intelligence methodology, which predicts the outcome of current traffic flow conditions based on historical flow data cases that led to accidents. This study focusses on investigating if case-based reasoning using spatio-temporal flow data is a viable method to differentiate between accidents and non-accidents by evaluating the capability of the retrieval mechanism, the first stage in a case-based reasoning system, to retrieve a traffic flow case from the case base with the same outcome as the target case. Preliminary results from experiments using real-world spatio-temporal traffic flow data and accident data are promising.

To come up with an effective prediction model, it is essential to consider the time-dependent volatility nature of traffic data. Inspired by this understanding, this paper explores the underlying trend of traffic flow to differentiate between peak and non-peak traffic periods, and finally makes use of this notion to train separate prediction model for each period effectively. It is worth mentioning that even if time associated with the traffic data is not given explicitly, the proposed approach will strive to identify different trends by exploring distribution of data. Once the data corresponding trends are determined, Random Forest as prediction model is well aware of data context, and hence, it has less chance of getting stuck in local optima. To show the effectiveness of our approach, several experiments are conducted on the data provided in the first task of 2010 IEEE International Competition on Data Mining (ICDM). Experimental results are promising due to the scalability of the proposed method compared to the results given by the top teams of the competition.

Therefore, the ability of systems to manage air traffic presents difficulties. In this paper, we address the Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) problem, as a new Linear Integer Program (LIP). It takes into account all flights phases, i.e., taking-off, cruising and landing. The model also allows rerouting decisions. All constraints of our model and objective function are linear, differently from the model of Bertsimas et al. [2] which contains non-linear constraints.

We consider a freeway composed of cells and entry/exit ramps, and formulate the ramp metering problem as a density tracking process. The cell transmission model (CTM) is firstly formulated and ramp control objective is determined. Based on CTM and single neuron, a freeway ramp metering system is then designed, and the learning algorithm of single neuron is given in detail. Finally, the ramp metering system is simulated in MATLAB software. The results show that this method can effectively deal with this class of control problem, and can achieve a perfect density tracking performance. This ramp metering can eliminate traffic congestion and maintain traffic flow stability.

In camera-equipped vehicles, road detection methods are being developed for advanced driver assistance, lane departure, and aerial incident detection, just to cite a few. In traffic surveillance, segmenting road information brings special benefits: to automatically wrap regions of traffic analysis (consequently, speeding up flow analysis in videos), to help with the detection of driving violations (to improve contextual information in videos of traffic), and so forth. Methods and techniques can be used interchangeably for both types of application. Particularly, we are interested in segmenting road regions from the remaining of an image, aiming to support traffic flow analysis tasks. In our proposed method, road segmentation relies on a superpixel detection based on a novel edge density estimation method; in each superpixel, priors are extracted from features of gray-amount, texture homogeneity, traffic motion and horizon line. A feature vector with all those priors feeds a support vector machine classifier, which ultimately takes the superpixel-wise decision of being a road or not. A dataset of challenging scenes was gathered from traffic video surveillance cameras, in our city, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

This study proposes a fuzzy logic based traffic congestion identification method. The components of a fuzzy logic inference are firstly formulated. According to such information as the speed and occupancy of freeway traffic flow, and the weather conditions on the freeway, a congestion identification method based on fuzzy logic inference is then designed. Gauss curves are assumed for the membership functions of the input and output variables, and 45 fuzzy rules are also established. Finally, the congestion identification method is simulated. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the above method. Fuzzy logic inference is suitable for estimating the traffic congestion index.

Furthermore, RSUs can take part in controlling traffic flow for vehicle's secure driving by broadcasting locally analyzed data, forwarding some important messages, and communicating with other RSUs, and so on. In order to maximize the availability of RSUs in the VANET, RSUs need to be fully distributed over an entire area. Thus, RSUs can make the best use of all traffic data gathered from every intersection. In this paper, we provide intersection-priority based RSU placement methods to find the optimal number and positions of RSUs for the full distribution providing with a maximal connectivity between RSUs while minimizing RSU setup costs. We propose three optimal algorithms: greedy, dynamic and hybrid algorithms. Finally, we provide simulated analyses of our algorithms using real urban roadmaps of JungGu/Jongrogu, YongsanGu, and GangnamGu in Seoul, each of which has a characteristic road style different than each other. We analyze how our algorithms work in such different types of roadways with real traffic data, and find the optimal number and positions of RSUs in these areas.

Based on expressway toll by weight system and by using database query language SQL, certain data such as structural proportion of traffic flow, total mass of cargo and vehicles, overload rate, the income of toll per km and so forth can be gathered through the preprocessing and analysis of freight vehicle weight information. Meanwhile, combined with the survey data of unloaded weight of the freight vehicles, the calculation model for per km freight turnover of toll by weight expressway has been established in the essay. Moreover, the statistics method for the freight turnover data of regional high-grade highway network has been put forward through the analog method which applied in the comparison between the toll by weight expressway and the traffic flow of other types of highway including non toll by weight expressway, first class and second class highway. At the end of the essay, the feasibility of the above mentioned calculation model has been approved using a sample of Yunnan province. And the research of the essay has not only indicated the convenience of gathering the needed basic data, with which the cost and time needed for the survey has been greatly saved, but also provided a new method for the statistics of regional transportation volume of goods. Moreover, the research of the essay has also reflected the capability and efficiency of the freight transportation of the regional high-grade highway network, which can be the reference for decision making of the relevant departments of transportation plan and statistics.

J	Holtl, A; Trommer, S				Hoeltl, Arne; Trommer, Stefan			Driver Assistance Systems for Transport System Efficiency: Influencing Factors on User Acceptance	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Driver Assistance; Driving Efficiency; Emissions; User Acceptance Model	IMPACT	A major success factor for the implementation of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) is knowledge about the user's reaction and response to such technologies. The objective of each development process is to achieve a broad acceptance among those using the system. User acceptance is a key success factor, so it should be taken into account in early development stages. This applies especially for technical solutions requiring frequent interactions, for example, to influence the driver's behavior toward a more efficient driving style. The complexity of developments in the field of ITS raises the question: At what point do users start feeling overloaded and no longer able to handle all functionalities, ultimately rejecting using them? A Europe-wide study was carried out (N = 5,807) focusing on drivers' perceptions of cooperative systems that offer assistance on fuel efficiency. The advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) used in the study have the potential to change driving behavior in the long term and thus have a sustainable impact to reduce fuel consumption and traffic emissions. ADAS functionalities provide up-to-date traffic information, which is disseminated by traffic management to help traffic flow in a more energy efficient way. Six ADAS functions were assessed in pre-, on-, and post-trip driving situations. The chosen research framework was used to compare the users' perception using a set of relevant acceptance factors that were developed in this study. The results showed significant effects between acceptance factors and the influencing variables. The interrelations between acceptance factors were analyzed using a research model developed in this study.

The spatial-temporal profiles are presented after the numerical simulation. It is shown that the accident car not only causes a local jam behind the accident car, but also causes vehicles to cluster in the bypass lane. The accident occurring in lane 1 (the left lane) in the weaving section are more inclined to cause traffic jam and the decrease of traffic capacity than in lane 2 (the right lane). Furthermore, the curves of saturated flux of weaving section against different accident sites are given. It is found that the capacity of weaving section will decrease fastest when the accident is located in the downstream of weaving section.

To get rid of this drawback, this paper proposes a traffic guiding method based on actuated control and phase jump. Time to make a phase jump is decided by the obtained knowledge of queued vehicles. For a light traffic, this paper has deduced the dynamic green time, designed a detector and achieved signal timing by the actuated guiding algorithm; For an almost saturated traffic, the maximum green time and cycle length are restricted by Webster-Monte Carlo Simulation. From the comparison of principles and applications of different guiding strategies, it is found that the method proposed in this paper has a better performance in guiding traffic flow than the existing actuated guiding strategy and the adaptive guiding strategy.

Influencing factors are classified into static factors and dynamic factors. We mainly focus on the three dynamic factors which are cycle length, platoon length and traffic flow continuation. An integrated correlation model is established to quantify the correlation degree of adjacent intersections and then a dynamic partition algorithm is developed based on the model. Both this algorithm and Chang's algorithm, which is a representative achievement in subarea partition cited by Traffic control systems Handbook, are applied to a network including 20 signalized intersections in VISSIM to compare their benefits. Statistical results show that: (a) adjacent intersections with high correlation degree can be partitioned into one subarea to execute signal coordination according to our algorithm; (b) implementing our algorithm can save average vehicle delay by 8.9% and average vehicle stops by 7.8% than implementing Chang's algorithm.

The two main challenges in modelling are: capturing the effect of varying size of vehicles, and the lack in behavior of vehicles. The same section length of the road can be occupied by different types of vehicles at the same time, and the conventional measure of traffic concentration, density (vehicles per lane per unit length), is not a good measure for heterogeneous traffic modelling. This paper addresses the above mentioned two challenges by extending the Aw-Rascle macroscopic model based on continuum theory using area occupancy for traffic concentration instead of density. The aim of the model is to have a parsimonious model of heterogeneous traffic for network wide applications that can capture unique phenomena in heterogeneous traffic flow such as capacity filling. The paper calibrates and validates the model using data from an arterial road in Chennai city. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Clustering techniques identify the similarities and dissimilarities between data, and classify the data into groups with similar characteristics. Such techniques have been successfully used in market research, astronomy, psychiatry, and transportation. A framework is proposed for clustering traffic data based on fundamental traffic flow variables. Three types of clustering techniques are investigated: 1) connectivity-based clustering, 2) centroid-based clustering, and 3) distribution-based clustering. Specifically, hierarchical clustering, K-means clustering and general mixture model (GMM) were investigated. Traffic sensor data from three freeway bottleneck locations in two major U. S. metropolitan areas, St. Louis, Missouri, and Twin Cities, Minnesota, were used in the study. Various combinations of traffic variables were investigated for all three clustering techniques. The results indicated that the clustering is an effective way to partition traffic data into the free flow and congested flow regimes. Partitioned traffic data can be used to create fundamental traffic flow diagrams and macroscopic traffic stream models. Using speeds, or both speeds and occupancies as input variables produced the best clustering results. The performance of K-means and hierarchical clustering techniques were comparable to each other and they outperformed GMM clustering. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A dynamic offset model based on stop line detector information	2ND CONFERENCE OF TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH GROUP OF INDIA (2ND CTRG)	Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd Conference of Transportation-Research-Group-of-India (CTRG)	DEC 12-15, 2013	Agra, INDIA	Transportat Res Grp India		Dynamic offset; travel time estimation; stop line detection; vehicle actuated signals		Existing traffic networks have to be controlled and regulated efficiently before trying to build new transportation facilities, with an aim to reduce the growing traffic congestion. One of the effective option is signal coordination which helps in improving the uninterrupted flow of traffic. The offset provided for traffic signal coordination is often static assuming constant link travel time making it unfit for varying traffic flows. Present study is aimed at building a dynamic offset model, based on the flow rate and the link length between the intersections meant for coordination. Estimation of travel time required for the vehicles to travel from one intersection to another forms the basis of the offset calculation. The underlying assumption is that the travel time increases with an increase in the rate of vehicular flow, as well as the distance between the intersections. This can be captured by a vehicle detector typically placed at stop line. The relation between travel time and vehicular flow has been verified by conducting studies in congested corridors in Mumbai, India, during peak and off peak hours. An algorithm similar to a vehicle actuated algorithm, but terminate at some common cycle length is used in the development of the models and evaluated using a robust traffic simulator. A non-linear dynamic offset model is hence built, which caters to the real time fluctuating traffic conditions. However, the estimation of vehicular flow rate from the detectors in the field is sometimes difficult and erroneous. To address this limitation, a second model is proposed based on the assumption that the green time provided by the algorithm can be used as a proxy for the detector output and consequently the level of congestion. Accordingly, a dynamic offset model is developed which gives the value of the offset to be implemented based on the green time used and the link length. The models developed are compared with the independent vehicle actuated control and constant offset control. The average delay and travel time are considered as the performance indicator. It is observed that the dynamic offset is successful in improving the coordination efficiency of corridors, even for heterogeneous traffic conditions. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A detailed investigation of highway traffic variations i.e. total traffic, passenger car and truck traffic with severity of cold, the amount of snow, and various combinations of cold and snow intensities is presented here. These investigations were conducted using hourly traffic data from 350 permanent traffic counter sites, 6 Weigh in Motion sites and weather data from 598 weather stations located in the province of Alberta, Canada, from 1995 to 2010. Multiple regression analysis is used in the modeling process. The model parameters include three sets of variables: the amount of snowfall as a quantitative variable, categorized cold as a dummy variable, and an interaction variable formed by the product of these two variables. The study results indicate that the association of highway traffic flow with cold and snow varies with day of week, hour of day, and severity of weather conditions. A reduction of 1% to 2% in total traffic volume for each centimeter of snowfall is observed when the mean temperature is above 0 degrees C. For the days with zero precipitation, reductions in total traffic volume due to mild and severe cold are 1% and 31%, respectively. An additional reduction of 0.5% to 3% per centimeter of snowfall results when snowfall occurs during severe cold conditions. Traffic volumes decreased with increase in the severity of cold temperatures. During extremely cold weather (below -25 degrees C), the average winter daily traffic volume was reduced by about 30%. Weekend traffic volumes were more susceptible to cold than weekday numbers for all types of highways. Commuter and regional commuter roads experienced the lowest variations with cold. The impact of cold was very high for recreational roads and moderate for rural, long distance roads. This study also shows a clear indication in the reduction in daily traffic volumes due to snow (reductions between 7% and 17% for each centimeter of snowfall were observed). When individual vehicle classes were analyzed, it is found that passenger cars are more vulnerable to adverse weather conditions than trucks. Trucks are not as greatly affected as passenger cars by adverse weather conditions. Interestingly, the modeling results for one of the study sites reveal that higher truck traffic volumes can result during heavy snowfall (or other adverse weather conditions) in winter months due to shifting of trucks from secondary highways with poor winter maintenance to primary highways. This is contradictory to observations from other similar studies in the literature. The traffic-weather models developed from the past studies have two major applications in transportation engineering. These models have been tested for: (1) imputation of missing traffic data during winter months and (2) estimation of annual average daily traffic (AADT) from short-term traffic counts undertaken during winter months. The imputation efficiency of the traffic-weather models was compared with the most efficient imputation methods used by highway agencies. A new factor approach, incorporating weather conditions, was proposed in this paper to estimate AADT from short duration counts taken during winter months. Therefore, the developed traffic-weather models can be recommended to highway agencies to impute missing traffic data and to estimate AADT from short duration counts taken during winter months.

Congestion occurs when traffic demand exceeds the operational capacity of the roadway. Better management of infrastructure is required in improving the operational capacity. Traffic signals are one of the most popular traffic control strategies that have been adopted for managing the demand and to reduce congestion; but if not properly designed will lead to excessive delay and increase in travel time. Therefore, signals need to be designed based on theory of traffic flow that requires a good understanding of the traffic system. The present study proposes a macroscopic model based control scheme for Indian traffic conditions. Traffic density and speed are used as the state variables to characterize the system and the developed control scheme regulates the density inside the section. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Traffic assignment problem (TAP) is a key step of the four-step process that determines the flow pattern which forms the basis for scenario analysis of a transportation improvement project. In many cases, different scenarios may differ by little, but FSTDM may lead to network flows which differ significantly or suggest improvements which are inconsistent with the network situation. This inconsistency arises due to solution noise. There are two main sources of this noise; first, the interdependency between the trip distribution and trip assignment steps of FSTDM, and second, the lower level of convergence in the traffic assignment step. This paper presents a methodology to address the aforementioned two issues by a post-processing technique incorporated through a feedback mechanism in the FSTDM. The post-processing technique consists of SMPA-hybrid, perturbation assignment and Origin-Destination (O-D) prioritization schemes. SMPA-hybrid is an improved implementation of traffic assignment algorithm labeled slope-based multi-path algorithm (SMPA) developed by Kumar and Peeta (2010). There are three methodological contributions of this paper. First, the paper presents an enhanced travel demand modeling framework, second, it formulates a hybrid approach by combining the merits of sequential approach and simultaneous approach of solution algorithms for the TAP, and third, it provides a methodology for the O-D prioritization in TAP. The results of computational experiments suggest that the SMPA-hybrid has a superior rate of convergence compared to the SMPA. The results further reveal that a warm start using perturbation assignment and O-D prioritization has significant benefits over the base case of cold start and non-prioritized implementation of the SMPA-hybrid.

Level of Service Criteria of off-street Pedestrian Facilities in Indian Context using Affinity Propagation Clustering	2ND CONFERENCE OF TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH GROUP OF INDIA (2ND CTRG)	Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd Conference of Transportation-Research-Group-of-India (CTRG)	DEC 12-15, 2013	Agra, INDIA	Transportat Res Grp India		PLOS; Off-street Pedestrian facilities; AP clustering; Average pedestrian space; Pedestrian travel speed		To know how well roadways accommodate pedestrian travel or how they are pedestrian friendly it becomes necessary to assess the walking conditions. Estimation of PLOS criteria is very important as this is the first step of LOS analysis but this is not well defined in Indian context. The analysis followed in India is basically an adaptation of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2010 methodology. However, the defined ranges of various measuring parameters mentioned in HCM 2010 are more suitable for developed countries. In this research, an in-depth study has been carried out to define PLOS criteria of urban off-streets facilities in developing countries having heterogeneous traffic flow conditions. Defining LOS is basically a classification problem and to solve it Affinity Propagation (AP), a very recently developed cluster algorithm is used. Inventory details and speed data are collected from two important cities (Bhubaneswar and Rourkela) of Odisha state, India having less than a million populations, through the application of video camera. After the collection of data, based upon average pedestrian space, flow rate, speed and volume to capacity ratio (v/c), six categories of PLOS are estimated. PLOS ranges found from this study for six categories (A-F) using average pedestrian space are (in m(2)/pedestrian) >15.67, >(13.84-15.67), >(10.67-13.84), >(7.63-10.67), >(5.08-7.63), <= 5.08, flow rate are (in pedestrian/sec/m) <= 0.065, >(0.065-0.081), >(0.081-0.096), >(0.096-0.116), >(0.116-0.141), > 0.141, speed are (in m/pedestrian) >1.51, >(1.32-1.51), >(1.13-1.32), >(0.91-1.13), >(0.69-0.91), <= 0.69 and volume to capacity ratio (v/c) are <= 0.4, >(0.4-0.57), >(0.57-0.76), >(0.76-0.9), >(0.9-1), >1 for PLOS categories A, B, C, D, E and F respectively. The PLOS ranges defined in this study are proportionately lower than that mentioned in HCM (2010) because of highly heterogeneous traffic flow and low volume of pedestrian movements in less than a million population cities in Indian context.

Micro simulation Based Performance Evaluation of Delhi Bus Rapid Transit Corridor	2ND CONFERENCE OF TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH GROUP OF INDIA (2ND CTRG)	Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd Conference of Transportation-Research-Group-of-India (CTRG)	DEC 12-15, 2013	Agra, INDIA	Transportat Res Grp India		BRTS; Micro Simulation; Performance Evaluation		Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) is the most popular form of rapid public transit system with large capacities and more importantly minimal capital costs compared to other forms of public transportation system, which makes it favourable for developing nations such as India, China and Brazil. BRTS can be effectively deployed to provide efficient and near door-to door to services meeting the daily commute needs of the citizens. However, the performance evaluation of BRT systems is essentially required to measure its effectiveness and thus monitor its efficiency. Two types of BRTS namely, Closed and Open BRTS are functional in some of the Indian cities with the most popular being the Ahmedabad BRTS where in the closed BRTS network is in vogue whereas the Delhi BRTS being a pilot corridor only as of now is an Open BRTS. Moreover, ten more BRTS are in the pipeline for many other cities in India. Considering this the performance evaluation of the BRT systems presently functional in the Indian traffic conditions becomes very vital. Various approaches have been deployed elsewhere for evaluating the performance of BRT systems and these are based on qualitative, quantitative and economic perspectives. The quantitative perspective mainly considers engineering parameters like speed, travel time, delay and capacity. In order to evaluate the quantitatively establish the performance measures of the BRT system functional in the Indian cities, an innovative approach based on scientific reasoning is essential and the same has been evolved in this paper. In the present study, a quantitative performance approach using micro-simulation technique has been formulated aimed to evaluating the open system BRT corridor functioning in Delhi. Delhi BRT corridor is currently operational for a length of 5.8 km from Ambedkar Nagar to Moolchand. 16-hour Classified Traffic Volume data was collected on this corridor covering the six major intersections namely, Ambedkar Nagar, Sheikh Sarai, Press Enclave, Chirag Delhi, Siri Fort and G K-I Intersection. Speed and delay data was collected using GPS based Velocity-Box (V-Box) apparatus for bus and car modes. Signal time and signal phasing data collected at above mentioned intersections was collected to simulate the real traffic movement on the study corridor. Furthermore, other road dimensional parameters such as number of lanes, location of bottle necks, width of bus lanes and mixed vehicle lanes, and location of bus stops was collected. In the present study, a quantitative performance approach using micro-simulation technique has been formulated aimed to evaluating the open system BRT corridor functioning in Delhi. Delhi BRT corridor is currently operational for a length of 5.8 km from Ambedkar Nagar to Moolchand. 16-hour Classified Traffic Volume data was collected on this corridor covering the six major intersections namely, Ambedkar Nagar, Sheikh Sarai, Press Enclave, Chirag Delhi, Siri Fort and G K-I Intersection. Speed and delay data was collected using GPS based Velocity-Box (V-Box) apparatus for bus and car modes. Signal time and signal phasing data collected at above mentioned intersections was collected to simulate the real traffic movement on the study corridor. Furthermore, other road dimensional parameters such as number of lanes, location of bottle necks, width of bus lanes and mixed vehicle lanes, and location of bus stops was collected. A base network of the BRT corridor has been created in VISSIM simulation software and the morning traffic volume data spread over from 8: 00 AM to 11: 00 AM has been considered for simulation. The model parameters have been calibrated for a trap length of 50 meters by comparing the simulated results with the observed field data such as traffic volume and traffic speeds. Since the random seed value inputted during VISSIM largely governs the realization of the stochastic quantities in VISSIM which includes the generation of simulated traffic flows during the simulation process as well as the traffic parameters, it was inferred during this study an average of seven runs (using varying random seed values) is essentially required to arrive at values closer to the observed traffic flows (Gautam Raj, 2013). Subsequently, the model has been validated for the entire corridor which also encompassed establishing statistical significance by using GEH statistics. The GEH is a widely used statistics for comparing the modelled values and observed values evolved through simulation tools. After validation, the developed model has been deployed to evaluate the performance of the BRT corridor by considering evaluation parameters such as travel time and speed. Average speed of the vehicles obtained from VISSIM are compared with the average speed of vehicles (Car and Bus) observed on BRT corridor through speed and delay studies. Based on the results derived in this paper, it can be concluded that the micro simulation based technique is the most suited approach to evaluate the performance of BRT corridor for the Indian cities.

However, the traditional analytical algorithmcan not be applied in actual traffic widely. A novel dynamic two-direction green wave coordinate control strategy was proposed to overcome the problem. By combining the genetic BP neural network with the traditional analytical algorithm, the urban traffic of two-direction was controlled coordinately online Finally, an actual example was presented. It shows that not only the green wave bandwidth, the phase-difference of each intersection and the critical cycle of trunk road were optimized according to real-time traffic flow, but also our algorithm can be used in different traffic condition by adjusting the parameters of the model.

Car-following behavior, which describes the behavior of a vehicle while following the evidence in front of it, has a significant impact on traffic safety. One of the most possible behavior leading to rear-end collisions is studied in this paper. In addition, car-following is one of the essential components of microscopic traffic models. In this paper, we estimate the emergency braking distance of passenger vehicles with respect to the following interval that should be kept as a "gap" between two consecutive vehicles moving in the same lane. Lane-changing behavior which describes a vehicle changes its lane into the other lane according to the accurate gap-acceptance decisions theory. Lane-changing related to collisions prone to occur in the process of lane-changing maneuvers. Lane-changing theoretical models and operational risk are studied in this paper to reveal the essence of traffic flow characteristics of the multi-lane freeway at the microscopic level. In summary, the paper presents a flexible framework for modeling car-following behavior and lane-changing behavior, which relaxes some constraints and assumptions of the most commonly used car following models and lane-changing models.

By dividing the vehicles with different destinations into different lanes, this approach offers an effective way to reduce the "friction" of lane-changing maneuvers and relieve impacts of congestion of the through traffic in freeway. Introduction of the preliminary configuration and principal components associated with the proposed lane assignments approach contribute to the core of this research. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, this study conducts sufficient simulation experiments based on a freeway simulator calibrated with real-world weaving section data. The results show that under heavily congested traffic conditions this system can perform better than traditional one considering the weaving section throughput, the average vehicle delay, queue length on freeway and on ramp, the interference with freeway, and the stability of weaving section. This paper also investigates factors related to critical traffic flow that may affect the performance of such a system. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The prediction results of these models are non-dynamic and can only be used to render the static noise maps. This paper performs the dynamic simulation of road traffic noise by integrating traffic micro-simulation technology, noise emission and propagation calculation, and accomplishes the dynamic rendering of traffic noise distribution based on Paramics platform. By designing and developing Paramics plug-ins, the dynamic traffic noise map is generated by real-time rendering of the spatial and temporal noise distribution data through the traffic simulation. High validation is indicated from the study case of Zhujiang New Town in Guangzhou. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the paper is to construct a deployment model for urban guide signs. In this study, a model for guide sign is proposed first. It describes the road network and guiding information sufficiently to support the deployment model development. Then, based on the relationship between guide signs and road network topology, guiding information is classified into 2 categories: connection signs and direction signs. The deployment model and its algorithm for guide sign are proposed based on engineering experiential principles. Finally, the guide sign model is applied to Guangzhou Higher Education Mega Center, and the results show that our deployment model is feasible and could contribute to realizing the intelligent management of guide signs.

The operational efficiency of bus lane is related to many factors, among which the form of roadside access traffic is of greater influence. This paper introduces two existing typical forms of access traffic, and uses the VISSIM simulation method to analyze the changing delay of bus flow, main road flow, and access point traffic flow in the different organization forms of access traffic. The appropriate values of the distance between entering points at basic traffic volume are recommended. Further comparative analysis of the delay changing trend is made under different bus flow and access point traffic flow, from which the application of recommended values can be easy seen. The results indicate that the shorter distance between entering points is better for the bus priority meanwhile brings less negative impacts on the social traffic. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Firstly, the ID algorithm of the decision tree was introduced, and accident delay time was solved by using information gain value. Then, according to the Traffic Flow Wave Theory, we determine the congestion dissipation time. Secondly, taking accident delay time as observation period, the maximum vehicle volume through the accident roads was considered as its capacity. Finally, it was simulated and calculated by VISSIM. The results show that, the accident delay time of vehicle anchor and the crowded dissipation time are the minimum, but the residual capacity of the accident roads was the maximum, the portion was 69.926%; the accident delay time of vehicle collision and the crowded dissipation time were the maximum, but the residual capacity of the accident roads was the minimum, the proportion was 49.963%; the residual capacity proportion attic vehicle roll-over, fire and rear-end were 56.87% 61.61%, 59.796% respectively.

Regarding the real-time traffic congestions, a variable speed limit (VSL) control system along freeway is able to improve the capacity of the downstream bottleneck. To respond to this need, this study firstly proposed a VSL control model, based on a macroscopic traffic flow model. Due to the inaccurate prediction of the macroscopic model, an enhanced module is further introduced, adopting the concept of Kalman Filter. Also, considering the fact that drivers may not follow the displayed VSL in real-world applications, the computed optimal VSL value would be adjusted according to the detected compliance rate. Our extensive simulation analysis with a VISSIM simulator has revealed the benefits of the proposed VSL control model, compared with the case without VSL. Also the results indicated that the compliance rate of drivers can served as a important factor which may impact the operational efficiency of the VSL system. (C) 2013 The Authors.

It's difficult to extract traffic data using surveillance cameras because of the wider field, panning and zooming of the surveillance cameras. To leverage the existing surveillance camera infrastructure, a surveillance video based traffic state detection system is proposed. The proposed system can estimate traffic flow speed and road space occupancy, and recognize three typical traffic states (congested, slow, and smooth). Experimental results show that the system had good adaptation and high accuracy in daytime. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We first propose a simulation model of UTNs, where the topology of road network is represented by a directed dynamic graph, and the transfer of underlying traffic flows is modeled by the cell transmission model (CTM). Furthermore, under some assumptions, we can obtain a signal control model of UTNs, which is a discrete-time linear time-invariant control system, and then design a state-feedback control law, under which the proposed control system can realize asymptotic stable consensus. At last, we illustrate basic ideas of our methods by an example. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In reality, capacities vary according to external conditions such as dry or wet road surfaces, daylight or darkness, and to the prevailing travel purpose of drivers on the freeway. Even under constant external conditions different capacities can be observed on freeways because of variations in driver behaviors. A capacity in this sense is no longer a constant value. Empirical analyses of traffic flow patterns show that this type of capacity can be treated as Weibull distributed. Using the distribution function of capacities, the probability of traffic breakdowns and thus the reliability of the freeway can be estimated. Up to now stochastic capacities have been mainly analyzed at specific points which are considered as bottlenecks. The stochastic relationship between the adjacent bottlenecks has not been taken into account. Furthermore, if a long segment of a freeway without clearly defined bottlenecks is analyzed, no methods are available for estimating the distributed capacities of several combined bottlenecks along a freeway. This paper introduces a concept dealing with the stochastic interpretation of capacity and breakdown probability within a larger freeway network. The stochastic methodology presented delivers a theoretical average capacity and the probability of breakdowns for freeway segments with different lengths. The methodology can also be used to identify the effects of consecutive freeway segments and bottlenecks such as on-ramps, off-ramps, and weaving areas with different characteristics. Using the proposed method, it is possible to determine the probability distribution function of breaking down from free flow into congested flow for a freeway segment as a function of the average volume or density. Using the methodology presented in this paper, the risk of disturbance of traffic flow along a freeway segment or within a freeway network can be analyzed. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Traffic jams often happen at entrance. The characteristics of urban expressway entrance and the advantages of the microscopic traffic simulation were combined to analyze capacity of entrance. VISSIM simulation software was used and the validity of the simulation model was verified. The influence of the main road traffic flow and the desired speed of entrance to flow and speed of the urban expressway entrance were analyzed through simulation experiment. On the whole, traffic capacity of urban expressway entrance reduces with the increase of traffic flow on the main road. The higher the desired speed is, the faster traffic capacity reduces. The increase of speed and control of main road traffic flow is of great significance for improving the capacity and service level of expressway.

The model not only simulated the interaction between vehicles, but also reproduced nonlinear phenomena which tallies with real traffic such as the synchronism flow and the metastable state. The time-space diagram of new model shows a gray synchronous band zone rather than that black blocking band zone. The range of synchronization is smaller when P-s is bigger, urging has less function, congestion area is wider. Comparing with SDNS model, with the proposed model in this paper, when emerging congestion, the combined action of urging and safe deceleration enabled system self-adjustment so that efficiently mitigated congestion.

Besides, the simulation system is realized on the basis of this model and the object-oriented design. This system is implemented in the integrated development environment Eclipse3.2 for Java, and basically has the functions of the animation simulation of traffic flow, real-time rendering of the traffic volume and delay time curves, dynamic display of the numbers of vehicles in the different lanes, the simulation of traffic control, data statistics and report form printing. The correctness of the model algorithm software and the validity of the function of this simulation software have been initially confirmed through the simulation examples. Not only that, we can analyze the real-time traffic conditions via the simulation outputs and before putting the new traffic management scheme into effect and changing the road infrastructure, this simulation system can also be used to analyze and evaluate the new scheme. Besides, higher efficiency can be gained, with more waste avoided.

Technological constraints must be the basis for any management strategy. If communication has been analytically proved to help stabilize traffic flow at a microscopic level, then realistic communication strategies should be evaluated by taking into consideration multiple perturbations such as sensor faults and driver cooperation. In this study, a three-layer multiagent framework was used to model and control the homogenization of traffic flow. The physical layer coordinated vehicle dynamics on the basis of a cooperative car-following model. This layer included cooperation derived from the communication and trust layers that, respectively, managed information and its reliability. Simulation results highlight the positive impacts of communication and control on the stability of traffic flow.

J	Mahmassani, HS; Hou, T; Saberi, M				Mahmassani, Hani S.; Hou, Tian; Saberi, Meead			Connecting Networkwide Travel Time Reliability and the Network Fundamental Diagram of Traffic Flow	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; URBAN; MODEL	The existence of the network fundamental diagram (NFD) has been established at the urban network scale. It relates three traffic descriptors: speed, density, and flow. However, its deterministic nature does not convey the underlying variability within the network. In contrast, travel time reliability as a network performance descriptor is of growing concern to both the traveling public and traffic managers and policy makers. The objectives of this paper were to extend travel time reliability modeling from the link path level to the network level and to connect overall network variability to NFD. Robust relationships between travel time variability and network density and flow rate were analytically derived, investigated, and validated with both simulated and real-world trajectory data. The distance-weighted standard deviation of travel time rate, as a measure of travel time variability, was found to increase monotonically with network density. A maximum network flow rate existed beyond which network travel time reliability deteriorated at a much faster pace. The results also suggest that these relationships are inherent network properties (signature) that are independent of demand level. The effects of en route information on the proposed relationships were also studied. The results showed that en route information reduced network travel time variability. The findings provide a strong connection between NFD and travel time variability, and this connection can be used further for modeling of network travel time reliability and assessment of measures intended to improve reliability of travel in a network.

Successful application of weather-sensitive TrEPS requires detailed calibration of weather effects on the traffic flow model. In this study, systematic procedures for the entire calibration process were developed, from data collection through model parameter estimation to model validation. After the development of the procedures, a dual-regime modified Greenshields model and weather adjustment factors were calibrated for four metropolitan areas across the United States (Irvine, California; Chicago, Illinois; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Baltimore, Maryland) by using freeway loop detector traffic data and weather data from automated surface-observing systems stations. Observations showed that visibility and precipitation (rain snow) intensity have significant impacts on the value of some parameters of the traffic flow models, such as free-flow speed and maximum flow rate, while these impacts can be included in weather adjustment factors. The calibrated models were used as input in a weather-integrated simulation system for dynamic traffic assignment. The results show that the calibrated models are capable of capturing the weather effects on traffic flow more realistically than TrEPS without weather integration.

J	Gan, QJ; Jin, WL				Gan, Qi-Jian; Jin, Wen-Long			Validation of a Macroscopic Lane-Changing Model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							SIMULATION	Systematic lane changes inside a weaving area could lead to accidents and disrupt the entire traffic flow. Recently, a simple macroscopic lane-changing model that determines the number of lane changes from on-ramp flows and the number of lanes was proposed to describe traffic dynamics inside the lane-changing area at a merging section. However, this macroscopic lane-changing model had not been validated with vehicle trajectory data. This study attempted to fill that validation gap. First, lane changes were categorized into two types: left-lane changes and right. lane changes. Then the following two hypotheses derived from the macroscopic lane-changing model were validated: (a) the number of left-lane changes within two adjacent lanes linearly increases from the leftmost lane to the shoulder lane and (b) the number of left-lane changes linearly increases with the flow rate of on-ramp vehicles inside the lane-changing area. Traffic balance among lanes was analyzed, and the two proposed hypotheses were validated for different periods and road geometries by using NGSIM vehicle trajectory data. The validation results confirm that the two linear relationships in the macroscopic lane-changing model exist.

This study developed an innovative traffic flow model for signalized arterials that considered the impact of signal controls. The proposed traffic flow model was then combined with a particle-filtering technique to integrate the field measurements. A comprehensive numerical investigation with a real world data set showed that the proposed model could produce reliable estimates of link density, speed, and queue length at intersections with an acceptable degree of accuracy.

In another aspect, the realtime vehicle routing services from customers, such as information pushing and travel time forecasting, are more demanding. Aimed at easing the traffic congestion pressure and improving the quality of transportation services, this paper presents the idea of decentralized vehicle routing service system (DVRSS), in the principle of TCP/IP approaches. With the cloud computing architecture, our system adopts the MapReduce method in Hadoop to fulfill the task assignments in parallel, uses ZooKeeper technology to establish the coordination system between subtask processors, and applies Kalman filter algorithm to conduct traffic flow prediction in short term. In this way, DVRSS is able to provide vehicle routing services in realtime, achieve more effective communications, and provide effective route recommendations, accurate travel time prediction, and versatile push notification services.

J	Ahmed, U; Drakopoulos, A; Ng, M				Ahmed, Umama; Drakopoulos, Alexander; Ng, ManWo			Impact of Heavy Vehicles on Freeway Operating Characteristics Under Congested Conditions	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							PASSENGER CAR EQUIVALENTS; SECTIONS	The significant impact of heavy vehicles (HVs) on freeway operations has been identified since the first edition of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). The HCM 2010 used passenger car equivalent (PCE) values and percentages of trucks, buses, and recreational vehicles to account for the effect of HVs on roadway performance. Unfortunately, the PCE values in the HCM 2010 relied on a limited field database and simulation runs that were calibrated for steady-flow traffic conditions, although the effect of HVs on traffic flow could reasonably have been expected to have varied with traffic conditions. Few studies have been conducted with extensive field data to examine impacts on traffic characteristics by HV presence under congested and forced-flow conditions. This paper presents such an effort by using urban freeway data containing 1.2 million individual vehicle observations. The results indicated a significant difference in lagging leading behavior between vehicle pairs related to HV presence. Passenger car and HV headways were found to increase with HV presence in the traffic stream. A similar pattern was found for the PCE factor. The PCE value under congested conditions and more than 9% HV presence was found to be 1.76, which was higher than the 1.5 value recommended by the HCM 2010 for level freeway sections. The maximum throughput of the freeway was found to be affected by HV presence. The maximum throughput was observed at a truck presence of 3%, after which it became progressively lower. The results of this paper can be used as input for future simulation runs of congested freeway flow conditions.

However, detailed studies on large truck crashes that highlight the contributing factors leading to injury severity have not been conducted in Texas, especially for its Interstate system. The contributing factors related to injury severity were analyzed with Texas crash data based on a discrete outcome-based model that accounts for possible unobserved heterogeneity related to human, vehicle, and road environment factors. A random parameter logit (i.e., mixed logit) model was estimated to predict the likelihood of five standard injury severity scales commonly used in the Crash Records Information System in Texas: fatal, incapacitating, nonincapacitating, possible, and none (i.e., property damage only). Estimation results indicated that the level of injury severity outcomes was highly influenced by several complex interactions between factors and that the effects of some factors could vary across observations. The contributing factors include driver demographics, traffic flow, roadway geometric features, land use, time characteristics, weather, and lighting conditions.

Real-time information feedback can improve traffic flow with existing facilities. This paper proposes a real-time information feedback strategy named improved mean number feedback strategy. Based on a two-route scenario, simulation results show that the strategy is much more effective in different length of roads or in different percentage of dynamic vehicles than the old strategies, i.e., congestion coefficient feedback strategy and mean velocity feedback strategy.

The proposed controller has a feedforward-feedback control structure that is designed for a motorway arterial model. For the feedback design the nonlinear model predictive control is used. The feedforward control is utilized to enhance the operability of the control system to high disturbances. Two different controllers are designed: while controller A uses continuous VSL signs, VSL input values of controller B is chosen from a discrete set. For the latter, a two-step optimization is used to decrease oscillations. The designed controllers are tested in a case study, in which a total traffic breakdown situation is modeled. In the uncontrolled case, the initial perturbation leads to a traffic jam with zero traffic speed, whereas the proposed control design is capable of preventing the congestion.

The traffic in urban agglomerations is optimised mainly for two groups of users: (1) individual traffic and (2) public transport. Creation of successful management means to integrate and to optimise the quality of transport. When intersection signal control is used, not only the high degree of safety is ensured, but also permeability of the intersection increases. But when there are several signal controlled intersections on the one route, the control of the intersections can act like a brake of the traffic flow. For better and more effective use of the network the coordinated road traffic control and the higher intelligent control of the intersections (central traffic control) is used. In this paper we would like to evaluate on the basis of microscopic simulation the coordination of the signal controlled intersections in the city of Zilina. For the simulation the Aimsun is used.

The study is based on the data from two video detectors located at the ends of a transit road in the city of Gliwice. The data were recorded 24 h/day for a period of one year. Neural networks (NN) were used in the prediction models. The effects, of the size of a time window and the length of selected data registration, on the learning rate of the nets and on the quality of prediction were studied. Tests were performed using three classes of time series corresponding to: working days, Saturdays and Sundays. The aim of the study was to elaborate an accurate short-term predicting method, which can be used in traffic control systems especially incorporated into modules of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).

Variables including traffic flow, vehicles' speed, relative humidity, the length and width of the segments of the roads, the average height of the buildings located around the road and the slope of the segments of roads were considered. Also, the vehicle horn noise as a predictor variable was included in the models. The results reveal that LAF(max) (1h) values are considerably higher than LA(eq) (1h) values. It is concluded that the vehicle horn noise may be responsible for the considerable difference between LA(eq) (1h) values and LAF(max) (1h) values.

This result can be of great importance to unveil simple perimeter control policies in such a way that maximizes the network outflow (trip endings). Single-region perimeter control might be sub-optimal if there is a significant number of destinations outside the region of analysis or if the network is heterogeneously loaded. This paper integrates an MFD modeling to perimeter and boundary control optimization for large-scale networks with multiple centers of congestion, if these networks can be partitioned into a small number of homogeneous regions. Perimeter control actions may be computed in real-time through a linear multivariable feedback regulator. The impact of the perimeter control actions to a three-region real urban network is demonstrated via micro-simulation. A key advantage of the proposed approach is that it does not require high computational effort and future demand data if the current state of each region can be observed.

A derivation of the mathematical model of control by the traffic lights at intersections is given. The mathematical model of control object is obtained using the controlled networks theory. This model is a system of nonlinear finite-difference equations. To present a large scale road networks the model contains the connection matrices. The connection matrices describe connections between input and output roads in subnetworks. These matrices allow considering the influence of traffic flows in one subnetwork the ones in other subnetwork. The traffic flow control is done by the coordination of active phases of traffic lights. The optimal control problem is to minimize the difference between the total input flow and total output flow for all subnetworks. To solve the optimal control synthesis problem we use a logical network operator method. An example of model for the network of three subnetworks is given.	[Diveev, A.

In order to avoid the highway traffic jams and decline of traffic efficiency, this article studied highway tollgate queuing discipline, which is one of the main contributing factors, aiming to reduce waiting time and reduce traffic jams. Based on the study of arrival rate of vehicles during peak hours and normal time, waiting time, queue length and the average efficiency of the service for each tollgate, a reasonable and feasible mathematical model is proposed. In this model, the vehicle arrival data obeys the Poisson distribution and transformed service time obeys the exponential distribution. Related data was given and the hypothesis test was conduced. By comparing rules before and after the establishment of the highway queuing model, the author offered suggestions on highway construction.

J	Rachtan, P; Huang, H; Gao, S				Rachtan, Piotr; Huang, He; Gao, Song			Spatiotemporal Link Speed Correlations Empirical Study	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							CORRELATION-COEFFICIENT; PREDICTION	Traffic variables are known to be correlated over time and space as a result of traffic flow propagation. However, the correlation pattern is still largely unknown, and most of the research in short-term travel time prediction, demand forecasting, and network modeling either ignores or assumes correlation. In this paper the patterns of spatial and temporal correlations of average point speeds in a freeway setting were investigated. Five-minute speed aggregates were obtained for two directions of an urban freeway along a 12-mi segment in Los Angeles, California. Other variables included traffic flow, ramp locations, number of lanes, and level of congestion at detector stations. Weighted least squares multivariate linear regression models were fitted to the data from three different times of day (morning, midday, and afternoon) along a shorter, 6.5-mi stretch of the I-10 eastbound freeway. Estimated regression models indicated that an increase in spatial or temporal distance or both reduced the expected value of Fisher Z (transformed correlation). The positive parameters of spatial and temporal distance interaction terms showed that the reduction rate diminished with spatial or temporal distance. Higher congestion tended to preserve higher correlation; variations in road geometry carried relatively small corrections to the models. Models were cross validated on two locations: the remaining 5.5-mi stretch of I-10 eastbound and the 6.3-mi segment of I-10 westbound. Cross validation results showed that the models retained 75% or more of their original predictive capability when applied to independent samples. The developed regression models are thus transferable and are apt to predict correlation on other freeway locations.

J	Rudloff, C; Schonauer, R; Fellendorf, M				Rudloff, Christian; Schoenauer, Robert; Fellendorf, Martin			Comparing Calibrated Shared Space Simulation Model with Real-Life Data	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							DYNAMICS	Shared spaces are being implemented in many countries to deal with safety concerns and traffic flow problems on busy urban streets and street crossings. However, shared space concepts could not be tested before they were built because of the lack of a functioning microscopic shared space simulation. Lane-based car-following models, currently used in traffic simulation, cannot reproduce the high heterogeneity of a mixed traffic mode's nonchannelized flow. This paper's novel approach introduces an extended social force model for vehicles and pedestrians that incorporates social interactions between different modes of transport rather than following a purely rule-based approach. The calibration of such a microscopic traffic simulation model with real-world data from two shared space sites is presented. The simulation can reproduce real-life shared space behavior by comparing it with trajectory and interaction data collected at implemented shared space road designs.

In oversaturated conditions, left turns at intersections not only are blocked by the oversaturated through traffic in the same direction but can also be blocked by spillback into the intersection from the through traffic in the opposite direction. This research developed and tested a new model, proposed as the conditional cell transmission model (CCTM). This model allows for the possibility of the formation of an additional cell in an intersection to account for any vehicles that may be caught there for some amount of time and incur delay that may potentially cause delay to conflicting movements. The results of experiments demonstrated that (a) the CCTM could accommodate various traffic demands properly and accurately represent left-turn blockages at intersections, (b) the CCTM had the ability to simulate left-turn blockages within an area inside an intersection, and (c) the CCTM uniquely allowed users to input the probability of a conditional cell and the probability of the occurrence of a useful gap to match the behavior of local drivers. The third feature is a unique contribution of the CCTM. Finally, the consistency between Highway Capacity Manual procedures and the CCTM shows that the CCTM is a reliable methodology with which to model traffic flow in oversaturated conditions.

J	Moghaddam, SS; Hellinga, B				Moghaddam, Soroush Salek; Hellinga, Bruce			Quantifying Measurement Error in Arterial Travel Times Measured by Bluetooth Detectors	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							LICENSE-PLATE DATA	Travel time is viewed by travelers and road managers as one of the key indicators of quality of service. Bluetooth detectors have recently emerged as a viable technology for the acquisition of vehicle travel times. Several studies have described the application of the technology to freeways and compared the measured travel times with the travel times obtained through other technologies. This paper examines the application of Bluetooth detectors to the acquisition of arterial travel times. The arterial environment is substantially more challenging than the freeway environment because of the frequent interruptions in the traffic flow caused by traffic signals. This paper examines the magnitude of errors in detection time and travel time measurement. It is not feasible to use field data to examine the measurement error because the error is inherent within the observations and cannot be separated. Consequently, a simulation framework is proposed to synthesize measurement errors for a range of arterial traffic conditions. The results show that the mean travel time error is essentially zero for all traffic conditions. However, the variance of the error varies as a function of the traffic conditions. Through multiple regression, the standard deviation of the travel time measurement error is modeled, and it is shown that under some conditions, the 95% confidence interval of this error may reach 25% of the true mean travel time. These results can be used to assess Bluetooth detector deployment plans and provide more insight into the reliability of arterial travel time measurements obtained from Bluetooth detectors.

The reliability analysis approach, frequently used to evaluate the probability of failure of a specific structural system, has two main outcomes: the reliability index and the design points. Two approaches to using these two outcomes in traffic safety analyses are presented. Data from a mountainous freeway in Colorado are used. The reliability index is used to evaluate the hazardous freeway segments by incorporating the traffic flow parameters provided by radar detectors. The design points are employed to evaluate real-time crash occurrence risk at the disaggregate level with weather parameters. Finally, results of the reliability analysis approach are compared with the results of traditional methods. The reliability analysis method shows promising application in traffic safety studies. With the use of the reliability indexes, the three most hazardous freeway segments are identified. Moreover, with the design points, the accuracy rate of predicting crash occurrence is improved by 10.53% as compared with the logistic regression method.

J	Shelton, J; Valdez, GA; Sanchez, G; Leos, G				Shelton, Jeffrey; Valdez, Gabriel A.; Sanchez, Gus; Leos, Gerardo			Multiresolution Visualization Tools to Aid in Conducting Road Safety Audits	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Typical road safety audits use site investigations in addition to historical data to make recommendations. Recent approaches have used simulation modeling to derive surrogate measures to analyze the potential for collisions, driving simulators to analyze human behavior, or other visualization tools to analyze geometric design characteristics. None of these tools can capture the dynamics of proposed changes that subsequently alter traffic patterns. Each proposed improvement has an influence on traffic patterns and must be captured at a regional level to determine whether vehicles choose the same path or defer to an alternative one. This study explored new methods to supplement the Road Safety Audit process. The study used visualization tools to assess the performance of each proposed improvement strategy by conducting a more thorough comprehensive safety study with multiresolution modeling methods in situations when suggested countermeasures would almost certainly redistribute traffic to alternative routes. A case study was selected in which an audit team performed a safety audit of a diamond interchange in El Paso, Texas, that experienced a high number of collisions during peak hours. The visualization of the proposed improvement scenarios helped the Texas Department of Transportation understand better how mitigation strategies would influence traffic flow in and around the study area or whether the proposed changes improved safety or merely shifted the problem to alternative locations. The use of visualization tools can help convey proposed improvements to the public.

J	Sinha, R; Roop, PS; Ranjitkar, P				Sinha, Roopak; Roop, Partha S.; Ranjitkar, Prakash			Virtual Traffic Lights plus A Robust, Practical, and Functionally Safe Intelligent Transportation System	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								The latest advancements in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) increasingly rely on wireless vehicle-to-vehicle (VTV) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (VTI) communications to manage traffic flows at intersections dynamically. A prominent example is virtual traffic lights (VTLs), which use only VTV communications and which have been shown to have the potential to increase traffic flows and reduce emissions significantly. Two key issues that can affect the adoption of desirable ITS solutions like VTLs are functional safety and the management of a move from a vehicle fleet not equipped with VTLs to a vehicle fleet completely equipped with VTLs. For the first issue, the first model-driven engineering-based modeling and verification technique for ITSs is proposed. This technique can be used to prove functional safety with 100% coverage. Through the use of this technique, it is shown that although VTLs are safe under normal circumstances, they are very fragile when they face unlikely, but not impossible, exceptional circumstances. For the second issue, an extended algorithm called VTL+ is proposed. VTL+ uses additional VTI communication with the existing infrastructure to enable effective and safe traffic flow during the VTL transition phase. It is also found through static analysis that VTL+ is more robust and more feature rich than VTLs.

Enhancing Roundabout Operations via Vehicle Connectivity	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							MODELING TRAFFIC FLOW	With in-vehicle automation and vehicle connectivity gaining momentum, cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) systems are expected to enter the market in the near future. Given that the number of round-abouts in the United States has increased significantly, this research effort investigated the potential benefits of the use of CACC systems and vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity to optimize the trajectories of vehicles approaching a single-lane roundabout. The optimization ensures that vehicles can enter the roundabout when gaps in the circulating roadway are available. The proposed idea is generally similar to the concept of metering single-lane entrance ramps. The system is simulated on a single-lane roundabout for different traffic demands and CACC market penetration levels. The study demonstrates that CACC systems can produce savings in total delay and fuel consumption levels of up to 80% and 40%, respectively, relative to the levels for traditional roundabout control. Further benefits are also achievable if one considers the potential to reduce the time headway between CACC-equipped vehicles and thus increase lane capacity.

Michael			Bidirectional Control Characteristics of General Motors and Optimal Velocity Car-Following Models Implications for Coordinated Driving in a Connected Vehicle Environment	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							TRAFFIC FLOW; DYNAMICS	In natural traffic flow, the information from preceding vehicles predominantly determines driver behavior. With connected vehicle technologies, drivers can receive information from both preceding and following vehicles. This information creates new opportunities for vehicle coordination and control at the microscopic level on the basis of bidirectional information. Although bidirectional car-following models have been studied since the 1960s, most existing car-following models, especially those used by adaptive cruise control technologies, are still forward-only car-following models. This paper serves as a first step toward the use of bidirectional car-following models for microscopic vehicle coordination and control. The focus is on the study of the models' general control characteristics and impact on traffic flow stability. A general bidirectional control framework is proposed to convert any car-following model into its bidirectional form. Four representative General Motors and optimal velocity car-following models are reformulated and calibrated against field vehicle trajectory data collected in the next-generation simulation program (NGSIM). The bidirectional control characteristics of the selected models were evaluated by tuning of the percentage of backward information considered in the final car-following decision. The evaluation uses forward versus backward acceleration diagrams and a ring road stability analysis of equilibrium states obtained from NGSIM data. The results indicate that the increase in the contribution of backward information may help alleviate traffic congestion and stabilize traffic flow. An operating range of the backward information contribution of between 5% and 20% is recommended to ensure that the resulting models are still physical and realistic for both free-flow and congestion situations.

In this context, field measurements at the related highway intersection have been obtained from highway authority in order to determine the pattern of the traffic, which fluctuates all day long. The most important output of the study is to test the ALINEA control mechanism, which may smooth the traffic flow on O-2. The algorithm has been implemented in PTV VISSIM microscopic traffic simulation environment. Obtained results have shown that even a standalone dynamic ramp metering process can be alleviated the traffic congestion on an urban highway sufficiently.

Accurate traffic prediction is one of the critical steps in the operation of an ITS. While techniques for traffic prediction have existed for many years, the research effort has mainly been focused on highway networks. Due to the fundamental difference between the traffic flow pattern on highways and that on city roads, much of the existing models cannot be effectively applied to city traffic prediction. In this paper, we propose two city traffic prediction models using different modeling approaches. Model-1 is based on the traffic flow propagation in the network, while Model-2 is based on the time-varied spare flow capacity on the concerned road link. The proposed models are implemented to predict the traffic volume in Cologne in Germany, and the real data are collected through simulations in the traffic simulator SUMO. The results show that both of the proposed models reduce the prediction error up to 52% and 30% in the best cases compared to the existing Shift Model. In addition, we found that Model-1 is suitable for short prediction interval that is in the same magnitude as the link travel time, while Model-2 demonstrates superiority when the prediction interval is larger than one minute.

However, these models cannot accurately capture the number of empty trips that result as a consequence of the movement of these commodities. Previous research has proposed a number of methodologies to incorporate empty trips as a function of loaded trips and some assumptions about the trip chains. Parameters in these models are calibrated with extensive origin destination surveys. However, freight transportation data are usually scarce or not available in proper form for use in models. This paper presents a novel methodology to estimate the number of empty trips on the basis of a time-expanded network flow approach that captures the behavioral and operational characteristics of the carriers. The model was formulated as a linear optimization problem that minimized the system costs associated with truck trips. The model was validated with a commercial vehicle survey from Colombia. The results showed that under some operational assumptions, the model appropriately represented the amount of empty vehicle hours in a freight transportation network.

An Analytical Approach for Assessing Conflicts	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Public transport is a very efficient way to handle large traffic flows in urban areas. At the same time, and especially in Europe, nonmotorized transport is being promoted as a further environmentally friendly and healthful way of urban mobility. This push includes the introduction and extension of separate lanes to increase safety and convenience of bikers and pedestrians. However, most cities have limited space for expanding streets and roads, and this limitation can lead to a conflict over the different uses. A clear understanding of the impacts of these changes on public transport is critical. A quick assessment model was developed to analyze the impact of changes to roadway design and policy that can affect public transport services. The model was developed to help public transport operator Verkehrsbetriebe Zurich in Zurich, Switzerland, assess changes quickly; these changes included the elimination of separate rights-of-way or the introduction of slow zones. The model will also help to explain the impacts of these changes to nontechnical audiences. The model uses a series of analytical calculations to analyze the main relationships between key public transport inputs and outputs. The model was validated with data from Zurich's tram and bus network. The case studies examined the influence of the reduction of separate rights-of-way, the expansion of 30 km/h zones, and the changes to stop distances on public transport operations.

SMM is derived from the Cell Transmission Model and then applied to the reconstruction of the traffic density, considered as state variable. As the SMM is a hybrid system which switches depending on the traffic conditions along the freeway, the paper shows how, the proposed estimation method takes into account such different modes. Several numerical simulation with different data demonstrate the relevance of the proposed algorithm.

The fatigue damage was calculated with the maximum horizontal tensile strain of asphalt layer bottom based on the fatigue fracture mechanics, when single axis went across. Then the fatigue life was obtained after the fatigue damage occurred in some degree by the Miner's linear cumulative damage rule. The results show that it taken 3.4 years when the damage area reached 10% of wheel path area, and 4.5years when reached 45%; while the calculated result was 5.5 years by axial-load conversion method. The analysis shows that the fatigue life of asphalt pavement calculated by fatigue fracture mechanics rule has more significance in practice.

The exhibition and mechanic of the influence between different vehicle types vary under different traffic flow and heavy vehicle proportion. In this paper, field survey was carried out and the characteristic of Chinese mixed traffic was gotten. Based on the phenomenon observed in the field survey, models were built to analysis the mechanic of the influence between different vehicle types. The influence states were divided into four aspects according to different exhibition and mechanic, that is: free flow condition, independent heavy vehicle impact, heavy vehicles and cars in different lane, drive in disorder. The influence states will transfer with the temporary variation of traffic flow composition. It is result from the self-organizing behavior of vehicles which pursue higher speed and brings dynamic change of capacity and level of service in time and space.

First, a macroscopic traffic flow model is established. Then the basic principles of an ant colony algorithm are formulated and the steps of ACO algorithm in optimizing the PI parameters are given. In conjunction with nonlinear feedback theory, on-ramp PI controllers optimized by the ant colony algorithm are designed. Finally, the control method is simulated in MATLAB software. Simulation results show that the ACO based ramp metering controllers are of good performance. This control method can eliminate traffic jams, maintain traffic flow stability, and make vehicles travel more efficiently and safely.

We investigated traffic flow on a gradient with a consideration of speed difference effect analytically and numerically. Stability and instability conditions were obtained by the use of linear stability theory. Nonlinear analysis method was taken to derive the mKdV equation and its kink-antikink soliton solution was obtained near the critical point in the unstable region. Kink-antikink density waves were reproduced in the simulation with a variable slope. Results show that the slope effect plays an important role in traffic flow.

J	Fu, LN; Kulkarni, R				Fu, Lina; Kulkarni, Rakesh			Model-Based Dynamic Pricing Algorithm for Managed Lanes	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Managed lanes, or high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes, have been implemented across the United States to improve the utility of existing road facilities. The pricing algorithm in managed lanes is the critical component in ensuring that the desired level of service metrics is met. Some pricing algorithms currently in use are static algorithms, and others adopt a dynamic strategy. Static pricing algorithms do not account for the changes in real-time traffic conditions. However, dynamic pricing algorithms are reactive in nature and do not account for the potential demand for actual future time intervals for which the toll is determined. The HOT-lane system is nonlinear and complex in nature; this complexity leads to high levels of instability in such a system. The complexity has been increasing because of the growth in demand as well as incorporation of other, noninteracting strategies that are implemented to address this demand. Therefore, more sophisticated designs of the pricing algorithm are needed for HOT-lane pricing control. A model-based pricing algorithm is proposed for determining the toll rate dynamically to maximize the throughput on the HOT lanes while maintaining a desired level of service. It consists of both proactive and reactive components to achieve fast response to real-time changes and maintain a steady, maximal traffic flow. The controller structure also incorporates active bottleneck management to maintain optimal traffic flow under stressed conditions. Implementation of this controller has shown high utilization of HOT lanes while ensuring the desired level of service.

In this paper, the definition of carrying capacity of urban traffic in the macroscopic view is given. In the model, peak hour traffic flow and traffic congestion coefficient is considered. Taking Beijing traffic network as an example, we calculated urban traffic carrying capacity of Beijing from 2002 to 2012 according to relevant statistical data. Furthermore, we studied the key factors which impacts Beijing traffic carrying capacity based on multivariate analysis, and used factor analysis and nonlinear regression to capture the internal relationship between the urban traffic carrying capacity and these factors. Finally, the predicted traffic carrying capacity of Beijing in 2013 similar to 2020 is given.

The trajectory estimation is the most critical and complex part in the floating vehicle information processing system. However, the trajectory estimation would be more difficult when using the low-frequency data sampling because of the high communication cost and the numerous data. Specifically, the ordinary algorithm cannot determine the specific vehicle paths with two anchor points across multiple intersections. Considering the accuracy in map matching, this paper used a delay matching algorithm and studied the trajectory estimation algorithm focusing on the issue of existence of a small road network between two anchor points. A method considering the three multiobjective factors of signal control and driving distance and number of intersections was developed. Firstly, an optimal solution set was acquired according to multiobjective decision theory and Pareto optimal principles in game theory. Then, the optimal solution set was evaluated synthetically based on the fuzzy set theory. Finally, the candidate trajectory which is the core evaluation factor was identified as the best possible travel path. The algorithm was validated by using the real traffic data in Wangjing area of Beijing. The results showed that the algorithm can get a better trajectory estimation and provide more traffic information to traffic management department.

Deciding which ramps to close can be treated as an optimization problem in which the decision variables are integers that indicate whether the ramp is open or closed. This paper examines the problem under multiple demand and budget scenarios for no-notice evacuations. Through the optimization formulation and solution method, optimized closure plans are developed for each scenario and compared with the do-nothing case, and an existing plan is developed with professional judgment. The optimized plans outperform the others in the evacuees' total travel time but are sometimes associated with decreases in overall network throughput. Three ramp closures, consistent across the scenarios, are explored as a reduced closure plan, and evacuee benefits are identified for all of the scenarios over the do-nothing option except in the most congested background traffic scenario. However, even in the most congested case, the three-ramp closure plan improved evacuees' travel times over the plan developed without analytical and simulation support. Although the exact optimized ramp closure plan varies across scenarios and budgets, overlap of the plans can help generate a smaller closure plan that provides benefits over plans that are strictly judgment based and over the do-nothing option in less congested cases.

Alternatively to these generally accepted fundamental of traffic and transportation theory, we discuss three-phase traffic theory as the basis for traffic flow modeling as well as briefly consider the network breakdown minimization (BM) principle for the optimization of traffic and transportation networks with road bottlenecks.

The effect of green time for vehicles after the time that the button is pushed by a pedestrian is also investigated.

Network calculus is a theory based on min-plus algebra. This calculus uses algebraic techniques to compute performance bounds in communication networks, such as maximum end-to-end delays and backlogs. The objective of this paper is to investigate the application of those techniques for determining performance bounds on road networks, such as upper bounds for travel times. A traffic model is proposed for cars moving in a single-lane ring road without passing. The model is compatible with network calculus theory and permits derivation of an upper bound of the travel time of cars on the road. An approach for extending the model to calculate upper bounds for the travel times of cars on paths passing through intersections in a whole network is also proposed.

Traffic problems have attracted the interest of many researchers from the perspective of theory and engineering. In order to provide a simple and practical method for measuring the exhaust emission and assessing the effect of pollution control, a model is based on the relationship between traffic flow and vehicle exhaust emission under a certain level of road capacity constraints. In the proposed model, the hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are considered as the indexes of total exhaust emission, and the speed is used as an intermediate variable. To verify the rationality and practicality of the model, a case study for Beijing, China, is provided in which the effects of taxi fare regulation and the specific vehicle emission reduction policy are analyzed.

However, the priority it can provide to buses has not been explored fully. Therefore, this study mainly investigated two advanced control strategies (signal priority using advanced detection and transit speed control). Signal priority using advanced detection is a strategy which detects one cycle ahead of buses' arrival in order to adapt a more flexible control algorithm to provide signal priority for buses. Another is transit speed control, which provides priority at intersections for buses by controlling the speed of them and predicting their arrival at certain intersection. These two advanced strategies were modeled and evaluated using simulation software VISSIM and presented better performance than other three scenarios (base case, exclusive bus lane, and conventional transit signal priority). Only the eastbound direction would be researched as its traffic flow and bus volume are much larger than those of the other direction. Data used in this model was collected in Yingtan City. It is also shown that both the operation of BRT and the efficiency of private traffic can be much improved by applying the two strategies proposed above.

The presented paper discusses a small part of a traffic flow study - the development of the methodology for assessing the speed and acceleration of a car during the column movement following-the-leader, based on a new mathematical method. Two methods -(1) the numerical calculation of the first derivative, i.e. speed of the car movement; (2) the numerical calculation of the second derivative, i.e. acceleration of the car movement - were developed, using the fast spline transformation. In the future, parameters obtained with the help of two new methods, can be used to solve complex transportation problems, such as: (1) control of traffic flows; (2) organisation of harmonised work of traffic lights; (3) analysis of psycho-physiological condition of a driver, etc.	[Kuzhel, Nina] Natl Aviat Univ, Dept Air Transportat Management, UA-03680 Kiev, Ukraine; [Bieliatynskyi, Andrii] Natl Aviat Univ, Dept Airport Reconstruct & Automobile Roads, UA-03680 Kiev, Ukraine; [Prentkovskis, Olegas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Transport Technol Equipment, LT-10105 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Klymenko, Iryna] Natl Univ Transport, Dept Econ, UA-01010 Kiev, Ukraine; [Mikaliunas, Sarunas] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Railway Transport, LT-03224 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Kolganova, Olena] Natl Aviat Univ, Dept Informat Secur, UA-03680 Kiev, Ukraine; [Kornienko, Svitlana] Natl Aviat Univ, Dept Aviat Radioelect Complexes, UA-03680 Kiev, Ukraine; [Shutko, Volodymyr] Natl Aviat Univ, Dept Elect, UA-03680 Kiev, Ukraine	Kuzhel, N (corresponding author), Natl Aviat Univ, Dept Air Transportat Management, Kosmonavta Komarova Ave 1, UA-03680 Kiev, Ukraine.	kuzhelnina@ukr.net	Prentkovskis, Olegas/E-8269-2017; Bieliatynskyi, Andrii/D-9469-2019	Prentkovskis, Olegas/0000-0003-0910-591X; Bieliatynskyi, Andrii/0000-0002-2158-512X; Shutko, Volodymyr/0000-0002-9761-5583; Kolganova, Olena/0000-0002-1301-9611			[Anonymous], 2010, HIGHW CAP MAN; Beliatynskii A., 2010, VISNYK INZHENERNOJI, P50; Beliatynskii A., 2011, VISNYK INZHENERNOJI, P185; Beljatynskij A, 2009, TRANSPORT-VILNIUS, V24, P308, DOI 10.3846/1648-4142.2009.24.308-317; Bellouquid A, 2012, MATH MOD METH APPL S, V22, DOI 10.1142/S0218202511400033; Bonzani I, 2008, COMPUT MATH APPL, V56, P2418, DOI 10.1016/j.camwa.2008.05.033; Buslaev AP, 2012, INT J COMPUT MATH, V89, P409, DOI 10.1080/00207160.2011.611241; Chiu YC, 2010, TRANSPORT RES B-METH, V44, P152, DOI 10.1016/j.trb.2009.06.001; Coscia V, 2007, INT J NONLIN MECH, V42, P411, DOI 10.1016/j.ijnonlinmec.2006.02.008; Dubelir G, 1910, PLANIROVKA GORODOV; Dubelir G.

The existing studies for traffic estimation mainly focus on the traffic parameter, namely density (or vehicles) of mainline traffic. In this paper, Kalman filtering for simultaneous traffic counts and off-ramp flow estimation is proposed with the linearization of the speed density observation equation. The state-space model is formulated by using a Markov chain to describe the vehicles' lane-change movements. Numerical studies are carried out to investigate the performance of the developed approach.

Single-detect equipment can't meet the needs of multi-purpose and different environments. What's more, under certain conditions, the detector performance is defective, and it can't get rich and high-quality section average velocity information. The paper will try to use B-P neural network to do date fusion, to get more realistic traffic flow speed information, to provide a basis for traffic management, control, and induction measures. Taking Beijing as the research background, the expressway section average velocity of multi-source data is adopted to do data fusion in the final section of the study.

In this paper, based on the ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of the ramp system, a new PI controller is designed by utilizing more priori traffic flow information of up-stream and down-stream. Meanwhile, the fuzzy control logic is developed to tune the PI parameters in real time according to the density tracking error and error variation. The simulation study shows that a better control performance is achieved for the proposed approach compared with the traditional PI controller.

Firstly, the approach introduces the Decision Tree ID algorithm, solves the accident delay time of different accident types by the Information Gain Value, and determines congestion dissipation time by the Traffic Flow Wave Theory. Secondly, taking the accident delay time as the observation cycle, the maximum number of the vehicles through the accident road per unit time was considered as its capacity. Finally, the attenuation simulation of the capacity for different accident types was calculated by the VISSIM software. The simulation results suggest that capacity attenuation of vehicle anchor is minimal and the rate is 30.074%; the next is vehicles fire, rear-end, and roll-over, and the rate is 38.389%, 40.204%, and 43.130%, respectively; the capacity attenuation of vehicle collision is the largest, and the rate is 50.037%. Moreover, the further research shows that the accident delay time is proportional to congestion dissipation time, time difference, and the ratio between them, but it is an inverse relationship with the residual capacity of urban expressway.

Traffic congestion causes severe problems, such as environment contamination and energy dissipation. Therefore, it would be useful to analyze the congestion propagation characteristics after traffic accidents. Numerical analysis and computer simulation were two of the typical methods used at present to study the traffic congestion propagation properties. The latter was more widespread as it is more consistent with the actual traffic flow and more visual than the former. In this paper, an improved cellular automata (CA) model was presented to analyze traffic congestion propagation properties and to evaluate control strategies. In order to apply them to urban traffic flow simulation, the CA models have been improved and expanded on. Computer simulations were built for congestion not only extending to the upstream intersection, but also the upstream intersection and the entire road network, respectively. Congestion propagation characteristics after road traffic accidents were obtained, and controls of different severities and durations were analyzed. The results provide the theoretical foundation and practical means for the control of congestion.

J	Tanasic, N; Ilic, V; Hajdin, R				Tanasic, Nikola; Ilic, Vladan; Hajdin, Rade			Vulnerability Assessment of Bridges Exposed to Scour	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								To improve the allocation of funds for the maintenance and risk mitigation of transportation infrastructure, there is a dire need for a simplified, yet sufficiently accurate, methodology to estimate bridge vulnerability to scour. The methodology should make use of existing data and indicate the basic variables needed to assess the vulnerability of bridges located around a future expressway in southeastern Serbia. The first part of the paper discusses the identification of possible modes of bridge failure caused by scouring that depend on soil, structure, and river hydraulic properties. The degradation of soil parameters is assumed to be the main cause of bridge failure. The capacity of a bridge to withstand a certain amount of structural damage governs the direct and indirect costs attributable to bridge failure; the subsequent work zones related to rehabilitation reduce the performance of the whole network. In the second part of the paper, a simulation of the redistribution of traffic flows is described for several possible scenarios; the simulations use state-of-the-art software VISUM, which was developed for computer-aided transportation planning and analysis. The simulated scenarios include the partial and full closure of road links as a result of bridge failures. The simulations confirmed that the most significant contribution to indirect costs stems from the increase in the total travel time of all network users.

Conventional traffic signal with fixed or pre-defined variable cycles setting can slightly alleviate the increasing traffic problem, but cannot deal with continuously growing vehicular traffic in rapidly growing urban areas. VANET technology offers a promising solution for better vehicular traffic management in urban area to reduce traffic jam and improve transportation safety. Adaptive Traffic Light Control (ATLC) using VANET has attracted considerable attention from academic community. Unfortunately, most of these existing works used simulated traffic flow and hypothetical intersection architectures which may not reflect the reality of urban area. In this paper, we present a case study based on a specific intersection in the city of Moncton with real traffic data, and propose a new adaptive traffic light control algorithm. Our results show a substantial improvement of traffic throughput and average waiting time in comparison with fixed optimal cycle's time currently used by the city of Moncton and with existing adaptive solutions.

J	Shi, J; Tan, JH				Shi, Jing; Tan, Jinhua			Effect Analysis of Intermittent Release Measures in Heavy Fog Weather with an Improved CA Model	DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY			English	Article							CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW; VISIBILITY; HIGHWAY; SPEED	Heavy fog may easily cause traffic accidents; thus freeway closures are frequently taken in order to ensure traffic safety in China, which not only seriously affect the travel of people, but also bring great economic losses. This paper studies the fog related risk of rear-end collisions and the intermittent release measures taken to reduce such risk; meanwhile, an improved cellular automaton model considering driving behaviors in heavy fog is proposed. The simulation results indicate that the risk indicator in f(a) fog is much higher than normal weather when cellular occupancy rho < 0.5. After taking intermittent release measures, the magnitude of f(a) will drop from 10(-4) to 10(-5) under the same fog condition, which greatly enhances the safety. In addition, this paper concludes the appropriate vehicle number released for each time and the time interval h(t) between adjacent fleets and the maximum number of vehicles Q(max) which can be released per hour. These results can be used as theoretical basis and reference for the traffic management departments to develop intermittent release measures.

J	Huang, H; Tang, QF; Liu, Z				Huang, He; Tang, Qifeng; Liu, Zhen			Adaptive Correction Forecasting Approach for Urban Traffic Flow Based on Fuzzy c-Mean Clustering and Advanced Neural Network	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article							PREDICTION; SVR	Forecasting of urban traffic flow is important to intelligent transportation system (ITS) developments and implementations. The precise forecasting of traffic flow will be pretty helpful to relax road traffic congestion. The accuracy of traditional single model without correction mechanism is poor. Summarizing the existing prediction models and considering the characteristics of the traffic itself, a traffic flow prediction model based on fuzzy c-mean clustering method (FCM) and advanced neural network (NN) was proposed. FCM can improve the prediction accuracy and robustness of the model, while advanced NN can optimize the generalization ability of the model. Besides these, the output value of the model is calibrated by the correction mechanism. The experimental results show that the proposed method has better prediction accuracy and robustness than the other models.

J	Bi, J; Chang, C; Fan, Y				Bi, Jun; Chang, Can; Fan, Yang			Particle Filter for Estimating Freeway Traffic State in Beijing	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							EXTENDED KALMAN FILTER	Freeway traffic state estimation is useful for intelligent traffic guidance, control, and management. The freeway traffic state is featured with rapid and dramatic fluctuations, which presents a strong nonlinear feature. In theory, a particle filter has good performance in solving nonlinear problems. This paper proposes a particle filter based approach to estimate freeway traffic state. The freeway link between the west of Peace Bridge and the west of San Yuan Bridge of the third ring in Beijing is used as the experimental object. According to the traffic characteristics and measurement mode of the link, the second-order validated macroscopic traffic flow model is adopted to set up the link model. The implementation steps of the particle filter for freeway traffic state estimation are described in detail. The estimation error analysis for the experiments proves that the proposed approach has an encouraging estimation performance.

Yet as simple roundabouts are not sufficient to cope with the increasing traffic volume, it is necessary to carry out programs on signalized roundabouts. Due to the fact that existing domestic researches on the capacity of roundabouts are limited to regular four-way models, this paper explores a capacity model of five-way roundabouts with signal control. First of all, the author would optimize the existing signal timing of a certain five-way roundabouts with the signal optimization model. Secondly, the author calculates the capacity of each road entry by dividing the entries into major and minor ones based on their traffic volume and quantity of lanes. Then the capacity of each entry is to be added up to get the total capacity of the roundabouts. Last but not least, the Wujiaochang five-way roundabout of Shanghai is taken as a case study for the test of the capacity model, and the result proves that this model presented in this paper enjoys excellent performance.

Experiences with Adaptive Signal Control in Germany	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Germany has a long tradition of traffic-actuated and -coordinated signal control. In recent years a specific approach to traffic actuation called a model-based system, or adaptive control, has found its way into practice. In the city of Muenster, Germany, the coordinated signal control system on the 6-km-long arterial Albersloher Weg, with 24 signalized intersections, has been completely renewed in a three-step process involving the old system, a rule-based traffic-actuation system, and an adaptive system. An empirical evaluation of this process by a university research team showed that conventional actuated signal control improved traffic performance in the first step. Additional significant improvement (as much as 30%) in traffic flow performance could be achieved by implementing Motion, an adaptive signal control system. However, further developments are required to meet the expectations of city engineers and road users. In particular, switching between optimized signal plans, which is an essential feature of the Motion system, must be improved.

Optimization of Dynamic Ridesharing Systems	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Internet-enabled technologies are becoming more widespread; users are constantly connected to the network in every place and daily activity. Access to transportation-related features mobile payment systems, Global Positioning System connections, real-time public transit timetables or traffic congestion information, and so on is easy. This access results in new ways to plan mobility. In the innovative mobility systems implemented and developed with these technologies, the new real-time capabilities of dynamic ridesharing, an extended version of traditional ridesharing, can play a key role if the relevant performance is improved. In other words, although ridesharing is not a new idea, recent technological advances should increase its popularity. In this paper, a proposed ridesharing system considers the interactions between drivers or riders and the system manager and the interactions between drivers and riders. The positions and speeds of the shared vehicles and the traffic flows in which such vehicles travel are omitted. To optimize the performance of the ridesharing system, a discrete event, dynamic pickup and delivery model that represents the considered dynamics and an optimal matching problem that optimally allocates an empty seat in a vehicle to a rider are proposed. The dynamic model represents the behavior of the ridesharing system and computes the relevant performance; the optimization problem finds the best match and path in the considered transportation network to minimize the difference between the desired departure and arrival times. In this paper, after the introduction of the ridesharing model, the discussion of the solution to the optimal matching problem, a simulation model is described. A real world case study is then presented and discussed.

Real-time simulation in laboratory environment is conducted to determine the traffic throughput to avoid possible congestions or ease existing congestions. Random numbers are generated to mimic approaching traffic, and this information is shared by a ZigBee-based real-time wirelessly network. Wireless nodes are connected to different PLCs representing different traffic lights in a cluster. Once the information is shared the timing and sequencing decisions are taken collectively in a synchronized manner. In this paper, the information is displayed on SCADA connected to each PLC for viewing the characteristics of continuous vehicular flow. It is found that the topology of the network can play an important role in the throughput of data, which may be critical in safety critical operations such as the control of traffic lights. This paper aims to highlight some of the possible effects of dataflow flow and time-delays faced by modern intelligent control of traffic lights.

We recall to the first time, the various models of the traffic road. Then we describe the Bond Graph with these principles in order to model three various macroscopic traffic flow models with Bond Graph. The originality of our approach lies in the fact that the road traffic can be modeled perfectly with Bond Graph and make use in the traffic control such as: ramp metering, crossroads, etc. Simulations of the developed traffic flow models are carried out in order to reproduce the famous fundamental diagrams (flow-density and speed-flow). Finally we have the results before opening prospects for future work.

Using various key metrics of interest including node degree, number of clusters, link duration and link quality, we provide a realistic analysis of the VANET topology characteristics. In this analysis, we integrate real-world road topology and real-time data extracted from Freeway Performance Measurement System database into the microscopic mobility model in order to generate realistic traffic flows along the highway. Moreover, we use more realistic, recently proposed, obstacle-based channel model and compare the performance of this sophisticated model to the most commonly used more simplistic channel models including unit disc and log-normal shadowing model. Our investigation on the key system metrics reveal that largely used unit disc model fails to realistically model communication channel, while parameters of simplistic models like log normal can be adjusted to match the corresponding system metrics of more complex and hard to implement obstacle based model.

It is proposed to minimize Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP) and Cost of Energy (COE). In line with that, Genetic Algorithm is implemented as intelligent method for optimization process. In this paper, optimization of HRES is implemented for street light application. This is focused to combine optimization process in supply side of street light with consideration of load management in lighting side. Load management process adjusts the light intensity based on traffic flow condition. In this study, HRES street light uses photovoltaic (PV) as main supply, battery as storage supply and fuel cell (FC) as backup supply. In lighting side, Light Emitting Diode (LED) is used and dimmed with control. Simulation of system uses MATLAB with real weather data and real traffic flow condition. As a result, the load management reduces power consumption about 12.9% in one year simulation. Moreover, the optimal design of street light supply is obtained and analyzed for uncontrolled and controlled load.

Tazul; Hadiuzzaman, M.; Fang, Jie; Qiu, Tony Z.; El-Basyouny, Karim			Assessing Mobility and Safety Impacts of a Variable Speed Limit Control Strategy	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							FREEWAYS; CRASHES	With the recent advances in active transportation and demand management, variable speed limits (VSLs) have been identified as an active traffic management strategy for improving freeway mobility and safety. Several heuristic VSL strategies have been proposed and evaluated. This paper proposes a model predictive VSL control strategy and evaluates its safety and mobility impacts. The strategy uses second-order traffic flow models to predict the traffic state and to provide a speed for optimizing corridor operational performance. A sensitivity analysis of the VSL update frequency and the safety constraints for the VSL strategy was performed to determine the best scenario in terms of safety and mobility. A stretch of Whitemud Drive, an urban freeway corridor in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, was selected as the study area. The proposed VSL strategy was implemented in the microsimulation platform with a special software module. A real-time collision prediction model was developed for the same study area by using a matched case-control logistic regression technique to estimate the collision probability for each scenario. The results indicated that the proposed VSL control strategy can improve safety by approximately 50% and mobility by approximately 30%. A VSL update frequency of 5 min and a maximum speed difference of 10 km/h between successive time steps yielded the best performances. This finding can be useful for field implementation of VSL control.	[Islam, M.

These forecasts are used for a wide variety of purposes from the planning to the design and operational stages of the highway network. The forecasting needs the sufficient historical traffic data to establish the trend of traffic demand. Apart from that choice of an appropriate model or technique is also an important consideration that can affect the accuracy of results. Artificial Neural Networks are considered to be more suitable than traditional techniques like linear regression or moving average method in terms of their accuracy, flexibility and implementation in real-world situations. In this paper, we have developed two neural networks to predict the daily traffic flow on King Fahd causeway. Three years of data has been used to train the networks, initial results were flawed, thus to improve the performance the data was classified. The neural networks were then trained with the classified data which showed enhanced performance. Neural networks were trained with various parameter settings and the best arrangement was selected. Ideas regarding future work and enhancements are also presented.

J	Ibrahim, U; Hayee, MI; Kwon, E				Ibrahim, U.; Hayee, M. I.; Kwon, Eli			Hybrid Work Zone Information System with Portable Changeable Message Signs and Dedicated Short-Range Communication	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								The future deployment of dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) technology requires that applications with their bases in DSRC be integrated with existing traffic management techniques so that vehicles not equipped with DSRC at the early stage of DSRC deployment can also reap the potential benefits of DSRC technology. A hybrid traffic information system was successfully developed; it combines DSRC technology and portable changeable message signs (PCMSs) for use in the work zone environment to improve traffic mobility and thereby driver safety. The developed system uses DSRC-based vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-vehicle communication to acquire travel safety parameters, such as travel time (TT) and the starting location of congestion (SLoC), and to disseminate these parameters to DSRC-equipped vehicles and PCMSs, which are strategically placed along the roadside. Through the use of the DSRC-PCMS interface developed and demonstrated in this work, PCMSs can receive these travel safety parameters from nearby DSRC-equipped vehicles on the road through DSRC-based vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and display them for the drivers of vehicles that lack DSRC capability. Such a system can be useful during the early stage of DSRC deployment when DSRC market penetration is low. In addition, a rigorous analysis was conducted to investigate the minimum DSRC market penetration rate needed for successful functionality of the developed system with respect to both acquisition and dissemination of TT and SLoC. Through the use of a realistic traffic flow model, guidelines were developed to estimate a minimum DSRC penetration rate needed to deploy the developed system for a variety of traffic scenarios on a given work zone road.

J	Xia, JX; Nie, QH; Huang, W; Qian, ZD				Xia, Jingxin; Nie, Qinghui; Huang, Wei; Qian, Zhendong			Reliable Short-Term Traffic Flow Forecasting for Urban Roads Multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity Approach	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							TRAVEL-TIME PREDICTION; SPACE NEURAL-NETWORKS; DYNAMICS; MODELS	Short-term traffic flow forecasting has an essential role in advanced traveler information systems, route guidance systems, and proactive traffic signal control systems. Numerous univariate and multivariate models have been presented on both traffic flow level forecasting and traffic flow variance forecasting. However, few studies have incorporated the relationship between traffic parameters (such as volume and speed) into development of the traffic flow forecasting model. It is well known that there are inherent relationships between traffic parameters and that heteroscedasticity exists in traffic flow series. On this basis a vector autoregressive plus multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) method is proposed for reliable short-term traffic flow forecasting for urban roads. The vector autoregressive model is used as the mean equation of the multivariate GARCH model for modeling traffic flow levels, and the multivariate GARCH model is used to model the conditional traffic flow variances. Actual traffic volume and speed data are used to validate and evaluate the proposed method. Results show that the proposed method can generate workable performance in forecasting accuracy and forecast confidence intervals.

The model consists in a scalar balance law for the (macroscopic) density of cars, with source terms representing incoming and outgoing roads (with respect to the bus route), and a coupled system of ODEs describing the dynamics of (microscopic) buses along the route. The coupling takes into account both the buses as moving bottlenecks in the car flow and the effect of the car flow on the buses' ODEs as microscopic vehicles. The resulting fully coupled micro-macro model promises to give an appropriate description for the car flow as well as for the buses. Finally, we study the model numerically.

The problem of designing an on-line coordinated ramp metering strategy is considered in this paper. First, the prevalent model predictive control (MPC) structure is used to formulate the problem with a second-order macroscopic traffic flow prediction model. To reduce the computational effort to match the request of on-line application, the original MPC is then extended with a controller positioning procedure. Not all but only the necessary ramps are selected as controllers by investigating the partial derivation of the cost criterion with respect to each ramp metering rate. Finally, a gradient-based numerical solving algorithm is introduced and the overall method is validated in a hypothetic network. Applying the proposed method, the performance of the freeway network improves as much as 13.4% compared with no-control case. In comparison with the original MPC method, the extended MPC method saves 32.3% computation time while barely degrades the control effectiveness.

To characterize the Italian territory nine different simulated scenarios have been used. These scenarios were obtained by combining three different situations of latitude (North, Central and South) with three conditions of altitude (high, medium, low altitude). For each of these scenarios, some configurations, proposed by the Italian CNR road pavement design catalogue with medium and high traffic flow, were verified using the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide. The results obtained showed that the Italian CNR road pavement design catalogue has a limited reliability.

Compared to macroscopic models, they include detailed lane changing restrictions and behaviors, which affect the throughput of the road infrastructure in certain situations. In order to achieve realistic macroscopic flow characteristics, several aspects of lane changing must be included in microscopic models, such as cooperation between drivers and per-vehicle lane-changing strategies and tactics. These aspects are important for achieving correct placement of vehicles on mandatory lanes in order to avoiding lane blocking situations and vehicle trapping in wrong queues. This paper presents an improved lane-changing model for metropolitan microscopic traffic simulations, which includes several methods for improving correct vehicle placement on mandatory lanes. These methods are integrated into a microscopic traffic simulation model which follows the cellular automata paradigm, in order to manage metropolitan-wide transportation scenarios. The influence of each method on the mandatory lane placement is evaluated through the experimental results presented in the final sections.

We establish the existence and large-time stability of traveling wave solutions for the initial value problem of such system. Contrast to previous results, there are four types of traveling waves according to the stability of the equilibria at x = +/-infinity.

Therefore, an accurate estimation of the road freight transportation for provinces of a country is so crucial to improve the rural traffic operation in a large-scale management. Accordingly, the focused case study database in this research is the information related to Iran's provinces in the year 2008. Correlation between road freight transportation with variables such as transport cost and distance, population, average household income and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of each province is calculated. Results clarify that the population is the most effective factor in the prediction of provinces' transported freight. Linear Regression Model (LRM) is calibrated based on the population variable, and afterwards Fuzzy Regression Algorithm (FRA) is generated on the basis of LRM. The proposed FRA is an intelligent modified algorithm with an accurate prediction and fitting ability. This methodology can be significantly useful in macro-level planning problems where decreasing prediction error values is one of the most important concerns for decision makers. In addition, Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) is developed to evaluate the prediction capability of the models and to be compared with FRA. According to the final results, the modified FRA estimates road freight transportation values more accurately than BPNN and LRM. Finally, in order to predict the road freight transportation values, the reliability of the calibrated models is analyzed using the information from the year 2009. The results show higher reliability for the proposed modified FRA.

J	Carrick, G; Washburn, S				Carrick, Grady; Washburn, Scott			Estimating the Impacts of Police Enforcement Stops on Freeway Operations and Capacity	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							MODELS	Over the years, some police agencies have sought to be good stewards of urban traffic flow by reducing their emergency lights while on roadside enforcement stops, particularly during peak hours. Over the past decade, however, move-over laws that require motorists to slow down or vacate the lane adjacent to the stopped emergency vehicle have been implemented in every state. As a consequence, the traffic impacts of police enforcement stops have shifted from a distraction that might slow traffic to a mandate for drivers to change lanes or slow down. From a highway capacity standpoint, the enforcement stop can be modeled as a theoretical lane-blocking event adjusted for motorists' compliance with move-over laws. This research examined 13,416 enforcement stops conducted near roadway traffic detectors on Florida freeways and shows that police enforcement stops reduced the available capacity by between 54% and 58% on two-lane freeways, 35% and 41% on three-lane facilities, 23% and 30% on four-lane facilities, and 14% and 22% when five lanes were present. Regression analysis examined factors to explain the speed of vehicles passing stops and showed that the number of lanes, posted speed limits, and ambient lighting conditions were statistically significant factors. Police agencies should therefore consider implementing policies in which they use their emergency lighting equipment throughout the duration of enforcement stops since they improve compliance with move-over laws and, ostensibly, safety. Breakdowns were not explicitly modeled and are likely not a deterministic measure, so police activity during periods of high traffic flow and congestion should be reserved for compelling traffic safety needs.

In particular, there lies a computational challenge in how these data can be efficiently processed for real-time intelligence. Given the data collected from ubiquitous sensor networks that have different densities distributed over a large geographical area, one can see how separate groups could be formed over them in order to maximize the total coverage by these groups. The applications could be either destructive or constructive in nature; for example, a jet fighter pilot needs to make a real-time critical decision at a split of second to locate several separate targets to hit (assuming limited weapon payloads) in order to cause maximum damage, when it flies over an enemy terrain; a town planner is considering where to station certain resources (sites for schools, hospitals, security patrol route planning, airborne food ration drops for humanitarian aid, etc.) for maximum effect, given a vast area of different densities for benevolent purposes. This paper explores this problem via optimal "spatial groups" clustering. Simulation experiments by using clustering algorithms and linear programming are to be conducted, for evaluating their effectiveness comparatively.

Vehicle activities before and during the first and second Drills, and during the Games, were surveyed. Based on the data under investigation, the impacts of control measures on traffic volumes and driving characteristics were analyzed during the first and second Drills, and the Games. The emission reduction of traffic control measures was also evaluated during the three stages using the MOBILE-China model. The results show that there were significant effects of implementing temporary traffic control measures on transportation activity and vehicular emissions. During the first and second Drills, and the Games, the average traffic volumes in monitored roads decreased, and the average speed of vehicles increased significantly. The co-effects of traffic flow reduction, traffic congestion improvement, and the banning of high-emitting vehicles helped to greatly reduce the estimated emissions from motor vehicles in Guangzhou during the first and second Drills, and the Games. Estimated vehicular emissions were reduced by 38 approximate to 52% during the first Drill and 28 approximate to 36% for the second Drill. During the Asian Games, vehicular emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <10 m (PM10) reduced by an estimated 42%, 46%, 26%, and 30%, respectively, compared with those before the Games. Both the banning of high-emitting vehicles and the travel restrictions imposed by use of odd-even licenses had significant effects on the reduction of vehicular emissions of CO, HC, NOx, and PM10. Implications: Motor vehicles have become the most prevalent source of emissions and subsequently air pollution within Chinese cities. Understanding the impacts that different control measures have on vehicular emissions is very important in order to be able to control vehicle emissions. The results of this study will be very helpful for the further control of vehicle emissions in Guangzhou in the future. In addition, the effects of temporary transportation control measures will provide important awareness to other cities that will be hosting large-scale activities similar to the Asian Games.

S	Moses, R		Ivala, E		Moses, Ren			E-Learning of Highway Traffic Flow in Real Time	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON E-LEARNING	Proceedings of the International Conference on e-Learning		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on E-Learning	JUN 27-28, 2013	Cape Peninsula Univ Technol, Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA		Cape Peninsula Univ Technol	traffic flow; wireless communications; e-learning; intelligent transportation		The goal of this project is to improve students' understanding of the relationship between microscopic and macroscopic highway traffic flow parameters in real time through online transmission of data from advanced traffic management centers located across the United States to a computerized laboratory. The paradigm shift in the transportation community from building new roads to using advanced technologies is challenging universities to produce graduates who are proficient in the design and operation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The cornerstone of this e-learning process is the innovative idea of Wireless Communications in Transportation (WCT) laboratory. The WCT laboratory is a multidisciplinary effort with a singular focus of educating undergraduate students - in sufficient depth and breadth - in the design and operation of diverse wireless communications systems to fulfill the needs of the transportation system. The objectives of the WCT laboratory are to: (a) provide a multidisciplinary environment for civil and electrical engineering students to interact on topics common to both fields of study, (b) teach students the technology, terminology, capabilities, limitations, and design requirements of wireless communications, and (c) to increase students' proficiency in simulation, implementation, and experimentation of wireless systems that can be used to collect, disseminate, and support data transmission requirements to fulfill ITS user services and other transportation needs. Students use the proposed WCT laboratory to experiment with wireless communications devices using real time data collected through an instrumented vehicle and through online data links with various field equipment operated by local highway agencies. The use of real time traffic data enables students to learn how to perform Dedicated Short-range Communication (DSRC) experiments which are typically applied in toll plazas; learning how to build automatic incident detection algorithm for urban freeways; and learning how to simulate real time traffic flow. In general, students are able to conduct experiments which relates to application of Intelligent Transportation Systems to monitoring, analysis, evaluation, and prediction of transportation system performance and behavior. Efforts are underway to formalize the establishment of a multidisciplinary course and integrate the course into the undergraduate curricula of both electrical and civil engineering disciplines.

We study the influence of the injection rate of on-ramp, the injection rate of main road and the removal rate of main road on the starting energy dissipation of each road. It is found that even though the injection rates neither of on-ramp nor main road have influence on the starting energy dissipation when critical values achieved, the removal rate of main road has a major impact on the starting energy dissipation of the system all along.

Concentrations of particulate matter and gaseous-species (CO and CO2) are monitored continuously from May 26 to September 23, 2011. Then the fuel-based emission factors of pollutants inside the tunnel are calculated based on the fuel carbon balance method. It is calculated that the average emission factors of particle number and mass are (1.068 +/- 0.695)x10(15) particle kg(-1) and (213.6 +/- 155.2) mg kg(-1) respectively. As for gaseous pollutants, CO and CO2 average emission factors are (80.727 +/- 70.133) g kg(-1) and (4.077 +/- 0.923)x10(3) g kg(-1) respectively. To overall reflect the emission variation of mixed vehicles, the emission profiles of each measured pollutants are illustrated. Moreover, the calculated emission factors in this study are compared with the previous published results. The possible reasons bringing about the estimation deviation are pointed out and one of the discrepancies can attribute to the uncertainties of on-road traffic information of the investigated vehicles. Thus, a series of effect parameters on emission factors are analyzed using multivariate regression method, taking an example of particle number emission. It is found that traffic density shows a strong relationship with particle number emission. These results in this study offer basic understanding to investigate the traffic emissions of Qingdao city.

Using traffic modeling and analysis to improve the traffic conditions become more important. Now, using the traffic flow model to study the traffic problems has made many achievements. However, traffic flow model cannot be a good choice for describing the relations of the traffic element at a specific moment, but these relations are indeed significant for forecasting traffic status from that moment on. In this paper, a graph model for the static traffic was studied, and then analyzed the feature of a graph substructure for traffic congestion at one moment. We propose an effective frequent subgraph mining algorithm to find the frequent substructure that represent traffic congestion status in a graph. Our mining algorithm can enhance the efficiency of finding the congestion subgraph. Analyzing the proportion of the congestion subgraph in a graph for traffic to forecast the traffic status at that moment later, thus to find ways to improve traffic conditions.

Based on field data, a macroscopic mixed platoon flow dispersion model (MPFDM) was proposed to simulate the platoon dispersion process along the road section between two adjacent intersections from the flow view. More close to field observation, truncated Gaussian mixture distribution was adopted as the speed density distribution for mixed platoon. Expectation maximum (EM) algorithm was used for parameters estimation. The relationship between the arriving flow distribution at downstream intersection and the departing flow distribution at upstream intersection was investigated using the proposed model. Comparison analysis using virtual flow data was performed between the Robertson model and the MPFDM. The results confirmed the validity of the proposed model.

It is very important to ensure the orderly operation of urban road intersection for the improvement of urban traffic. In this paper, it is started with urban road intersection. The relationship of vehicle speed, vehicle changing lanes, vehicle running red light, and pedestrian running red light is introduced into cellular automaton model, and established the cellular automaton model of urban road intersection. After traffic situation is highly simulated by cellular automaton model of urban road intersection, it is found that complex traffic rules make vehicles detained in the intersection, which deteriorates the traffic conditions of intersection; pedestrians and vehicles running red light will make the intersection disorder, and vehicles running red light influences more on the traffic situation of the intersection than pedestrians do.

In this paper, the Level of Service (LOS) has been used as an alternate measure to characterize street segments, LOS categorizes the traffic status according to quality of service of an urban street, considering three categories: few traffic, moderate congestion and congested. The proposed framework uses three GPS-Data fields (Date-Time, Latitude, and Longitude) to estimate Travel Time, Distance and Speed at two different levels of analysis: GPS-Data traces and street segments. At segment level of analysis average speed has been used to calculate LOS scale and characterize street segments with a LOS, color and performance. As a case of study, a subset of 1012 GPS-Data traces, gathered from Beijing, China, were analyzed. This trajectory data corresponds to 90 minutes of a Taxi. The implementation of this framework showed that, using only three GPS-Data fields, traffic information about individual vehicles can be estimated and used to characterize street segments with the average speed and its corresponding LOS.

The simulation results show that the present model can exhibit a multi-phase coexistence phenomenon, i.e., the freely moving phase, the maximum flow phase and the jamming phase coexist in traffic system. The fundamental diagram shows that the number of slowdown section has no influence on the mean velocity and flow. However, energy consumption increases with increase of the number of slowdown section at low density. In addition, it can be found that the speed limit and distribution of different slowdown sections have an important effect on traffic flow and energy consumption, and the underlying mechanism is also analyzed.

Uncertain terms are allowed to be modelled or unmodelled.The unmodelled terms in the model were estimated by there bounded differential. Compared with other ramp metering method, this controller is designed without approximately linearizing the complicated nonlinear model and requiring the upper bound of unmodelled terms known.The control gain is reduced.The method is verified to be robust subject to both external disturbances and unmodelled dynamics,and to be adaptive to unknown parameters.

In this paper, the traffic flow of CCDs was analyzed, and the traffic flow guidance evaluation model was established. Firstly, according to the travel time function, traffic flow was allocated to the road network of the CCDs by the dynamic assignment model, and the heavy-traffic roads were identified. Then, traffic flow guidance measures mainly including forbidding straight, left turn, or right turn were given, and the evaluation model above was applied to select the optimal measure. Finally, with VISSIM simulation software, the model was applied to the Tianjin Binjiangdao CCD, which illustrated that the satisfied guidance measure can be selected effectively.

The research proposes several spatial correlation validation indicators to verify the spatial characteristics among the road networks. Based on the analysis of spatial characteristics, the relationship between operation performance and influencing factors under the impact of spatial effect is examined. Furthermore, a spatial autocorrelation based influence models at three traffic flow levels is developed by using the data from a partial urban road network in Beijing. The model analysis shows that the spatial autocorrelation model is more effective in analyzing the urban road network operation performance under the influence of various factors. This model will be beneficial in identifying traffic network problems and improving traffic operations of the urban road network.

This paper first builds a model about traffic flow characteristic, including vehicle velocity, roadway reliability and traffic congestion recovery time. The paper also researches different pattern of vehicle velocity before and after the rail number restriction, analyzes the changing trend of road-mobility reliability with traffic demands, and calculates the pattern of traffic congestion recovery time between the restrictions. The result indicates that when traffic flow's density is large, the vehicle's velocity is increased to 180% of the original after the restriction; and the recovery time from congestion to smooth is decreased to 75.8% of the original; after taken the restriction measures, the road unblocked reliability in Peak hours is increased, and the traffic condition ameliorate evidently.

Traffic behaviors are simulated under the situation that congestion pricing revenue is used to raise the level of bus service and extend the road capacity. Also the simulation is compared with other two situations with and without congestion pricing. The results demonstrate that this method overcomes the localization of the traditional micro traffic flow simulation model, and the traffic flow of congesting section can be effectively reduced and distributed more optimal.

Underlying the fundamental diagram is the speeddensity relationship which was originally documented in Greenshields' seminal work and followed by a variety of equilibrium models over the past 75 years. Observed in these efforts was their deterministic nature striving to pursue two seemingly competing goals: mathematical elegance and empirical accuracy, the former of which is attractive to mathematical modeling of traffic dynamics, and the latter is required if such modeling is meant to be realistic. As a continued effort of such a pursuit, this paper presents a stochastic speeddensity model. The motivation is twofold: first, it is desirable to have a model which achieves both goals reasonably and second, the stochastic model can potentially lead to probabilistic traffic flow modeling and prediction which is typically not offered by a macroscopic approach.

The roadway is divided to serve motorized and nonmotorized traffic streams. Bus stops are located on the nonmotorized lanes. When buses dwell at the stop, they block the bicycles. Thus, two conflict points between car stream and other traffic stream are identified. The first conflict point occurs as bicycles merge to the motorized lane to avoid waiting behind the stopping buses. The second occurs as buses merge back to the motorized lane. The average car delay is estimated as the sum of the average delay at these two conflict points and the delay resulting from following the slower bicycles that merged into the motorized lane. Data are collected to calibrate and validate the developed model from one site in Beijing. The sensitivity of car delay to various operation conditions is examined. The results show that both bus stream and bicycle stream have significant effects on car delay. At bus volumes above 200 vehicles per hour, the curbside stop design is not appropriate because of the long car delays. It can be replaced by the bus bay design.

A traffic signal control method for six-phase intersection is proposed in this paper, aiming at reducing the average waiting time of vehicles. A two-stage fuzzy controller for this method is designed in the paper. This method takes into account not only the traffic condition of the current prevailing phase and the next phase, but also the traffic demand of the vehicle flow that turn right, non-motorized traffic flow and pedestrian. Taking the average waiting time of vehicles as the evaluation index, we make simulations on the control method proposed above. The result for the simulation shows that the performance of this method is superior to that of the timing signal control method.

Based on road risk, this paper discusses land-saving mode of Congo (Brazzaville) Highway One (Phase II), trying to reach the balance between the two after accomplishing literature review and analyzing the prediction of traffic flow. The result shows that, the project should choose the mode such as proper construction scale and high bridge & tunnel ratio, rather than small turning radius and low roadbed.

This paper focuses on an effort to develop a character-aware data quality evaluation equation and analysis algorithm based on the state-of-the-art wireless sensor network technologies applied to the traffic monitoring system. With proximity sensor readings and data fusion, the analysis result of the data quality analysis algorithm is more accurate than single detector system. Take into account of the difference and variation of traffic flow characters in the live detection scenario, batch estimation filter is adapted, and with that the quality analysis algorithm can be self-adaptable and self-adjustable according to the traffic data detection based on the active-learning mechanism. The simulation results show that this algorithm outperforms other data quality analysis algorithms with better performance and good scalability.

The models are as follows: Firstly, the process of cars driving is simulated. Secondly, the process of pulling station is simulated. In this part, two Cellular Automata Models are built separately for two cases, three tollbooths in the toll station and four tollbooths. The result shows that when the density of cars is on medium level, comparing with the toll station with three tollbooths, the toll station with four tollbooths can remit the traffic congestion effectively, but when the density of cars is too high or too low, the toll station with three tollbooths can do better.

The proposed algorithm aims to address the issues of development of short-term traffic flow predictors which have not been addressed fully in the current literature namely that: 1) strongly non-linear characteristics are unavoidable in traffic flow data; 2) memory space for implementation of short-term traffic flow predictors is limited; 3) specification of model structures for short-term traffic flow predictors which do not involve trial and error methods based on human expertise; and 4) adaptation to newly-captured, traffic flow data is required. The proposed algorithm was applied to forecast traffic flow conditions on a section of freeway in Western Australia, whose traffic flow information is newly-captured. These results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of using the proposed algorithm for real-time traffic flow forecasting.

First, to get the new partial safety factors of vehicle load effects, this paper conducted a survey of the short and medium span bridges,distinguished the similarities and differences between the standard in highway bridges from different countries and confirmed the reasonable position of Chinese standard in the world. The rationality of the design load of highway and bridge is directly related to the security, economy and durability of the bridge. Design vehicle load of bridge should fit with traffic flow characteristics of highway, the size of traffic, transportation situation and future development trend. Design live load of bridge (vehicle load) of countries in the world is fictional load, which is the maximum estimated load in the bridge design reference period rather than the actual load. The effect and form of fictional load should be compatible with the characteristics of the national highway traffic flow, the size of traffic, transportation situation and future development trend. With the rapid development of China's transportation economy, the characteristics of highway traffic flow have changed a lot, with the surging of highway traffic volume and the number of heavy vehicles. So the contradiction between the design live load of China's roads and bridges previously developed based on limited measured data and referred to relative foreign standards and the current actual operating load is increasingly sharpening. The construction of mass super-large bridges which cross river or sea also set a new request to the model and standard of bridge design load. So it is urgent to start a new round of research on automobile loading of highway and bridge design.

The paper uses the optimal velocity car-following model and symmetric lane-changing rule to simulate traffic flow operating in the weaving section, and calculate the headway and average speed under the different weaving section length. The results show that there is a critical value for the weaving section length. When the weaving section length is less than a critical value, the space headway significantly increase and the speed significantly decrease. When the weaving section length is larger than the critical value, the increased weaving section length has little improvement of traffic flow performance. The study proposes the critical value for the weaving section length of city expressway. Lastly, the paper analyzed the trajectory of traffic flow in the phase space of speed and space headway.

Traffic flow, which is highly time-relevant, with the features of high non-linear and non-determinism, can be treated as the time sequence forecast. Considering these features, this paper deals specially with this issue based on Wavelet neural network. Besides, by taking a road in mountain area for example, the paper realizes the analog simulation through the Matlab software programming. And the simulation results show that the traffic flow can be precisely forecast using Wavelet neural network, and its value is close to the expectations. The MAE of the Wavelet neural network is 20.1074 and the MSE is 2.5254.

In this paper, a new cellular automaton (CA) model is proposed to characterize the traffic flow at the intersection of this type. In present CA model, new rules are designed to avoid the conflicts among different directional vehicles and eliminate the gridlock. Two kinds of performance measures (i.e., flux and average control delay) for intersection are compared. The impacts of U-turn movements are analyzed under different initial conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that (i) the average control delay is more practical than flux in measuring the performance of intersection, (ii) U-turn movements increase the range and degree of high congestion, and (iii) U-turn movements on the different direction of main road have asymmetrical influences on the traffic conditions of intersection.

The calculation of energy dissipation via two traffic cases: two Riemann initial conditions and the traffic bottleneck on the road indicates the energy dissipation of macroscopic traffic mode is influenced by not only the velocity reduction of the vehicle, but also the velocity gradient of the vehicle and the traffic density along the road, which is different from the result obtained from the CA model.

J	Li, ZP; Zhang, R				Li, Zhipeng; Zhang, Run			An Extended Non-Lane-Based Optimal Velocity Model with Dynamic Collaboration	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; DIFFERENCE	Incorporating the effects of the lane width in traffic, in this paper, we propose a dynamical model based on the strategy of three-vehicle cooperation driving. We obtain the smoother acceleration distribution in the new model through considering the dynamic collaboration with the nearest preceding vehicle and the nearest following vehicle. It is proved that the stability of the new model is greatly improved compared to the early non-lane-based car following model by using the linear stability theory. We find that when the parameter of lateral separation distance is identified, the amplitude of traffic congestion decreases with increasing the strength of dynamic collaboration in the simulation experiments. In addition, we apply the new extended model to simulate the motions of cars starting from a traffic signal and the dissipating of the traffic congestion; it is found that our new model can predict realistic delay time and kinematic wave speed and obtained a faster dissipation speed of traffic congestion than the traffic flow model without considering the dynamic collaboration.

J	Weng, JC; Liu, LL; Rong, J				Weng, Jiancheng; Liu, Lili; Rong, Jian			Impacts of Snowy Weather Conditions on Expressway Traffic Flow Characteristics	DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY			English	Article								Snowy weather will significantly degrade expressway operations, reduce service levels, and increase driving difficulty. Furthermore, the impact of snow varies in different types of roads, diverse cities, and snow densities due to different driving behavior. Traffic flow parameters are essential to decide what should be appropriate for weather-related traffic management and control strategies. This paper takes Beijing as a case study and analyzes traffic flow data collected by detectors in expressways. By comparing the performance of traffic flow under normal and snowy weather conditions, this paper quantitatively describes the impact of adverse weather on expressway volume and average speeds. Results indicate that average speeds on the Beijing expressway under heavy snow conditions decrease by 10-20 km/h when compared to those under normal weather conditions, the vehicle headway generally increases by 2-4 seconds, and the road capacity drops by about 33%. This paper also develops a specific expressway traffic parameter reduction model which proposes reduction coefficients of expressway volumes and speeds under various snow density conditions in Beijing. The conclusions paper provide effective foundational parameters for urban expressway controls and traffic management under snow conditions.

In a lot of earlier studies, acceleration values were analysed and defined, mostly in optimal conditions for traffic functioning. However, values of almost all traffic flow parameters have been changed over time, due to changes in driving-dynamic vehicle characteristics, pneumatic tyres, material used for building road surface, etc. Besides, local environment influence and changes in drivers' behaviour also significantly affect values of this parameter. According to HCM, it is advisable to perform local research for all values of the parameters recommended within the framework of this handbook, and to adapt their values to local conditions as well.

Data acquisition is an expensive process that involves household surveys and automatic as well as semiautomatic measurements performed all over the network. For example, in order to accurately estimate the effect of a certain network change on the total emissions produced by vehicles in the network, assessment of the vehicle fleet composition for each origindestination pair is required. As a result, problems that optimize nonlocal merit functions become highly difficult to solve. One such problem is finding the optimal deployment of traffic monitoring units. In this article we suggest a new traffic assignment model that is based on the concept of shortest path betweenness centrality measure, borrowed from the domain of complex network analysis. We show how betweenness can be augmented in order to solve the traffic assignment problem given an arbitrary travel cost definition. The proposed traffic assignment model is evaluated using a high-resolution Israeli transportation data set derived from the analysis of cellular phones data. The group variant of the augmented betweenness centrality is then used to optimize the locations of traffic monitoring units, hence reducing the cost and increasing the effectiveness of traffic monitoring.

The considered model involves a continuum of nonatomic indistinguishable drivers commuting between a common origin-destination pair in an acyclic transportation network. The drivers' route choices are affected by their relatively infrequent perturbed best responses to global information about the current network congestion levels, as well as their instantaneous local observation of the immediate surroundings as they transit through the network. A novel model is proposed for driver route choice behavior, exhibiting local consistency with their preference toward globally less congested paths as well as myopic decisions in favor of locally less congested paths. The simultaneous evolution of the traffic congestion on the network and of the aggregate path preference is modeled by a system of coupled ordinary differential equations. The main result shows that if the frequency of updates of path preferences is sufficiently small as compared to the frequency of the traffic flow dynamics, then the state of the transportation network ultimately approaches a neighborhood of the Wardrop equilibrium. The presented results may be read as further evidence in support of Wardrop's postulate of equilibrium, showing robustness of it with respect to nonpersistent perturbations. The proposed analysis combines techniques from singular perturbation theory, evolutionary game theory, and cooperative dynamical systems.

We find that the transition largely consists of a pre-insertion transition and a relaxation process. These two processes are different but can be reasonably captured with a single model. The findings also suggest that lane-changing induces a regressive effect on driver characteristics: a timid driver (characterized by larger response time and minimum spacing) tends to become less timid and an aggressive driver less aggressive. We offer an extension to Newell's car-following model to describe this regressive effect and verify it using vehicle trajectory data. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, the intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) technologies, which can improve traffic flow and safety, have been developed to reduce the fuel consumption and vehicle emissions. Emission and fuel consumption estimation models play a key role in the evaluation of ITS technologies. Based on the influence analysis of driving parameters on vehicle emissions, this paper establishes a set of mesoscopic vehicle emission and fuel consumption models using the real-world vehicle operation and emission data. The results demonstrate that these models are more appropriate to evaluate the environmental effectiveness of ITS strategies with enough estimation accuracy.

Based on a unique dataset consisting of the GPS trajectories of 10 million travels accomplished by 150,000 cars in Italy, we investigate how known mobility models apply to car travels, and illustrate novel analytical findings. We also assess to what extent the sample in our dataset is representative of the overall car mobility, and discover how to build an extremely accurate model that, given our GPS data, estimates the real traffic values as measured by road sensors.

In this model, the backward-looking effect and the information inputs from multiple leading cars in traffic flow are considered at the same time. The linear stability criterion of this model is obtained using linear stability theory. Furthermore, the nonlinear analysis method is employed to derive the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation, whose kink-antikink soliton solution is then used to describe the occurrence of traffic jamming transitions. The numerical simulation of the presented model is carried out.

The traffic assignment problem, which represents the distribution of the traffic flows on the road network, is solved under user equilibrium manner using Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG) method. The investment strategy, which minimizes total travel time on the network, is determined by considering the available budget. The proposed method is applied on two well-known example road networks in the literature. Results showed that the meta-heuristic ITS based solution method could effectively be used for discrete design of urban transportation networks and the system performance of the road network, which is solved with this method, is improved about 16%.

J	Yao, RH				Yao, Ronghan			Sensitivity analysis of optimization models for isolated intersections with short left-turn lanes on approaches	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						isolated intersection; short left-turn lane; capacity maximization; delay minimization; sensitivity analysis	SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS; CAPACITY; LENGTHS	Short left-turn lanes are often channelized to improve capacity and level of service at signalized intersections. On the basis of previous achievements, this paper improves the joint optimization models for isolated signalized intersections with short left-turn lanes and aims to analyze the sensitivity of the optimization results to the parameters (critical cycle length and maximum short-lane length). To further clarify the effects of these models on traffic flow operations, several better optimization scenarios are simulated together with the existing one. The models and the methods are illustrated via the field data from Dalian, China. According to the analysis results, the optimum models and parameter values or ranges are recommended. Finally, the procedure of the model application is also proposed to apply in practice. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Chiou, YC; Huang, YF				Chiou, Yu-Chiun; Huang, Yen-Fei			Stepwise genetic fuzzy logic signal control under mixed traffic conditions	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						adaptive signal control; genetic fuzzy logic controller; stepwise learning algorithm; mixed cell transmission model	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; CONTROL-SYSTEM	This paper proposes a stepwise genetic fuzzy logic controller (SGFLC) by considering traffic flows and queue lengths of cars and motorcycles as state variables and extension of green time as control variable, towards the minimization of total vehicle delays. For the learning efficiency of SGFLC and the capability in capturing traffic behaviors of Asian urban streets, where mixed traffic of cars and motorcycles are prevailing, the mixed traffic cell transmission model (MCTM) is introduced to replicate traffic behaviors. To investigate the control performance of the proposed SGFLC model, comparisons with two pre-timed timing plans and three adaptive signal timing models are conducted at an isolated intersection. Results show our proposed SGFLC model performs best. Moreover, as traffic flows vary more noticeably, the SGFLC model performs even better. In the experimental and field cases of three-intersection arterial under four coordinated signal systems, namely simultaneous, progressive, alternate and independent, both cases consistently show that the proposed SGFLC model perform best, suggesting that the proposed SGFLC signal control model is efficient and robust.

On-Road Sensor Configuration Design for Traffic Flow Prediction Using Fuzzy Neural Networks and Taguchi Method	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st IEEE International Workshop on Measurements and Networking (MandN)	OCT 10-11, 2011	Capri Island, ITALY			Fuzzy neural networks (FNNs); fuzzy systems; on-road sensor; orthogonal array; sensor configuration; Taguchi method; traffic flow control; traffic flow prediction	SECONDARY PATH IDENTIFICATION; GENETIC ALGORITHM; SIMULATION; MODELS; SYSTEM	On-road sensors provide proactive traffic control centers with current traffic flow conditions in order to forecast the future conditions. However, the number of on-road sensors is usually huge, and not all traffic flow conditions captured by these sensors are useful for predicting future traffic flow conditions. The inclusion of all captured traffic flow conditions is an ineffective means of predicting future traffic flow. Therefore, the selection of appropriate on-road sensors, which are significantly correlated to future traffic flow, is essential, although the trial and error method is generally used for the selection. In this paper, the Taguchi method, which is a robust and systematic optimization approach for designing reliable and high-quality models, is proposed for determinations of appropriate on-road sensors, in order to capture useful traffic flow conditions for forecasting. The effectiveness of the Taguchi method is demonstrated by developing a traffic flow predictor based on the architecture of fuzzy neural networks which can perform well on traffic flow forecasting. The case study was conducted based on traffic flow data captured by on-road sensors located on a Western Australia freeway. The advantages of using the Taguchi method can be indicated: 1) Traffic flow predictors with high accuracy can be designed, and 2) development time of traffic flow predictors is reasonable.

J	Bassan, S				Bassan, Shy			Modeling of peak hour factor on highways and arterials	KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						peak hour factor; calibrated models; traffic volume; road categories	VARIABILITY	The peak hour factor characterizes the fluctuations of traffic flow based on the busiest 15 minutes during the peak hour. This parameter is used in the process of evaluating the traffic flow conditions such as capacity and Level of Service. The paper examines the impact of traffic on the PHF, and results in calibrated models that estimate the PHF of different road categories based on a large data set obtained from a recent cordon and screen line traffic survey of Tel Aviv metropolitan area in Israel. The PHF was estimated for four road categories based on the independent variables: total number of vehicles per lane per direction, total number of trucks per direction, and total number of buses per direction. The PHF resulted in the following ranges, based on the superior calibrated models with or without the impact of the heavy vehicle variables: 0.88-0.99 for rural freeways and multilane highways, 0.81-0.97 for two-lane rural highways, 0.922-0.972 for urban and suburban freeways and multilane highways, and 0.91-0.98 for urban arterials. These volume based ranges partially include the uniform values proposed by the Highway Capacity Manual (2000, 2010). The rural model calibrations could be beneficial in estimating traffic flow rates for traffic engineering analysis when traffic counting is incomplete or not achievable. The urban models need further examination.

J	Zhang, GH; Wang, YH				Zhang, Guohui; Wang, Yinhai			Optimizing Coordinated Ramp Metering: A Preemptive Hierarchical Control Approach	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							MINNESOTAS; NETWORKS; STRATEGY; FLOW	This article describes a coordinated ramp metering algorithm for systematically mitigating freeway congestion. A preemptive hierarchical control scheme with a three-priority-layer structure is employed in this algorithm. Ramp metering is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem to enhance system performance. These optimization objectives include promptly tackling freeway congestion, sufficiently utilizing on-ramp storage capacities, and preventing on-ramp vehicles from overflowing to local streets, balancing on-ramp vehicle equity, and maximizing traffic throughputs for the entire system. Instead of relying heavily on accurate estimates of freeway traffic flow evolvement, this new approach models ramp meter control as a linear program and uses real-time traffic sensor measurements for minimizing the indeterminate impacts from the mainstream flow capacities. VISSIM-based simulation experiments are performed to examine its practicality and effectiveness using geometric and traffic demand data from one real-world freeway segment. The simulation test results show that the proposed ramp metering approach performed well in optimizing overall freeway system operations under various traffic conditions. The system-wide optimal control performance can be achieved to quickly mitigate freeway congestion, prevent traffic from overflowing to local streets, and maximize overall traffic throughputs. The proposed ramp metering approach can dynamically assemble relevant ramp meters to work together and effectively coordinate the individual meter rates to leverage their response strengths for minimizing time to clear the congestion. This study demonstrates that utilization of existing freeway infrastructure can be optimized through the proposed algorithm.

In these years, probe taxis, which equip with some sensors (e.g., global positioning system), become widely used in Tokyo. Additionally, their sensor data enable us to predict the amount of future traffic. In this paper, we report a web-based viewer of taxi probe data which are used for traffic simulation. Moreover, we propose a traffic simulation model based on the concept of "PageRank", which is used for the Google search engine, to gain a quick overview of traffic flow in Tokyo. The original algorithm of "PageRank" needs a matrix calculation called "Google matrix", but the matrix calculation can be simulated by transitions of web surfers among web pages.

While there are limited air-quality-monitor-stations in a city, air quality varies in urban spaces non-linearly and depends on multiple factors, such as meteorology, traffic volume, and land uses. In this paper, we infer the real-time and fine-grained air quality information throughout a city, based on the (historical and real-time) air quality data reported by existing monitor stations and a variety of data sources we observed in the city, such as meteorology, traffic flow, human mobility, structure of road networks, and point of interests (POIs). We propose a semi-supervised learning approach based on a co-training framework that consists of two separated classifiers. One is a spatial classifier based on an artificial neural network (ANN), which takes spatially-related features (e.g., the density of POIs and length of highways) as input to model the spatial correlation between air qualities of different locations. The other is a temporal classifier based on a linear-chain conditional random field (CRF), involving temporally-related features (e.g., traffic and meteorology) to model the temporal dependency of air quality in a location. We evaluated our approach with extensive experiments based on five real data sources obtained in Beijing and Shanghai. The results show the advantages of our method over four categories of baselines, including linear/Gaussian interpolations, classical dispersion models, well-known classification models like decision tree and CRF, and ANN.

We used traffic flow data manually counted from intersection traffic video and taxi GPS data to derive MFD and GMFD. The method is suitable to recognize traffic situation. These figures show the property of the road network, which consists of infrastructure and control. Mastering the properties of the network supply side, we can better manage and control traffic demand. In the process of data analysis, we found that the time step for data processing is a determinant for the MFD and GMFD shapes. That means different time step produces different results.

In a separate paper, we seek the performance of two models by adopting traffic flow theory based reconstruction approaches. An overall evaluation on freeway travel time reconstruction performance of both a macroscopic and a microscopic model are presented considering real data obtained within a case study conducted on a stretch of Istanbul freeway network. While the initial paper presents the simulation results on both day and flow direction basis, we further consider the results in the explicit analyses on distributions and reliabilities of model reconstructions in the present paper. In order to investigate the distributions of route traversal times by considering explicitly the day-to-day variations, we apply the fitness test of normal distribution to the overall reconstructions by 5 weekday data and then proceed with the standardization of reconstructions and derivation of day-to-day distributions. Statistics obtained as order moments of travel time random variable are considered in the indication of reliability.

In this paper, all of the road segments on the freeway are considered as candidates of the independent variables fed into the prediction model. A spatio-temporal multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) approach is proposed for the road network analysis and to predict the short-term traffic volume at the observation stations on the freeway. The actual traffic data are collected from a series of observation stations along a freeway in Portland every 15 minutes. In the first phase, the macroscopic dependency relationships of the stations on the freeway are investigated via MARS method. Subsequently the stations most related to the object station are selected and fed into the MARS prediction model to generate the short-term volume. The experiments are carried out on the actual traffic data and the results indicate that the proposed spatio-temporal MARS model can generate superior prediction accuracy in contrast with the historical data based MARS model, the parametric ARIMA, and the nonparametric PPR methods.

Multi-scale modelling is an increasingly important research subject, particularly in the design and evaluation of large scale ITS, since these may affect travel and driving behaviour at different scales, ranging from route choice behaviour to (ontrip) path planning and actual driving behaviour. In such applications, the consistency of travel and traffic operations between the different models in a multi-scale framework is critically important. In this paper we provide a new taxonomy that enables the identification of the sources of inconsistency between traffic flow models of different scales. We show that these inconsistencies can be categorised into two main categories, which we term global and local inconsistency respectively. Since these two classes relate to the endogeneity or exogeneity of the variables and parameters of interest, two models connected in a multi-scale framework can be both locally and/or globally inconsistent. On the basis thereof we sketch two main solution directions targeted at resolving both classes of inconsistencies. In this paper we demonstrate the applicability of both solution directions with an example case. We close with a discussion on the further development of a multi-scale modelling framework based on these results.

The model is based on the Cell Transmission Model (CTM) and incorporates a feature to reproduce the capacity drop phenomenon observed in real traffic. An auxiliary dynamic state is included that induces hysteretic behavior on the density-flow relationship. The hysteresis is dependent on the time derivative of the density in a particular cell and allows to change the congested flow traffic wave velocity in the fundamental diagram and, with this, to produce a capacity drop. A Lyapunov stability analysis for a stretch of highway is presented that is compared with a similar analysis for the CTM. Simulation results show that the capacity of a congested stretch of highway is reduced when its vehicular density is decreasing.

The application of the legacy algorithm enables the intelligent intersection to accommodate vehicles, in a low percentage, not equipped or with faulty V2V and V2I communications. The developed intelligent traffic management techniques, which are based on a spatio-temporal reservation scheme, aim to minimize accidents, traffic congestion and consequently the environmental costs of road traffic. The performance of three intelligent traffic management algorithms applied to road intersections, roundabouts and crossroads, are analyzed. Compared with traditional traffic management techniques, simulation results using the developed intelligent traffic management techniques, show that the traffic output flux can be increased, traffic flow rate can be higher and the average time to cross intersections can be significantly reduced. This reduction is more pronounced when the traffic flow is heavy. The conducted studies show that the inclusion of a low percentage of vehicles, not equipped or with faulty V2V and V2I communications, in intelligent intersections using the legacy algorithm, have a low impact on the traffic flow.

The system gives advice - which is determined in a central back office based on the traffic state - to the driver, in order to prevent or solve suboptimal traffic flow conditions. The system aims at optimal lane distribution in high flow conditions and a reduction of the capacity drop by advising drivers to maintain a short (but safe) headway at the end of a traffic jam. The system was implemented in a microscopic simulation tool to evaluate the potential benefits for different penetration and compliance rates. With the simulation results, insight is gained into the situations in which the system is most effective. With loop detector data from motorways and other major roads in The Netherlands it is analyzed how often the situations in which the system is most effective happen. This lead to an estimation of the potential of Connected Cruise Control in The Netherlands.	[Klunder, G. A.; Jonkers, E.; Woldeab, Z.

Coordination of Automated Vehicles at a Traffic-Lightless Intersection	2013 16TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS - (ITSC)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	16th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	OCT 06-09, 2013	The Hague, NETHERLANDS	IEEE				This paper presents a coordination scheme of automated vehicles at an intersection without using any traffic lights under a connected vehicles environment. Vehicles approaching the intersection from all sections are globally coordinated, by considering their states all together in a model predictive control framework, for their safe and rapid crossing. The optimal trajectories of the vehicles are computed based on avoidance of the cross-collision risks around the intersection. Compared with the other methods, the scheme enhances safety by generating the trajectories of vehicles far from each other with respect to the cross-collision points and enables turning movements under constrained velocity without using any auxiliary lanes. The proposed coordination scheme is evaluated through numerical simulation for a simple test intersection consisting of four single-lane approaches. Observations under different traffic flow conditions reveal that the proposed scheme significantly improves performance compared with the traditional traffic-light-based intersection control.

Recent studies in a macroscopic simulator have shown optimal and feedback MTFC potential to improve traffic conditions. In this paper, local feedback MTFC is applied in microscopic simulation for an on-ramp merge bottleneck. Traffic behavior reveals important aspects that had not been previously captured in macroscopic simulation. Mainly, the more realistic VSL application at specific points instead of along an entire freeway section produces a slower traffic response to speed limit changes. In addition, the nonlinear speed limit-flow relation observed in the microscopic model is more pronounced than what was observed at the macroscopic level. After appropriate modifications in the control law significant improvements in traffic conditions were obtained.

A Game-Theoretic Framework for Studying Truck Platooning Incentives	2013 16TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS - (ITSC)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	16th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	OCT 06-09, 2013	The Hague, NETHERLANDS	IEEE			CONGESTION	An atomic congestion game with two types of agents, cars and trucks, is used to model the traffic flow on a road over certain time intervals. In this game, the drivers make a trade-off between the time they choose to use the road, the average velocity of the flow at that time, and the dynamic congestion tax that they are paying to use the road. The trucks have platooning capabilities and therefore, have an incentive for using the road at the same time as their peers. The dynamics and equilibria of this game-theoretic model for the interaction between car traffic and truck platooning incentives are investigated. We use traffic data from Stockholm to validate the modeling assumptions and extract reasonable parameters for the simulations. We perform a comprehensive simulation study to understand the influence of various factors, such as the percentage of the trucks that are equipped with platooning devices on the properties of the pure strategy Nash equilibrium that is learned using a joint strategy fictitious play.

Route choice preferences are represented by multinomial distributions and estimated via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. The proposed model takes into account measurement errors in the link counts, the uncertanties present in OD data and alternative routes choices both inside or outside the network of study.

In this paper, we try to optimize each traffic section state to a desired consensus state in traditional subarea. Because of the difficulty to execute real experiment, we apply ACP computational experiments method to realize the process. Firstly, we establish a regional road network traffic model and set up traffic state equation with traffic density as traffic state and leaving proportions of traffic flow on sections during effective green per cycle as control input. Secondly, we design a state feedback control strategy to regulate the leaving proportions of each section which indirectly reflects the effective green time, according to the difference between real-time traffic states and desired traffic consistency state. Thirdly, we apply computational experiments method to find the right value of leaving proportions indexes which will make section traffic state converge towards the desired consensus states and balance the distribution of traffic in overall regional traffic network. The MATLAB simulation results show the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method.

However, congestion in basic sections on interurban expressways is not effectively considered in ITS design because spontaneous generation of congestion has not yet been modeled. This paper points out the difficulties of traditional approaches and proposes a new traffic flow model where only the exchange interaction of time headway is considered, which is different from standard car-following models. Through this approach, traffic flow in critical states can be approximated as connected particles, as in a magnetic model. The characteristics of traffic flow are limited to two dominant parameters expressing the robustness of time headway. The influence of the model parameters on traffic flow is exemplified through numerical simulations. This paper concludes with a discussion about the applicability of similar statistical physical models and their potential as a platform for associating the geometric design of roads with traffic capacity.

For freeways well-known models for traffic flow and speeds are applicable, e.g., based on physical models inspired by hydrodynamic or statistical models ranging from more conventional to more advanced AI approaches. While for urban trips the traffic flow models are more complicated because, next to vehicle-vehicle interaction, also the influence of traffic signals has to be modeled. In this paper, a trip travel time distribution model for urban roads with fixed-time controlled intersections is introduced. The model explicitly considers urban traffic characteristics, including stochastic traffic processes at intersections, stochastic properties of traffic flow and signal coordination between intersections. Based on the proposed model, a trip travel time distribution prediction procedure is discussed, which considers time-varying demand and traffic control schemes. The model predicted results are further compared with those from VISSIM simulation data. It shows that the proposed trip travel time distribution prediction model can perform well both for undersaturated conditions and oversaturated conditions.

Individual driving behavior is represented by a prospect theory based model that takes into account uncertainty and risk-based evaluation of the gains and losses while following a lead vehicle. Given a set of stimuli (i.e. headways, relative speeds, etc.), the stochastic acceleration model generates acceleration probability distribution functions rather than simple acceleration deterministic values. Such distribution functions may be integrated across the link and across the vehicles at different time steps. Numerical results from a Monte Carlo simulation demonstrate that the proposed microscopic stochastic modeling approach produces a realistic macroscopic traffic flow pattern and can be used to generate travel time distributions. With proper experimental set-up and sensitivity analysis, the travel time distributions may be linked to the drivers safety-based parameters.

These models are helpful for improving the efficiency of the reduction of emissions. We develop a macroscopic emission model that takes into account the multi-class nature of traffic. This results in a integrated macroscopic multi-class traffic flow and emission model called the multi-class VT-Macro model. Model predictive control is adopted to reduce the total time spent and the total emissions. End point penalties are included in the objective function, taking into account the different distances to the destination of different vehicles. A case study based on a benchmark network is implemented. The simulation results show that better performance is obtained by using the multi-class VT-macro model and end point penalties.

Unfortunately, without countermeasures, they also allow selfish agents to take advantage of communication to improve their own utility. In this paper we present a novel framework for dealing with potentially untrustworthy information. The framework consists primarily of two components: a computational trust model for estimating the amount of uncertainty in received information and a possibilistic beliefs-desires-intentions agent system for reasoning about this uncertain information in order to achieve the driver's goals. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in an easy to understand but realistic scenario of a freeway system in which we also show that deceit may have a larger impact on traffic flow than previously thought.

Our goal in this article is to present a state of the art modeling techniques, namely the macroscopic model, mesoscopic and microscopic. And we see that in order to solve problems related to space and time encountered in the above models, a new scale model called hybrid appeared. The latter aims to take advantage of conventional models, by adopting the scale model of the phenomenon. The main objective of the system is to improve urban traffic flow and optimize the flow through operating rules and management. However, the problems related to the design of control systems is the control of the spatial and temporal consistency of decisions, given the characteristics of controlled systems and their environment. The second part of this article will be devoted to the study of some tools to help the existing decision. On the other hand, the approach based on agents used to design models of non-centralized control and self-organized and to improve system responsiveness decision. Un agent is a hardware or software that supports context autonomous decision-making. The last part of this article discusses these concepts and the concepts of multi-agent approach.

Traffic flow detection focuses on the detection and segmentation of video object. The most existing methods need to implement complex background modeling, and accordingly increase the computing complexity and computing cost. In order to reduce the computing cost of the vehicle detection, we propose a new vehicle detection method based on saliency energy image (SEI) and saliency motion energy image (SMEI) for automatic traffic flow detection. First, we set the detecting region of objects, and computing image saliency map of the detecting region for each frame. Then saliency energy image (SEI) and saliency motion energy image (SMEI) are calculated. Finally, the vehicle flow is detected by combining the vertical projection histogram of the SEIs and the binary SMEIs within pre-set virtual detecting box. Experimental results show that our method can work in realtime with a high accuracy and robustness to noise.

To this aim, based on adaptive Kalman filtering theory, two forecasting approaches are proposed. We suggest solving a multi-step ahead prediction problem as a filtering one by considering pseudo-observations coming from the averaged historical flow or the output of other predictors in the literature. For taking into account the stochastic modeling of the process and the current measurements we resort to an adaptive scheme. The proposed forecasting methods are evaluated by using measurements of the Grenoble south ring.

A Cost Effective Methodology for Pedestrian Road Crossing for Developing Countries	2013 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE	ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition		English	Proceedings Paper	ASEE Annual Conference	JUN 23-26, 2013	Atlanta, GA	ASEE		Monte Carlo Simulation; Traffic Flow Modeling; Level of Service; signalized and unsignalized		The objective of this paper is to present a low-cost methodology for the selection of proper pedestrian crossing facility by anticipating pedestrian delays at interrupted and uninterrupted flow and to correlate the pedestrian delays with level of service based on 6 levels which are ranked using the human's perceptions of comfort, safety and psychological limitation as well as acceptable delay. This paper focuses on the application of statistical distributions to model traffic and pedestrian flows. A Monte Carlo technique used to simulate traffic and pedestrians, and discusses how to create a tool in order to quantitatively rank which pedestrian facility is appropriate for particular situation. Initially pedestrian delay can anticipate at an unsignalized intersection. If the pedestrian delay is found to be more in uninterrupted flow, then signalized facility will be simulated. Later, the effect on vehicle delay at signalized intersection will be simulated. Finally delay simulation outputs will be used for the selection of pedestrian facility either unsignalized crosswalk, signalized cross walk or grade separated pedestrian facility. Thus, the simulation results gained in this study should be useful for enhancing the current assessment of facility. It is also hoped that the developed model could be used as a reference source for other Asian cities with similar pedestrian and traffic flow characteristics.

It is pointed out by other study that Braess's Paradox disappears at the high traffic density. The aim of this study is to discuss the appearance of Braess's Paradox at the different traffic density. At the different traffic density, the road network is determined so as to maximize the traffic amount by the help of the optimization algorithm and the traffic simulator. The results show that the optimized road network depends on the traffic density.

Although expanding the capacity of transportation systems and stimulating the public transportation may decrease the traffic congestion, they cannot completely solve the traffic congestion problem. As a solution for the worsening traffic congestion problem in urban areas, road pricing systems have been employed. In this paper, we propose a radically different road pricing scheme to prevent and decrease the traffic congestion in metropolises. Unlike designating a small congestion charge zone in a city, we propose to employ a road pricing system over the entire city. Thus, our road pricing system can control the traffic flow in the entire traffic network of the city. Furthermore, the road prices are adjusted dynamically based on the instantaneous traffic densities of each road in the city in order to rapidly and efficiently control the traffic flow and to prevent the traffic congestion. Moreover, we propose to change the road prices according to the past usage statistics of the road by predicting a possible congestion. The simulation results of our road pricing algorithm show that traffic congestion is prevented over the entire traffic network and the traffic densities of the roads are homogenized.

Upon these optimization framework, a suite of optimization subproblems: a program partitioning and network resource allocation problem, we propose a distributed vehicular sensing platform, called VeSense where mobile users in vehicles publish/access sensor data via a cloud computing-based distributed P2P overlay network. The key objective is to satisfy the vehicular sensing application's quality of service requirements by modeling each subsystem: mobile clients, wireless network medium, and distributed cloud services. By simulations based on experimental data, we present the proposed system can achieve up to 37 times more energy-efficient and 73 times faster compared to a standalone mobile application, in various vehicular sensing scenarios applying a realistic mobility model.

Measuring and localizing the congestion is an important step towards reducing the time people spend stuck in traffic. With the rapid development of phones, smart phones can provide location estimates with GPS sensor. Using position samples from drivers' phones to monitor traffic delays opens up the possibility of road condition estimation. This paper describes a road state evaluation system using the GPS data obtained from mobile phones. First is to evaluate the link average speed of a single vehicle, piecewise cubic Hermite interpolation method is employed to improve the accuracy of evaluation. Concerning that the speed of the same type vehicle is relatively stable, next is to obtain this parameter using the method of weighting. Last, use the average speed of different types of vehicles and ratio of those types as the inputs, and the link average speed as the output to construct the RBF (Radical Basis Function) neutral network. With the network, we can get the link average velocity, and according to the statistical analysis we know the number of the vehicle in the period of time, so the traffic flow is easy to calculate. We present experimental results from 24 different link groups of bus GPS data, the analysis result proves that the piecewise cubic Hermite interpolation method has a better performance and less error than traditional linear interpolation method. We show that after training the RBF network with large volumes of data obtained from VISSIM, the proposed evaluation method has a good performance.

To solve this problem, the design of traffic control is required. Traffic control parameter can be determined from the traffic flow behavior of the traffic intersection. Currently, most of the traffic control system in Malaysia is using Webster Model, which its green time duration is predetermined by collecting the data from the traffic intersection. Most of the waiting time at the intersection is wasted due to the constant green time duration. The aim of this paper is to optimize the average waiting time of a traffic intersection via a developed Fuzzy Logic traffic control system. Traffic light simulator hardware is built to deal with the difficulties of working in a real environment and to investigate the performance of the traffic control system. Conventional traffic control system, Webster Model and the Fuzzy Logic controller will be applied into the traffic signal simulator in order to investigate their performance.

Since then, volumes of researches have been done while others are still on going on how to improve the performance of traffic light systems so as to meet up with the demand of ever increasing road users especially in urban cities. This work observed that little has been done in the domain of Predictive Maintenance (PM) vis-a-vis traffic light systems. Anexisting approach of Breakdown Maintenance Approach (BMA) which has been adopted in literature is not satisfactory as the traffic light is not supposed to go off especially during the busy hours. This paper presents a self diagnostic system that monitors the quality of light produced by the light emitting element of traffic light system, and alerts the maintenance operators via Short Message Service (SMS) to change the lamp head before it fails totally. Our overall methodology is encapsulated in the body of the work.

Traffic congestion reduces the efficiency of the transportation infrastructure of a city; increases travel time, fuel consumption and air pollution, and leads to increased user frustration and fatigue. Reducing traffic congestion can improve traffic flow, reduce travel times and the environmental impact. The main objective of this paper is to consider the problem of vehicular traffic density to determine the low and high traffic conditions. To determine the traffic firstly we determine the texture features. Based on the texture features we determine the various traffic conditions. The procedure includes background subtraction from which we obtain the difference image and we apply the Support Vector Machine (SVM) procedure on a given captured image. Experimental result shows that the approaches are very efficient and produce up to 90% accuracy.

Under normal circumstance, average vehicle speed data, which is used to determine traffic conditions, is mainly obtained from taxis and other small vehicles which travel at a speed similar to the road's free traffic flow speed. But for intercity highways and suburban roads that are less traveled by taxis, coach buses and hazmat cargo trucks, which are traveling at a much slower speed compared to the road's free traffic flow speed, are required to compute traffic conditions.

The concept of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has been introduced to improve the efficiency of the traffic flow. The autonomous vehicle technology is slowly becoming a reality, alongside wireless communication technology, which is becoming a major role in vehicle communication. Wireless communication devices will be generally used in vehicles for the future road transportation. The purpose of this research work is to use the local traffic information to reduce delay time of a vehicle at an intersection. In this paper, the fully autonomous intersection system is represented as a single intersection model. In addition, the multiple intersections are created based on the connection of a single autonomous intersection agent. The communication topology of the intersection network is modeled by using the undirected graph. The traffic information in the network is able to be exchanged by Infrastructure-to-Infrastructure (I2I) communication. This discrete consensus algorithm is implemented for coordinating the local traffic information and the neighborhood intersection. The proposed method works, based on the concept Green Wave, which maximizes the throughput, as well as minimizing the delay time. It maintains the traffic density of every intersection in the network to manage every vehicle for a continuous drive with a minimal delay time. The simulation of variable traffic flow rate of multiple autonomous intersections is implemented based on the proposed method.

Microscopic simulators are typically used to determine the performance of a traffic control scheme/algorithm by studying their effect on the relevant traffic parameters such as average waiting time, average travel time etc. However, the only method for real time evaluation of the control algorithms on physical platforms is to use pseudo-random number generation as input traffic data. In this paper we propose the use of a 32-bit serial based processing platform for the real time evaluation of traffic control schemes that utilizes accurate traffic data generated from a microscopic traffic simulator. This integrated platform can be used to evaluate traffic control algorithms more accurately and realistically since the algorithms are evaluated using traffic simulation data instead of random numbers.

The proposed design allows greater flexibility and control of signal timings while keeping in view multiple criterions. It is based on simple rules that allow traffic flows on all intersection branches to control the timing of current signal phase without causing unrealistic delays on low volume side streets. The algorithm is also adjusted for capacity of different links. Detector data has been used to assess congestion situation and respond accordingly. A priority scheme for priority vehicles is also proposed. As a proof of concept, the proposed algorithm has been implemented on FPGA as a parameterized VERILOG model allowing adjustment to any intersection size and topology. An evaluator circuit was designed to assess the performance as compared to actuated signal controller. Improvement was observed in total stopped delay, number of stops and queue lengths.

Actuated traffic light controllers monitor the traffic conditions in real time and are equipped appropriately to react to varying changes in traffic flows thus reducing traffic congestion. We propose to use scheduling in actuated traffic light control to reduce traffic congestion and optimize traffic flow. We propose two traffic scheduling algorithms, Minimum Destination Distance First (MDDF) and Minimum Average Destination Distance First (MADDF) and compare their performance with existing scheduling algorithms as well as non-actuated traffic lights to curb long waiting times in queues at intersections. The simulation results proved the utility of the MDDF and MADDF algorithms since they were able to reduce the average waiting times by as much as 70% as compared to non-actuated traffic lights.

Traffic actuated signals use real time traffic data obtained from sensors at the intersections to service queues intelligently. We developed a test bed for the real time evaluation of adaptive traffic light control algorithms using the microscopic traffic simulation open source software, SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility), and the AVR 32-bit microcontroller. An interface was developed between SUMO and the AVR microcontroller in which we used the simulation data generated by SUMO as an input to the microcontroller which executed the scheduling algorithms and sent commands back to SUMO for changing the states of the traffic signals accordingly. We implemented four scheduling algorithms in SUMO through the AVR microcontroller, the effect of the algorithms on the traffic network was studied using SUMO and execution times of the scheduling algorithms were measured using the AVR microcontroller. Through this interface, scheduling algorithms can be evaluated more effectively and accurately as compared to the case in which the algorithms are fed with data using pseudo random number generators.

Relative to their internal combustion vehicle counterparts, EVs consume less energy per unit distance, and add the benefit of not emitting any carbon dioxide in operation and instead shift their emissions to the existing local fleet of power generation. However, true success of EVs depends on their successful integration with the supporting infrastructure systems. Building upon the recently published methodology of the same purpose, this paper presents an systems-of-systems example assessing the impacts of EVs on these three systems in the context of Abu Dhabi. For the physical transportation system, a microscopic discrete-time traffic operations simulator is used to predict the kinematic state of the EV fleet over the duration of one day. For the impact on the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), the integration of EVs into Abu Dhabi is studied using a Multi-Domain Matrix (MDM) of the Abu Dhabi Department of Transports ITS. Finally, for the impact on the electric power system, the EV traffic flow patterns from the CMS are used to calculate the timing and magnitude of charging loads. The paper concludes with the need for an Intelligent TransportationEnergy System (ITES) which would coordinate traffic and energy management functionality.

Modeling of the real traffic stream in urban environment is done in Matlab. The model integrates infrastructural submodel and general acceleration submodel. It controls three sets of inlet parameters and covers two primary vehicle conditions, several secondary vehicle conditions and so called emergency condition. Vehicle acceleration, speed, traveled distance and intervehicle spacing are basic output parameters of the model. They are obtained as a result of simulation of real traffic stream in urban environment. In order to bring the model closer to the real traffic conditions, it is calibrated with experimentally gathered urban traffic data. At the end of this process we have obtained flexible single lane urban traffic simulator capable of performing real simulations of traffic flow on different types of arterial roads.

In the existing literature, the analysis of the cyber security impacts has been primarily focused from the computer science perspectives investigating potential attacking scenarios and counter-measures through network security strategies. In this paper, we investigate traffic impacts of cyber attacks considering real-world driver behavior, especially the "built-in" safety redundancy of the visual verification by drivers or autonomous driving system. More specifically, we study the impact of "false-accident" attacks on the stability of traffic flow. In the false-accident attack, a vehicle sends out a false accident alert to its surrounding vehicle through CV-enabled network and has considered an attacking scenario that has catastrophic effects. Traffic flow stability is based on widely-used numerical linear stability analysis methods, the ring road test. In such a test, vehicles are restricted within a ring road so that traffic congestion and perturbations appear in cyclic patterns indicating the stability of traffic flow. The study indicates that false-accident attacks do not necessarily yield significant impact on the stability of traffic flow. Sensitivity analysis is conducted by varying the attacking duration, the attacking vehicle position in a platoon, and the CV safety application reaction range.	[Jin, Peter J.; Walton, C.

By coupling VSL and Connected Vehicle (CV) environment enabling two-way wireless communications for vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-toinfrastructure, it is expected to achieve improved performance of VSL as a viable traffic congestion mitigation tool. This digest paper presents the impact of connected vehicle on the effectiveness of VSL on a freeway bottleneck section by using a microscopic simulation model. Simulation experimental results show that CV-powered VSL improves the traffic congestion conditions up to 7-12% depending on CV market penetration rates.

In India there has been a sudden rise in vehicles on road leading to several problems such as loss of time, increased fuel consumption, wasted fuel increasing air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions, noise pollution, inconvenience caused due to long queues and increased cost. Intelligent methods have not yet been adopted on Indian roads. Most of the cities rely on pre-timed control. This paper presents an intelligent system for traffic flow prediction and control through green signaling. Live Data from upstream detectors and historical data of a particular junction are input to the fuzzy control which predicts the estimated flow at the intersection. Based on this estimated flow Particle Swarm Optimizer outputs the optimized green timing for the intersection. TSIS-CORSIM is used for simulation of the system. The results show that the proposed system results in lesser delay than the pre-timed and actuated controller of CORSIM.

Prediction of an individual speed profile on an urban network is a challenging problem because traffic flow on urban routes is frequently interrupted and delayed by traffic lights, stop signs, and intersections. In this paper, we present an Intelligent Speed Profile Prediction on Urban Traffic Network (ISPP_UTN) that can predict a speed profile of a selected urban route with available traffic information at the trip starting time. ISPP_UTN consists of four speed prediction Neural Networks (NNs) that can predict speed in different traffic areas. ISPP_UTN takes inputs from three different categories of traffic information such as the historical individual driving data, geographical information, and traffic pattern data. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm gave good prediction results on real traffic data and the predicted speed profiles are close to the real recorded speed profiles.

It intends to separate the hazmat traffic flow from the regular traffic flow via controlling the dual toll. In order to design the dual toll pricing policy on a highly realistic road network environment and detailed human behaviors, an extended BDI framework is employed to mimic human decision behaviors in great detail. The proposed approach is implemented in AnyLogic (R) agent based simulation software with using a traffic data of Albany, NY. Also, search algorithms in OptQuest (R) are used to determine the optimum dual toll pricing policy which results in the minimum risk and travel cost based on the simulation results. The result reveals the effectiveness of the proposed approach in devising a reliable policy under the realistic road network conditions.

Urban Network Gridlock: Theory, Characteristics, and Dynamics	20TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON TRANSPORTATION AND TRAFFIC THEORY (ISTTT 2013)	Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory (ISTTT)	JUL 17-19, 2013	Noordiwjk aan Zee, NETHERLANDS	Delft Univ Technol, Transport Inst, TrafficQuest Ctr Expertise Traff Management		Network Fundamental Diagram; Gridlock; Hysteresis; Adaptive Driving; Congestion	DESTINATION DEMAND ESTIMATION; TRAVELER INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; REAL-TIME INFORMATION; ROUTE	This study explores the limiting properties of network-wide traffic flow relations under heavily congested conditions in a large-scale complex urban street network; these limiting conditions are emulated in the context of dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) experiments on an actual large network. The primary objectives are to characterize gridlock and understand its dynamics. This study addresses a gap in the literature with regard to the existence of exit flow and recovery period. The one-dimensional theoretical Network Fundamental Diagram (NFD) only represents steady-state behavior and holds only when the inputs change slowly in time and traffic is distributed homogenously in space. Also, it does not describe the hysteretic behavior of the network traffic when a gridlock forms or when network recovers. Thus, a model is proposed to reproduce hysteresis and gridlock when homogeneity and steady-state conditions do not hold. It is conjectured that the network average flow can be approximated as a non-linear function of network average density and variation in link densities. The proposed model is calibrated for the Chicago Central Business District (CBD) network. We also show that complex urban networks with multiple route choices, similar to the idealized network tested previously in the literature, tend to jam at a range of densities that are smaller than the theoretical average network jam density. Also it is demonstrated that networks tend to gridlock in many different ways with different configurations. This study examines how mobility of urban street networks could be improved by managing vehicle accumulation and re-distributing network traffic via strategies such as demand management and disseminating real-time traveler information (adaptive driving). This study thus defines and explores some key characteristics and dynamics of urban street network gridlocks including gridlock formation, propagation, recovery, size, etc. (C) 2013 The Authors.

This work intends to understand how space distributions for modes and interactions among modes affect network traffic performance. While the connection between performance of transport systems and general land allocation is the subject of extensive research, space allocation for interacting modes of transport is an open research question. Quantifying the impact of road space distribution on the performance of a congested multimodal transport system with a dynamic aggregated model remains a challenge. In this paper, a multimodal macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) is developed to rep resent the traffic dynamics of a multimodal transport system. Optimization is performed with the objective of minimizing the total passenger hours travelled (PHT) to serve the total demand by redistributing road space among modes. Pricing strategies are also investigated to provide a higher demand shift to more efficient modes. We find by an application to a bi-modal two-region city that (i) the proposed model captures the operational characteristics of each mode, and (ii) optimal dynamic space distribution strategies can be developed. In practice, the approach can serve as a physical dynamic model to inform space distribution strategies for policy makers with different goals of mobility. (C) 2013 The Authors.

In our previous studies (Jin, 2010a, b), a phenomenological model of lane-changing traffic flow was proposed, calibrated, and analyzed based on the concept of lane-changing intensity. In this study, we further consider weaving and non-weaving vehicles as two commodities and develop a multi-commodity, behavioral Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model of lane-changing traffic flow. Based on a macroscopic model of lane-changing behaviors, we derive a fundamental diagram with parameters determined by car-following and lane-changing characteristics as well as road geometry and traffic composition. In particular, we calibrate and validate fundamental diagrams corresponding to a triangular car-following fundamental diagram with NGSIM data. We introduce an entropy condition for the multi-commodity LWR model and solve the Riemann problem inside a homogeneous lane-changing area. From the Riemann solutions, we derive a flux function in terms of traffic demand and supply. Then we apply the model to study lane-changing traffic dynamics inside a lane-drop area and show that the smoothing effect of HOV lanes is consistent with observations in existing studies. The new theory of lane-changing traffic flow can be readily incorporated into Cell Transmission Model, and this study could lead to better strategies for mitigating bottleneck effects of lane-changing traffic flow.

The Uncertainty of Drivers' Gap Selection and its Impact on the Fundamental Diagram	20TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON TRANSPORTATION AND TRAFFIC THEORY (ISTTT 2013)	Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	20th International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory (ISTTT)	JUL 17-19, 2013	Noordiwjk aan Zee, NETHERLANDS	Delft Univ Technol, Transport Inst, TrafficQuest Ctr Expertise Traff Management		Gap; uncertainty; fundamental diagram; driving behavior; traffic count model	EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; FREEWAY FLOW; MODEL	Time gap, defined as the time difference between the departure of the leading vehicle and the arrival of the following at the designated test point, is of great importance for both microscopic and macroscopic traffic modeling. In this paper, we report our recent investigation on a large amount of time gap data. By categorizing time gaps according to traffic conditions (indicated by travel speeds) and driving conditions (including no-speed-change, acceleration, and deceleration), we first studied the uncertainty in drivers' gap selection, which is determined by drivers' perception of selecting a comfortable and safe distance to the front vehicle. As we found out, under congested conditions, the average time gaps selected by drivers display little variation when drivers do not accelerate or decelerate; but when drivers are accelerating or decelerating, on average, they choose different time gaps with different speeds. We further studied the impact of the uncertainty of drivers' gap selection on the macroscopic traffic variables by considering the road traffic as a stochastic process. We derived a shifted Gamma traffic count distribution to describe the randomness of traffic flow caused by the uncertainty of drivers' gap selection, and then derived the fundamental diagram (FD) based on the count distribution. We found out that the uncertainty of drivers' gap selection partially contributes to the scatter in the FD; and the shape of the FD changes with driving conditions: the right-hand-side of the FD most likely is a linear line for no-speed-change condition; but it becomes a convex curve when vehicles are accelerating and a concave curve when decelerating. The different capacity values shown in the FD offer a possible explanation for the "capacity drop". (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Effect of Speed Limit Compliance on Roadway Capacity of Indian Expressways	2ND CONFERENCE OF TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH GROUP OF INDIA (2ND CTRG)	Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd Conference of Transportation-Research-Group-of-India (CTRG)	DEC 12-15, 2013	Agra, INDIA	Transportat Res Grp India		Heterogeneous traffic flow; Expressways; Simulation; Driver Compliance; Roadway Capacity; Posted Speed Limit	CALIBRATION; FLOW	Expressway is an arterial highway for motorized traffic, with divided carriageways for high speed travel, with full control of access and usually, provided with grade separators at location of intersections. Higher design speeds, restriction on slow moving vehicles, varied traffic composition with high amount of cars and no strict lane-discipline characterize these roads. This study aims to evaluate the change in roadway capacity with increasing driver compliance levels within a posted speed limit. It has been found that with increasing driver compliance level for a given posted speed limit there is an increase in roadway capacity along with a marginal decrease in the travel times at flow levels nearing capacity. The results of the study may be useful in underlining the importance of driver compliance to a designed speed limit along with its enforcement. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Vehicle Class-wise Speed Volume model for Three-lane Undivided Urban Roads	2ND CONFERENCE OF TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH GROUP OF INDIA (2ND CTRG)	Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd Conference of Transportation-Research-Group-of-India (CTRG)	DEC 12-15, 2013	Agra, INDIA	Transportat Res Grp India		speed-flow relationship; undivided roads; urban roads; LOS analysis		Two or three lane two-way undivided roads are a ubiquitous presence in any city in India and they are typically mixed traffic roads with vehicles of widely varying static and dynamic characteristics and with poor or no lane discipline. Hence multi-class speed flow equations are more relevant to these types of facilities rather than single class flow speed models. In addition, the available research for the operation of these types of facilities in India is very limited. Hence this paper aims to study the traffic flow in a three-lane two-way undivided road in the city of Chennai through developing multi-class speed-flow relationships using both linear and Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) models. It has been found from the study that models with total volume perform the same irrespective of units used being vehicles or PCU and models with class-wise (with and without direction) consistently perform better than total volume models. It was also found that linear models work better than other models for all vehicle classes modelling 2-wheeler speeds and two-wheelers, cars and LCVs have the greatest influence on the speeds of almost all the category of vehicles and the stream. One of the other important conclusions from the study is that an optimum use of class-wise and class& direction-wise models can offer models of better fit than two individual class and class-direction models.

Short term traffic flow prediction for a non urban highway using Artificial Neural Network	2ND CONFERENCE OF TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH GROUP OF INDIA (2ND CTRG)	Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd Conference of Transportation-Research-Group-of-India (CTRG)	DEC 12-15, 2013	Agra, INDIA	Transportat Res Grp India		traffic flow; speed; heterogeneous traffic; multi-layer perceptron; sensitivity	MODEL	This study applies Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for short term prediction of traffic flow using past traffic data. The model incorporates traffic volume, speed, density, time and day of week as input variables. Speed of each category of vehicles was considered separately as input variables in contrast to previous studies reported in literature which consider average speed of combined traffic flow. Results show that Artificial Neural Network has consistent performance even if time interval for traffic flow prediction was increased from 5 minutes to 15 minutes and produced good results even though speeds of each category of vehicles were considered separately as input variables.

Research on the intersection safety problem in China is still in its early stage. The recent development of an advanced traffic information system in Shanghai enables in-depth intersection safety analyses using road design, traffic operation, and crash data. In Shanghai, the road network density is relatively high and the distance between signalized intersections is small, averaging about 200m. Adjacent signalized intersections located along the same corridor share similar traffic flows, and signals are usually coordinated. Therefore, when studying intersection safety in Shanghai, it is essential to account for intersection correlations within corridors. In this study, data for 195 signalized intersections along 22 corridors in the urban areas of Shanghai were collected. Mean speeds and speed variances of corridors were acquired from taxis equipped with Global Positioning Systems (GPS). Bayesian hierarchical models were applied to identify crash risk factors at both the intersection and the corridor levels. Results showed that intersections along corridors with lower mean speeds were associated with fewer crashes than those with higher speeds, and those intersections along two-way roads, under elevated roads, and in close proximity to each other, tended to have higher crash frequencies.

J	Qu, XB; Meng, Q; Liu, ZY				Qu, Xiaobo; Meng, Qiang; Liu, Zhiyuan			Estimation of number of fatalities caused by toxic gases due to fire in road tunnels	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Road tunnel; Fire; Toxic gas; Number of fatalities; Fractional effective dose; Fire simulation	HAZARDOUS MATERIALS; ATMOSPHERES; TRANSPORT; MODELS	The quantitative risk assessment (QRA) is one of the explicit requirements under the European Union (EU) Directive (2004/54/EC). As part of this, it is essential to be able to estimate the number of fatalities in different accident scenarios. In this paper, a tangible methodology is developed to estimate the number of fatalities caused by toxic gases due to fire in road tunnels by incorporating traffic flow and the spread of fire in tunnels. First, a deterministic queuing model is proposed to calculate the number of people at risk, by taking into account tunnel geometry, traffic flow patterns, and incident response plans for road tunnels. Second, the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) is used to obtain the temperature and concentrations of CO, CO2, and O-2.

J	Bell, MC; Galatioto, F				Bell, Margaret Carol; Galatioto, Fabio			Novel wireless pervasive sensor network to improve the understanding of noise in street canyons	APPLIED ACOUSTICS			English	Article						Urban area; Pervasive wifi noise sensors; Traffic noise [dB(A)]; Road classification	ROAD	This paper presents the first results of the application of an array of up to 50 novel wireless pervasive sensors, referred to as motes, developed at Newcastle University in the project, MESSAGE (Mobile Environmental Sensing System Across Grid Environments). The motes measure noise, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, temperature, humidity and traffic occupancy/flow. The system has wireless communication (using ZigBee standard) to allow daisy-chaining of data from mote to mote (either static or dynamic) to router technology which forwards the data into a gateway. This passes the data through GPRS (or hard wired web link) to be captured in real-time into an Urban Traffic Management and Control, compliant database. Following a brief discussion of the health impacts associated with noise exposure and the policy context, the validation and proof of concept of the use of a pervasive sensor array to measure noise in an urban area is demonstrated through separate deployments in Leicester (UK) and Palermo (Italy). The motes provide real-time minute by minute, noise data [Leg in dB(A)] and their low cost and small size means that they can be pervasively deployed. From the two applications the results clearly show the potential of these motes to measure noise levels and to improve the understanding of the effect of traffic flow characteristics on the minute by minute variation in noise levels in busy urban streets. The distribution of one minute LAeq noise levels measured by the standard deviation were shown to exhibit consistent but different characteristics depending which of three measurement clusters, primary congested road and well ventilated secondary roads with busy traffic, tertiary roads without acoustic screening from busy roads and finally residential streets. Predictive relationships which allow the magnitude of the standard deviation to be expected depending on the noise level are presented. The results demonstrated a measurement system and predictive method that offers potential to explore more suitable noise parameters that correlate the human response to traffic related noise.

Cell transmission model based variable speed limit control for freeways	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						cell transmission model; fundamental diagram; capacity drop; model predictive control; variable speed limit	WAVES	Variable speed limit (VSL) can be used on freeways to manage traffic flow with the goal of improving capacity. To achieve the objective, this study proposes a novel VSL control strategy that explicitly considers the fundamental diagrams (FDs) at active bottleneck, and its upstream-downstream segments. To deeply understand the effectiveness of the VSL control, an analytical model based on the cell transmission model (CTM) is developed. Two modifications in the FD are proposed to model: (1) active bottleneck in which there is a capacity drop once feeding flow exceeds its capacity; and (2) variable free-flow speeds for the cells operated with VSL control. To allow these modifications, the local demand-supply approach is adopted to change the boundary condition of the CTM. As part of the VSL control algorithm, the proposed VSL control model is implemented in a North American urban freeway corridor with the model predictive control approach. This simulation study reveals that, in terms of traffic mobility, VSL is mostly effective during congestion periods.

J	Gao, S; Wang, YL; Gao, Y; Liu, Y				Gao, Song; Wang, Yaoli; Gao, Yong; Liu, Yu			Understanding urban traffic-flow characteristics: a rethinking of betweenness centrality	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING & DESIGN			English	Article						taxi trajectory; traffic flow; betweenness centrality; mobile phone data; spatial heterogeneity; distance decay	NETWORK ANALYSIS; ROUTE CHOICE; MOBILITY; ACCESSIBILITY; STREETS; MOVEMENT; PATTERNS; PHONES; CITY	In this study we estimate urban traffic flow using GPS-enabled taxi trajectory data in Qingdao, China, and examine the capability of the betweenness centrality of the street network to predict traffic flow. The results show that betweenness centrality is not a good predictor variable for urban traffic flow, which has, theoretically, been pointed out in existing literature. With a critique of the betweenness centrality as a predictor, we further analyze the characteristics of betweenness centrality and point out the 'gap' between this centrality measure and actual flow. Rather than considering only the topological properties of a street network, we take into account two aspects, the spatial heterogeneity of human activities and the distance-decay law, to explain the observed traffic-flow distribution. The spatial distribution of human activities is estimated using mobile phone Erlang values, and the power law distance decay is adopted. We run Monte Carlo simulations to generate trips and predict traffic-flow distributions, and use a weighted correlation coefficient to measure the goodness of fit between the observed and the simulated data. The correlation coefficient achieves the maximum (0.623) when the exponent equals 2.0, indicating that the proposed model, which incorporates geographical constraints and human mobility patterns, can interpret urban traffic flow well.

Traffic simulation and chaos movement states are studied based on car-following model. Firstly, LA model was presented, that is the car-following model with a cubic additional term. It is nonlinear. Then Runge-Kutta method was used to calculate of flow. Finally, the simulated traffic flow was generated with MATLAB based on the LA model. The flow was analysised by a combination of many chaos distinguishing methods. Simulation results are shown that there are chaos characteristics in the traffic flow which was derived by LA model.

With the development in time series analysis model and their applications, it is important to focus on how to find the useful and real-time traffic information from the Intelligent Transportation System.

With previous traffic volume forecasting model, traffic agencies could make relevant decisions on traffic managements and controls. In the past decades, many advanced models have been proposed and achieved a significant improvement in forecasting. However, multiple-step ahead traffic forecasting has not attracted its deserved attention. In this paper, we proposed a Gaussian Mixed Model embedded Back Propagation network (GMM-BP) to implement multiple-step ahead traffic forecasting. To test the effectiveness of the proposed method, we have designed a numerical experiment using PeMS dataset and compared its performance to single Gaussian Mixed Model (GMM) and Back Propagation (BP) network with the Mean Relative Deviation (MRD) criterion and "acceptance region". The results show that our proposed method in this paper outperforms single GMM and BP network, and especially in multiple-step ahead traffic volume forecasting. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Compared to conventional methods, the new identification scheme allows the parameters of second-order macroscopic traffic model, namely free speed and critical density, be estimated in an on-line and computationally efficient fashion are identified by means of differential algebra and operational calculus. The simulation example of a hypothetical scenario demonstrates these advantages numerically.

A road-link-based model was constructed based on a bottom-up approach by coupling COPERT emission functions with the travel demand model of EMME/2. Results showed total emission from the studied network was largely impacted by vehicles' technology and age, speeds in the links, and fuel type. The proper transportation management to reduce the part of passenger cars and improve traffic flow also leads to a significant drop in the emission, e. g., emission decreased by 43% from 20% traffic volume reduction. Results indicated the importance of concurrent implementation of practices for effective emission reduction. Enforcing proper emission standards, expanding public transportation, and vehicles' fleet renewal can potentially reduce more than 90% of current CO emission.

Based on traffic census was calculated a number of vehicles which passed through a particular region in the Czech Republic. This allowed calculating (first to eight) binary and numeric precedence between particular regions. This way any disproportions were defined. Consequently were monitored transport infrastructure changes in three different periods. Transport constructions and its regional significance were weighted. Through these weights precedence progressions were sought. The aim was to reveal combinations of weights which would be fitted with functional dependences between precedencies of the traffic intensity and transport infrastructure.

Multivariate forecasting of road traffic flows in the presence of heteroscedasticity and measurement errors	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Data collection error; Dynamic linear model; Linear multiregression dynamic model; Traffic modelling; Variance law	BAYESIAN NETWORK; DYNAMIC-MODELS; MISSING DATA; TIME-SERIES; PREDICTION; SYSTEMS	Linear multiregression dynamic models, which combine a graphical representation of a multivariate time series with a state space model, have been shown to be a promising class of models for forecasting traffic flow data. Analysis of flows at a busy motorway intersection near Manchester, UK, highlights two important modelling issues: accommodating different levels of traffic variability depending on the time of day and accommodating measurement errors due to data collection errors. This paper extends linear multiregression dynamic models to address these issues. Additionally, the paper investigates how close the approximate forecast limits that are usually used with the linear multiregression dynamic model are to the true, but not so readily available, forecast limits.

In this paper, we will discuss in detail the effectiveness of Back-Propagation (BP) neural network for prediction of lane-changing trajectory based on the past vehicle data and compare the results between BP neural network model and Elman Network model in terms of the training time and accuracy. Driving simulator data and NGSIM data were processed by a smooth method and then used to validate the availability of the model. The test results indicate that BP neural network might be an accurate prediction of driver's lane-changing behavior in urban traffic flow. The objective of this paper is to show the usefulness of BP neural network in prediction of lane-changing process and confirm that the vehicle trajectory is influenced previously by the collected data.

Furthermore, the traffic flow on typical accident road was analyzed by the software ANSYS in order to reveal the effects of accident on the traffic flow characteristics. The results show that the velocity, pressure and density of traffic flow in the accident section changed greatly. In order to ensure the dredging of accident section and avoid secondary accident, the warning signs should be set up, and traffic control measurement such as limiting the traffic speed as well as restricting the traffic flow at the upstream and downstream of the accident section should be carried out.

It is a Stackelberg Game Model between traffic manager and travelers which combined two traffic assignment principles, the User Equilibrium and the System Optimum. Meanwhile, the Improved Logit Model is employed to calculate the probability of path selection so as to make travelers' path selection behaviors better fit the real world. In order to present the dynamics and time variability of the traffic guidance system, the traffic demand uncertainty is introduced in the simulation experiment and also the Rolling Horizon Implementation to the solution algorithm. The simulation experimental results show that the presented game model is able to improve the vehicle speed, realize the traffic flow equilibrium and optimize the global road network performance.

A feedback control based on flatness technique is introduced. The control objective is to minimize the difference of the travel time on alternate routes in a road network which have the same origin and destination. Accordingly, congestion could be reduced or eliminated. Some numerical simulations are carrying out to demonstrate the relevance of introduced method in the case when the geometric condition of the alternate routes are the same as well as when some behaviour of the two alternate routes are different.

The effect of electric vehicles (EVs) on traffic related pollution is assessed at the transportation link level in the Hamilton Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) following a simulation procedure from 2006 to 2021. The traffic emissions considered in this paper are: total hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and a basic estimate of carbon dioxide (CO2). Emissions were estimated through a number of steps. Firstly, different EV market penetration scenarios were introduced (conservative, medium, optimistic) and compared to the base case scenario where no action or minimum policy controls are supposed to take place over the next couple of decades. Scenarios were determined through a comprehensive review of penetration estimates in the literature. Following these, the spatial distribution patterns of EVs were predicted using the vehicle registration data for the Hamilton CMA along with socioeconomic data obtained from 2006 census. Different distribution patterns of EVs adoption were assessed creating sub-scenarios, in order to reflect the possible changes in the future. Subsequently, the results from the regression model were used to properly modify the Origin-Destination (OD) matrices by type of vehicle. These matrices were used as input into our traffic simulation model (TRAFFIC) that assigns traffic on the network and estimates volumes for each of the links. MOBILE 6.2C(1) was customized to accept the new vehicle type and to compute the emission factors. The hourly emissions on each link were mapped through a geographic information system (GIS) framework after the integration of three parameters: street network, associated traffic flows and emissions (Link_emissions model). We conclude that different distribution patterns produce different spatial patterns of traffic related emissions in the links and even a modest adoption of EV technology may lead to significant reduction in traffic emissions	[Papargyri, Evangelia] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Rural & Survey Engn, 9 Iroon Polutechneiou St, Athens 15780, Greece; [Kanaroglou, Pavlos] McMaster Univ, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, CSpA, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Photis, Yorgos] Univ Thessaly, Sch Planning & Reg Dev, Volos, Greece	Papargyri, E (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Rural & Survey Engn, 9 Iroon Polutechneiou St, Athens 15780, Greece.	papargyri.eva@gmail.com; pavlos@mcmaster.ca; yphotis@gmail.com					Bento AM, 2005, REV ECON STAT, V87, P466, DOI 10.1162/0034653054638292; Brady J, 2011, TRANSPORT RES D-TR E, V16, P188, DOI 10.1016/j.trd.2010.09.006; Bueno G, 2012, RENEW SUST ENERG REV, V16, P1988, DOI 10.1016/j.rser.2012.01.004; Canada's Action, 2010, CAN ACT CLIM CHANG; Canadian Nuclear Society, 2013, EL SOURC; Chu YB, 2002, TRANSPORT RES REC, P60, DOI 10.3141/1805-08; CSpA, 2009, MOB EM EST HAM; Cunningham J, 2009, ANAL BATTERY ELECT V; Curtin R., 2009, PLUG IN HYBRID ELECT; Earley R., 2011, ELECT VEHICLES CONTE; Ito N, 2011, WILLINGNESS PAY INFR; Ji SG, 2012, ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL, V46, P2018, DOI 10.1021/es202347q; Ministry of Transportation, 2010, PLAN GREEN ONT; OECD, 2007, ENV DAT COMP; Perujo A, 2010, ENERG POLICY, V38, P4549, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2010.04.010; Potoglou D, 2008, J TRANSP GEOGR, V16, P42, DOI 10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2007.01.006; Stuben J., 2008, ENVIRON PLANN B, P1070; Thiel C, 2010, ENERG POLICY, V38, P7142, DOI 10.1016/j.enpol.2010.07.034; TTS, 2006, DAT MAN GROUP TRANSP	19	0	0	0	8	GLOBAL NEST, SECRETARIAT	ATHENS	UNIV, AEGEAN, 30, VOULGAROKTONOU STR, ATHENS, GR 114 72, GREECE	1106-5516		978-960-7475-51-0	PROC INT CONF ENV SC			2013													8	Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Sciences	Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology	BB7WL	WOS:000346067900341					2021-01-11

Better real-time information about congestion levels can help with more effective use of infrastructure, for example allowing journey planning based on predicted congestion levels, or on selecting optimal routes based on current congestion levels at different places. In this paper we describe hardware and image processing methods for constructing a vision-based traffic congestion monitoring system tailored to the constraints of monitoring chaotic developing world traffic. By designing roadside monitoring units around camera phones, our prototype radically reduces costs compared to convential CCTV systems and hence makes it practical for deployment in this context. We show results from this system operating in Kampala.

In this paper, we present techniques to measure traffic density and speed in unlaned traffic, prevalent in developing countries, and apply those techniques to better understand traffic patterns in Bengaluru, India. Our techniques, based on video processing of traffic, result in about 11% average error for density and speed compared to manuallyobserved ground truth values. Though we started with intuitive and straight-forward image processing tools, due to a myriad of non-trivial issues posed by the heterogeneous and chaotic traffic in Bengaluru, our techniques have grown to be non-obvious. We describe the techniques and their evaluation, with details of why simpler methods failed under various circumstances. We also apply our techniques to quantify the congestion during peak hours and to estimate the gains achievable by shifting a fraction of traffic to other time periods. Finally, we measure the fundamental curves of transportation engineering, relating speed vs. density and flow vs. speed, which are integral tools for policy	[Sen, Rijurekha] Indian Inst Technol, Bombay, Maharashtra, India; [Sen, Rijurekha; Cross, Andrew; Vashistha, Aditya; Padmanabhan, Venkata N.; Cutrell, Edward; Thies, William] Microsoft Res India, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India	Sen, R (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol, Bombay, Maharashtra, India.	riju@cse.iitb.ac.in; t-across@microsoft.com; t-avash@microsoft.com; padmanab@microsoft.com; cutrell@microsoft.com; thies@microsoft.com					Anderson R.

However, the experiments of the methods were difficult to perform in real road networks. In order to prove the effectiveness of the methods, traffic simulations by using a traffic simulator were required. Although various traffic simulators have been developed, the most of simulator was not specified for simulation of traffic signal control. A micro traffic simulator for simulation of traffic signal control is introduced in this paper. The micro-simulator is based on a Cellular Automaton (CA) model, which is a model of artificial life. Furthermore, the CA traffic model is modified according to features of traffic flows at intersections in order to reproduce the traffic situation of urban area. The usability of the proposed CA traffic model is evaluated through the analysis of relationship between traffic density, average speed, and traffic flows. Moreover, the micro-simulator is applied to evaluate traffic signal control methods.

Statistical tests are used to evaluate the developed models with respect to temporal data resolution, prediction accuracy, and quality of fit. The results indicate that, by and large, NNs provide more accurate predictions than do classical statistical approaches, particularly for finer data resolutions. Evaluation of model fit indicated that, in contrast to vector autoregressive models, NNs may also provide unbiased predictions. Overall, the findings clearly suggest the need to jointly consider statistical and NN models to develop more efficient prediction models.

The LTM was recently developed for route assignment, but in this study the LTM was modified to be used for control purposes. This modification achieved a model that provides a balanced trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity, and therefore the model is useful for online model-based traffic control. Nevertheless the extension of the model for ramp metering and speed limit control needed careful attention. Because the LTM lacks explicit velocity equations, the focus was on other potential sources that could imitate the influences of VSL. The delays inside the model were manipulated to achieve the mentioned goal. Moreover, different situations were taken into account that might occur in reality on the basis of changes in VSL and different traffic conditions. Finally, the total extensions were verified with simulation and real data. For that aim to be achieved, the VSL extension integrated in the LTM was verified with simulations for a benchmark case study (to show the performance of the extended LTM clearly). Next, the LTM was calibrated by real data collected from the A12 freeway in the Netherlands. The optimal parameters of the model were identified with a global optimization method. Comparison with real data from a period of time when VSL installed on the freeway was active showed the acceptable performance of the total extended and calibrated LTM.

A comprehensive study was conducted to analyze the behavioral characteristics of the speed synchronization process of merging vehicles from entrance ramps by tracking their trajectories in the merge lanes. On the basis of gap selection, merging vehicles were classified as either original gap type or overtaking type, and the existence of speed synchronization was proved by comparing the speed differences of merging vehicles in relation to the putative leader (PL) and the putative follower (PF) vehicles. Several rules of merging vehicles during speed synchronization were established in the behavioral study. The merging vehicles tended to maintain a speed 5 to 7 m/s higher than the speed of the PL sons to overtake unsatisfied gaps in the adjacent through lane. When those vehicles intended to accept a gap, they first adjusted their speeds to be within a 2-m/s difference from their PL and PF vehicles and then merged into the targeted gap within 2 to 3 s. Factors affecting drivers' tolerance of their speed with PL and PF vehicles were modeled with the multiregression method. Significant effects in speed synchronization include the number of rejected gaps, acceleration or deceleration, the speed difference between the PL and the PF, the time headway, the remaining distance in the auxiliary lane, and whether the PL is a merged vehicle. Results from this study may contribute to the understanding of the complex lane-changing behavior in microscopic traffic flow modeling.

Because of the difficulty of real-time experiments, traffic simulators are a good and widely used tool for analyzing specific situations of the traffic flow virtually. This paper introduces TraffSim, a new platform-independent framework, which is capable of simulating microscopic vehicular road traffic in a time-continuous manner. It is able to simulate scenarios close to reality by using OpenStreetMap networks, creating precise and at the same time reproducible results. TraffSim is able to use various network types from multilane motorways to dense city road networks including multiple types of junctions or one-way streets and provides great extensibility and flexibility for both developers and users. Moreover, it allows free definition of vehicle properties like dimensions or engine features, which are used by several applicable models for longitudinal movement, lane-changing and fuel-consumption. We present the architectural and logical aspects of the simulator, as well as the user interface and statistics features.

For the empirical analysis, probe vehicle data generated by TomTom's navigation devices in the commercial TomTom's HD-traffic service as well as road detector data measured at the same road section are used. A stochastic microscopic (car-following) three-phase model is further developed for simulations of a real empirical complex spatiotemporal traffic dynamics measured over a three-lane long road stretch with several different bottlenecks. Physical features and limitations of simulations of real spatiotemporal traffic dynamics are revealed. Phase transition points between free flow (F), synchronized flow (S), and wide moving jam (J) are identified along trajectories of empirical and simulated probe vehicles randomly distributed in traffic flow. As predicted by three-phase theory, the empirical probe vehicle data shows that traffic breakdown is an F -> S transition and wide' moving jams emerge only in synchronized flow, i.e., due to S -> J transitions. Through the use of the simulations, it has been found that already about 2% of probe vehicle data allows us to reconstruct traffic dynamics in space and time with an accuracy that is high enough for most applications like the generation of jam warning messages studied in the article.

Understanding Road Usage Patterns in Urban Areas	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							AIR-POLLUTION; PREDICTABILITY; MOBILITY	In this paper, we combine the most complete record of daily mobility, based on large-scale mobile phone data, with detailed Geographic Information System (GIS) data, uncovering previously hidden patterns in urban road usage. We find that the major usage of each road segment can be traced to its own - surprisingly few - driver sources. Based on this finding we propose a network of road usage by defining a bipartite network framework, demonstrating that in contrast to traditional approaches, which define road importance solely by topological measures, the role of a road segment depends on both: its betweeness and its degree in the road usage network. Moreover, our ability to pinpoint the few driver sources contributing to the major traffic flow allows us to create a strategy that achieves a significant reduction of the travel time across the entire road system, compared to a benchmark approach.

J	Zhou, YH; Yang, X; Mi, C				Zhou, Yonghua; Yang, Xun; Mi, Chao			State Estimation of Unequipped Vehicles Utilizing Microscopic Traffic Model and Principle of Particle Filter	CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING & SCIENCES			English	Article						state estimation; traffic flow; microscopic model; particle filter	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; EXTENDED KALMAN FILTER; FLOW; SIMULATION; OPTIMIZATION; FORMULATION; MANAGEMENT; NETWORKS; SYSTEMS; MATES	The movements of vehicles equipped with various positioning systems such as global and wireless positioning ones have provided beneficial channels to acquire abundant traffic flow information for total road network. However, not all vehicles are mounted with positioning systems and not all equipped positioning facilities are always active. This paper will address how to estimate the number and the states of unequipped vehicles through a series of observations on equipped ones. The proposed estimation process initiates employing the non-analytical microscopic traffic model for particle filter to estimate the number, positions and speeds of unequipped vehicles between an equipped one and another equipped one or a specified point in front. Various kinds of possible particles are utilized for the estimation process. Each kind of particle is composed of a definite number of vehicles (quarks) with possible position and speed distributions. The movements of vehicles in each particle are described through microscopic traffic simulation model. The importance of each particle is iteratively measured by the distinction between the observed states of equipped vehicle and their estimates. The position and speed information of unequipped vehicles can be roughly abstracted through the weighted sum of simulated vehicle movements in the same kind of particles. The subtotal of weights of the same kind of particles stands for the confidence level of corresponding kind of state estimates. Numerical tests have demonstrated the favorable performance of proposed estimation approach. It provides a solution to establish traffic flow database of total road network through limited mobile positioning sensors for the application of traffic planning, route guidance and signal control.

J	Chen, XQ; Li, L; Li, ZH				Chen, Xiqun; Li, Li; Li, Zhiheng			Phase Diagram Analysis Based on a Temporal-Spatial Queueing Model	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Phase diagram; ramping; temporal-spatial queueing model; traffic flow	CONGESTED TRAFFIC STATES; FUNDAMENTAL DIAGRAM; KINEMATIC WAVES; PROPAGATION; TRANSITIONS; FLOW	In this paper, we propose a simple temporal-spatial queueing model to quantitatively address some typical congestion patterns that were observed around on/off-ramps. In particular, we examine three prime factors that play important roles in ramping traffic scenarios: the time tau(in) for a vehicle to join a jam queue, the time tau(out) for this vehicle to depart from this jam queue, and the time interval T for the ramping vehicle to merge into the mainline. Based on Newell's simplified car-following model, we show how tau(in) changes with the main road flow rate q(main). Meanwhile, T is the reciprocal of the ramping road flow rate q(ramp). Thus, we analytically derive the macroscopic phase diagram plotted on the q(main)-versus-q(ramp) plane and tau(in)-versus-T plane based on the proposed model. Further study shows that the new queueing model not only reserves the merits of Newell's model on the microscopic level but helps quantify the contributions of these parameters in characterizing macroscopic congestion patterns as well. Previous approaches distinguished phases merely through simulations, but our model could derive analytical boundaries for the phases. The phase transition conditions obtained by this model agree well with simulations and empirical observations. These findings help reveal the origins of some well-known phenomena during traffic congestion.

Stochastic Modeling of Traffic Flow Breakdown Phenomenon: Application to Predicting Travel Time Reliability	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Car-following model; duration model; flow breakdown probability; heterogeneous drivers; Monte Carlo simulation; travel time reliability		This paper presents a modeling approach in generating random flow breakdowns on congested freeways and capturing subsequent wave propagation among heterogeneous drivers. The approach is intended for predicting travel time variability caused by such stochastic phenomena. It is assumed that breakdown may occur at different flow levels with some probability and would sustain for a random duration. This is modeled at the microscopic level by considering speed changes that are initiated by a leading vehicle and propagated by the following vehicles with correlated-distributed behavioral parameters. Numerical results from a Monte Carlo simulation demonstrate that the proposed stochastic modeling approach produces a realistic macroscopic traffic flow behavior and can be used to generate travel time distributions.

Despite the continuous advances in the field of traffic control under saturated conditions, novel and promising developments of simple concepts in this area remains a significant objective, because some proposed approaches that are based on various meta-heuristic optimization algorithms can hardly be used in a real-time environment. To address this problem, the recently developed notion of network fundamental diagram for urban networks is exploited to improve mobility in saturated traffic conditions via application of gating measures, based on an appropriate simple feedback control structure. As a case study, the proposed methodology is applied to the urban network of Chania, Greece, using microscopic simulation. The results show that the total delay in the network decreases significantly and the mean speed increases accordingly. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ji, YX; Geroliminis, N				Ji, Yuxuan; Geroliminis, Nikolas			On the spatial partitioning of urban transportation networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Macroscopic fundamental diagram; Traffic flow; Partitioning; Urban mobility		It has been recently shown that a macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) linking space-mean network flow, density and speed exists in the urban transportation networks under some conditions. An MFD is further well defined if the network is homogeneous with links of similar properties. This collective behavior concept can also be utilized to introduce simple control strategies to improve mobility in homogeneous city centers without the need for details in individual links. However many real urban transportation networks are heterogeneous with different levels of congestion. In order to study the existence of MFD and the feasibility of simple control strategies to improve network performance in heterogeneously congested networks, this paper focuses on the clustering of transportation networks based on the spatial features of congestion during a specific time period. Insights are provided on how to extend this framework in the dynamic case. The objectives of partitioning are to obtain (i) small variance of link densities within a cluster which increases the network flow for the same average density and (ii) spatial compactness of each cluster which makes feasible the application of perimeter control strategies. Therefore, a partitioning mechanism which consists of three consecutive algorithms, is designed to minimize the variance of link densities while maintaining the spatial compactness of the clusters. Firstly, an over segmenting of the network is provided by a sophisticated algorithm (Normalized Cut). Secondly, a merging algorithm is developed based on initial segmenting and a rough partitioning of the network is obtained. Finally, a boundary adjustment algorithm is designed to further improve the quality of partitioning by decreasing the variance of link densities while keeping the spatial compactness of the clusters. In addition, both density variance and shape smoothness metrics are introduced to identify the desired number of clusters and evaluate the partitioning results. These results show that both the objectives of small variance and spatial compactness can be achieved with this partitioning mechanism. A simulation in a real urban transportation network further demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method in effectiveness and robustness compared with other clustering algorithms.

J	Soriguera, F				Soriguera, Francesc			Deriving Traffic Flow Patterns from Historical Data	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Traffic demand; Traffic flow; Hourly traffic volumes; Pattern classification; Historical traffic data	PREDICTION; REGRESSION; VOLUME	The development and decreased cost of technology and communications have brought about a huge increase in the availability of traffic data. With every passing day, traffic management centers must deal with an increased amount of detailed data. Once the real time use of these data is complete, they must be stored for long periods of time. In this long-term context, the vast amount of raw data is meaningless, which is a clear example of data asphyxiation. Traffic management centers must aggregate and synthesize the data to extract the maximum information from them. Pattern classification is a way to deal with this issue. Traditionally, traffic demand patterns have been easily constructed using ad hoc methods, where the experience and judgment of the analyst are their main attribute. These procedures lack the required rigor to support current needs in terms of planning and operational management. This paper proposes a quantitative method to systematically derive traffic demand patterns from historical data. The method is based on the cluster analysis technique and allows for the inclusion of preexisting knowledge, which eases the interpretation and practical use of the results. The proposed pattern classification procedure is applied to 5 years of hourly traffic volumes on a Spanish highway. The obtained results prove the validity and utility of the method in accurately summarizing the seasonal and daily characteristics of traffic demand. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000456.

Cellular Automaton Modeling of the Interaction between Vehicles and Pedestrians at Signalized Crosswalk	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Mixed traffic flow; Cellular automaton; Crosswalk; Vehicles; Pedestrians	MIDBLOCK CROSSWALK; BEHAVIOR; SIMULATION; LEVEL	Characteristics of mixed traffic on a road with a signalized crosswalk are investigated by cellular automaton modeling. The interaction mechanism between vehicles and pedestrians is taken into account. Also, the inordinate behavior of vehicles near the crosswalk, and various behaviors of three types of pedestrians (i.e., careful pedestrians, normal pedestrians, and riskers), are incorporated into the proposed model. By using numerical simulations, the case for pedestrian flow consisting of careful and normal pedestrians is investigated. Phase diagrams and spatiotemporal diagrams are presented to show different traffic states. The results show that there is a critical value that divides the vehicle flow into a free flow portion and a congested flow portion. Interestingly, there are two critical values for pedestrian flow for a large signal cycle value, whereas there is only one critical value when the signal cycle value is smaller than a critical value. Finally, the variation of violating frequency against time during a signal cycle is investigated. It is found that there are two local maximum values on the frequency curves when the pedestrians consist of all three types, and this phenomenon is coincident with the qualitatively real traffic.

J	Aghabayk, K; Sarvi, M; Young, W				Aghabayk, Kayvan; Sarvi, Majid; Young, William			Understanding the Dynamics of Heavy Vehicle Interactions in Car-Following	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Traffic flow; Car following; Truck; Heavy vehicles	BEHAVIOR	Heavy vehicles and passenger cars differ in their maneuverability and acceleration capabilities. Heavy vehicles thus influence other traffic in a different manner than passenger vehicles, causing different levels of traffic instability. Increasing number and proportion of heavy vehicles in the traffic stream may result in quite different traffic flow characteristics. Over the last five decades many studies have investigated passenger car drivers' car-following behavior. However, the existence of heavy vehicles in the traffic stream has not received the same attention. This paper investigates the different car-following behavior of drivers in congested heterogeneous traffic conditions. It specifically focuses on the existence of heavy vehicles in general traffic and their interaction with other vehicles. Four different combinations of passenger car and heavy vehicle were considered. These combinations include passenger car-following a passenger car, passenger car-following a heavy vehicle, heavy vehicle following a passenger car, and heavy vehicle following another heavy vehicle. A data set from a freeway in the United States was used to show the different car-following behavior of drivers for each combination. This study analyzes space and time headways, drivers' reaction times, and vehicle accelerations. It also introduces different car-following thresholds for each car-following combination. It was found that the presence of heavy vehicles causes larger space and time headways, longer reaction time, and more robust car-following behavior. It also shows that the car-following thresholds are of the four combinations studies. The findings of this paper indicate that further research is required to develop a generalized car-following model that can be used when different vehicle types are in the traffic stream.

This paper synthesizes both reliability concepts: traffic breakdown, the indicator of the instability of travel times, is treated as the risk, whereas travel time variability, the indicator of the uncertainty of travel times, is considered as the consequence of this risk. An analytical formula, using risk assessment technique, explicitly expresses the cost of travel time unreliability as the sum of the products of the consequences (i.e. variability) and the corresponding probabilities of breakdown. It provides a novel measure of travel time reliability and is applicable in network performance evaluations. An empirical example based on a large dataset of freeway traffic flow data from loop detectors shows that the developed travel time reliability measure is both intuitively logical and consistent.

J	Berthelin, F; Broizat, D				Berthelin, Florent; Broizat, Damien			A MODEL FOR THE EVOLUTION OF TRAFFIC JAMS IN MULTI-LANE	KINETIC AND RELATED MODELS			English	Article						Traffic flow models; constrained pressureless gas dynamics; multi-lane; weak solutions; traffic jams		In [8], Berthelin, Degond, Delitala and Rascle introduced a traffic flow model describing the formation and the dynamics of traffic jams. This model consists of a Pressureless Gas Dynamics system under a maximal constraint on the density and is derived through a singular limit of the Aw-Rascle model. In the present paper we propose an improvement of this model by allowing the road to be multi-lane piecewise. The idea is to use the maximal constraint to model the number of lanes. We also add in the model a parameter a which model the various speed limitations according to the number of lanes. We present the dynamical behaviour of clusters (traffic jams) and by approximation with such solutions, we obtain an existence result of weak solutions for any initial data.

The braking and acceleration forces are based on a behavioural model and on free flow dynamics. The latter are modelled by using different fundamental diagrams. Numerical investigations for different situations illustrate the properties of the mathematical model. In particular, the emergence of stop-and-go waves is observed for suitable parameter ranges.

Use of a passive sampling network for the determination of urban NO2 spatiotemporal variations	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Nitrogen dioxide; Passive sampling; Urban air pollution; Cluster analysis; Traffic	NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; AIR-POLLUTION; EMISSIONS; SAMPLERS; SO2; VALIDATION; EXPOSURE; SITES; TREND	Nitrogen dioxide levels were systematically measured by means of passive samplers at 79 sites in the city of Elche (southeastern Spain) with the aim of investigating the factors affecting NO2 spatiotemporal variations and quantitatively assessing the impact of traffic on urban NO2 concentrations. One-week sampling campaigns were performed approximately once a month during 2007 and 2008. The average NO2 concentration during the two-year period was 32 +/- 12 mu g m(-3), with minima in summer and maxima from fall to early spring. Temporal variations of nitrogen dioxide concentrations were mainly affected by meteorological factors. On the other hand, the relative spatial distribution of NO2 levels, which remained fairly constant during the study period, was controlled by both traffic flow allocation and urban street layout. Using cluster analysis, the sampling sites were grouped into four representative classes of urban NO2 pollution, indicating that a considerable reduction in the number of measurement points for monitoring the spatial and temporal variability of nitrogen dioxide levels is feasible. By means of regression analysis, we estimated a weekly average concentration decrease of similar to 1 mu g NO2 m(-3) if a reduction of 4000 vehicles per week occurred in city centre streets. These results can be useful for improving urban air quality management and control efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Spatial and temporal characterization of traffic emissions in urban microenvironments with a mobile laboratory	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Ultrafine particles; Mobile measurements; Street canyon; Traffic pollutants; Pedestrian exposure	ULTRAFINE PARTICLES; STREET CANYON; SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS; AIR-POLLUTION; DISPERSION; EXHAUST; TRANSPORT; NANOPARTICLES; AETHALOMETER; EXPOSURE	A measurement campaign by a mobile laboratory van was performed in urban microenvironments bounded by a busy street Mannerheimintie in the city center of Helsinki, Finland. The characteristics of spatiotemporally high-resolution pollutant concentrations were studied such as ultrafine particles in the size range of 3-414 nm, black carbon BC, fine particle mass PM2.5, as well as nitrogen oxides NO and NO2. In addition, the effects of street geometry and roadside structure on the local dispersion of traffic emissions were analyzed as well. Meteorological conditions stayed stable and the wind direction was perpendicular to Mannerheimintie during the campaign. The highest particle concentrations were similar to 8 x 10(5) cm(-3), of which around 94% was smaller than 40 nm. At the pavement, the average concentration was in maximum 5 x 10(4) cm(-3); around 80% of the particles was smaller than 40 nm. The volatility fraction was 75% by number. Due to the street canyon effect by the surrounding buildings, the downwind concentrations were around 24% of the upwind concentrations for particle number, 28% of NO, 39% of BC and 70% of NO2 concentrations. Furthermore, the upwind concentrations were higher than the simultaneously measured concentrations within the traffic flow. In fact, the particle count was around 3-fold, BC 2.5-fold, PM2.5 and NO2 1.5-fold compared to the concentrations while driving. Thus, for this measurement site and under these meteorological conditions, the exposure to pedestrians and cyclist on the upwind pavement is even higher than the driver's exposure. If the downwind buildings were parallel to Mannerheimintie, the concentrations dropped significantly at the pavement and continued decreasing slightly in the courtyards. When the downwind buildings were perpendicular to Mannerheimintie, a gradual reduction in the concentrations between the buildings was observed. However, at a distance of approximately a hundred meters a parallel side street which was a street canyon, started to affect the concentrations resulting in an increased exposure risk for pedestrians and cyclists. Understanding the local transport and the dispersion of traffic emissions are important for city planning and air quality assessment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Chiou, JM				Chiou, Jeng-Min			DYNAMICAL FUNCTIONAL PREDICTION AND CLASSIFICATION, WITH APPLICATION TO TRAFFIC FLOW PREDICTION	ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Clustering; discrimination; functional regression; mixture model; subspace projection; traffic flow rate; intelligent transportation system	VS. GENERATIVE CLASSIFIERS; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; MODELS; MORTALITY; VOLUME; RATES	Motivated by the need for accurate traffic flow prediction in transportation management, we propose a functional data method to analyze traffic flow patterns and predict future traffic flow. In this study we approach the problem by sampling traffic flow trajectories from a mixture of stochastic processes. The proposed functional mixture prediction approach combines functional prediction with probabilistic functional classification to take distinct traffic flow patterns into account. The probabilistic classification procedure, which incorporates functional clustering and discrimination, hinges on sub-space projection. The proposed methods not only assist in predicting traffic flow trajectories, but also identify distinct patterns in daily traffic flow of typical temporal trends and variabilities. The proposed methodology is widely applicable in analysis and prediction of longitudinally recorded functional data.

J	Munir, S; Chen, HB; Ropkins, K				Munir, Said; Chen, Haibo; Ropkins, Karl			Modelling the impact of road traffic on ground level ozone concentration using a quantile regression approach	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Tropospheric ozone; Quantile regression model; Road traffic flow; Vehicles speed; Urban decrement; Leeds UK	UK	Road traffic is both a major source of ozone precursors (e.g. nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons) and a potential local sink for ozone in the form of fresh nitric oxide (NO) that depletes ozone. This study investigates the effect of road traffic characteristics on ground level ozone concentration (ppb) applying a quantile regression model (QRM). QRM has certain advantages over other regression methods, including its applicability to non-normal ozone distribution and its ability to handle non-linearities in the relationship of ozone with its covariates. The paper is developed in two parts. In the first part ozone concentrations at urban and rural sites have been compared using data from 80 ozone monitoring sites throughout the UK. The model results in an average urban decrement of about 7 ppb (26%) but indicates variations at various quantiles of the ozone distribution, for instance the difference is 5.25 ppb (25%) and 10.78 ppb (30%) at quantile 0.1 and 0.99, respectively. In the second part the effect of road-traffic characteristics (traffic flow, speed and fleet composition) on urban decrement has been modelled, as a case study in Leeds, UK. The relationship between urban decrement and road traffic characteristics changes at different regimes of ozone distribution indicating a highly non-linear association. Flow of cars, buses and articulated heavy vehicles seem to have the strongest effect on urban decrement; however buses are the only category showing significant effect at all quantiles. The effect of average speed and motorcycles flow was not significant. The results of QRM show that up to 86% ozone variations between rural and urban sites can be explained with the help of traffic characteristics. The effect of various traffic scenarios on urban decrements has been investigated. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Impacts of freeway traffic conditions on in-vehicle exposure to ultrafine particulate matter	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						In-vehicle exposure; Roadway concentrations; Ultrafine particles; Detailed traffic data; Traffic congestion	PARTICLE CONCENTRATION RATIOS; DIESEL EXHAUST INHALATION; LOS-ANGELES; ON-ROADWAY; CABIN; DAMAGE; DYSFUNCTION; POLLUTANTS; EMISSIONS; DNA	There is evidence of adverse health impacts from human exposure to traffic-related ultrafine particulate matter pollution. As more commuters are spending a significant portion of their daily routine inside vehicles, it is increasingly relevant to study exposure levels to harmful pollutants inside the vehicle microenvironment. This study is one of the first research efforts to combine detailed freeway traffic data (at 20 s intervals) and in-vehicle ultrafine particulate (UFP) exposure data under varying vehicle ventilation conditions. Results show that due to negative correlation between traffic speed and density, traffic states have a small but significant impact on in-vehicle UFP concentrations, highest in high traffic flowhigh speed conditions or in high traffic density-low speed conditions. Vehicle cabin barrier effects are the primary determinant of in-vehicle exposure concentrations, providing 15% protection with the windows down, 47% protection with the windows up and the vent open, and 83-90% protection with the windows up and the vent closed (more with the air conditioning on). Unique results from this study include the dominance of ventilation over traffic effects on UFP and the non-linear relationships between traffic variables and UFP concentrations. The results of this research have important implications for exposure modeling and potential exposure mitigation strategies. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Guiding traffic in the case of big events with spot checks on traffic and additional parking space requirements	CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article						Traffic routing; Big events; Spot checks on traffic; Cell-transmission model; Mixed-integer programming	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; ROAD NETWORK; SIMULATION	Big events lead to temporary very high traffic volumes which usually exceed traffic capabilities of the existing infrastructure. Hence, it is necessary to control traffic in a way that helps to keep traffic congestion as low as possible. In this paper we introduce a traffic planning model for big events which optimizes traffic routing, allocates parking space, and defines locations for spot checks on traffic. We extend and modify a traffic flow model that has successfully been used in previous work on evacuation planning. A computational study demonstrates the model's applicability to a real world situation.

J	Zheng, L; Zhong, SQ; Jin, PJ; Ma, SF				Zheng, Liang; Zhong, Shiquan; Jin, Peter J.; Ma, Shoufeng			Influence of lateral discomfort on the stability of traffic flow based on visual angle car-following model	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Car following; Lateral discomfort; Visual angle; Stability analysis	INFORMATION; DYNAMICS; STATES	Due to the poor road markings and irregular driving behaviors, not every vehicle is positioned in the center of the lane. The deviation from the center can cause discomfort to drivers in the neighboring lane, which is referred to as lateral discomfort (or lateral friction). Such lateral discomfort can be incorporated into the driver stimulus-response framework by considering the visual angle and its changing rate from the psychological viewpoint. In this study, a two-lane visual angle based car-following model is proposed and its stability condition is obtained through linear stability theory. Further derivations indicate that the neutral stability line of the model is asymmetry and four factors including the vehicle width and length, the lateral separation and the sensitivity regarding the changing rate of visual angle have large impacts on the stability of traffic flow. Numerical simulations further verify these theoretical results, and demonstrate that the behaviors of diverging, merging and lane changing can break the original steady state and cause traffic fluctuations. However, these fluctuations may be alleviated to some extent by reducing the lateral discomfort. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A discrete-time car-dynamics describing the traffic on a 1-lane road without passing is interpreted as a dynamic programming equation of a stochastic optimal control problem of a Markov chain. This variational formulation permits to characterize the stability of the car-dynamics and to determine the stationary regimes when they exist.

An Investigation on Vehicle's Fuel consumption and Exhaust Emissions in Different Driving Conditions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Vehicle; Fuel consumption; Exhaust emission; Driving pattern; K-means clustering; Traffic condition	PATTERN-RECOGNITION; TRAFFIC FLOW	In this paper, vehicle's fuel consumption and exhaust emissions are investigated in different driving conditions based on driving segments clustering. Driving data collection is performed using global positioning systems in real traffic conditions. The driving data is clustered into five groups using k-means clustering technique. Vehicle's fuel consumption and exhaust emissions (i.e. HC, NOx and CO) are investigated in different driving conditions using computer simulations. The relationship between driving features and vehicle's fuel consumption and exhaust emissions is also presented. According to the simulation results, vehicle's fuel consumption decreases as average velocity increases from very congested traffic condition to freeway traffic condition. The most HC is produced is low speeds. The results also demonstrate that high accelerations and decelerations cause high amount of NOx. About the CO emission, a moderate driving in which the velocity and accelerations are not very high or very low, leads to the least amount of CO.

The objective of this paper is to gain new insight regarding the composition of traffic flows, and to reveal how and to what extent suburbanites' travelling affects rush hour traffic. We put forward an alternative methodological approach using call detail records of mobile phones to assess the composition of traffic flows during the evening rush hour in Tallinn, Estonia. We found that daily commuting and suburbanites influence transportation demand by amplifying the evening rush hour traffic, although daily commuting trips comprises only 31% of all movement at that time. The geography of the Friday evening rush hour is distinctive from other working days, presumably in connection with domestic tourism and leisure time activities. This suggests that the rise of the overall mobility of individuals due to societal changes may play a greater role in evening rush hour traffic conditions than does the impact of suburbanisation.

J	Liu, RH; Hyman, G				Liu, Ronghui; Hyman, Geoff			Modelling motorway merge: The current practice in the UK and towards establishing general principles	TRANSPORT POLICY			English	Article						Merge capacity; Delays at merge; Pcu values; Microsimulation	DRIVING BEHAVIOR; FREEWAY CAPACITY; BREAKDOWN	Motorway merging has been regarded as a major source of conflicts and congestion, but has long been recognised as an area in which modelling has been relatively weak. The current traffic models represent the traffic operations at a merge are based on gap-acceptance approach, with the merging traffic givingway to traffic on the mainline carriageway and imposing little or no delay to the mainline traffic. The results tend to overestimate delays to the merging traffic, and underestimate delays and interruptions to the mainline traffic. This paper investigates the current practice in modelling motorway merge in the UK and highlights some major conceptual and methodological differences to those in the US and Germany. Studies based on empirical observations and a dynamic, behaviour-based microsimulation modelling were carried out to improve understanding of the factors involved in the performance at merge. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of model predictions - and perhaps policy decisions - to the behavioural assumptions made in traffic models. The paper provides simple, practical recommendations to improve the current practice on modelling merge by the consideration of peak flow profile in the estimation of merge capacity, realistic local and variable pcu values for heavy vehicles, and a more confined merge influence area than currently advised in the UK guidelines. It calls for further empirical and behavioural-based microsimulation analysis and for the explicit consideration of the variability of traffic flows and dynamic congestion effects on merge, to improve the model predictions and provide better investment decisions.

In this paper, an attempt is made to develop a random utility-based discrete multinomial choice model for the behavior of automobile drivers while selecting toll lanes at a toll plaza. Specifically, a multinomial logit model is developed and calibrated using disaggregate level choice data from three toll plazas with different geometry and rates of arrival of vehicles. The calibrated logit models from the different sites when statistically compared show that a generic model, applicable to all the sites, is possible. Such a generic model is also developed. The use of the proposed model can improve the analysis of traffic flow at toll plazas and ultimately lead to more effective designs of these facilities. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000440.

J	Sun, SL; Huang, RQ; Gao, Y				Sun, Shiliang; Huang, Rongqing; Gao, Ya			Network-Scale Traffic Modeling and Forecasting with Graphical Lasso and Neural Networks	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Traffic flow forecasting; Graphical lasso (GL); Neural network (NN); Gaussian process regression (GPR)	FLOW; SELECTION; PREDICTION; VOLUME	Traffic flow forecasting, especially the short-term case, is an important topic in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). This paper researches network-scale modeling and forecasting of short-term traffic flows. First, the concepts of single-link and multilink models of traffic flow forecasting are proposed. Secondly, four prediction models are constructed by combining the two models with single-task learning (STL) and multitask learning (MTL). The combination of the multilink model and multitask learning not only improves the experimental efficiency but also improves the prediction accuracy. Moreover, a new multilink, single-task approach that combines graphical lasso (GL) with neural network (NN) is proposed. GL provides a general methodology for solving problems involving lots of variables. Using L1 regularization, GL builds a sparse graphical model, making use of the sparse inverse covariance matrix. Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a classic regression algorithm in Bayesian machine learning. Although there is wide research on GPR, there are few applications of GPR in traffic flow forecasting. In this paper, GPR is applied to traffic flow forecasting, and its potential is shown. Through sufficient experiments, all of the proposed approaches are compared, and an overall assessment is made. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000435. (C) 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

An investigation of merging and diverging cars on a multi-lane road using a cellular automation model	CHINESE PHYSICS B			English	Article						traffic flow; merging and diverging area; intelligent transportation system; cellular automation	TRAFFIC-FLOW MODEL; SELF-ORGANIZATION; WEAVING SECTION; LANE; TRANSITION; RULES	In this paper, we have investigated two observed situations in a multi-lane road. The first one concerns a fast merging vehicle. The second situation is related to the case of a fast vehicle leaving the fastest lane back into the slowest lane and targeting a specific way out. We are interested in the relaxation time tau, i.e., which is the time that the merging (diverging) vehicle spends before reaching the desired lane. Using analytical treatment and numerical simulations for the NaSch model, we have found two states, namely, the free state in which the merging (diverging) vehicle reaches the desired lane, and the trapped state in which tau diverges. We have established phase diagrams for several values of the braking probability. In the second situation, we have shown that diverging from the fast lane targeting a specific way out is not a simple task. Even if the diverging vehicle is in the free phase, two different states can be distinguished. One is the critical state, in which the diverging car can probably reach the desired way out. The other is the safe state, in which the diverging car can surely reach the desired way out. In order to be in the safe state, we have found that the driver of the diverging car must know the critical distance (below which the way out will be out of his reach) in each lane. Furthermore, this critical distance depends on the density of cars, and it follows an exponential law.

Unlike previous works, where the reaction delay is considered to be fixed, in this paper, a modified neural network approach is proposed to simulate and predict the car-following behavior based on the instantaneous reaction delay of the driver-vehicle unit as the human effects. This reaction delay is calculated based on a proposed idea, and the model is developed based on this feature as an input. In this modeling, the inputs and outputs are chosen with respect to the reaction delay to train the neural network model. Using the field data, the performance of the model is calculated and compared with the responses of some existing neural network car-following models. Considering the difference between the responses of the actual plant and the predicted model as the error, comparison shows that the error in the proposed model is significantly smaller than that that in the other models.

J	Bae, SH; Heo, TY; Ryu, BY				Bae, Sang-Hoon; Heo, Tae-Young; Ryu, Byoung-Yong			An evaluation of the ramp metering effectiveness in reducing carbon dioxide emissions	SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Intelligent Transportation System; Ramp Metering; Greenhouse Gas; CO2 Reduction; State Preference Analysis; TSIS Simulation		In this study, we develop a methodology to estimate the effectiveness of ramp metering in reducing CO2 emissions. Ramp metering is one of several Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications to control traffic flow. In this paper in order to estimate the reduced emissions, we followed the procedure supported by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UN-FCCC). And ramp metering causes some drivers to change their routes and affects CO2 emissions on the ramp and on the main lane. With these issues in mind, we performed Stated Preference analysis to determine the degree of driver preference for individual traffic situations.The Traffic Software Integrated System (TSIS) simulation program was used to verify the CO2 measurement model. The TSIS simulation showed that the reduction in CO2 emissions was 818.4 kg/h and that the decrease in the effectiveness was 7.3%. It also revealed that ramp metering reduced the CO2. emissions to 3,273.6kg emissions per day and 1,194.9 ton per year. In conclusion we found that ramp metering is effective in reducing CO2 emissions.

Michael			Simulation analysis for evacuation under congested traffic scenarios: a case study	SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						transportation and traffic; planning and forecasting; emergency planning and management	MODEL	In this paper a new simulation modeling approach to support evacuation traffic management is introduced and a case study is presented. Traditional traffic simulation models neglect some real-life factors that need to be considered in an evacuation, such as the effect of road information and active control measures to manage traffic flow while vehicles are competing to find the best or preferred route. A passive equilibrium-seeking modeling approach may not be suitable for evacuation trip analysis due to limited route capacity and likely severe congestion during an evacuation. This paper introduces a new updated cell transmission model using discrete-event simulation, which can review and analyze the preferred path of evacuation traffic from multiple starting locations (or originations) to multiple destinations. Using this approach, case studies are conducted based on the user equilibrium principle, since it represents a natural behavior in an evacuation process. This research also demonstrates that, with the help of the cell transmission simulation model, an active traffic control mechanism can be evaluated. This study found that active traffic control measures are capable of decreasing total travel time during an evacuation by thousands of vehicle hours. Incorporating behavior consideration into the evacuation planning can help form a more accurate and realistic analysis of an evacuation plan.	[Duanmu, Jun; Robinson, R.

J	Haworth, J; Cheng, T				Haworth, James; Cheng, Tao			Non-parametric regression for space-time forecasting under missing data	COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS			English	Article						Kernel regression; Missing data; Spatio-temporal; Transport; Journey time; Imputation	TRAFFIC FLOW; NEURAL-NETWORKS; WEIGHTED REGRESSION; IMPUTATION; MODELS; VALUES; PREDICTION; COUNTS; ISSUES; WAVES	As more and more real time spatio-temporal datasets become available at increasing spatial and temporal resolutions, the provision of high quality, predictive information about spatio-temporal processes becomes an increasingly feasible goal. However, many sensor networks that collect spatio-temporal information are prone to failure, resulting in missing data. To complicate matters, the missing data is often not missing at random, and is characterised by long periods where no data is observed. The performance of traditional univariate forecasting methods such as ARIMA models decreases with the length of the missing data period because they do not have access to local temporal information. However, if spatio-temporal autocorrelation is present in a space-time series then spatio-temporal approaches have the potential to offer better forecasts. In this paper, a non-parametric spatio-temporal kernel regression model is developed to forecast the future unit journey time values of road links in central London. UK, under the assumption of sensor malfunction. Only the current traffic patterns of the upstream and downstream neighbouring links are used to inform the forecasts. The model performance is compared with another form of non-parametric regression, K-nearest neighbours, which is also effective in forecasting under missing data. The methods show promising forecasting performance, particularly in periods of high congestion. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Macroscopic traffic equations with multi-valued fundamental diagrams are derived from different microscopic and kinetic models. Numerical experiments show similarities and differences of the models, in particular, for the appearance and structure of stop and go waves for highway traffic in dense situations.

J	Zhong, SQ; Zhou, LZ; Ma, SF; Jia, N				Zhong, Shiquan; Zhou, Lizhen; Ma, Shoufeng; Jia, Ning			Effects of different factors on drivers' guidance compliance behaviors under road condition information shown on VMS	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						VMS; Compliance behavior; Influencing factors; Ordinal regression; Guidance mode	VARIABLE MESSAGE SIGNS; ROUTE CHOICE BEHAVIOR; TRAFFIC INFORMATION; SYSTEMS; SIMULATOR; MODEL	It is generally accepted that compliance behavior is affected by many factors. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of diverse factors on drivers' guidance compliance behaviors under road condition information shown on graphic variable message sign (VMS), and based on this to find out a better information release mode. The involved data were obtained from questionnaire survey, and ordinal regression was used to analyze the casual relation between guidance compliance behavior and its influencing factors. Based on an overall analysis of conditions in driver's route choice, an accurate method was proposed to calculate the compliance rate. The model testing information indicated that ordinal regression model with complementary log-log being the link function was appropriate to quantify the relation between the compliance rate and the factors. The estimation results showed that age, driving years, average annual mileage, monthly income, driving style, occupation, the degree of trust in VMS, the familiarity with road network and the route choice style were significant determinants of guidance compliance behavior. This paper also compared two different guidance modes which were ordinary guidance mode (M1) and predicted guidance mode (M2) through simulation. The average speed fluctuations and average travel time supported that M2 had better effect in improving traffic flow and balancing traffic load and resource. Some detailed suggestions of releasing guidance information were proposed with the explanation by flow-density curve and variation of traffic flows. These findings are the foundation to design and improve guidance systems by assessing guidance effect and modifying guidance algorithm. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We study the formation mechanism of the nm-vehicle illegal lane-changing behavior (NILB) by considering the overtaking motivation and the traffic safety awareness. In the framework of Kerner's three-phase theory, we propose a model for the mixed traffic flow by introducing a new set of rules. A series of simulations are carried out in order to reveal the formation, travel process and influence of the mixed traffic flow. The simulation results show that the proposed model can be used to study not only the travel characteristic of the mixed traffic flow, but also some complex traffic problems such as traffic breakdown, moving synchronized flow pattern (MSP) and moving jam. Moreover, the results illustrate that the proposed model reflects the phenomenon of the mixed flow and the influence of the MSP caused by the NILB, which is consistent with the actual traffic system, and thus this work is helpful for the management of the mixed traffic flow.

A new model is proposed to describe the motion of vehicles running on a curved road. The stability condition is obtained by the use of control theories. The nonlinear analysis method is taken to derive the modified KdV (Korteweg-de Vries) equation and the kink-antikink solution is obtained near the critical point. Simulations are carried out to verify the double effects upon traffic flow. The flux increases but the stability decreases with an increase of the two parameters. Numerical results are in good agreement with the analytical results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Nagatani, T; Tobita, K				Nagatani, Takashi; Tobita, Kazuhiro			Vehicular motion in counter traffic flow through a series of signals controlled by a phase shift	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic dynamics; Signal control; Nonlinear map; Counter flow; Complex system	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; BUS-ROUTE; LATTICE MODEL; TRANSITION; STATES; SEQUENCE; SIMULATION; KINETICS; PHYSICS; SYSTEM	We study the dynamical behavior of counter traffic flow through a sequence of signals (traffic lights) controlled by a phase shift. There are two lanes for the counter traffic flow: the first lane is for east-bound vehicles and the second lane is for west-bound vehicles. The green-wave strategy is studied in the counter traffic flow where the phase shift of signals in the second lane has opposite sign to that in the first lane. A nonlinear dynamic model of the vehicular motion is presented by nonlinear maps at a low density. There is a distinct difference between the traffic flow in the first lane and that in the second lane. The counter traffic flow exhibits very complex behavior on varying the cycle time, the phase difference, and the split. Also, the fundamental diagram is derived by the use of the cellular automaton (CA) model. The dependence of east-bound and west-bound vehicles on cycle time, phase difference, and density is clarified. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

PREDICTING URBAN TRIP GENERATION USING A FUZZY EXPERT SYSTEM	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FUZZY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Trip generation; Multiple linear regression; Membership function; Fuzzy rules; Fuzzy expert system	TRAFFIC FLOW; REGRESSION; TRANSPORTATION; MODEL; NETWORKS; VARIABLES	One of the most important stages in the urban transportation planning procedure is predicting the rate of trips generated by each traffic zone. Currently, multiple linear regression models are frequently used as a prediction tool. This method predicts the number of trips produced from, or attracted to each traffic zone according to the values of independent, variables for that zone. One of the main limitations of this method is its huge dependency on the exact prediction of independent variables in future (horizon of the plan). The other limitation is its many assumptions, which raise challenging questions of its application. The current paper attempts to use fuzzy logic and its capabilities to estimate the trip generation of urban zones. A fuzzy expert system is introduced, which is able to make suitable predictions using uncertain and inexact, data. Results of the study on the data for Mashhad (Lon: 59.37 E, Lat: 36.19 N) show that this method can be a good competitor for multiple linear regression method, specially, when there is no exact data for independent variables.

J	Yin, WH; Murray-Tuite, P; Wernstedt, K				Yin, Weihao; Murray-Tuite, Pamela; Wernstedt, Kris			Incident-Induced Diversion Behavior: Existence, Magnitude, and Contributing Factors	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Transportation; Traffic; Incident; Diversion; Route switching; Statistical model; Detector	ROUTE CHOICE MODEL; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS; DRIVER BEHAVIOR; LEVEL SHIFTS; TIME-SERIES; PROPENSITY; PREFERENCE; DYNAMICS; MESSAGE; ATIS	The need to understand the effects of diverting traffic is emphasized by growing congestion and delays. This paper examines incident-induced diversion behavior by using loop-detector data and incident records on a freeway in Virginia. This work diverges from previous studies by (1) addressing both existence of diversion and its magnitude, (2) relying on field data rather than surveys, and (3) statistically relating diversion behavior and magnitude to quantifiable incident characteristics and traffic conditions. A dynamic programming-based procedure is used to identify diversions by isolating transient level shifts, and the diversions are associated with incident and traffic characteristics and variable message sign (VMS) displays through a binary logit model. The magnitude of the diversion is statistically related to traffic conditions via a linear regression model. The models indicate that the probability of triggering a diversion increases when an incident lasts longer, more general-purpose lanes are blocked, and speeds are lower. The results on the effects of trip purpose/time and information availability are consistent with previous studies. The magnitude of the diversion, measured by diversion rate, is related to instant traffic flow characteristics, general traffic demand considerations, and the incident characteristics.

Michael			Freeway Recurrent Bottleneck Identification Algorithms Considering Detector Data Quality Issues	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article						Bottleneck identification; Fundamental diagrams of traffic flow; Loop detector data quality	FLOW	Computer algorithms used to identify recurrent freeway bottlenecks have been studied since the deployment of loop detecting systems. Such algorithms automatically analyze the archived loop detector data and identify potential recurrent bottlenecks and their characteristics, such as location, time of day, and activation rate, for further investigation. In a highway congestion mitigation project, such algorithms can save time and resources for the initial screening of bottlenecks over a large freeway network. These algorithms include rule-based, contour-map-based, and simulation-based methods. However, existing methods require loop detector data with high accuracy and consistency, which is difficult to achieve in prevailing loop detecting systems. This paper proposes a new bottleneck identification algorithm with strong error and noise tolerance. Several simple denoising methods to improve the error resistance of existing algorithms are also proposed. Using statistical error analysis methods, the proposed algorithm and the denoising methods were calibrated and evaluated using field data collected from two distinct freeway corridors (US 12/14 and I-894) in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. Ground truth data for this study come from the manual inspection of 287,055 traffic video snapshots in the course of a month. In the evaluation tests, the proposed algorithm can produce quality congestion identification results with fewer false alarms than the existing algorithms, especially when identifying severe bottleneck congestion.

J	Ng, MW				Ng, ManWo			Traffic Flow Theory-Based Stochastic Optimization Model for Work Zones on Two-Lane Highways	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article						Traffic flow; Maintenance; Highway and road management; Transportation models	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; KINEMATIC WAVES; FORMULATION; CAPACITY	Road maintenance is essential to ensure a safe and efficient transportation system. Unfortunately, work zones can give rise to significant delays to road users. In this paper, two major limitations in the current work zone optimization models are addressed. First, we relax the assumption of determinism, and model vehicle arrivals as being stochastic. While previous work has shown that this relaxation is important in the quantification of user delay at work zones, no model exists that explicitly accounts for stochasticity in the optimization of work zones. Second, unlike in previous work in which idealized traffic flow modeling techniques have been used, the proposed model employs the traffic flow theory-based cell transmission model, yielding a more accurate and realistic representation of traffic flow dynamics. The focus in this paper is on two-lane two-way highways. A case study is presented to illustrate the proposed model. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000425.

J	Knorr, F; Schreckenberg, M				Knorr, Florian; Schreckenberg, Michael			On the reproducibility of spatiotemporal traffic dynamics with microscopic traffic models	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT			English	Article						cellular automata; traffic and crowd dynamics; traffic models	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; FLOW; PHYSICS	Traffic flow is a very prominent example of a driven non-equilibrium system. A characteristic phenomenon of traffic dynamics is the spontaneous and abrupt drop of the average velocity on a stretch of road leading to congestion. Such a traffic breakdown corresponds to a boundary-induced phase transition from free flow to congested traffic. In this paper, we study the ability of selected microscopic traffic models to reproduce a traffic breakdown, and we investigate its spatiotemporal dynamics. For our analysis, we use empirical traffic data from stationary loop detectors on a German Autobahn showing a spontaneous breakdown. We then present several methods to assess the results and compare the models with each other. In addition, we will also discuss some important modeling aspects and their impact on the resulting spatiotemporal pattern. The investigation of different downstream boundary conditions, for example, shows that the physical origin of the traffic breakdown may be artificially induced by the setup of the boundaries.

I-710 and Route 110.I-710 is a major route for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) traveling to and from the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, while Route 110 has a much lower HDV fraction -3.9% versus 11.4%. Two sets of samples were collected for each roadway, each set representing approximately 50 degrees h of on-road sampling. Concurrent sampling at a fixed site at the University of Southern California's (USC) downtown Los Angeles campus provided estimates of urban background levels. Chemical analysis was performed for elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), hopanes and steranes, and metals and trace elements. Freeway-based emission rates (ERs) - mass per kilometer of freeway per hour - were calculated using mass concentrations, fuel characteristics, and traffic flow rates. These ERs are presented such that freeways could be treated as a line source of emissions for use in predictive models of population exposure for nearby communities. This data could also be used to assess the exposure of commuters to traffic-related PM2.5 emissions. ERs are compared to data from a previous fixed-site roadside study of I-710 as well as to reconstructed values from a tunnel study. ERs were generally lower (or comparable) on the gasoline-vehicle dominated freeway (Route 110) than the freeway with more diesel trucks (I-710), with EC and pyrene being notably lower on Route 110, findings consistent with the Route 110's lower HDV fraction. We found EC emission rates decreased over time suggesting that efforts to reduce diesel emissions from HDVs at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have been successful. While ERs for most of the organic species were within the range of values reported by previous studies, the present study found much higher ERs for metals and trace elements. This suggests that the sampling methods employed in this campaign are more efficient at capturing particles from sources such as resuspended road dust and wear from tires and brakes, which are usually not included in traditional sampling methodologies for assessing vehicular emissions (e.g. dynamometer studies).

Using recorded sound spectra profile as input data for real-time short-term urban road-traffic-flow estimation	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Road traffic; Sound spectra; Estimation models; Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks; Fisher linear discriminant; Multiple linear regression	NOISE; NETWORKS; PARAMETERS; EVENTS; MODELS	Road traffic has a heavy impact on the urban sound environment, constituting the main source of noise and widely dominating its spectral composition. In this context, our research investigates the use of recorded sound spectra as input data for the development of real-time short-term road traffic flow estimation models. For this, a series of models based on the use of Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks, multiple linear regression, and the Fisher linear discriminant were implemented to estimate road traffic flow as well as to classify it according to the composition of heavy vehicles and motorcycles/mopeds. In view of the results, the use of the 50-400 Hz and 1-2.5 kHz frequency ranges as input variables in multilayer perceptron-based models successfully estimated urban road traffic flow with an average percentage of explained variance equal to 86%, while the classification of the urban road traffic flow gave an average success rate of 96.1%.

J	Alecsandru, C; Ishak, S; Qi, Y				Alecsandru, Ciprian; Ishak, Sherif; Qi, Yan			Passenger car equivalents of trucks on four-lane rural freeways under lane restriction and different traffic conditions	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						freeway operation; lane restriction; differential speed limit; passenger car equivalents; traffic simulation; truck impact	SPEED LIMITS; SAFETY	Truck lane restriction and differential speed limits for trucks and passenger cars are becoming more common policies to improve freeway operations and safety. The most recent edition of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) recognizes that the passenger car equivalent (E-T) values may differ with various traffic conditions, but does not explicitly address how E-T values may be impacted by truck lane restrictions or differential speed limit policies. This study developed a flow-based methodology to determine E-T for trucks under truck lane restriction policies and different levels of demand and traffic composition. A simulation model (VISSIM) was calibrated to reproduce E-T in HCM on a level terrain freeway segment and then used to simulate various scenarios to capture the effect of demand flow rate, truck percentage, and compliance ratio to lane restriction, all under the enforcement of differential speed limit policy. The results showed that E-T increases as the compliance ratio increases, regardless of the truck percentage and demand flow rate. For a given traffic flow rate, E-T decreases as the truck percentage increases. Moreover, regardless of the compliance ratio to lane restriction and the truck percentage, E-T increases with the demand flow rate. The statistical analysis revealed that the truck percentage has a significant effect on E-T for most cases, except when the truck percentage exceeds 30%. The results also showed significant differences in E-T for all demand flow rates at 95% confidence level. The study also developed linear regression models for each level of service to estimate the value of E-T as a function of the truck percentage and compliance ratio.

J	Li, ZP; Zhou, Y				Li Zhi-Peng; Zhou Ying			Impact of the Next-Nearest-Neighbor Interaction on Traffic Flow of Highway with Slopes	COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						traffic flow; traffic jam; next-nearest-neighbor interaction	OPTIMAL VELOCITY MODEL; MODIFIED KDV EQUATION; NONLINEAR-ANALYSIS; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; DYNAMICAL MODEL; DENSITY WAVES; CAR; STABILIZATION; STABILITY	In this paper, we study the motion course of traffic flow on the slopes of a highway by applying a microscopic traffic model, which takes into account the next-nearest-neighbor interaction in an intelligent transportation system environment. Three common gradients of the highway, which are sag terrain, uphill terrain, and downhill terrain on a single-lane roadway, are selected to clarify the impact on the traffic flow by the next-nearest-neighbor interaction in relative velocity. We obtain the current-density relation for traffic flow on the sag, the uphill and the downhill under the next-nearest-neighbor interaction strategy. It is observed that the current saturates when the density is greater than a critical value and the current decreases when the density is greater than another critical value. When the density falls into the intermediate range between the two critical densities it is also found that the oscillatory jam, easily leads to traffic accidents, often appears in the downhill stage, and the next-nearest-neighbor interaction in relative velocity has a strong suppressing effect on this kind of dangerous congestion. A theoretical analysis is also presented to explain this important conclusion.

The reasons for such a traffic breakdown are perturbations caused by human drivers in dense traffic. We present a strategy to reduce traffic congestion with the help of vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Periodically emitted beacons are used to analyze traffic flow and to warn other drivers of a possible traffic breakdown. Drivers who receive such a warning are told to keep a larger gap to their predecessor. By doing so, they are less likely to be the source of perturbations, which can cause a traffic breakdown. We analyze the proposed strategy via computer simulations and investigate which fraction of communicating vehicles is necessary until a beneficial influence on traffic flow is observable. We show that penetration rates of 10% and less can have significant influence on traffic flow and travel times. In addition to applying a realistic mobility model, we further increase the degree of realism by the use of empirical traffic data from loop detectors on a German Autobahn.

Firstly, we explore the effects of road condition on uniform flow from analytical and numerical perspectives. The results indicate that road condition has great influences on uniform flow, i.e., good road condition can enhance the velocity and flow and their increments will increase when road condition becomes better; bad road conditions will reduce the velocity and flow and their reductions will increase when road condition turns worse. Secondly, we study the effects of road conditions on the starting and braking processes. The numerical results show that good road condition will speed up the two processes and that bad road condition will slow down the two processes. Finally, we study the effects of road condition on small perturbation. The numerical results indicate that the stop-and-go phenomena resulted by small perturbation will become more serious when the road condition becomes better.

Phys. Soc. Jpn. 70, 2793 (2001); 70, 3747 (2001)], has been studied on the basis of the local occupation probability method. However, in this work, based on the novel theoretical analysis and computer simulations, we have studied this crossroad traffic model again and presented the same phase diagrams of traffic flow in the case of various maximum vehicle velocities. We have also derived the flow formulas in all regions in the phase diagrams, which are in good agreement with computer simulation results. Compared with the previous local occupation probability method, our analytical way is simpler and may be widely used for other traffic bottlenecks research.

The effects of electric vehicles on residential households in the city of Indianapolis	ENERGY POLICY			English	Article						Electric vehicles; Electricity grid; Electricity tariffs	WIND POWER; ENERGY; SYSTEMS	There is an increasing impetus to transform the U.S transportation sector and transition away from the uncertainties of oil supply. One of the most viable current solutions is the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). These vehicles allow for a transportation system that would be flexible in its fuel demands. However, utilities may need to address questions such as distribution constraints, electricity tariffs and incentives and public charging locations before large scale electric vehicle adoption can be realized. In this study, the effect of electric vehicles on households in Indianapolis is examined. A four-step traffic flow model is used to characterize the usage characteristics of vehicles in the Indianapolis metropolitan area. This data is then used to simulate EV usage patterns which can be used to determine household electricity usage characteristics. These results are differentiated by the zones with which the households are associated. Economic costs are then calculated for the individual households. Finally, possible public charging locations are examined. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper we combine a macroscopic model of traffic congestion in urban networks with an agent-based simulator to study congestion pricing schemes. The macroscopic model, which has been tested with real data in previous studies, represents an accurate and robust approach to model the dynamics of congestion. The agent-based simulator can reproduce the complexity of travel behavior in terms of travelers' choices and heterogeneity. This integrated approach is superior to traditional pricing schemes. On one hand, traffic simulators (including car-following, lane-changing and route choice models) consider travel behavior, i.e. departure time choice, inelastic to the level of congestion. On the other hand, most congestion pricing models utilize supply models insensitive to demand fluctuations and non-stationary conditions. This is not consistent with the physics of traffic and the dynamics of congestion. Furthermore, works that integrate the above features in pricing models are assuming deterministic and homogeneous population characteristics. In this paper, we first demonstrate by case studies in Zurich urban road network, that the output of a agent-based simulator is consistent with the physics of traffic flow dynamics, as defined by a Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). We then develop and apply a dynamic cordon-based congestion pricing scheme, in which tolls are controlled by an MFD. And we investigate the effectiveness of the proposed pricing scheme. Results show that by applying such a congestion pricing, (i) the savings of travel time at both aggregated and disaggregated level outweigh the costs of tolling, (ii) the congestion inside the cordon area is eased while no extra congestion is generated in the neighbor area outside the cordon, (iii) tolling has stronger impact on leisure-related activities than on work-related activities, as fewer agents who perform work-related activities changed their time plans. Future work can apply the same methodology to other network-based pricing schemes, such as area-based or distance-traveled-based pricing. Equity issues can be investigated more carefully, if provided with data such as income of agents. Value-of-time-dependent pricing schemes then can also be determined. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this research is to examine the spatio-temporal autocorrelation structure of road networks in order to determine likely requirements for building a suitable space-time forecasting model. Exploratory space-time autocorrelation analysis is carried out using journey time data collected on London's road network. Through the use of both global and local autocorrelation measures, the autocorrelation structure of the road network is found to be dynamic and heterogeneous in both space and time. It reveals that a global measure of autocorrelation is not sufficient to explain the network structure. Dynamic and local structures must be accounted for space-time modelling and forecasting. This has broad implications for space-time modelling and network complexity.

Full Bayesian Method for the Development of Speed Models: Applications of GPS Probe Data	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Traffic speed; Global positioning system; Bayesian analysis; Monte Carlo method; Geometry; Weather conditions	FLOW; RELIABILITY; PERFORMANCE; ACCIDENTS	Traffic speed is one of the basic variables that indicates the level of service of a road entity. It plays an essential role in transportation planning and management. This study attempts to establish a prediction model for speed distribution, in terms of average travel speed and standard deviation, using probe vehicle data in Hong Kong. Taking advantage of detailed traffic flow data obtained from the annual traffic census, a comprehensive traffic information database can be established using the geographical information system technique. The effects of traffic flow, road geometry, and weather conditions on speed distribution are determined using the Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation approach full Bayesian method.

This study investigated air pollution at street level before and after implementation of local traffic policies including low emission zones (LEZ) directed at heavy duty vehicles (trucks) in five Dutch cities. Methods: Measurements of PM10, PM2.5, 'soot', NO2, NOx, and elemental composition of PM10 and PM2.5 were conducted simultaneously at eight streets, six urban background locations and four suburban background locations before (2008) and two years after implementation of the policies (2010). The four suburban locations were selected as control locations to account for generic air pollution trends and weather differences. Results: All pollutant concentrations were lower in 2010 than in 2008. For traffic-related pollutants including 'soot' and NOx and elemental composition (Cr, Cu, Fe) the decrease did not differ significantly between the intervention locations and the suburban control locations. Only for PM2.5 reductions were considerably larger at urban streets (30%) and urban background locations (27%) than at the matching suburban control locations (20%). In one urban street where traffic intensity was reduced with 50%, 'soot', NOx and NO2 concentrations were reduced substantially more (41,36 and 25%) than at the corresponding suburban control location (22, 14 and 7%). Conclusion: With the exception of one urban street where traffic flows were drastically reduced, the local traffic policies including LEZ were too modest to produce significant decreases in traffic-related air pollution concentrations.

Calibration of second order traffic models using continuous cross entropy method	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Traffic flow models; Cross entropy method; Kernel density estimation; Continuous multi-extremal optimization	MACROSCOPIC MODEL; FLOW MODELS; SIMULATION; OPTIMIZATION; WAVES	Second order macroscopic traffic flow models are often used to replicate non-linear traffic flow phenomena such as phantom traffic jams or traffic instabilities. In contrast to the (first order) Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) traffic model, which assumes an equilibrium speed-density relationship (or so-called fundamental diagram), the second order model uses one more dynamic equation to describe the evolution of the speed, therefore allows the speed to fluctuate around the equilibrium diagram. In general, in the second order model, a given model parameter set may exhibit traffic instabilities due to a small initial traffic perturbation (e.g. lane-changing or sudden deceleration). Therefore, small changes of parameter set in second order models will lead to completely different model performance, which consequently leads to a complex calibration effort and hence prohibits its real-life application as compared to the LWR model. So far relatively few calibration results for general macroscopic traffic flow models have been reported. To contribute to the state-of-the-art, this paper puts forward an effort to find global optimal parameters of a second order macroscopic traffic model using a stochastic optimization approach, namely cross entropy method (CEM). Basically, the CEM is set up to solve combinatorial optimization problems so the main novelty of this paper is to apply the CEM to solve continuous multi-extremal optimization problems in transportation through the use of the Kernel density estimation method. Numerical studies are carried out to show that the Kernel-based CEM can search for the global optimal model parameters in a second order model and is a promising method for the calibration of traffic models in general.

J	Lin, S; De Schutter, B; Xi, YG; Hellendoorn, H				Lin, Shu; De Schutter, Bart; Xi, Yugeng; Hellendoorn, Hans			Efficient network-wide model-based predictive control for urban traffic networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Urban traffic network control; Urban traffic modeling; Model predictive control	REAL-TIME; CONTROL-SYSTEM	Traffic congestion has become a stringent issue in urban areas. Traffic control systems are designed to make a better use of the existing traffic infrastructures in order to improve traffic conditions. Along with the fast development of the transportation infrastructures, traffic networks become larger and more complex. Therefore, network-wide traffic control systems that can coordinate the whole network and improve the utilization of the entire traffic infrastructure, are highly required. In this paper, a structured network-wide traffic controller is presented based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) theory. Two macroscopic models are proposed to be the prediction model of the MPC controller. One is more accurate, but correspondingly requires more computation time; the other sacrifices a certain amount of accuracy, but is computationally much more efficient. Based on these two models, MPC controllers are developed. Simulation results show that the MPC controllers are capable of coordinating an urban traffic network, especially in the situations that the traffic flow is not spread evenly through the network. Through reducing the prediction model, the corresponding MPC controller exhibits less on-line computational burden, and thus becomes more applicable in practice. Therefore, it becomes possible for the control system to deal with complex urban road networks more efficiently. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In recent years, a variety of feedback strategies have been proposed. Despite the fact that these strategies have been proved to enhance the traffic efficiency, we find that the road capacity has not been saturated and there is still plenty of room for improvement. Based on the analytic approximations, we found the reason why corresponding angle feedback strategy is superior to weighted congestion coefficient feedback strategy. Given that the sharp decay of the weighted coefficient is the key point, we proposed an efficient feedback strategy called the exponential function feedback strategy (EFFS). We applied it to both the symmetrical two-route model with two exits and that with a single exit. The simulation results indicate that, compared with other strategies, EFFS has decided numerical advantages in average flow, a physical quantity used for depicting the road capacity.

Schedule-driven intersection control	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Adaptive traffic signal control; Model-based intersection optimization; Real-time systems; Urban traffic control; Intelligent transportation systems	TRAFFIC CONTROL; REAL-TIME; CONTROL-SYSTEM; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM	Model-based intersection optimization strategies have been widely investigated for distributed traffic signal control in road networks. Due to the form of "black-box" optimization that is typically assumed, a basic challenge faced by these strategies is the combinatorial nature of the problem that must be solved. The underlying state space is exponential in the number of time steps in the look-ahead optimization horizon at a given time resolution. In this paper, we present a schedule-driven intersection control strategy, called SchIC, which addresses this challenge by exploiting the structural information in non-uniformly distributed traffic flow. Central to our method is an alternative formulation of intersection control optimization as a scheduling problem, which effectively reduces the state space through use of an aggregate representation on traffic flow data in the prediction horizon. A forward recursive algorithm is proposed for solving the scheduling problem, which makes use of a dominance condition to efficiently eliminate most states at early stages. SchIC thus achieves near optimal solutions with a polynomial complexity in the prediction horizon, and is insensitive to the granularity of time resolution that is assumed. The performance of SchIC with respect to both intersection control and implicit coordination between intersections is evaluated empirically on two ideal scenarios and a real-world urban traffic network. Some characteristics and possible real-world extensions of SchIC are also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We consider the form-one-lane rule and the merge-lane rule that decide which car moves ahead when two cars in two different lanes are in front of a junction. We simulate the proposed cellular automaton model for both rules, and generate fundamental diagrams and car distribution examples. Then, we analyze experimental results and demonstrate that the proposed model reflects the real world traffic flow with a junction according to the considered rules. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Nine international teams competed in urban and highway platooning scenarios with prototype vehicles using cooperative adaptive cruise control. Team Scoop, a collaboration between KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, and Scania CV AB, Sodertalje, Sweden, participated at the GCDC with a Scania R-series tractor unit. This paper describes the development and design of Team Scoop's prototype system for the GCDC. In particular, we present considerations with regard to the system architecture, state estimation and sensor fusion, and the design and implementation of control algorithms, as well as implementation issues with regard to the wireless communication. The purpose of the paper is to give a broad overview of the different components that are needed to develop a cooperative driving system: from architectural design, workflow, and functional requirement descriptions to the specific implementation of algorithms for state estimation and control. The approach is more pragmatic than scientific; it collects a number of existing technologies and gives an implementation-oriented view of a cooperative vehicle. The main conclusion is that it is possible, with a modest effort, to design and implement a system that can function well in cooperation with other vehicles in realistic traffic scenarios.

A Methodological Approach for Estimating Temporal and Spatial Extent of Delays Caused by Freeway Accidents	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Accidents; binary integer programming (BIP); censored data; nonparametric survival analysis; nonrecurrent congestion; shockwave; spatio-temporal congestion region	TRAFFIC FLOW; WORK	Given that reliable prediction of such relatively rare-and random-events as accident occurrence will remain elusive, the most important potentially soluble factor in the development of accident management strategies is to identify and quantify the conditions affecting the nonrecurrent congestion caused by accidents once they have been known to have occurred. The objective of the research reported in this paper is to develop a method of quantifying the delay due to accidents on urban freeways, as well as to identify the causal factors affecting the total delay caused by such accidents. Binary integer programming (BIP) is applied in estimating the temporal and spatial extent of delay caused by freeway accidents, based solely on commonly available inductance loop detector data. The basic idea behind the method is to estimate the most likely temporal and spatial extent of the region of congestion caused by an accident by solving a BIP problem that is consistent with the topology of the spatio-temporal region that defines candidate speed differences between normal flow conditions and accident conditions. The procedures developed in this paper will be useful for the performance evaluation of accident management systems by quantifying accident congestion in terms of the total delay to evaluate the benefit of accident management systems accrued from efficient traffic operations. The procedures are demonstrated by a case study using accident data collected from six major freeways in Orange County, CA.

Despite the increasing number of heavy vehicles on freeways, previous lane changing studies are predominantly associated with passenger cars. This study uses a detailed vehicle trajectory data analysis to investigate the effects of microscopic characteristics of the surrounding traffic on lane changing decision of heavy vehicle drivers. Lane changing decision can be divided into two stages: the motivation to change lanes and the selection of the target lane. To investigate the factors which influence heavy vehicle drivers' lane changing decision, 42 heavy vehicle lane changes are analysed. Heavy vehicles are classified into heavy trucks and light trucks based on their length. The results show that the speeds of the front and the rear vehicles in the current lane may motivate the heavy vehicle drivers to change lanes. Furthermore, the speed difference between the lead and the lag vehicles in both adjacent lanes has an impact on selection of the target lane. In general, different influencing traffic characteristics are observed in lane changing decision of heavy truck and light truck drivers.

J	Jin, WL				Jin, Wen-Long			A kinematic wave theory of multi-commodity network traffic flow	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model; Multi-commodity Cell Transmission Model; Fair merging; First-in-first-out diverging; Riemann problem; Entropy conditions	BLOOD-FLOW; MODEL; ASSIGNMENT; OPTIMIZATION; FORMULATION; SIMULATION; EQUATIONS; SCHEMES; GODUNOV	A systematic understanding of traffic dynamics on road networks is crucial for many transportation studies and can help to develop more efficient ramp metering, evacuation, signal control, and other management and control strategies. In this study, we present a theory of multi-commodity network traffic flow based on the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model. In particular, we attempt to analyze kinematic waves of the Riemann problem for a general junction with multiple upstream and downstream links. In this theory, kinematic waves on a link can be determined by its initial condition and prevailing stationary state. In addition to a stationary state, a flimsy interior state can develop next to the junction on a link. In order to pick out unique, physical solutions, we introduce two types of entropy conditions in supply-demand space such that (i) speeds of kinematic waves should be negative on upstream links and positive on downstream links, and (ii) fair merging and First-In-First-Out diverging rules are used to prescribe fluxes from interior states. We prove that, for given initial upstream demands, turning proportions, and downstream supplies, there exists a unique critical demand level satisfying the entropy conditions. It follows that stationary states and kinematic waves on all links exist and are unique, since they are uniquely determined by the critical demand level. For a simple model of urban or freeway intersections with four upstream and four downstream links, we demonstrate that theoretical solutions are consistent with numerical ones from a multi-commodity Cell Transmission Model. In a sense, the proposed theory can be considered as the continuous version of the multi-commodity Cell Transmission Model with fair merging and First-In-First-Out diverging rules. Finally we discuss future research topics along this line. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Measurements of Enhanced Turbulent Mixing near Highways	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY			English	Article							VEHICLE-INDUCED TURBULENCE; DISPERSION; WAKE	In August and September of 2010, measurements of turbulent fluxes and turbulent kinetic energy were made on highways in the Toronto area (Ontario, Canada). In situ turbulence measurements were made with a mobile laboratory while driving on the highway with traffic. Results demonstrate that the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) spectrum is significantly enhanced on and near the highway by traffic for frequencies above 0.015 Hz. The decay of TKE with distance behind vehicles is well approximated by power-law curves. The strongest increase in TKE is seen while following heavy-duty trucks, primarily for frequencies above 0.7 Hz. From these results, a parameterization of on-road TKE enhancement is developed that is based on vehicle type and traffic-flow rate. TKE with distance downwind of the highway also decays following a power law. The enhancement of roadside TKE is shown to be strongly dependent on traffic flow. The effect of vehicle-induced turbulence on vertical mixing was studied by comparing parameterized TKE enhancement with the typical TKE predictions from the Global Environmental Multiscale weather forecast to predict the potential increase in vertical diffusion that results from highway traffic. It is demonstrated that this increase in TKE by traffic may be locally significant, especially in the early morning.

J	Kim, C; Langari, R				Kim, Changwon; Langari, Reza			Adaptive Analytic Hierarchy Process-Based Decision Making to Enhance Vehicle Autonomy	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Adaptive cruise control (ACC); autonomous vehicles; decision making; lane change maneuver (LCM)	CRUISE CONTROL; ALGORITHM	In this paper, an autonomous vehicle function management methodology is studied. At the decision-making level, the proposed system chooses the optimal function [adaptive cruise control (ACC) or a lane change maneuver (LCM)] that is consistent with the user-selected driving mode, such as fast travel, cautious driving, and efficient travel mode, whereas the control level is implemented via a neuromorphic strategy based on the brain limbic system. To realize the decision-making strategy, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used by considering driving safety, traffic flow, and fuel efficiency as objectives, while LCM and ACC are chosen as the alternative functions. The adaptive AHP is further suggested to cope with the dynamically changing traffic environment. The proposed adaptive AHP algorithm provides an optimal relative importance matrix that is essential to making decisions under varying traffic situations and driving modes. The simulation results show that the proposed structure produces an effective approach to autonomous vehicle function management.

When the detectors and the GPS probes are not available, vehicle speeds can be estimated by the cellular floating vehicle data technique, where the telecom network needs to spend extra effort to identify specific users and track their movements. This paper proposes the Speed Determination (SD) Algorithm, which uses standard statistics of telecom switches to compute the speeds of vehicles without extra effort in the telecom network. Simulation and field measurements indicate that the SD Algorithm can effectively report the vehicle speeds of two-way roads.

J	Minciardi, R; Robba, M				Minciardi, R.; Robba, M.			A Bilevel Approach for the Optimal Control of Flows Through a Network	IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL			English	Article						Bilevel decision architectures; risk analysis; traffic control; transportation	DECISION-MAKING; RISK; TRANSPORTATION; MODEL; ROAD; OPTIMIZATION; MANAGEMENT; ALGORITHMS; DESIGN	The operational management of traffic flows, controlled by different decision makers (that do not exchange information) through a network, gives rise to a common modeling framework that may find application within different research areas: road traffic control, hazardous materials transportation, telecommunication networks, energy systems. In this paper, a general decision architecture is considered and an application is provided to the case of the management of fleets of vehicles that transport hazardous materials (hazmat). The considered architecture takes into account the presence of different decision makers. The problem is also characterized by the presence of several (possibly conflicting) objectives. In the case of hazmat transportation, such objectives may be the reduction of economic costs and the containment of the risk (for vehicles and infrastructures). The considered model includes an upper-level decision maker that can take decisions affecting the utility functions of the lower-level decision makers (LDMs), for example, changing the tolls for the LDMs, but leaving to such LDMs some decision capability. A specific case study is considered, relevant to the management of vehicles carrying hazmat through a critical infrastructure.

The procedure was extended from homogeneous traffic flow to mixed traffic flow. Based on the procedure and queuing theory, car capacity and speed models were proposed for three types of bus stops including curbside, bus bay and bicycle detour. The effects of various combinations of bus stop type, traffic volume, bus dwell time, and berth number on traffic operations were investigated. The results indicate that traffic volume, bus dwell time and berth number have negative effects on traffic operations for any type of bus stops. For different types of bus stops, at car volumes above approximately 200 vehicles per hour, the bus bay and bicycle detour designs provide more benefits than the curbside design. As traffic volume increases, the benefit firstly increases in uncongested conditions and then decreases in congested conditions. It reaches the maximum at car volumes nearly 1 100 vehicles per hour. The results can be used to aid in the selection of a preferred bus stop design for a given traffic volume in developing countries.

J	Rassafi, AA; Davoodnia, P; Pourmoallem, N				Rassafi, Amir Abbas; Davoodnia, Pirooz; Pourmoallem, Naser			Modeling Traffic Flow on Urban Highways: the Application of Cellular Automata and Nested Logit	ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Cellular automata; Nested logit; Traffic modeling	SIMULATION	The current study attempts to model the drivers' behavior in a basic freeway in order to use it in future simulations and predictions as well as to find out its effective variables and analyze the sensitivity of model to them, using a cellular automata model. Cellular automata are considered as one of the applied methods in traffic flow simulation. These models consist of a set of regular and finite grid of cells each of which can be in one of a finite number of defined states. In order to find the rules, a nested logit model is constructed. The parameters of the nested logit model are then estimated and analyzed. In order to be able to estimate the parameters, real data are needed. Therefore, the data which are extracted from a selected highway in Iran are used for the parameter estimation of the nested logit model. Results of the analysis confirmed the capability of nested logit model in simulation of traffic flow under irregular driving conditions, in which lane changing occurs frequently. They also showed that crash risk has no effect on reduction of longitudinal speed of vehicles, while the maximum safe speed plays a main role in driving behavior, showing that the focused drivers choose their next position in accordance with the maximum safe speed. The current paper's center of attention is its methodology. This method can be used to improve the utilization of the existing systems (without lane addition) through better traffic management and operations strategies, and improve the geometric design of roads and highways, and consequently improve mobility, safety, and air quality, which are of great importance.

The VSL management technique for highway is already being applied and operated in Germany, the UK, and other countries in Europe. But there are few studies about the effect of VSL on traffic flow. This paper aims to study the principle of VSL and the effect of VSL on traffic flow theoretically using the fundamental traffic model and shockwave theory. In this paper, changes in traffic flow state with VSL are explained using the time/distance headway of the vehicle trajectory and are then converted into aggregate data in order to apply the real traffic condition easily. Finally the findings are verified by the numerical method and VISSIM simulation.

Traffic Flow Estimation Models Using Cellular Phone Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Cellular phone data; traffic counts; vehicle traffic flow	MOBILITY	Traffic volume is a parameter used to quantify demand in transportation studies, and it is commonly collected by using on-road (fixed) sensors such as inductive loops, cameras, etc. The installation of fixed sensors to cover all roads is neither practical nor economically feasible; therefore, they are only installed on a subset of links. Cellular phone tracking has been an emerging topic developed and investigated during the last few years to extract traffic information. Cellular systems provide alternative methods to detect phones in motion without the cost and coverage limitations associated with those infrastructure-based solutions. Utilizing existing cellular systems to capture traffic volume has a major advantage compared with other solutions, since it avoids new and expensive hardware installations of sensors, with a large number of cellular phones acting as probes. This paper proposes a set of models for inferring the number of vehicles moving from one cell to another by means of anonymous call data of phones. The models contain, in their functional form, terms related to the users' calling behavior and other characteristics of the phenomenon such as hourly intensity in calls and vehicles. A set of intercell boundaries with different traffic background and characteristics were selected for the field test. The experiment results show that reasonable estimates are achieved by comparison with volume measurements collected by detectors located in the same study area. The motion of phones while being involved in calls can be used as an easily accessible, fast, and low-cost alternative to deriving volume data on intercell boundaries.

In this paper, we propose a new traffic control system without traffic lights at an intersection. We assume a system with fully autonomous driverless cars, and infrastructure to avoid collision completely. When automobiles approach an intersection, they communicates with the access point in both random access mode and polling mode, and the movement of the automobiles will be coordinated by the infra structure (access point). Traffic congestion is very difficult to predict and deal with because it is a function of many unknown factors such as number of cars, weather, road conditions, accidents, etc. The proposed algorithm is designed for urban road networks to ease the congestion, and make it more predictable at the same time. A key idea of this paper is that IEEE 802.11 DCF/PCF mechanisms are used to control traffic flow for driverless cars when there are no traffic lights at an intersection. The algorithm uses the concept of contention/contention-free period of IEEE 802.11 to find a balance between the efficiency of traffic flow and the fairness between users.

Dynamic near-term traffic flow prediction: system-oriented approach based on past experiences	IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article							TRAVEL-TIME PREDICTION; BUS ARRIVAL-TIME; NEURAL-NETWORKS; NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION; VOLUME; MODEL; SERIES; PERFORMANCE; NEIGHBORS; ALGORITHM	Short-term prediction is one of the essential elements of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Although fine prediction methodologies have been reported, most prediction methods with current time-series data lead to inefficient predictions when current or future time-series data either exhibit fluctuations or abruptly change. In order to deal with this problem, a dynamic multi-interval traffic volume prediction model, based on the k-nearest neighbour non-parametric regression (KNN-NPR), is introduced in this study. In an empirical study with real-world data, the input parameters of the proposed model including the k-values for the nearest neighbours in the neighbourhood and the d(m)-values for the number of lags were optimised according to the multi-interval prediction horizon in order to immediately capture the directionality of the future states and to minimise the prediction errors. The presented model performed effectively in terms of prediction accuracy, despite multi-interval schemes, to the same degree as applications of the real ITS, even if the time-series data abruptly varied or exhibited wide fluctuations. It can clearly be seen that the proposed methodology is one of the promising system-oriented approaches in the area of multi-interval traffic flow forecasting.

Comparison of Methods for Path Flow Reassignment for Dynamic User Equilibrium	NETWORKS & SPATIAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						Traffic; Dynamic traffic assignment; Dynamic user equilibrium; Path inflow reassignment; Route choice	VARIATIONAL INEQUALITY FORMULATION; TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT MODEL; CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; NETWORK; EXISTENCE; WAVES; ROUTE	Models to describe or predict of time-varying traffic flows and travel times on road networks are usually referred to as dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models or dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) models. The most common form of algorithms for DUE consists of iterating between two components namely dynamic network loading (DNL) and path inflow reassignment or route choice. The DNL components in these algorithms have been investigated in many papers but in comparison the path inflow reassignment component has been relatively neglected. In view of that, we investigate various methods for path inflow reassignment that have been used in the literature. We compare them numerically by embedding them in a DUE algorithm and applying the algorithm to solve DUE problems for various simple network scenarios. We find that the choice of inflow reassignment method makes a huge difference to the speed of convergence of the algorithms and, in particular, find that 'travel time responsive' reassignment methods converge much faster than the other methods. We also investigate how speed of convergence is affected by the extent of congestion on the network, by higher demand or lower capacity. There appears to be much scope for further improving path inflow reassignment methods.	[Carey, Malachy] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Ge, Y.

Comparing traffic flow time-series under fine and adverse weather conditions using recurrence-based complexity measures	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS			English	Article						Recurrence quantification analysis; Complexity measures; Confidence bounds; Traffic flow; Weather conditions; Precipitation intensity	INCIDENT DETECTION; URBAN; PREDICTION; VOLUME; DELAY; PLOTS	Adverse weather conditions may have a significant impact on the statistical characteristics of traffic variables such as volume and speed, and consequently on their predictability. We address the problem of freeway lane speed variability under the effect of precipitation episodes and present a non-linear dynamics methodology based on recurrence quantification analysis to compare speed evolution under fine and adverse weather conditions. Findings indicate that, under fine weather conditions, section travel speed is an adequate descriptor of traffic evolution in the left and middle lanes for high demand, but fails in cases of incidents or low traffic. Moreover, when it rains, regardless of intensity and duration, a significantly dissimilar evolution of lane speed is observed; this difference should be considered in the process of short-term traffic forecasting.

J	Blandin, S; Couque, A; Bayen, A; Work, D				Blandin, Sebastien; Couque, Adrien; Bayen, Alexandre; Work, Daniel			On sequential data assimilation for scalar macroscopic traffic flow models	PHYSICA D-NONLINEAR PHENOMENA			English	Article						Traffic flow; Macroscopic modeling; Sequential estimation; Data assimilation; Conservation law; Riemann problem	EXTENDED KALMAN FILTER; CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; MONTE-CARLO METHODS; STATE ESTIMATION; IMPLEMENTATION; NETWORK; WAVES; PART	We consider the problem of sequential data assimilation for transportation networks using optimal filtering with a scalar macroscopic traffic flow model. Properties of the distribution of the uncertainty on the true state related to the specific nonlinearity and non-differentiability inherent to macroscopic traffic flow models are investigated, derived analytically and analyzed. We show that nonlinear dynamics, by creating discontinuities in the traffic state, affect the performances of classical filters and in particular that the distribution of the uncertainty on the traffic state at shock waves is a mixture distribution. The non-differentiability of traffic dynamics around stationary shock waves is also proved and the resulting optimality loss of the estimates is quantified numerically. The properties of the estimates are explicitly studied for the Godunov scheme (and thus the Cell-Transmission Model), leading to specific conclusions about their use in the context of filtering, which is a significant contribution of this article. Analytical proofs and numerical tests are introduced to support the results presented. A Java implementation of the classical filters used in this work is available on-line at http://traffic.berkeley.edu for facilitating further efforts on this topic and fostering reproducible research.

A fire source due to a heavy goods vehicle (HGV) with a peak of the heat release rate (HRR) of 50 MW is simulated. The influence of position of the HGV fire in the tunnel, tunnel geometry, longitudinal ventilation of jet-fans, and the presence of traffic flow, are more especially investigated. The effects of these variables on hot gas temperatures, air flow velocity, visibility distance, toxic gases concentrations, and the people evacuation process, are shown. The worst fire scenario was identified to be when the HGV was located in the middle of the tunnel length and in the driving lane centre. This was due to the combined effect of ventilation and geometrical characteristics. The presence of traffic, in contrast with the isolated HGV, caused higher temperatures, interfered with the air flow by decreasing its velocity, and decreased more rapidly the visibility distance in the tunnel. However, toxic gases were found to be below the minimum values that may represent a potential danger to human life. People evacuation from the tunnel was found to be safe when the time before starting to walk is short and the walking speed is a rather high. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we propose a model to generate correlated scale free transportation networks with community structure by considering the mechanisms of dynamical network evolution and rewiring links. With the introduction of congestion effects, we investigate the performance and carrying capacity of this network. The results show that congestion in the uncorrelated network is more serious than the assortative or disassortative ones. Therefore, the correlated network with communities can bear much more traffic flow. In addition, the networks with lager modularity can enhance the transportation efficiently.

By using a gravity type model, we found that the bus flow between cities depends on the square root of the product of the population size of city A and the population size of city B. On the other hand, the total bus flow of a city depends on only its population size. These different dependences on population originate from the network property of the express bus network.

Particles could also jump fully asymmetrically from lane i to lane i + 1. It is found that in the case that p(i) > q(i) and p(i) - q(i) are not equal to each other, the phase diagram in three-lane system has three different geometric structures. The principles of phase diagram structure have been generalized to multilane PASEPs. The case that p(i) - q(i) could be equal has also been studied. Unfortunately, the phase diagram structure is complex and generalization to multilane PASEPs is difficult. A vertical cluster mean-field analysis has been carried out, which shows good agreement with simulations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This model was modified from the Nordic prediction method by adding three types of traffic flow rates, including heavy vehicles, light vehicles, and motorcycles, as well as local traffic speeds and road characteristics to the calculating equations. The parameters that were input into the equations include traffic flow, vehicle speed, distance from the center of the road, height of the road surface, position and height of the barriers, thickness of the barriers, location of the receiver relative to the surrounding road surface or barriers, reflecting vertical surfaces, type of ground, and height of the buildings. The model was validated by comparing the measured noise levels at 42 sampling sites close to main roads with the predicted values. A significant correlation was found between the predicted and measured noise levels (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.75, p<0.001). The deviation between the predicted and measured noise levels within the range of +/- 3.5 A-weighted decibel (dB(A)) was 90.5%. The mean difference between the predicted and measured noise levels was 0.9 +/- 2.1 dB(A). The modified Nordic prediction model is therefore applicable to estimate the noise exposure in this urban environment in Taiwan. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Xuan, YG; Coifman, B				Xuan, Yiguang; Coifman, Benjamin			Identifying Lane-Change Maneuvers with Probe Vehicle Data and an Observed Asymmetry in Driver Accommodation	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Highway traffic; Lane-change maneuvers; Instrumented probe vehicles; Lidar; Traffic instabilities	PREDICTION; WAVES	This paper uses an instrumented probe vehicle to monitor ambient traffic and overcome many challenges of observing traffic flow phenomena that occur over extended distances. One contribution of this paper is a general methodology to identify the probe vehicle's lane of travel without a priori knowledge of where the lanes are. This knowledge is used to find the probe's lane-change maneuvers (LCMs), to differentiate these LCMs from GPS errors, and, in conjunction with a ranging sensor, to identify which lanes the ambient vehicles are in to find their LCMs. The second contribution of this paper comes from the identified LCMS. The data are used to provide an independent validation of earlier studies, and thus yield further evidence of how LCMs contribute to the formation of disturbances within freeway queues. In particular, it is found that vehicles following an entering vehicle generally complete their response and return to steady state quicker than those following an exiting vehicle. As discussed herein, this asymmetry in the lane-change maneuver accommodation time effectively induces a ripple in the traffic state that propagates upstream. The resulting disturbances provide a possible mechanism to explain the fact that congested traffic tends to fluctuate, e. g., stop-and-go traffic, rather than remain at a single, relatively stable congested state.

Modeling Origin-Destination Effects on Roundabout Operations and Inflow Control	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article						Roundabout capacity; Origin-destination flows; Average circulating flow; Average trip length; Macroscopic fundamental diagram	TRAFFIC FLOW	Traffic flows around roundabouts have been found to be dependent on origin-destination flows, but the true nature of this relationship is not properly understood. Present analyses are based on either gap acceptance models or empirical models. These models do not properly account for the impact of origin-destination flows on roundabout operations. This has limited the possibility to develop strategies that improve roundabout operations by controlling inflows. This research proposes a theory to analyze roundabout traffic flows and a strategy to determine inflows into a roundabout that would maximize the outflow from the roundabout. This strategy could be implemented through use of signals to meter vehicles at the entry. To achieve this, a theoretical framework is proposed based on the macroscopic fundamental diagram for urban networks. The theory and strategy is then tested using microscopic simulation. It was found that the outflow from a roundabout is dependent on the average flow and the average trip length around the roundabout. The average trip length is a function of the origin-destination flows. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000394. (C) 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Dixit, VV; Gayah, VV; Radwan, E				Dixit, Vinayak V.; Gayah, Vikash V.; Radwan, Essam			Comparison of Driver Behavior by Time of Day and Wet Pavement Conditions	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article						Two-fluid model; Driver aggressiveness; Urban traffic networks; Wet pavement; Time of day	ARTERIAL STREETS; 2-FLUID MODEL; QUALITY	This study uses the two-fluid model for traffic flow, to examine driver behavior during both wet and dry pavement conditions and various times of the day. It was found that parameters in the two-fluid model known to be strongly affected by driver behavior (particularly driver aggressiveness) were statistically different between wet pavement and dry pavement conditions. The results confirmed that drivers tend to behave more conservatively when the pavement was wet compared with dry. The parameters of the two-fluid model were found to be statistically different for the morning peak period from the midday and evening peak periods, the results of which indicated that drivers behave more aggressively during the morning peak. Although these findings have been observed in previous studies, they have not been quantified using traffic data. This study shows that the two-fluid model apart from being a measure of network performance may be able to unveil more about driver behavior. There is a strong possibility that the parameters of the model may be used by researchers as a surrogate measure of safety and could lead to a measure to evaluate aggressive driving.

Time Series Analysis and Models of Freeway Performance	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article						Statistical methods; State-space models; Traffic surveys; Traffic congestion; Markov processes; Forecasting; Computer simulation; Probability density	TRAFFIC FLOW; IDENTIFICATION	This paper describes a study whose primary purpose is to better understand the relationship between freeway traffic flow and speed. Incidents of recurrent and nonrecurrent congestion were encountered at six radar collection northbound locations on New Hampshire interstate I-93 in July 2010. The root cause for the onset of the recurrent congestion is explained with exploratory data analyses and a time series modeling approach. A complex combination of present and past values of traffic flow, speed, and congestion state, a congestion history of lingering effect variables, can explain the triggering and mitigation of congestion events for a highly volatile traffic environment. The approach includes two mathematical models: (1) a generalized additive binomial model to forecast the probability of congestion and (2) state-space models of speed and flow. The state-space models use a dynamic linear model (DLM) with switching structures to describe the bimodal distribution of speed and flow in the free-flow and congested states. Model selection, parameter estimation and checking are presented. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000403. (C) 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Ma, QL; Liu, WN; Sun, DH				Ma Qing-Lu; Liu Wei-Ning; Sun Di-Hua			Multi-parameter fusion applied to road traffic condition forecasting	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						traffic parameter; traffic condition; prediction; reconstruction of phase space	PHASE-SPACE RECONSTRUCTION; LATTICE MODEL; FLOW; PREDICTION	In view of the chaotic characteristic in road traffic flow and the actual traffic condition that cannot be comprehensively reflected by single traffic parameter, a fusion algorithm of multi-parameters for traffic condition forecasting, with the consideration of the relationship between multiple parameters, is proposed. This algorithm is based on the reconstruction of phase space. According to Bayesian estimation theory, the multiple traffic parameters are optimally fused into phase points in the same phase space. Accordingly, the phase space information increases and the phase points are closer to dynamical behavior of the traffic system. On the basis, by using the multi-parameter chaos prediction method, the tendency of dynamic systems from different aspects is described, with reference to the method of predicting single parameter chaotic time series. The experimental results confirm that more features of real traffic condition are reflected by fusing multiple traffic parameters. The multi-parameters forecasting algorithm reduces the prediction error and improves the equalizer coefficients compared with the results generated from single parameter prediction. That is to say, the prediction method used in this paper is effective and accurate for predicting traffic condition based on multiple traffic parameters.

The main feature is to specify commuting paths as the "locations'' of consumers in a Hotelling-style model. As a result, spatial differentiation depends in an intuitive way on the structure of the road network and the direction of traffic flows. The model is estimated using panel data on the Quebec City gasoline market and used to evaluate the consequences of a recent vertical merger. Difference-in-difference and counterfactual simulation methods are compared, and the results, to a large extent, validate the assumptions of the demand model.

Based on theoretical analysis and computer simulations, we have presented the phase diagram for the cases of various maximum vehicle velocities, and it is found that the phase diagram has several different topology structures. The flow formulas in all regions in the phase diagram have been derived. The results of theoretical analysis are in good agreement with the simulation ones.

J	Zheng, L; Zhong, SQ; Ma, SF				Zheng, Liang; Zhong, Shi-quan; Ma, Shou-feng			Controlling traffic jams on a two-lane road using delayed-feedback signals	JOURNAL OF ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY-SCIENCE A			English	Article						Optimal velocity (OV) model; Two-lane traffic flow; Lateral friction; Stability analysis; Delayed-feedback signals	CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; VARIABLE-SPEED LIMITS; FLOW; CONGESTION; STATES	This paper focuses mainly on the stability analysis of two-lane traffic flow with lateral friction, which may be caused by irregular driving behavior or poorly visible road markings, and also attempts to reveal the formation mechanism of traffic jams. Firstly, a two-lane optimal velocity (OV) model without control signals is proposed and its stability condition is obtained from the viewpoint of control theory. Then delayed-feedback control signals composed of distance headway information from both lanes are added to each vehicle and a vehicular control system is designed to suppress the traffic jams. Lane change behaviors are also incorporated into the two-lane OV model and the corresponding information about distance headway and feedback signals is revised. Finally, the results of numerical experiments are shown to verify that when the stability condition is not met, the position disturbances and resulting lane change behaviors do indeed deteriorate traffic performance and cause serious traffic jams. However, once the proper delayed-feedback control signals are implemented, the traffic jams can be suppressed efficiently.

To measure of emissions at the level of individual vehicles under varying payloads a portable emission measurement system is used. This paper reports on a model based on data at the level of individual vehicles for a representative road trajectory. The model aggregates the data to the level of a homogeneous flow dependent of velocity and specific power, which is dependent on payload weight. We find a lean specification for the model that provides emission factors for CO2, NOx, HC, CO, and NO2. The results indicate that, in comparison with earlier models, NOx emissions in particular tend to be underestimated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Leaf-cutting ants as road engineers: the width of trails at branching points in Atta cephalotes	INSECTES SOCIAUX			English	Article						Ants; Building behavior; Costa Rica; Foraging trails; Trail design	TRAFFIC ORGANIZATION; WALKING SPEED; MAINTENANCE	We used a simple engineering principle, which suggests that the width of a road needed for a smooth traffic flow is proportional to the peak traffic volume ("engineering hypothesis"), to analyze the adaptive significance of trail width at branching points in the leaf-cutting ant Atta cephalotes. Since the flow of outgoing ants splits at trail bifurcations and merges when ants return to the nest through the same paths, the sum of branch widths should equal the width of the trail section upstream of the bifurcation. We measured the width of branches and their preceding trail section and also performed field measurements and manipulations to analyze ant flow, number of collisions, and ant speed in different trail sectors. Contrary to the prediction of the "engineering hypothesis", the sum of branch widths was larger than the width of the trail immediately before the bifurcation. Our data contradict the "trail addition hypothesis" and support the "border effect hypothesis" to explain this pattern. First, the width of the widest branch was smaller than the width of the trail upstream of the bifurcation, an unexpected result if one branch is merely the continuation of the basal trail. Second, ants collided with obstacles more often in the margin than in the central portion of the trail, relocated ants from central to margin trail sectors reduced their speed, and ant flow was higher in the central sections of the trail. Since the delaying effect of trail margins increases as the trail width decreases, ants may build branches wider than expected to reduce the border effect. The delaying effect of trail margins should be included in the analysis of costs and benefits to fully understand the adaptive value of the design of ant trail networks.	[Farji-Brener, A.

Bounded rationality is the idea in decision making, rationality of individuals is limited by the information they have, the cognitive limitations of their minds, and the finite amount of time they have to make decisions. The emotional theory is an important topic presented in this field. The new methods in the direction of purposeful forecasting issues, which are based on cognitive limitations, are presented in this study. The presented algorithms in this study are emphasizes to rectify the learning the peak points, to increase the forecasting accuracy, to decrease the computational time and comply the multi-object forecasting in the algorithms. The structure of the proposed algorithms is based on approximation of its current estimate according to previously learned estimates. The short term traffic flow forecasting is a real benchmark that has been studied in this area. Traffic flow is a good measure of traffic activity. The time-series data used for fitting the proposed models are obtained from a two lane street I-494 in Minnesota City, USA. The research discuss the strong points of new method based on neurofuzzy and limbic system structure such as Locally Linear Neurofuzzy network (LLNF) and Brain Emotional Learning Based Intelligent Controller (BELBIC) models against classical and other intelligent methods such as Radial Basis Function (RBF), Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) neurofuzzy, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and the effect of noise on the performance of the models is also considered. Finally, findings confirmed the significance of structural brain modeling beyond the classical artificial neural networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Optimal distribution of traffic flows in emergency cases	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Conservation laws; traffic problems; optimal redistribution of flows	NETWORKS; WAVES; ROADS; MODEL	The aim of this work is to present a technique for the optimisation of emergency vehicles travel times on assigned paths when critical situations, such as car accidents, occur. Using a fluid-dynamic model for the description of car density evolution, the attention is focused on a decentralised approach reducing to simple junctions with two incoming roads and two outgoing ones (junctions of 2 x 2 type). We assume the redirection of cars at junctions is possible and choose a cost functional that describes the asymptotic average velocity of emergency vehicles. Fixing an incoming road and an outgoing road for the emergency vehicle, we determine the local distribution coefficients that maximise such functional at a single junction. Then we use the local optimal coefficients at each node of the network. The overall traffic evolution is studied via simulations, both for simple junctions or cascade networks, evaluating global performances when optimal parameters on the network are used.

Integration of Environmental Objectives in a System Optimal Dynamic Traffic Assignment Model	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; TRANSPORTATION NETWORK; SIGNAL CONTROL; EMISSION; DESIGN; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM; EXTERNALITY; CONSUMPTION; FORMULATION	Maintaining air-quality standards is a major concern for transportation planners and policy makers in the United States. This necessitates considering nontraditional emission objectives in transportation systems modeling. In this research, we integrate emission-based objective into the traditional travel time based dynamic assignment framework. Carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from vehicles are computed as functions of space mean speed (determined from an embedded mesoscopic traffic flow model). Different performance metrics (CO emission, system wide travel time, and speed profiles) from the integrated model are compared with traditional dynamic assignment model (with travel time minimization objective). In addition, results indicate changes in route choice behavior of the road users when emission objective is integrated to dynamic assignment framework.	[Aziz, H. M.

J	Sun, D; Elefteriadou, L				Sun, Daniel (Jian); Elefteriadou, Lily			Lane-Changing Behavior on Urban Streets: An "In-Vehicle" Field Experiment-Based Study	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							WORK ZONE CAPACITY; MODEL; RELAXATION	Lane-changing behavior has received increasing attention during the recent years in traffic flow modeling. Researchers have developed various algorithms to model the maneuvers on both highways and urban streets. However, the majority of these models was derived and validated using data such as vehicle trajectories, without many considerations of driver characteristics. In this study, an instrumented vehicle-based experiment was carefully designed to observe the drivers action under various urban lane-changing scenarios. The personal background data, and in-vehicle driver behavior and trajectory data were obtained from the experiment, and used to classify 40 drivers into four general groups according to the lane-changing maneuvers performed in an urban street environment. Additional comparisons and analysis were conducted to confirm the categorization results. The article concludes by providing recommendations related to the implementation of study findings into micro-simulators, such as using only four driver types in CORSIM instead of the existing 10 types, to better replicate driver behavior in urban street networks.

J	Placzek, B				Placzek, Bartlomiej			Selective data collection in vehicular networks for traffic control applications	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Vehicular sensor network; Road traffic control; Data collection; Fuzzy cellular model	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; FUZZY-LOGIC; VEHICLE; COMBINATION; PROTOCOL	Vehicular sensor network (VSN) is an emerging technology, which combines wireless communication offered by vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) with sensing devices installed in vehicles. VSN creates a huge opportunity to extend the road-side sensor infrastructure of existing traffic control systems. The efficient use of the wireless communication medium is one of the basic issues in VSN applications development. This paper introduces a method of selective data collection for traffic control applications, which provides a significant reduction in data amounts transmitted through VSN. The underlying idea is to detect the necessity of data transfers on the basis of uncertainty determination of the traffic control decisions. According to the proposed approach, sensor data are transmitted from vehicles to the control node only at selected time moments. Data collected in VSN are processed using on-line traffic simulation technique, which enables traffic flow prediction, performance evaluation of control actions and uncertainty estimation. If precision of the resulting information is insufficient, the optimal control action cannot be derived without ambiguity. As a result the control decision becomes uncertain and it is a signal informing that new traffic data from VSN are necessary to provide more precise prediction and to reduce the uncertainty of decision. The proposed method can be applied in traffic control systems of different types e.g. traffic signals, variable speed limits, and dynamic route guidance. The effectiveness of this method is illustrated in an experimental study on traffic control at signalised intersection. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Paviotti, M; Vogiatzis, K				Paviotti, Marco; Vogiatzis, Konstantinos			On the outdoor annoyance from scooter and motorbike noise in the urban environment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Environmental noise; Annoyance; Scooters; Motorbikes; Urban traffic; Urban life quality	MODEL	The health impacts of environmental noise are a growing concern amongst both the general public and policy-makers in Europe. Environmental noise - especially from road transportation - is widely accepted as an important environmental impact factor that can be taken as a start for the process of evaluating the impact of annoyance on the exposed urban population. Extensive urbanisation and the increase of road transport define the main driving forces for the environmental noise exposure of the population. In urban conditions, it is rather common, regarding road transportation noise, to hear from people that, especially, PIW (Powered Two Wheelers) are annoying, and many times are actually the most annoying environmental noise sources introducing a degradation of the urban environment. In this research, in Athens city centre, both scooters and motorbikes operation patterns are analysed, in the basis of their environmental impact through ad-hoc tests to establish if specific features of their emitted noise are annoying and affect the quality of life. It resulted that PTW are a relevant cause of specific environmental annoyance on pedestrians when low background noise levels and sparse traffic flow allow identifying the PTW. Based on the results of a measurement campaign, both L-max and roughness indices are identified as characteristic noise signatures of the PTW. Results are compared to laboratory studies on annoyance found in literature and to a specific set of interviews with a large number of pedestrians in selected sites. Annoyance caused by scooters and motorbikes is analysed in the findings and conclusions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhou, YP; Zhuang, HB				Zhou, Yaping; Zhuang, Hongbin			Traffic Performance in Signalized Intersection with Shared Lane and Left-Turn Waiting Area Established	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Left-turn waiting area; Shared-use lanes; Traffic queuing; Traffic simulation; Geometric improvement	SATURATION FLOW; CAPACITY; BLOCKAGE; PHASE	This paper highlights the left-turn waiting area in an intersection and proposes a different perspective for measuring the capacity of the traffic flows, which permits the through vehicles to queue on the left lane in a protected signal operation. The effect of flow diverting from the through lanes on the left lane is quantitatively analyzed with random service system theory and probability theory. The utilization of the left-turn waiting area significantly improves the discharge rate of the through lane without compromising the efficiency of left-turning flows, thus reducing the average vehicle delay. A typical intersection with a different capacity of left-turn waiting area is presented to verify the advantage of shared-use operation in the average delay. Besides, effects of the length of the left-turn waiting area, green ratio, and left-turn proportion on the capacity in shared lane are constructed in different conditions. The relationships between these parameters and the actual capacity are presented to show the trade-off between shared use and the exclusive configuration. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the shared-use style still works even when the arrival rate of through flows reaches the road capacity, which may result in congestions.

J	Murena, F				Murena, Fabio			Monitoring and modelling carbon monoxide concentrations in a deep street canyon: application of a two-box model	ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH			English	Article						Atmospheric pollution; Deep street canyon; Operational models; Box models; Mass transfer	FLOW-FIELD; DISPERSION; TURBULENCE	Carbon monoxide concentrations were monitored at 3, 10 and 30 meters in a deep street canyon with an aspect ratio of (H/W) approximate to 5.8 and were modelled using a two-box model developed in a previous CFD study. The monitoring campaign lasted 5 days, from 11th to 15th July, 2011. The turbulent kinetic energy at the rooftop level and traffic flow was also measured in the same period. Experimental data were used to evaluate parameters (mass transfer velocities and overall mass transfer velocity) of the box model. The daily pattern shows a significant increase of the overall mass transfer velocity from 9:00 to 11:00 and a decrease until 14:00. Turbulent kinetic energy measured at the rooftop level seems to play a major role with respect to wind velocity in determining the mass transfer between the canyon and the atmosphere above. The evaluation of the overall mass transfer velocity contributes to the use of operational street canyon dispersion models in the case of deep street canyons. (c) Author(s) 2012.

Trends in NOx and NO2 emissions from road traffic in Great Britain	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Emissions inventory; NOx; NO2; Remote sensing; Emissions trends		In this paper we have compared detailed road traffic NOx emissions with the equivalent trends in ambient roadside NOx measurements. This was undertaken separately in Great Britain and London, for all of the major roads, and by road type and location. The emissions trends were created using different emissions factors, those used in UK emissions inventories (Base case), the Swiss-German handbook (HBEFA), and those created from recent remote sensing measurements in the UK (RSD). An alternative assumption for use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) in the articulated Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) fleet was also tested. For all scenarios traffic flows, speeds and vehicle age were kept constant. Comparison between the emissions scenarios in Great Britain showed that by 2009, NOx emissions estimates from road traffic could be as much as 25% greater than current UK estimates and 31% greater in London. The RSD emissions inventory gave the smallest downward trend in NOx emissions, from 2004 to 2009, of between 3 and 4%/year and this compared with a reduction of similar to 6%/year from the Base Case and HBEFA scenarios. All scenarios compared poorly with roadside NOx measurement trends from UK sites, which typically reduce by between 1% and 2%/year. We have shown that the differences in NOx emissions trends were driven, partially at least, by the relative contribution from light duty diesel vehicles. An analysis from 2700 NOx measurement sites throughout Europe has shown that this problem is unlikely to be limited to the UK, and identifies a difficulty in meeting EU limit values for NO2, obligations under the National Emission Ceilings Directive (NECD, 2001) and the Gothenburg Protocol (UNECE, 1999) and for forecasting future changes in PM2.5.

J	Mori, H; Kitaoka, H; Ishida, M; Asakura, Y				Mori, Hiroko; Kitaoka, Hironobu; Ishida, Masaya; Asakura, Yasuo			Traffic flow model of network simulators for estimation of CO2 emissions	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						traffic flow model; traffic network simulator; CO2 emission; large-scale network; acceleration control system; estimation		This paper describes a new approach to developing a traffic flow model of traffic network simulators for the estimation of CO2 emissions by considering various measures such as the use of vehicle control systems and transportation demand management (TDM) strategies. Thus far, we have developed the traffic network simulator NETSTREAM (NETwork Simulator for TRaffic Efficiency And Mobility), which has been able to reproduce traffic congestion in large-scale networks because of its unique traffic flow model. This paper proposes an enhancement of this model: acceleration is also considered because it has a significant effect on the calculation of CO2 emissions. The proposed model is then verified and validated. The results indicate that it can reproduce acceleration in a way that closely agrees with the actual data, while maintaining the QK and KV relationships. Finally, this paper presents an example evaluation of an acceleration control system. We confirm that the proposed traffic flow model can evaluate environmental improvements in large-scale networks.

J	Xu, CC; Liu, P; Wang, W; Li, ZB				Xu, Chengcheng; Liu, Pan; Wang, Wei; Li, Zhibin			Evaluation of the impacts of traffic states on crash risks on freeways	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Traffic states; Crash risk; K-means clustering analysis; Case-control study; Discriminant analysis	SAFETY	The primary objective of this study is to divide freeway traffic flow into different states, and to evaluate the safety performance associated with each state. Using traffic flow data and crash data collected from a northbound segment of the I-880 freeway in the state of California, United States, K-means clustering analysis was conducted to classify traffic flow into five different states. Conditional logistic regression models using case-controlled data were then developed to study the relationship between crash risks and traffic states. Traffic flow characteristics in each traffic state were compared to identify the underlying phenomena that made certain traffic states more hazardous than others. Crash risk models were also developed for different traffic states to identify how traffic flow characteristics such as speed and speed variance affected crash risks in different traffic states. The findings of this study demonstrate that the operations of freeway traffic can be divided into different states using traffic occupancy measured from nearby loop detector stations, and each traffic state can be assigned with a certain safety level. The impacts of traffic flow parameters on crash risks are different across different traffic flow states. A method based on discriminant analysis was further developed to identify traffic states given real-time freeway traffic flow data. Validation results showed that the method was of reasonably high accuracy for identifying freeway traffic states. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Street washing is one of the methods proposed to reduce resuspended road dust contributions to ambient PM concentrations. As resuspended particles are mainly found in the coarse mode, published studies investigating the effects of street washing have focused on PM10 size fraction. As the PM2.5 mass fraction of particles originating from mechanical abrasion processes may still be significant we conducted a study in order to evaluate the effects of street washing on the mitigation of resuspension of fine particles. The PM2.5 mass concentration data were examined and integrated with the occurrence of street washing activities. In addition, the effect of the meteorological variability, traffic flow and street washing activities, on ambient PM2.5 levels was evaluated by means of a multivariate regression model. The results revealed that traffic flow is the most important factor that controls PM2.5 hourly concentrations while street washing activities did not influence fine particle mass levels.

Effects of traffic signal coordination on noise and air pollutant emissions	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Urban traffic; Microscopic simulation; Synchronization; Green wave; Sound level; Air pollution	FUEL CONSUMPTION; MICROSCOPIC SIMULATION; SPEED; FLOW; DYNAMICS; MODELS; IMPACT	Traffic management solutions are increasingly called for to address problems of transport and mobility. In particular, coordinated traffic lights that create green waves along major arterials are an increasingly used strategy to reduce travel times. Although it is usually assumed that an improved traffic flow will result in lower vehicle emissions, little scientific research has been spent on the effects of synchronized traffic lights on emissions. Moreover, because changes in traffic flow do not necessarily influence travel times, noise and air quality in the same way, there is a clear need for a combined approach. This paper reports on a computational study in which a microscopic traffic simulation model (Paramics) is combined with submodels for the emission of noise (Imagine) and air pollutants (VERSIT+). Through the simulation of a range of scenarios, the model is used to investigate the influence of traffic intensity, signal coordination schemes and signal parameters on the noise, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emissions along an arterial road equiped with a series of traffic lights. It was found that the introduction of a green wave could potentially lower the emissions of the considered air pollutants by 10%-40% in the most favorable conditions, depending on traffic flow and signal timing settings. Sound pressure levels were found to decrease by up to 1 dB(A) near the traffic signals, but to increase by up to 1.5 dB(A) in between intersections. Traffic intensity and green split were found to have the largest influence on emissions, while the cycle time did not have a significant influence on emissions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
