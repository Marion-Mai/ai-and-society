Traditional traffic signal control approaches are often based on the pure motor vehicles, regardless the effect of increasing e-bicycles. This paper proposed a discharge model of e-bicycle mixed traffic flows and developed an average delay formula based on that. We analysed the relationship between the average delay and cycle length, for the cases of pure motor vehicles delay and e-bicycle mixed traffic delay, respectively. Moreover, we presented a practical traffic signal control strategy for intersections with e-bicycle mixed traffic flow. It demonstrates that the optimal cycle length obtained from the proposed method is normally larger than that got from the Webster method, which complies with the field application and fits the real traffic circumstances.

According to the relationship between traffic parameters in the theory of traffic flow continuity, the rationality of the parameter is analyzed and the definition and calculation formula of the phase coordination rate are presented, by taking phase split, vehicle queue length, traffic flow velocity at upstream section as input variables, and signal cycle and phase green light starting point as output variables. Applying the new method to the adjacent intersections signal timing optimization, Compared with the traditional signal timing method, the paper considers the bandwidth requirement in each phase, and deeply describes the coordination degree of intersection traffic flow, phases and adjacent intersections, which provided a new theoretical reference of signal parameter optimization for balanced traffic flow.

This paper is to analyze the effect of pedestrians' crossing street on vehicle flows based on the investigation of their traffic characteristics. Rules of lane changing, acceleration, deceleration, randomization and update are modified here to simulate real traffic flows better. Then an urban two-lane cellular automata model of traffic flows is established under the above rules. MATLAB is used for numerical simulation of different traffic conditions. Meanwhile, space-time diagram and relational graphs of traffic flow parameters are generated and then comparatively analyzed. The analyzation results illustrate that the proposed model is in good consistence with real situation and can provide some practical reference for urban traffic management.

Accurate travel time prediction can help these companies make better planning and task scheduling. For several reasons, most companies are not able to obtain traffic flow data from traffic management authorities, but a large amount of trajectory data were collected everyday which has not been fully utilised. In this study, we aim to fill this gap and performed travel time prediction for freight vehicles at individual level using sparse Gaussian processes regression (SGPR) models with trajectory data. The results show that the prediction performance can be gradually improved by adding more mean speed estimates of traveled distance from the first 5 min as the real-time information. The overall performances of SGPR models are very similar to full GP, supported vector regression (SVR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models. The computational complexity of SGPR models is O(mn(2)), and it does not require lengthy model fitting process as SVR and ANN. This makes GP models more practicable for real-world practice in large-scale transportation data analyses.

From time series of traffic characteristics obtained for the links, we reconstruct mathematical models of the interdependencies between the traffic intensity (a.k.a. traffic flow or flux) and mean velocity. Graphical representations of these interdependencies have the same shape as the fundamental diagram of traffic flow through a physical street segment, which is known in transportation science.

Urban traffic is a kind of typical complex network, the analysis of its property is becoming a hot topic. The research of the urban traffic network congestion is presented in this paper. Through in-depth analysis of the urban traffic network features and a variety of circumstances which lead to traffic congestion, we build a complex network model which the nodes represent specific roads. In this model, we get the PageRank algorithm improved which in the field of search engines, and we apply it to a transportation network. Then we predict the situations of urban traffic network congestion with this model. Finally, comprehensive tests are conducted with the data from the monitoring of real roads. The experimental results show that the model proposed in this paper can simulate the change of traffic flow, which has a good forecast effect on the urban traffic congestion and also has a referential value to the planning of urban traffic.

Research on the traffic flow characteristic of the electric bicycle has important practical significance. Based on NaSch model, this paper models electric bicycle traffic flow with CA model and improves the lane changing model. Then the electric bicycle lanes change into general lane change and whistle change, and corresponding lane changing rules are set up. Simulation analysis of the model is carried out. The results show that when the traffic density is small, whistling behavior to raise the road utilization rate has some effect, but in the high density, whistle behavior can not improve road traffic capacity.

With the objective of explicitly addressing the effects of travel pattern [e.g., origin-destination (0-D) distribution] on the prediction of urban roadway traffic flow, this paper proposes a modified measure that integrates the BC index and the traditional travel demand metrics (i.e., the O-D demand and the ratios of total demand). In the case study, roadway networks of two cities San Francisco, California, and Nanjing, China were selected to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Taxi GPS trace data in the two cities were retrieved and applied to calibrate and validate the proposed measure. Correlation analyses were conducted to compare the predictions of the conventional and modified betweenness measures against the observed taxi traffic flows. The results show that, compared with the traditional approach, the modified betweenness measure produces predictions that have better correlations with the observed taxi traffic flows in both case studies. More accurate predictions for the future year traffic flow can be expected with the application of the new modified measure.

This paper proposes a cellular automata model to study the interactions of crossings pedestrian and traffic flow on a single lane roundabout. The boundary is controlled by the injecting rates alpha(1), alpha(2) and the extracting rate. Meanwhile, the crossing pedestrian decision is modeled with a gap acceptance rule. The results show that, pedestrian (resp. vehicular) flow can benefit from small (resp. large) gap acceptance to decrease the interferences vehicles-pedestrians. Likewise, we found that the crosswalk location play a chief role in improving the satisfaction of both pedestrians and vehicles. However, the use of slowdown sections provokes a decrease in pedestrians-vehicles interactions and increases the traffic capacity.

Beside the free flow (phase I), jamming phase (phase III) and maximum current (phase IV) the phase diagram exhibits a new phase (phase II) which take place for beta < 0.4 ( beta is the extracting rate). Moreover, the investigation of probability of the occurrence of car accidents has shown that the probability Pac increases with increasing the extraction rate beta and exhibits a maximum at the transition point from the free flow to the congestion phase. However, when beta exceeds the value 0.4, the probability Pac doesn't depends on beta. Furthermore, simulation results show that the speed limit zone (SLZ) can improve the road safety, where the probability Pac decreases with increasing length of SLZ. Likewise, we found that there is a critical injection rate alpha(c), below which both roads must be equiprobable. However, above which, one road must always have priority in order to reduce the risk of collisions.

Traditional traffic flow forecasting methods mainly include linear, nonlinear, neural network, and Time Series Analysis method. However, all of them have some shortcomings. This paper analyzes the existing algorithms on traffic flow prediction and characteristics of city traffic flow and proposes a road traffic flow prediction method based on transfer probability. This method first analyzes the transfer probability of upstream of the target road and then makes the prediction of the traffic flow at the next time by using the traffic flow equation. Newton Interior-Point Method is used to obtain the optimal value of parameters. Finally, it uses the proposed model to predict the traffic flow at the next time. By comparing the existing prediction methods, the proposed model has proven to have good performance. It can fast get the optimal value of parameters faster and has higher prediction accuracy, which can be used to make real-time traffic flow prediction.

The authors analytically derive a system of equations defining the optimal distribution of the incoming flow with minimum social costs, as well as a corresponding system of equations for the Wardrop equilibrium in this network. In particular, the Wardrop equilibrium is applied to the competition model with rational consumers who use the carriers with minimal cost, where cost is equal to the price for service plus the waiting time for the service. Finally, the social costs under the equilibrium and under the optimal distribution are compared. It is shown that the price of anarchy can be infinitely large in the model with strategic pricing.

This paper presents a new MapReduce-based nearest neighbor (NN) approach for traffic flow prediction using correlation analysis (TFPC) on a Hadoop platform. In particular, we develop a real-time prediction system including two key modules, i.e., offline distributed training (ODT) and online parallel prediction (OPP). Moreover, we build a parallel k-nearest neighbor optimization classifier, which incorporates correlation information among traffic flows into the classification process. Finally, we propose a novel prediction calculation method, combining the current data observed in OPP and the classification results obtained from large-scale historical data in ODT, to generate traffic flow prediction in real time. The empirical study on real-world traffic flow big data using the leave-one-out cross validation method shows that TFPC significantly outperforms four state-of-the-art prediction approaches, i.e., autoregressive integrated moving average, Naive Bayes, multilayer perceptron neural networks, and NN regression, in terms of accuracy, which can be improved 90.07% in the best case, with an average mean absolute percent error of 5.53%. In addition, it displays excellent speedup, scaleup, and sizeup.

Previously the American HCM was used, but specific circumstances in the Netherlands made it necessary to develop a Dutch HCM. This led to the introduction of the Dutch HCM, Handboek Capaciteitswaarden Infrastructuur Autosnelwegen in 1999, followed by the 2nd edition in 2002. Then, after a long period a completely new 3rd edition was published in 2011 and a fourth edition was completed in 2015. More than 15 years of research on highway capacities and the experience in using the manual has resulted in a practical handbook with an obligation to use it in planning studies for new and renewed highways in the Netherlands. The manual is one of the guidelines implemented in a working process system for planning studies. Although different indicators have been used over the years in transportation policy, the volume-to-capacity ratio is still the main indicator for the traffic flow quality in the Dutch HCM. Before the introduction of the Dutch HCM (< 1999) this indicator had been used most frequently. The most recent fourth version of Dutch HCM includes the research of capacities of tapers, cloverleaves, rush hour lanes and 4 lanes freeways. Weaving sections received special attention, as they are still simulated with the microsimulation model FOSIM. The new information was mostly added after requests of users. Because of a bigger role of consultants and less involvements of experts of Rijkswaterstaat in the highway designing process, guidelines become much more obligatory and nowadays contain specific minimum values and other specifications of the highway elements. Analysis has also been performed of capacity measurements at more than 200 locations. The influence of, among others, lane width, speed limit, absence of emergency lanes, tunnels and bridges have been analyzed. Also different road work configurations have been analyzed. The results from these analyses have been used in the fourth version of the Dutch HCM to state the influence of different infrastructure elements on the capacity and to validate and update previously stated values.

Enhancing the road infrastructure by building additional lanes or new motorways is cost-intensive and - due to the complex planning process in Germany - extremely tedious. Thus, the government tries to maximise the performance of the existing infrastructure using dynamic control systems. The development and deployment of autonomous driven vehicles can have positive effects on the capacity of road elements. In this study the effect of dynamic control systems on the traffic flow on motorways is analysed in case studies using microscopic traffic simulation. Furthermore it is outlined that autonomous driving in an environment where access to the motorway is limited to autonomous vehicles only can have a positive effect in terms of higher capacities and more harmonized traffic resulting in fewer traffic breakdowns.

In work zones, the capacity can be significantly reduced due to narrower lanes, a reduced number of traffic lanes, and unfavorable roadway geometry. In order to evaluate the impact of work zones on congestion occurrence and resulting delays as well as to allow for a consideration of alternative work zone layouts in the planning process, models to estimate the capacity of work zones are required. The paper presents results from a comprehensive study of work zone capacity on German freeways. In the analysis, a large number of short-term work zones with temporary lane closures as well as long-time work zones with and without a reduction of the number of lanes were covered. Data from loop or radar detectors upstream of the work zones were analyzed. For the capacity estimation of long-term work zones, both deterministic and stochastic approaches were used. For short-term work zones, valid capacity estimates could only be determined for the post-breakdown congestion outflow. The estimated capacities were analyzed regarding the influence of the traffic, geometric, and control conditions in the work zone. Relevant parameters are the number of lanes, the lane widths, the existence of divided lanes, the longitudinal gradient as well as the share of commuters and heavy vehicles. For short-time work zones, also the side of the lane closure (left or right lane) has an influence on the capacity. As a result of the study, capacity estimation models for both short-and long-term work zones, which can be applied in work zone planning procedures, are provided.

The paper presents a state-of-the-art description on roadwork effects on capacity. Based on the literature on this topic the most important parameters that should be incorporated in a Swedish capacity manual for the operation and maintenance roadwork are: the proportion of heavy traffic; lane width; number of closed lanes; closed road shoulder; proportion of commuter traffic; and length of roadwork zone. The paper presents a comparison of a composite model of correction factors from Germany, USA and Denmark and the Dutch model for computation of capacity reduction. The comparison show that the two models essentially gives the same results. Based on these results a model was developed. The model developed was validated using empirical data from a full scale test at the motorway network in Gothenburg. The throughput was measured in two cases during the morning and afternoon peak hour. The capacity for the normal site conditions was estimated based on traffic flow and speed data from the same site. The result shows that the empirically estimated capacity reduction is consistent with the reduction calculated with the new model for the different road work designs evaluated. The conclusion is that the model developed seems to be valid for capacity reduction estimations of roadworks on Swedish motorways but that more empirics are needed to ensure general validity.

Aiming to reduce traffic flow disruptions to a minimum, Hessen Mobil - Road and Traffic Management installed an innovative reversible lane system in a work zone on Autobahn A 3 south-east of Frankfurt, Germany. The section with three lanes and temporary hard shoulder running in both directions carries a high amount of commuter traffic with considerable fluctuations in peak traffic flow direction. During road works, four lanes in the peak direction and three lanes in the off-peak direction could be maintained through the use of a reversible lane system. The paper discusses the effects of the reversible lane system on traffic flow and road safety. Radar measurements revealed a maximum traffic volume of roughly 1500 veh/h on the reversible lane. The capacity of the work zone was estimated with the stochastic capacity estimation technique based on models for censored data. Compared with the capacity of the unaffected three-lane carriageway with temporary hard shoulder running, a decrease of the capacity by around 15% was estimated for the four-lane work zone configuration including the reversible lane. Similar to other freeway work zones, the road safety analysis revealed an increase of crash rates during road works. However, based on police accident reports only 10% of the total number of crashes and none of the severe crashes could be linked to particular features of the reversible lane system. Altogether, the investigation shows that a reversible lane system is a useful, safe and accepted instrument of intelligent traffic management for freeway work zones with high fluctuations in peak traffic flow direction. At the analyzed work zone, estimated travel time losses of 400000 veh . h could be saved during two months of road works by the application of the reversible lane compared with a permanent lane reduction in one direction.

They generate bottlenecks and can consequently cause congestion and accidents. If the number of lanes is reduced, this will lead to a significant decrease in capacity. Even if all lanes can be kept operational, narrower lanes and roadway switching will reduce the capacity. Intelligent solutions to support the traffic flow at long-term roadworks therefore need to be evaluated. The "Traffic Change" (TC) system was developed for this purpose. This system enables lanes to be dynamically assigned to the roadway with the higher demand. It can be applied in the case of bridge maintenance, road resurfacing and repair (entire roadway), tunnel renovation with two-way traffic in the operational bore, or temporary adaption of the number of operational lanes, depending on the traffic demand. In this way, the work space needed for roadworks can be enlarged. Thus TC has beneficial effects on capacity and thus on traffic flow when the number of traffic lanes is reduced in roadworks. Even if all traffic lanes are kept operational during the roadworks, TC provides several advantages concerning road- and bridgeworks operation and costs. The TC concept leads to improved traffic safety and optimized traffic flow at roadworks, as well as shorter interruptions and lower costs. Finally, using TC at roadworks will result in major cost savings that can be computed using the "Traffic Change Simulation" tool (TC-Sim).

Autonomous and Connected Cars: HCM Estimates for Freeways with Various Market Penetration Rates	INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ENHANCING HIGHWAY PERFORMANCE (ISEHP), (7TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON HIGHWAY CAPACITY AND QUALITY OF SERVICE, 3RD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON FREEWAY AND TOLLWAY OPERATIONS)	Transportation Research Procedia		English	Proceedings Paper	International Symposium on Enhancing Highway Performance (ISEHP) / 7th International Symposium on Highway Capacity and Quality of Service / 3rd International Symposium on Freeway and Tollway Operations	JUN 14-16, 2016	Berlin, GERMANY	German Rd & Transportat Res Assoc		driverless; autonomous; connective vehicle; freeway operations; HCM; LOS		Major IT companies and vehicle manufacturers have announced their plans for autonomous driving technology. Autonomous light duty vehicles are often referred to as "driverless cars" (DLC). These technologies intend to partly or fully replace driving by combining navigation systems, artificial intelligence, in-vehicle sensors, roadside ITS and traffic monitoring data, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. The absence of perception errors and the minimal perception and reaction time of DLC enable them to maintain shorter headways, to apply consistent acceleration and deceleration rates, and to optimize the use of gaps. In theory, freeway operations and level of service (LOS) can be impacted to a substantial but yet unknown degree by the DLC. The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). is a static and macroscopic methodology for assessing various traffic flow facilities. Its 2010 edition is not adjusted for the presence of DLC on highways, however, several of its parameters are sensitive to differences in perception and reaction times, headways, etc. An investigation was conducted to assess the likely changes to traffic flow characteristics that may result from the introduction of DLC. The focus of this paper is on expressways, that is, on HCM analyses of basic freeway segment and freeway weaving segment. DLC is able to increase capacity (c), the maximum service flow rate (MSFi), the adjustment factor for unfamiliar driver population (f(P)), passenger-car equivalent (PCE), and the proportion of heavy vehicles (P-T). The combined benefits improve LOS. The results from the case studies show that the impacts of DLC on HCM parameters are tiny if the DLC have a very small market share. Two types of DLC are considered in this paper: Autonomous DLC, and Connected DLC with V2V and V2I. On a basic freeway segment the Autonomous DLC improves LOS from D to C when its share in traffic reaches 7%. The same case study shows that the Connected DLC improves LOS from D to C when its share in traffic reaches 3%.

The paper presents the HBS procedure for the assessment of basic freeway segments and discusses challenges for the future development of the methodology. As in the former edition of the HBS, the volume-to-capacity ratio is used as measure of effectiveness for basic freeway segments. The design capacities and speed-flow diagrams for basic freeway segments were completely revised and supplemented by new design values for segments with four-lane carriageways and segments with hard shoulder running. Besides the provision of specific design capacities, the reduced capacity variance on segments with variable speed limits, which was ascertained in recent investigations, is considered by adjusting the lower threshold value of LOS E. The new edition of the HBS also provides a framework for the use of specific parameters and the application of alternative methods for the assessment of traffic flow quality. Overall, the revised procedure for the analysis of basic freeway segments includes major enhancements and covers a larger number of segment types, but the main concept still follows the tradition of using deterministic capacities and providing rather simple analytical procedures to assess the traffic flow in one specific peak hour. For the future development of the HBS, the application of computer-based simulation models as well as the use of stochastic traffic flow parameters that better represent traffic reliability will increasingly emerge.

To incorporate this traffic flow regime within the methodology, we identify several aspects of the methodology that require enhancements and propose modifications. Next, we implement these modifications in a macroscopic traffic model developed as a software implementation of the German guideline. In this manner, the HBS user can conduct traffic flow analysis that includes volume-to-capacity ratios above 1.00 which has not been foreseen by the guideline until now. The main contribution of this paper is the identification of methods within the German Highway Capacity Manual that require modification to enable incorporation of oversaturated traffic flow within the analysis. Further, we introduce traffic density as a variable within the HBS methodology and show benefits of its incorporation during the oversaturated time periods. Finally, the paper includes illustrative examples of empirical and model-based evaluation of congested freeway facility in Germany. The paper concludes with a discussion of proposed methods and their limitations.

One of the most complex traffic phenomena on freeways are shockwaves. Shockwaves are recognized as the sudden, substantial change in the state of the traffic flow, which acts as an active or moving bottleneck. They have significant impact on freeway capacity and safety. For this study, a microscopic traffic simulation was used to determine the extent to which inter-vehicle communication and change in the driving strategy after the recognition of a shockwave can influence the propagation and dissolving of shockwaves on freeways. We also briefly introduce the shockwave theory and our communication algorithm. Then we present the simulation result with different penetration rates of communicative vehicles, which are randomly dispersed in traffic flow, through performance measures for traffic flow with shockwaves.

Multisource data from Bluetooth (R) and IP-based (cellular and Wi-Fi) communications, global positioning system (GPS) devices, cell phones, probe vehicles, license plate readers, infrastructure-based traffic-flow sensors, and in the future, connected vehicles enable multisource data fusion to be exploited to produce an enhanced interpretation of the monitored or observed situation. This occurs by decreasing the uncertainty present in individual source data. Although demonstrated for more than two decades, data fusion (DF) is still an emergent field as related to day-to-day traffic management operations. Data fusion techniques applied to date include Bayesian inference, Dempster-Shafer evidential reasoning, artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, and Kalman filtering. This paper provides a survey of ITS DF applications, including ramp metering, pedestrian crossing, automatic incident detection, travel time prediction, adaptive signal control, and crash analysis and prevention, and indicates directions for future research. The encouraging results so far should not conceal the challenges that remain before widespread operational deployment of DF in transportation management occurs.

It also aims at using this information for the traffic state determination of a whole freeway network with the goal of a fast and reliable dynamic net control in incident situations. Based on a four-year experience in a Bluetooth detector test bed in Northern Bavaria, Germany, and after the evaluation of hundreds of millions of single detections, the technology as well as the developed algorithms for validation and evaluation of the data show their feasibility in practical use, especially in areas with a low density of stationary detectors like inductive loops. The data-driven part of the approach is divided into three subsequent steps. These steps are the determination of travel times, the data filtering and validation of plausible travel times and the automatic incident detection. The determination of travel time is based on the time stamp of the detection of a Bluetooth device with the shortest estimated distance to the position of the Bluetooth detector. For the data filtering the "Time Dependent Comparison to Neighbor Values Filter" will be applied. This filter allows for a fast and reliable differentiation between unrealistic (due to stops, detours, back and return trips etc.) and plausible travel time values for a certain segment of the freeway and is based on a method to validate if the determined travel time is in a plausibility threshold corridor defined by the values of the previous and the next neighboring travel times. The outcome is a detailed travel time information for the whole freeway network which is used for an automatic incident detection, which was developed and calibrated within this research project. This includes the detection of the start of an incident as well as the end of an incident. The result is continuous information about the prevailing travel times and a fast and reliable traffic state information for all segments, which allows for a dynamic large-scale re-routing in the Bavarian freeway network in case of congestions or other disturbances of the traffic flow.

Impact of Bottleneck Merge Control Strategies on Freeway Level of Service	INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ENHANCING HIGHWAY PERFORMANCE (ISEHP), (7TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON HIGHWAY CAPACITY AND QUALITY OF SERVICE, 3RD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON FREEWAY AND TOLLWAY OPERATIONS)	Transportation Research Procedia		English	Proceedings Paper	International Symposium on Enhancing Highway Performance (ISEHP) / 7th International Symposium on Highway Capacity and Quality of Service / 3rd International Symposium on Freeway and Tollway Operations	JUN 14-16, 2016	Berlin, GERMANY	German Rd & Transportat Res Assoc		Traffic Flow; Traffic Congestion; Bottlenecks; Level of Service (LOS); Simulation		Freeway work zones typically mandate lane closures that often induce bottlenecks. Merge maneuvers and the accompanying increase in the rate of lane changes at these bottlenecks can become problematic resulting in undesirable mobility and safety impacts. Traditionally, merge control strategies are deployed to mitigate such impacts. Literature sources indicate that available merge control strategies fall into one of four categories, namely: (i) late merge control, (ii) early merge control, (iii) mainline merge metering, and (iv) temporary ramp metering. However, little is known about the proper criteria for selecting and implementing one of the available merge control strategies. In addition, the impact of the various control strategies on freeway Level of Service (LOS) is currently under-researched. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the operational impacts of the above-mentioned freeway merge control strategies. The goal is to provide work-zone-aware LOS indicators that would help transportation agencies in selecting the most appropriate merge control strategy to minimally impact the freeway operations. In order to meet the research goals and objectives, this study used the CORSIM micro-simulation platform to evaluate impacts of various merge control strategies at a freeway study corridor in Birmingham, AL. The 2010 Highway Capacity Manual methods for calculating LOS were considered and modifications were proposed to align the calculated LOS with the assessed impacts of each merge control strategy. This study is significant for its contribution to providing transportation researchers and professionals with tools and methods to evaluate freeway LOS under work zone conditions and assisting them in mitigating the adverse impacts of work zones on traffic operations.

Generally, the basis of congestion pricing zone (CPZ) systems comprised of the following three main phases: vehicle detection, data communication, and enforcement. In terms of data communication, the majority of the existing systems utilize Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) which contains several limitations such as a low transmission range, low data rate, communication drawbacks like delay, tag and reader collisions, signal fading, and interception. In this particular context, it would be very constructive to take advantage of a Vehicular ad hoc Network (VANET) that is based on the Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) method to design a pervasive-congestion pricing system. This study aims to design an optimized CPZ-management model using VANET to solve the existing mainstream problems. The proposed approach is evaluated and validated using a simulation environment and a selection of tools including NS-2, SUMO, and TraNS. The experimental results from two different scenarios (i.e. using RFID-based RSU and DSRC-based RSU) were attained after considering the number, velocity, and occupancy of the contributed vehicles, and the traffic flow. The obtained results show that DSRC outperformed RFID in terms of occupancy, traffic flow, and velocity by an average of 8.27%, 22%, and 13.75%, respectively. Consequently, the DSRC employment under VANET infrastructure not only enhances data-communication, but also reduces traffic congestion around CPZ.

Since such factors vary depending on the type of road network, restricting the traffic prediction model to pre-decided congestion factors could compromise the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a traffic prediction model that could adapt to the road network and appropriately consider the contribution of each congestion causing or reflecting factors. Basically our model is based on the multiple symbol Hidden Markov Model, wherein correlation among all the symbols (congestion causing factors) are build using the bivariate analysis. The traffic congestion state is finally deduced on the basis of influence from all the factors. Our prediction model was evaluated by comparing two different cases of traffic flow. We compared the models built for uninterrupted (without traffic signal) and interrupted (with traffic signal) traffic flow. The resulting prediction accuracy is of 79 % and 88 % for uninterrupted and interrupted traffic flow respectively.

So far, various studies have been done to evaluate the saturation flow rate at nearside legs of intersections which is fit to geometrical dimensions, traffic flow characteristics and the behaviour of the drivers. However, despite the deference between the above specifications, no study has been conducted on the saturation flow rate at far-side legs and considering the difference between the saturation flow rate at nearside and far-side legs in case of reducing the number of lanes, lane width and other effective factors, it seems to be necessary to determine the saturation flow rate at far-side legs. In the present study, using field data collection at five signalized intersections in Rasht city, the saturation flow rate is estimated and analyzed by macroscopic and microscopic methods, considering the existing lane width at nearside and far-side legs of the intersections. The results indicate that the values of saturation flow rate at far-side legs using the microscopic method are higher than the similar values in nearside legs. Also there is a primarily linear relationship (R-2=0.957) between the lane width and saturation flow rate at far-side legs using the macroscopic method. There is an exponential non-linear relationship at far-side legs (R-2=0.859) and a logarithmic non-linear relationship at nearside legs (R-2=0.105) between the lane width and saturation flow rate using the microscopic method. In regard to far-side leg's R-2, it seems that the main criterion in determining the saturation flow rate is the lane width, while at nearside leg more effective parameters need to be used to determine the values of saturation flow rate.

The presented mathematical model makes it possible to quantify the dynamic characteristics of the traffic flow for various levels of speed limitation and for a wide range of road conditions. The problem of structural and parametric identification of the mathematical model is challenging. A solution to this problem is based on the traffic flow theory, regression analysis and dynamic programming.

As a result, traffic is now considered a main source of noise pollution. This paper reports on the modelling of traffic noise levels in Golestan National Park, Golestan using vehicle data and other environmental features. For the evaluation of noise and the recording of independent environmental variables, Sampling stations were selected using a systematic-random method at 76 points at various distances and between 0-250 meters from the road. At each sampling point, traffic flow (number and speed of vehicles, number of horn beeps) was measured for 15 minutes from 8 am to 8 pm. Simultaneously other environmental variables were assessed, including the geometry of the road surface and location conditions.The best multivariable regression based on the correlation coefficient (R) and the coefficient of determination (R2) was achieved. The R-square (73%) and the adjusted R-square (68%) of the regression equation were 73% and 68% respectively. The results of modelling show that the most important variables affecting noise pollution are distance from the road, roughness coefficient, speed of medium-weight vehicles, relative humidity, and height and number of light vehicles. There is a negative correlation with distance from the road and noise pollution.The accuracy of the model was found to be about 5 dB. Therefore, the model is suggested for the prediction of traffic noise on the Asian Highway in Golestan National Park.

Firstly, we extracted all the traffic flow data of microwave coils and videos, as well as the traffic accidents after updating the electromechanical system of Beijing section in Jing-ha freeway, so as to establish the risk prediction database, and developed the pre-analysis software of basic data; secondly, the traffic flow data of 30 minutes prior to the time of the accident were divided into six slices at 5-minute level, and the volume, speed, occupancy as well as their statistical parameters were selected as the chosen parameters of the model; next, single parameter Logistic regression analysis was carried out in each time slice respectively; finally, based on the results of the correlation analysis of parameters and the single-parameter modeling significance, the multi-parameters Logistic regression model was established in each time slice respectively, thus obtaining the short-term prediction model of the traffic flow operation security situation. The results indicate that, the modeling fitting effect of slice 1 is the best, that is the change of the traffic flow parameters and their statistics in 5 minutes prior to the time of the accident can effectively predict the possibility of the accident, in which the average speed has a significant impact on the risk of the accident.

In this paper, a novel short-term traffic flow prediction method called Ensemble Real-time Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (ERS-ELM) with simplified single layer feed-forward networks (SLFN) structure under freeway peak traffic condition and non-stationary condition is proposed. By quickly training historical data and incrementally updating model with new arrived data, ERE-ELM has the characteristics of less training time consumption and high prediction accuracy. Ensemble mechanism is also used to improve stability and robustness. Experiment results show that average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), test root mean square error (RMSE) as well as training time consumption of proposed method is superior to classical Wave-NN, MLP-NN and ELM methods.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of Delayed Acceleration Feedback (DAF) on the dynamics of the Reduced Classical Car-Following Model (RCCFM). We first derive the Reduced Classical Car-Following Model with Delayed Acceleration Feedback (RCCFM-DAF). Next, we demonstrate that the transition of traffic flow from the locally stable to the unstable regime occurs via a Hopf bifurcation. The analysis also yields the necessary and sufficient condition for local stability. We characterise the type of Hopf bifurcation and the asymptotic orbital stability of the emergent limit cycles for the RCCFM by using Poincare normal forms and the center manifold theory. We then use this analysis to infer requisite insights into the RCCFM-DAF by means of an appropriately defined linear transformation. The analysis is complemented with a stability chart and a bifurcation diagram. Our work reveals three effects of DAF on the RCCFM: (i) reduction in the stable region, (i i) increase in the frequency of the emergent limit cycles, and (i i i) decrease in the amplitude of the emergent limit cycles. This, in turn, has two immediate repercussions: (i) decrease in resilience to the reaction delay, and (ii) an increase in the risk of a collision due to jerky vehicular motion.

Intelligent Transportation Systems are a key constituent of any smart planet solution. Forecasting Traffic flow is one of the aspects of Intelligent Transportation Systems. A hybrid model comprising of genetic algorithm and time delay neural network has been used here to predict short term traffic flow. Three new input parameters; dew point, humidity and sea level pressure have been incorporated into a multi input parameters model. The hybrid model leads to significant reduction in RMSE values as compared to neural network model.

J	Dehman, A; Drakopoulos, A				Dehman, Amjad; Drakopoulos, Alexander			Revisiting Merge-Influence Area Empirically Operations Inside Recurrent Freeway Bottlenecks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							MICROSCOPIC SIMULATION; CAPACITY	The current effort aims to analyze traffic operations empirically at merge-influence areas positioned inside recurrent freeway bottlenecks. Four years of data at four bottlenecks in the Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, freeway system were used in the analysis. Bottlenecks were ranked on the basis of merge-area capacity use and were treated individually. The study evaluated how merge-area traffic mix influenced freeway breakdown characteristics such as prebreakdown flow (PBF), queue discharge flow (QDF), queue discharge speed, and congestion duration (CD). Merge-area traffic mix was evaluated with the ramp volume ratio (RVR), which was defined as the percentage of the ramp flow in the total merge-area traffic flow. For bottlenecks with heavily used merge areas, both capacities (PBF and QDF) and queue discharge speed were reduced when RVR increased in value. The value of CD appeared to be sensitive to RVR. The value of CD was found to double, triple, or almost quadruple when ramp flow composed a higher percentage of merge-area flow. Bottlenecks with lightly used merge areas sometimes showed different or even contradictory results. The study also modeled two capacity flows (PBF and QDF) stochastically at merge areas with the three-parametric Weibull distribution. From the current analysis, it appears that the maximum merge-area flow (4,600 passenger cars per hour) recommended by the Highway Capacity Manual is not a conservative design value.

This study developed an analytical model for estimating the capacity of weaving, merge, and diverge sections with the median XBL installed on an urban expressway by using a microsimulation approach. An in-depth analysis of weaving behaviors was conducted and factors that influenced the weaving section capacity were identified. Specifically, an off-ramp weaving ratio and a newly defined variable called the bus ratio in the total weaving volume were used. A Vissim simulation model was developed and calibrated on the basis of field data collected in Beijing. From the simulation results, a regression model on the capacity estimation was proposed; the model was further validated with a statistical approach and field capacity data. The results demonstrate that the proposed capacity model is applicable and easy to use with an acceptable accuracy. The model can be used not only to estimate the weaving section capacity with a median XBL but also to estimate the capacity of merge or diverge sections with a median XBL under appropriate constraints. Moreover, the proposed model can be applied to examine different bus operational strategies. Hence, a comparative analysis was conducted of the effectiveness of different measures to improve traffic flows in the weaving section with the installation of a median XBL. A recommendation is provided.

Numerous control strategies have been proposed to mitigate the traffic congestion. This paper introduced an improved control model that integrated both ramp and mainstream on multi-lane roadways. The basic model proposed by Papageorgiou was firstly introduced, and then the improved control model taking both ramp and mainstream into consideration was modified. The simulation experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of the improved model. Results indicate that compared to no control and ALINEA model, the modified model proposed by this study has the best control effect on multi-lane roadway congestion mitigation.

It not only brings huge losses of life and property, but also disturbs urban traffic operation, thus brings bad impact on urban transportation that in turn influences the rescue efficiency. In this paper, the characteristics of traffic fire and traffic influence of fire are discussed at first, and then simulation experiments on traffic operation before and after fires are conducted using VISSIM software. The test results show that the fire accident will bring big delays and long queue length to upstream traffic flow but the influence will be significantly reduced after taking some reasonable traffic restrictions.

This method makes improvements in the original layout optimization model. Through the analysis of the complex components of VMS guidance effects, this method introduces repeated VMS traffic flow guidance effect and wasted VMS traffic flow guidance effect. This method also defines guidance coverage rate and guidance effect loss rate. At last, the greedy algorithm was used to solve the VMS layout optimization function. Through a road network example of 15 nodes, the model is proved to be simple and efficient. When seven VMS are collocated in the net, the guidance coverage rate is 0.75, and the guidance effect loss rate reaches 0.04; in Mei model 1, the guidance coverage rate is 0.56, and the guidance effect loss rate reaches 0.22; so it is an optimal configuration. Hence, it is more suitable for the needs of actual traffic flow guidance.

However, there are relatively few studies about how to decide the priority of different traffic organizational modes of multi-lane freeways with more than eight lanes. Based on the data from Shen-Shan Segment of Jing-Ha Freeway, this paper aimed to establish a multi-objective evaluation index system for three different traffic organizational modes, including, the integral mode, the 'Long-distance artery & collecting and distributing rode' mode and the passenger-freight separated mode. VISSIM simulation studies were conducted to obtain various traffic flow parameters, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process was used to determine the priority of the three traffic organizational modes. The research results can help the decision makers to select a relatively better organizational mode in reconstruction and expansion projects of multilane freeways.

This chapter presents research results of traffic noise level recorded in the street of the transit and distribution function, which is a part of the road system of the city of Bielsko-Biala, Poland. The study was conducted before and after the opening of the expressway S-69, which took over the transit function from the examined street. Measured noise data were compared to the registered traffic flows and the share of heavy vehicles in the traffic flow. The results of research conducted before and after opening of the expressway were also compared. The studies are at the first step towards obtaining general assumptions to the formulation of a semiempirical model of acoustic impact of traffic flow.

J	Llorca, C; Farah, H				Llorca, Carlos; Farah, Haneen			Passing Behavior on Two-Lane Roads in Real and Simulated Environments	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							SIGHT DISTANCE; DRIVERS; AGE	Passing maneuvers allow faster drivers to continue driving at their desired speeds without being delayed behind impeding vehicles. On two-lane rural roads, such maneuvers require the passing driver to occupy the opposing lane; this condition has tremendous implications for the safety and operation of two-lane roads. Several studies have investigated the passing behavior of drivers, and some studies have used driving simulators to analyze drivers' behavior during following and passing maneuvers. However, the validity of simulators has not been ensured, because their results have rarely been compared with real data. The objective of this study was to compare drivers' passing behavior as observed in the field with passing behavior in a driving simulator. For this purpose, data on passing performance and passing gap acceptance decisions were required. The study carried out a comparative analysis of the most significant variables related to passing behavior. The results showed similarities between passing time and passing distance of completed maneuvers (during the occupation of the opposing lane). However, drivers passed faster in the driving simulator and maintained greater clearances. Gap acceptance decisions were found to be similar, as the distributions of accepted and rejected gaps were similar, although critical gaps were found to be lower in the driving simulator. This finding might be explained by the absence of objective risks. The applicability of driving simulation seems reasonable, although some improvements are still possible, to account for sight distance limitations, replicate age and gender distributions, and reproduce the opposing traffic flow.

It can reduce variation in speed of vehicles travelling along the controlled section. The implementation of VSL encourages a uniform driving behaviour and thus resulting in a better distribution of traffic over the motorway network, and better utilization of the road infrastructure. The primary objective of motorway traffic management is to improve mobility benefits of motorways under acceptable safety standards; this is also the main purpose of applying VSL. This paper reviews the existing VSL methods from view points of safety and mobility gains or losses due to VSL on motorway systems. A systematic review of the literature of empirical as well as simulation-based studies is presented.

J	Zhu, H; He, XY; Liu, XM; Li, H				Zhu, Hui; He, XiaoYing; Liu, XiMeng; Li, Hui			PTFA: a secure and privacy-preserving traffic flow analysis scheme for intelligent transportation system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMBEDDED SYSTEMS			English	Article						intelligent transportation system; ITS; traffic flow analysis; privacy-preserving; multi-dimensional aggregation		With the pervasiveness of vehicle information systems (VIS) and the advance of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which can improve road traffic and reduce traffic accidents, have attracted considerable interest recently. However, the development of ITS still faces many challenges including privacy of individual data and locations. In this paper, we propose a secure and privacy-preserving traffic flow analysis scheme, called PTFA, for ITS. With PTFA, user privacy can be guaranteed when the manager acquires the fine-grained traffic information. We first map the information of roads to a super increasing sequence; then, construct an improved multi-dimensional aggregation scheme based on the homomorphic Paillier cryptosystem. For data communications from user to traffic regional-centre (TRC), data aggregation is performed directly on ciphertext at road side units (RSUs) without decryption, and the aggregation result of the original data can be obtained at the TRC. Detailed security analysis shows that the proposed PTFA scheme can efficiently achieve user privacy-preserving in ITS. In addition, performance evaluations via extensive simulations demonstrate the PTFA's effectiveness in terms of providing fine-grained traffic information processing and minimising communication cost.

The traffic flow theory that can guide and schedule traffic is needed. Traffic flow model based on cellular automata which is used to describe the freeway traffic flow model has been reaching maturity and applied to the actual traffic simulation system. And the traffic flow model that used to describe the city road network, referred as BML model) still remains in the stage of theoretical research. Many scholars analyze the BML model by analyzing phase-change principle and making theoretical proof. Yet the scholars have not applied the BML model into the actual urban traffic network, and intelligent scheduling and guidance. The basic BML model is improved to predict traffic congestion of the actual city road network. This study focuses on the amelioration of BML model and the numerical simulation based on this model. The main idea of this paper is: (1) the real urban traffic road network mapped to the D-BML model in accordance with a certain strategy. And the proportion of traffic volume density should be mapped to the D-BML model in accordance with of the road network in a time period. (2) D-BML model evolves in accordance with rule 184 of the cellular automaton evolution. The jam coordinate values of model grid points can be got when the model eventually enter the blocked state. (3) The severe congestion at the intersection also can be got in the next period of time. The experimental results show that the proposed D-BML model can accurately predict the blocked intersection in the road network. The first analysis of the D-BML model density of traffic is on the uniform distribution and Poisson distributions. The blockage values on the model grid are analyzed. The experiments show that as long as the initialization traffic flow density distribution determined, the clogging grid points will not change. Then engineering experiments are made. The simulation experiments of this article are about England's Birmingham City traffic network. The final experimental results are very consistent with the actual traffic clogged intersections, which strongly proved correctness and effectiveness of M-BML model.

There is no doubt that the city's economic development and people's travel life have brought a lot of pressure on the urban road traffic. Many research focus on the optimization of traffic flow in cities. Considering the accident, vehicles can avoid congestion point and change behavior, such as moving path of accidents before the vehicle driving rules in BML model was improved, closer to that of the actual vehicle driving behavior.

J	Martin-Gasulla, M; Garcia, A; Moreno, AT				Martin-Gasulla, Marilo; Garcia, Alfredo; Moreno, Ana Tsui			Benefits of Metering Signals at Roundabouts with Unbalanced Flow Patterns in Spain	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Unbalanced flow patterns may be a problem in roundabouts, even at medium demand levels. One single approach can cause queues on the downstream approaches; the average delay can increase greatly, and the roundabout can fail. This operational problem can be lessened by regulating traffic with metering signals, one of the most cost-effective measures used in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Even though some Spanish roundabouts exceed capacity, the potential benefit to local conditions has not been studied. Traffic micro simulation was used to analyze capacity improvements and operational performance on roundabouts with metering signals. A field study characterized gap acceptance behavior on conditions close to capacity. Vissim was calibrated and validated, and a signal control logic was implemented in its VisVAP module. The capacity from traffic micro simulation represents the traffic demands observed in the field more accurately because of the variable follow-up headways. In contrast, the U.S. Highway Capacity Manual 2010 underestimates capacity for almost all observed conditions. Almost 400 combinations of design and control parameters for metering signals were required to obtain the optimal (location and timing) model with the lowest average delay. Then, traffic demand scenarios were varied with the optimal metering system. The percentage benefit, calculated as overall average delay, could be up to 60% depending on the combination of controlling traffic demand and conflicting traffic flow. Results allow users to determine the need for metering and quantify the potential benefit from its application to one-lane roundabouts.

J	Choi, S; Oh, C				Choi, Saerona; Oh, Cheol			Proactive Strategy for Variable Speed Limit Operations on Freeways Under Foggy Weather Conditions	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							MAINSTREAM TRAFFIC FLOW; SAFETY; IMPACTS	Adverse weather conditions are a critical external factor that threaten traffic safety on freeways. Variable speed limit (VSL) operations can be used as a traffic management tool to harmonize vehicle speed and reduce the likelihood of crashes during adverse weather conditions. This paper proposes a novel VSL operations strategy based on the prediction of weather and traffic conditions, referred to as a proactive VSL operations strategy. The k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) statistic was used to predict weather and traffic conditions. VSL operations logic, which used visibility distances and safe stopping distances obtained from road weather information systems and average speeds obtained by vehicle detection systems, was developed. The proposed methodology is focused on the restricted visibility distance resulting from foggy weather conditions on freeways. A microscopic traffic simulator, VISSIM, was used to simulate a freeway traffic stream and collect vehicle-maneuvering data. An external application program interface, the VISSIM COM interface, was used to implement the proposed VSL operations strategy. A surrogate safety assessment model was used to derive indirect safety measures to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Total conflicts in the proposed VSL algorithm were reduced in comparison with a system lacking VSL by 19.10% and 27.27% under moderately and severely foggy weather conditions, respectively. These outcomes are expected to be of great use in the development of more effective VSL systems to enhance freeway safety during adverse weather conditions.

J	Kong, DW; Guo, XC; Yang, B; Wu, DX				Kong, Dewen; Guo, Xiucheng; Yang, Bo; Wu, Dingxin			Analyzing the Impact of Trucks on Traffic Flow Based on an Improved Cellular Automaton Model	DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY			English	Article							SIMULATION-MODEL; VEHICLES; BEHAVIOR; STATES	This paper aims to analyze the impact of trucks on traffic flow and propose an improved cellular automaton model, which considers both the performance difference between passenger cars and trucks and the behaviour change of passenger cars under the impact of trucks. A questionnaire survey has been conducted to find out whether the impact of trucks exists and how the behaviour of passenger car drivers changes under the impact of trucks. The survey results confirm that the impact of trucks exists and indicate that passenger car drivers will enlarge the space gap, decelerate, and change lanes in advance when they are affected. Simulation results show that traffic volume is still affected by percentages of trucks in the congestion phase in the proposed model compared with traditional heterogeneous cellular automaton models. Traffic volume and speed decrease with the impact of trucks in the congestion phase. The impact of trucks can increase traffic congestion as it increases. However, it has different influences on the speed variance of passenger cars in different occupancies. In the proposed model, the relative relationship of the space gap between car-following-truck and car-following-car is changeable at a certain value of occupancy, which is related to the impact of trucks.

The primary objective of this study is to model the cyclists' red-light running frequency within the framework of Bayesian statistics. Data was collected at twenty-five approaches at seventeen signalized intersections. The Poisson-gamma(PG) and Poisson-lognormal (PLN) model were developed and compared. The models were validated using Bayesian.. values based on posterior predictive checking indicators. It was found that the two models have a good fit of the observed cyclists' red-light running frequency. Furthermore, the PLN model outperformed the PG model. The model estimated results showed that the amount of cyclists' red-light running is significantly influenced by bicycle flow, conflict traffic flow, pedestrian signal type, vehicle speed, and e-bike rate. The validation result demonstrated the reliability of the PLN model. The research results can help transportation professionals to predict the expected amount of the cyclists' red-light running and develop effective guidelines or policies to reduce red-light running frequency of bicycles at signalized intersections.

A set of assumptions have been proposed to normalize the execution of lane-changing. Both the execution process and slow-to-start rule are taken into account, and comparisons are made among basic STCA model, STCA-sts (combined with the slow-to-start rule) model and the new model (STCA-E). The simulation results show (i) STCA-E model is consistent with driver's lane changing motivation that the driver is always keeping the speed not lower than the current value; (ii) a two-dimension plane is found in the lane changing frequency-density figure, which may provide proof to three-phase traffic theory; (iii) along with increasing of slow trucks, more vehicles will make lane changing for a better traffic condition, and the 2D plane will become narrower.

Based on the traffic axle load data measured by the weigh-in-motion system and the methods proposed by General Code for Design of Highway Bridges and Culverts (JTG D60-2004) and Code for Design of Highway Reinforced Concrete and Prestressed Concrete Bridges and Culverts (JTG D62-2004), the vehicle load parameters under practical traffic flow conditions are investigated. A typical 6-axle vehicle model with a 2-1-3 axial pattern is proposed by using the statistical analysis of total weight, axial weight, etc. The live load effects of Daliushu No. 2 Bridge, one highway bridge on the national highway G103, are analyzed using the proposed model and compared to the vehicle load model given in the Chinese code. The results show that there are great differences in the vehicle load parameters and the live load effects from the proposed vehicle load model increased by 20-50% compared with the model given by the code. The overweight vehicles are potential threats to the safety of existing bridges.

VALIDATION OF SCENARIO MODELLING FOR BRIDGE LOADING	BALTIC JOURNAL OF ROAD AND BRIDGE ENGINEERING			English	Article						bridges; highway; loads; scenario modelling; traffic; trucks	TRAFFIC-FLOW MODELS; CALIBRATION	Accurate estimates of characteristic bridge load effects are required for efficient design and assessment of bridges, and long-run traffic simulations are an effective method for estimating the effects. For multi-lane same-direction traffic, truck weights and locations on the bridge are correlated and this affects the calculated load effects. Scenario Modelling is a recently developed method, which uses weigh-in-motion data to simulate multi-lane same-direction traffic while maintaining location and weight correlations. It has been unclear however, whether the method may produce unrealistic driver behaviour when extrapolating beyond the weigh-in-motion measuring period. As weigh-in -motion databases with more than about a year of data are not available, a microsimulation traffic model, which can simulate driver behaviour, is used here to assess the accuracy of extrapolating traffic effects using Scenario Modelling. The microsimulation is used to generate an extended reference dataset against which the results of Scenario Modelling are compared. It is found that the characteristic load effects obtained using Scenario Modelling compare well with the reference dataset. As a result, for the first time researchers and practitioners can model two-lane same-direction traffic loading on bridges while being confident that the approach is generating accurate estimates of characteristic load effects as well as effectively reproducing the complex traffic correlations involved.

The data were collected by three WIM stations located on highly trafficked highways and motorways, continuously over a whole year. The data were analyzed using statistical software developed by the US National Science Foundation. The trucks of the traffic flow were classified into almost 20 categories, depending on the silhouette, number and spacing of axles, body configuration (trailer/semi-trailer), type of axles (steering, driving or standard axle) and wheel or tire (single, twin, wide). The data were analyzed by category. The location of the centre of gravity of the payload was calculated and the variability of its abscissa along the vehicle was analyzed in each category. The loading patterns and behavior were analyzed and the results reported here for 5-axle articulated trucks and 2-axle rigid truck with 2-axle trailer. Then, the axle load distributions were analyzed by axle rank and truck category, and modeled with multimodal Gaussian probability distribution functions. The modes have been determined using a maximum of likelihood method. These modes are useful to design endurance tests of truck tires. These investigations provide a better knowledge about truck loading, overloads and truck aggressiveness on infrastructure, and may lead to optimization policies. In this case, the results are used directly in the domain of tyre optimization. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

It is processed for several time horizons or time intervals. The basic purpose of transportation planning and management is to match transportation supply with travel demand, which represents 'need'. A thorough understanding of existing travel pattern is necessary for identifying and analyzing existing traffic related problems. Detailed data on current travel pattern and traffic volumes are needed also for developing travel forecasting/prediction models. The prediction of future travel demand is an essential task of the long-range transportation planning process for determining strategies for accommodating future needs. Further sustainable mobility in Slovak cities, their competitiveness, economy as well as living conditions of inhabitants are depend also on the way of transport planning, development of transport infrastructure and services. Generally the calculation of the interzonal transport relations (number of trips) is a challenge. The practical application of the transport forecast theory is not easy. Some steps are hardly implemented to the practice for various reasons. The discrepancy between needed data and available data is one of the common problem. The traffic modelers must often study the method of data gathering which use an institutions possessing of demanded data. The discrepancies are showed on different levels (for examples the borders of urban zone and statistic area units are different in principle). One of the problematic issue is the definition of work trips or business trips. The origin and destination is defined at office address. The mobility survey contains data characterized one household, people not admit usual mentioned trips. The official company address are different as transport department. The ratio of these trips in traffic flow is not negligible. The article is aimed to brief description of the transport forecast process calculation. The main part of the article describes outputs from mobility surveys of some regions of Slovakia and them implementation in transport forecast calculation process. This methodically tool is intended for traffic analysis, planned solutions and arrangements verification of problem situations solutions. The University of Zilina processed several mobility surveys. The sample covers different regions with different gravity areas. The database was detailed evaluated and compared. Two Slovak regions were modeled in the Visum software (PTV Vision). Output data were used for town transport plans. Other mobility surveys were made for analysis of interstate transport relations (Slovak republic - Hungary). (C) 2016 The Authors.

These include the objective to strongly reduce fatalities and serious injuries, budgetary constraint requiring prioritisation of road investment, and the growing need for improved integration of road transport to drive efficiency. The current National Road Safety Strategy 2011-2020 aims for a 30% reduction in fatal and serious injuries, a step on a path towards the Safe System (Vision Zero). This aim is made more challenging by the geographically scattered nature of fatal and serious (severe) crashes on the road network, especially on routes with moderate traffic flows or in regional areas. This problem has led to reducing economic returns from conventional road safety initiatives based on treatment of crash-cluster locations or lengths. This paper shows how the Australian National Risk Assessment Model (ANRAM) addresses this challenge and assists state road agencies to meet the aims of the national strategy. ANRAM is used by the agencies to assess the risk of future severe crashes across their road networks. It is then used to prioritise those sections based on severe crash estimates, less susceptible to random variation (the scatter). The model facilitates creation of strategically-aligned infrastructure investment programs to reduce the severe crash risk and to estimate future crash savings. These are used together with program capital costs to carry out economic analysis and to support funding decisions. The paper outlines how ANRAM uses a crash-predictive approach to first estimate mean severe crashes per road section, by crash type. Then, it shows how ANRAM adjusts the estimate using risk algorithms which build on the International Road Assessment Program (iRAP) protocols. These algorithms use detailed road attribute data and research evidence about crash risk potential associated with road design/infrastructure, traffic speeds, and likelihood of vehicle conflicts. Finally, the model uses historical severe crash data in an Empirical Bayes validation technique to provide additional confidence in the estimates. ANRAM has enabled Australian road agencies to scope and prioritise proactive road safety investment options before severe crashes form a historical data clusters. The paper presents several examples of recent programs which reflect jurisdictional priorities, unique local conditions and available resources. The paper concludes with a discussion on how the approach used in ANRAM could have relevance to effective programming of road safety investment for European road agencies. It also suggests additional benefits beyond road safety, e.g. though providing inputs into road data inventories used in transport modelling. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The major goal of our work is to design a microscopic traffic simulation model for such vehicles, including a robust protocol for exchanging information. The question arises as to whether such communication system may efficiently improve travel quality while reducing the risk of collisions. For the purpose of our research we created and developed a simulation software. Our tool visualizes traffic flow for custom but simplified road maps. The transport infrastructure includes multiple junctions, optionally equipped with traffic lights, and roads with varying number of travel lanes. Each vehicle is assigned a fixed route leading to a randomly chosen destination point. Any decisions made by autonomous cars (regarding acceleration or turning maneuvers) are preceded by communication stages (retrieving necessary data, negotiations). In the paper we present fundamental concepts, assumptions and design of our model and simulation software, we also discuss potential issues relevant to our approach. As for the future work, we plan to implement our model in a large-scale agent-based traffic simulation software, Traffic Simulation Framework, so that further examination will be carried out for realistic road networks taken from the OpenStreetMap project. We also plan to apply machine learning techniques, so that self-driving vehicles, as well as traffic light controllers, will be able to learn how to develop the best strategy and by this way improve traffic safety and efficiency in atypical cases.

The overall objective is the improvement of the socio-economic situation of the Srem region within the Danube-Serbia region, by means of building a sustainable cycle tourism infrastructure as a prediction for the development of the tourism sector. The planned route of the main regional cycling routes through Srem area was identified in the Regional Spatial Plan of AP Vojvodina, as a national bicycle corridor. The total route length of 142 km and through Fruska Gora mountain is 104 km. In addition to this basic route area take into account the other routes that are logical and functional solution for the route Srem. The use of the existing road is mainly for tourism purposes but largely used as a forest road, which affects his rapid deterioration. The area through which the main trail passes is very important but under-utilized tourism potential, given the almost the entire length stretches through the National Park. There are large number of lakes, wine trails, monasteries and other tourist attractions. However, on the primary bicycle route no cycling signs or objects that would provide the necessary services to cyclists exists. Also, there are no maps and other materials that would inform cyclists on the route and to provide the necessary service information and data on tourist facilities. By implementing the results of these Study will significantly increase the attractiveness of the route and will create conditions for the development of the cycle tourism in Serbia. The final project outputs include: 1. Analysis of traffic flow-supply and demand on the relevant route, analysis of traffic safety with a focus on the cyclists, 2. Defined bicycle route Srem and measures to improve the current situation (the existing infrastructure, critical sections, potential locations for rest areas, services, accommodation facilities, measures to improve bicycle safety along the route trails, guiding the route from the border with the Republic of Croatia, Euro Velo 6 connection with the Srem bicycle route). 3. De-tour routes along the main route linked with the important cultural, historical, natural and religious facilities. 4. Project signalization and information boards along the proposed bicycle network (unified guiding principles of the presented maps, situational plans of bicycle signals with defined directions in which to set up in GPS coordinates, Detailed drawings of each of the planned panel, Project for signposts installation, Standard solutions for the placement of signs 5. Design of the bicycle stations and rest areas (Defined the conditions, the optimal number and distribution of rest areas, locating them only in public land, 6. Regional cycling map of the route 7.

The "alternative" components required (in particular batteries) make these utility vehicles rather expensive for fleet operators. The return on investment seems to be still out of reach. Hence, it is necessary to cut down on operational costs. Given these facts, the starting point was to clarify the criteria of logistic services as needed by the customers. First and foremost this concerns the type of vehicle chosen for a given logistic task. Secondly, concern needs to be given to the factors which influence the dynamics of vehicle movements, such as the load factor in terms of the geographical sequence of the points of deliveries. Thirdly, the time windows available for delivery affect variations in the velocity dependent on the respective level of service of the traffic flow. This opens up some additional potential for optimisation aside from vehicle technology. Road network planning and traffic management can boost low-emission freight services by taking into consideration the performance of different powertrain systems. The object was to quantify effects of innovative powertrain technologies on freight transport fleets with respect to reducing energy consumption and CO2 equivalent emissions. We identified representative logistic services as framework conditions of their operations in correlation with vehicle classes (light, medium and heavy). The vehicles use routes from the outskirts to the core of a conurbation and vice versa. The roads used are defined in categories which allow estimates of their capacity to handle variable traffic flows depending on the time of the day. These boundary conditions were used for a comprehensive comparison (based on numerical simulations) of advanced powertrain systems for such commercial vehicles. Particularly, fuel types as well as electricity were taken into account along with some variation in gross vehicle weights and hybrid configurations. The investigations were carried out for 32 different powertrain architectures such as advanced diesel and CNG engines, also as baselines for different hybrid variants and even pure battery-powered commercial vehicles. The results should be of interest for fleet operators, and our interpretations regarding further energy and emission reductions in goods supply processes challenges the entire future system of logistics, traffic management, infrastructure planning and powertrain technologies.

By virtual patrolling, incidents e.g. queues, accidents and car breakdowns on a road network, can be predicted or detected in an early stage. This early detection and prediction of an incident likely to happen, offers the opportunity to act faster and therefore reduce congestion compared to current practice. A module is developed capable of virtual patrolling and based on four key features: data fusion, real-time estimation of the fundamental diagram, fuzzy traffic state estimation and artificial neural networks. In CHARM, the cooperation between the Highways England (UK) and Rijkswaterstaat (NL), the potential of this module has been demonstrated in a simulation environment and in 2015 further developed, deployed and tested in real life. Extended Kalman filtering and traffic flow theory algorithms are used to fuse data from loop detectors with FVD (floating vehicle data) to provide detailed traffic state data (i.e. flow and speed for 10 seconds for every segment of approximately 200 meters). For the prediction of the future traffic state, information on the actual road capacity is necessary. Road capacity varies for weather, lightness, number of heavy vehicles et cetera. A self-adapting module is used to make a real time estimation of the fundamental diagram and road capacity. The traffic state estimation itself is based on fuzzy logic to determine to what extent the traffic state is free flow or congested. If only speed data is available, alternative simplified fuzzy logic rules are applied. The fuzzy traffic state estimations for separate segments is combined into a combined traffic state estimation. This traffic state estimation is used as input for artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict whether it is likely that a queue will form within the short-term future (within 10 minutes) on a relevant segment. This is defined as a segment that suffers from queues on a frequent basis. The results of these estimations will be used for virtual patrolling to distinguish between normal and expected congestion and other situations. Information from the modules can also be used for the detection of prediction of shockwaves. This can be of help to act faster when incidents happen and to prevent or solve shockwaves by giving (in-car) advices on speed and lane choice to car users. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The overloaded information of the traffic signs and improper distance ahead of the signs present serious problems, for they may raise the driver's visual cognition burden, reduce expressway operation efficiency and cause potential safety hazards. This paper aims at developing design criteria of traffic sign information volume and reasonable AGS positions with regard to driving behavior and traffic safety. The relationship among driving behavior, traffic sign information and AGS positions has been studied based upon driving simulation tests in this paper. The information of traffic signs is processed and quantified with the method of information entropy under the framework of information theory. According to traffic flow theory and a mathematical model of vehicle lane change, AGS positions are analyzed and reasonable positions are recommended in relation to the operation conditions on multi-lane expressways. During the simulation tests, drivers aged 20-40 with 2-10 year driving experience were invited for the tests and asked to drive along the designed expressway scenes. The driver's visual behavior was monitored with an eye tracking system and data of driving behavior and the vehicle running tracks were also collected during the simulation tests. The relationship model between traffic sign information volume, AGS position and driving behavior parameters was developed as a result of further data mining, analysis and synthesis. Eventually, a multidimensional indicator of expressway sign information volume threshold has been proposed and reasonable AGS positions on multi-lane expressways are determined. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The configuration of the turbo-roundabout makes that patterns of conflict at entries with one and two conflicting traffic streams can coexist. This paper presents research efforts aimed at measuring quantitatively the effect of heavy vehicles on operational conditions of a turbo-roundabout. The study starts from the initial belief that the greatest constraints to the vehicular trajectories imposed by the turbo-roundabout necessarily imply that the impact of heavy vehicles on the quality of traffic flow is more unfavorable than on other modern roundabouts. Microsimulation revealed as a useful tool when the variation of the traffic quality in turbo-roundabouts should be evaluated in presence of mixed fleets, each having different percentages of heavy vehicles; indeed, it allowed to isolate traffic conditions difficult to observe on field and replicate them to have a number of data as much as possible numerous. Entry capacity values for each entry lane of the turbo-roundabout were obtained by microsimulation, varying the percentage of heavy vehicles for entering flows. Nonlinear regression analysis of simulation data allowed to derive the behavioral parameters for heterogeneous populations of users and, ultimately, composed exclusively of heavy vehicles. The capacity functions thus obtained allowed us to determine how the passenger car equivalent (PCE) varies with the percentage of heavy vehicles and circulating flows for each entry lane of the turbo-roundabout. The results of this study indicate that there is a need to distinguish the impact of heavy vehicles when analyzing the capacity of a turbo-roundabout. When the traffic stream contains a significant number of heavy vehicles, a larger PCE effect would be expected. This effect should be accounted for in the estimation of the turbo-roundabout capacity. Lastly it should be emphasized that an important aspect of the research consists in having identified a methodology for assessing the impact of heavy vehicles on the quality of traffic flow, that can be applied to different patterns of intersection.

Vehicles in our model can obtain more integrated driving information such as headway distance, brake light state and velocity through IVC. By taking a number of preceding vehicles' driving information into consideration, drivers can predict the next time-step velocity more reasonably and effectively compared with the previous models. The proposed model with periodic boundary is simulated to prove the validity. It is shown that vehicles run more smoothly in this new model and traffic congestion problem is resolved effectively.

By taking the information of several front vehicles in both self-lane and objective lane into consideration, drivers can predict the velocity tendency of next time steps on both lanes, thus decide whether to change lanes or not. Simulations with both periodic boundary and open boundary under the new lane changing model and Rickert's lane changing model 1171 are conducted. Compared with previous lane changing models, the lane changing model in this paper can reduce ping pang lane changing frequency effectively. When there is a bottleneck on the one lane, the new lane changing mechanism performs better than the traditional model.

J	Zhang, YR; Zhang, YL				Zhang, Yanru; Zhang, Yunlong			A Comparative Study of Three Multivariate Short-Term Freeway Traffic Flow Forecasting Methods With Missing Data	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						ITS; Missing Data; Multivariate Prediction; Neural Network; Traffic Flow Forecasting	MOVING AVERAGE; KALMAN FILTER; PREDICTION; NETWORK	Short-term traffic flow forecasting is a critical function in advanced traffic management systems (ATMS) and advanced traveler information systems (ATIS). Accurate forecasting results are useful to indicate future traffic conditions and assist traffic managers in seeking solutions to congestion problems on urban freeways and surface streets. There is new research interest in short-term traffic flow forecasting due to recent developments in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) technologies. Previous research involves technologies in multiple areas, and a significant number of forecasting methods exist in the literature. However, most studies used univariate forecasting methods, and they have limited forecasting abilities when part of the data is missing or erroneous. While the historical average (HA) method is often applied to deal with this issue, the forecasting accuracy cannot be guaranteed. This article makes use of the spatial relationship of traffic flow at nearby locations and builds up two multivariate forecasting approaches: the vector autoregression (VAR) and the general regression neural network (GRNN) based forecasting models. Traffic data collected from U.S. Highway 290 in Houston, TX, were used to test the model performance. Comparison of performances of the three models (HA, VAR, and GRNN) in different missing ratios and forecasting time intervals indicates that the accuracy of the VAR model is more sensitive to the missing ratio, while on average the GRNN model gives more robust and accurate forecasting with missing data, particularly when the missing data ratio is high.

However, most spatio-temporal models suffer from high mathematical complexity and low tune-up flexibility. This article presents a novel spatio-temporal random effects (STRE) model that has a reduced computational complexity due to mathematical dimension reduction, with additional tune-up flexibility provided by a basis function capable of taking traffic patterns into account. Bellevue, WA, was selected as the model test site due to its widespread deployment of loop detectors. Data collected during the 2 weeks of July 2007 from 105 detectors in the downtown area were used in the modeling process and traffic volumes predicted for 14 detectors for the entire month of July 2008. The results show that the STRE model not only effectively predicts traffic volume but also outperforms three well-established volume prediction models, the enhanced versions of autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and spatiotemporal ARMA, and artificial neural network. Even without further model tuning, all the experimental links produced mean absolute percentage errors between 8% and 16% except for three atypical locations. Based on lessons learned, recommendations are provided for future applications and tune-up of the proposed STRE model.

J	Wang, C; Ye, ZR				Wang, Chao; Ye, Zhirui			Traffic flow forecasting based on a hybrid model	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Forecasting; heteroscedasticity; hybrid model; time series; traffic flow	NETWORK MODEL; PREDICTION; VOLUME; HETEROSKEDASTICITY; MULTIVARIATE; LINK	Real-time traffic flow forecasting is of great importance in the development of advanced traffic management systems and advanced traveler information systems. Traffic flow is evaluated using time series, and the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model has been commonly used for determining the regression-type relationship between historical and future data. However, the performance of the ARIMA model is limited by the difficulty of capturing nonlinear patterns and the challenges of diagnosing permanent white noises. Hence, a hybrid method of ARIMA-EGARCH-M-GED was developed with the intent to address those limitations. It combines the linear ARIMA model with a nonlinear model of Exponent Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (EGARCH) to capture heteroscedasticity (the variance of random error varying across the data) of traffic flow series. EGARCH in Mean (EGARCH-M), which corrects the expression of conditional variance by connecting the conditional mean directly with the variance, was introduced to better restrain the influence of abnormal data. Moreover, the tail of the generalized error distribution (GED) is better than that of the normal distribution in characterizing the features of time series, especially heteroscedasticity of residual sequences. Data collected from an interstate highway (I-80 in California) with a sampling period of 5 minutes were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The results from the hybrid model were compared with ARIMA, an artificial neural network, and a K-nearest neighbor model. The results showed that the hybrid model outperformed the other methods in terms of accuracy and reliability. Overall, the proposed model performed well in tracking the features of measured data and controlling the impact of abnormal data.

ITSs are developing both in the cities, that will become smart cities, and on freeways, by designing smart roads. Focusing on freeways, tollbooths currently represent serious challenges in many countries. Most commonly used payment toll systems create traffic congestion with the consequent increase of traffic pollution, time delays and negative results in terms of vehicular throughput and freeways' efficiency. ITSs integrated with new arriving Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and novel toll collections designs, such as Open Road Tolling (ORT), could remove, or at least, mitigate these bottlenecks. This paper presents traffic flow models and algorithms implemented in IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio. Modeling and comprehensive investigation, using real data, brings advantages in terms of traffic throughput and optimization. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Nonhomogeneous Time Mixed Integer Linear Programming Formulation for Traffic Signal Control	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; FLOW; NETWORK	Urban traffic congestion is on the increase worldwide; therefore, it is critical to maximize the capacity and throughput of the existing road infrastructure with optimized traffic signal control. For that purpose, this paper builds on the body of work in mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approaches that attempt to optimize traffic signal control jointly over an entire traffic network and specifically on improving the scalability of these methods for large numbers of intersections. The primary insight in this work stems from the fact that MILP-based approaches to traffic control used in a receding horizon control manner (that replan at fixed time intervals) need to compute high-fidelity control policies only for the early stages of the signal plan. Therefore, coarser time steps can be used to see over a long horizon to adapt preemptively to distant platoons and other predicted long-term changes in traffic flows. To that end, this paper contributes the queue transmission model (QTM), which blends elements of cell-based and link-based modeling approaches to enable a nonhomogeneous time MILP formulation of traffic signal control. Experimentation is then carried out with this novel QTM-based MILP control in a range of traffic networks, and it is demonstrated that the nonhomogeneous MILP formulation achieves (a) substantially lower delay solutions, (b) improved per vehicle delay distributions, and (c) more optimal travel times over a longer horizon in comparison with the homogeneous MILP formulation with the same number of binary and continuous variables.

An Intelligent Highway Tollgate Queue Selector for Improving Server Utilization and Vehicle Waiting Time	2016 IEEE REGION 10 SYMPOSIUM (TENSYMP)	IEEE Region 10 Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP)	MAY 09-11, 2016	Sanur, INDONESIA	IEEE Reg 10, IEEE Indonesia Sect		Tollgate system; server utilization; vehicle waiting time; queue selector; fuzzy logic		On a highway setup, a vehicle will most probably use a tollgate server that has the shortest queue thinking that it is the fastest exit. In this paper, an intelligent highway tollgate queue selector using fuzzy logic is proposed and simulated in Matlab SimEvents. Its aim is to automatically select the most appropriate tollgate server for a vehicle to ensure the shortest waiting time while trying to balance the server's utilization. Two policies are considered in this study, namely: (1) Shortest Queue (SQ) and (2) Fuzzy Logic-Controlled Queue (FLCQ). Results indicate that the FLCQ policies reduce the average waiting time and queue length by approximately 50% of those obtained from the SQ policy while guaranteeing an equal utilization among available servers. These findings are valid for light and heavy, homogeneous and nonhomogeneous vehicle arrivals. To further improve the decision making of the fuzzy logic controller, traffic flow information collected by remote road-side units can be exploited to allow the control of various system parameters (e.g., service time) in advance.

The resulting congestion has become a key issue and emerging research topic to transportation specialist and decision makers. In this study, inspired by recent advanced vehicle technologies, we take into account in improving traffic flow in real-time problem. In order to solve the problem, we propose a new approach to manage traffic flow at the intersection in real-time via controlling by traffic light scheduling. In particular, the proposed method is based on process synchronization theory and connected vehicle technology where each vehicle is able to communicate with others. The traffic deadlock is also taken into consideration in case of high traffic volume. The simulation shows the potential results comparing with the existing traffic management system.

J	Wang, DZW; Xie, DF				Wang, David Z. W.; Xie, Dong-Fan			Reliable transportation network design considering uncertain demand variability	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						Network design; travel time reliability; two-stage stochastic programming; uncertain demand variability	STOCHASTIC USER EQUILIBRIUM; SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS; TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT; ROAD NETWORKS; MODEL; RELIABILITY; CAPACITY; FORMULATION; ALGORITHMS; TRAVELERS	Travel demand is indeed stochastic with day-to-day travel demand variability, because of the underlying characteristic of variability of travel activities. The stochastic travel demand can be described by different probability distribution patterns and has to be considered in transport network design, as it affects travelers' routing choice behavior against stochastic travel time and eventually the traffic flow pattern on the network. However, on the other hand, because of the inaccurate or inconsistent travel demand estimation procedures, the prediction of the travel demand distribution pattern and parameters is susceptible to a certain level of uncertainty. Therefore, both the travel demand day-to-day variability and the uncertainty in terms of estimating travel demand distribution pattern and parameters have to be incorporated in the transportation network design. This study develops an approach to model network design problem with uncertain demand variability. Specifically, it is assumed that the total travel demand comprises two parts, commuters and infrequent travelers, and only the demand of infrequent travelers is stochastic. Then, the travel time reliability is introduced to depict the path choice behavior. A finite-scenario two-stage stochastic programming approach is applied to model the network design problem with uncertain demand variability. Numerical studies are performed to illustrate the model validity and efficiency of solution algorithm.	[Wang, David Z.

Driving around turbo-roundabouts vs. conventional roundabouts: Are there advantages regarding pollutant emissions?	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						Discrete models; emissions; multilane roundabouts; speed profiles; turbo-roundabouts	AIR-QUALITY; SAFETY	This article addresses the impact of turbo-roundabouts located in urban areas on pollutant emissions using field measurements of vehicle activity data and road congestion levels. The research also compares the emissions of vehicles moving along a turbo-roundabout and a conventional multilane roundabout. Based on field measurements taken at turbo-roundabouts without curb dividers located in Grado, Spain, and multilane roundabouts in Aveiro, Portugal, three representative speed profiles for each speed trajectory were identified: no stop (I), stop once (II), and multiple stops (III). This study also develops discrete models for turbo-roundabouts and multilane roundabouts in which the relative occurrence of those speed profiles is expressed as a function of the entry and conflicting traffic flows. The vehicle specific power (VSP) methodology is then employed to estimate second-by-second pollutant emissions. This study tests the hypotheses that emissions are impacted by the differences in (1) the characteristics of speed profiles in each movement, (2) the volumes of entry and conflicting flows, (3) the overall saturation level, and (4) the transportation facility considered (turbo-roundabout / multilane roundabout). Considering the selected case studies and traffic demands, vehicles at turbo-roundabouts generated more emissions (15-22%, depending on the pollutant) than multilane conventional roundabouts, especially under medium and high congestion levels. These findings suggest that there are no advantages in implementing turboroundabouts from an environmental point of view, regardless of the traffic congestion levels.	[Fernandes, P.; Pereira, S.

J	Shi, Q; Abdel-Aty, M				Shi, Qi; Abdel-Aty, Mohamed			Evaluation of the Impact of Travel Time Reliability on Urban Expressway Traffic Safety	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							MOUNTAINOUS FREEWAY; CRASH-FREQUENCY; CONGESTION; ELEMENTS; DRIVERS; WEATHER; GENDER; CHOICE; SINGLE; ROADS	In urban areas, toll expressways have been constructed to provide motorists with safe, efficient, and reliable trips. Numerous studies have investigated the relationship between safety and efficiency. However, there has been only a limited focus on how traffic safety and reliability are related. In this study, multiple travel time reliability indicators were developed on the basis of an automatic vehicle identification system installed on the expressway of interest. The effects of travel time reliability on crash frequency were evaluated within the Bayesian hierarchical Poisson lognormal framework. It was confirmed that the reduction of travel time reliability caused by late arrivals would lead to more crashes. Nevertheless, the effects of travel time reliability were more significant on multivehicle crashes than on single-vehicle crashes. In addition, the necessity of using direct reliability measurement in safety analysis was assessed by calibrating models with only traditional traffic flow variables and structural equation models in which the effects of travel time reliability were modeled by latent variables. Comparison results showed that to understand better the effects of travel time reliability on safety, inclusion of direct reliability measurement would be more efficient. In conclusion, this study suggests that improvement of travel time reliability by providing estimated travel times to drivers in real-time might not only be beneficial to better travel experience, but might also improve safety on urban expressways.

S	Majith, NA; Sinha, S			IEEE	Majith, Abdul N.; Sinha, Sitabhra			Dynamics of Urban Traffic Congestion: A kinetic Monte Carlo approach to simulating collective vehicular dynamics	2016 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS (COMSNETS)	International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks		English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Communication Systems and Networks (COMSNETS)	JAN 05-10, 2016	Bangalore, INDIA					Transitions observed in the dynamical patterns of vehicular traffic, for instance, as a result of changes in traffic density, form an important class of phenomena that is sought to be explained by large-scale modeling using many interacting agents. While the dynamics of highway traffic has been the subject of intense investigation over the last few decades, there is as yet comparatively little understanding of the patterns of urban traffic. The macroscopic collective behavior of cars in the network of roads inside a city is marked by relatively high vehicular densities and the presence of signals that coordinate movement of cross-flowing traffic traveling along several directions. In this article, we have presented a novel kinetic Monte Carlo simulation approach for studying the dynamics of urban traffic congestion. This allows us to study continuous-time, continuous-space models of traffic flow in the presence of stochastic fluctuations, which contrast with the dominant paradigm of cellular automata models. We first reproduce well-known results of such discrete models for traffic flow in the absence of any intersections, and then, show the corresponding behavior in the presence of an intersection where cross-flowing traffic is regulated by a signal. The fundamental diagram of traffic flow in the presence of a signal shows a broad plateau indicating that the flow is almost independent of small variations in vehicle density for an intermediate range of densities. This is unlike the case where there are no intersections, where a sharp transition is observed between free flow behavior and jamming on changing vehicle density. The distribution of congestion times shows a power-law scaling regime over an extended range for the stochastic case when exponential-like right skewed probability distributions are used. These results reproduce in a simple setting the empirically observed power-law behavior in congestion time distributions for Indian urban traffic that is validated here with a much larger data-set.

At the first level, a complex traffic network is first partitioned into several subnetworks. The traffic dynamics in each subnetwork is modeled by utilizing the concept of Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD), which relates the network-wide space-mean flow and the number of vehicles at the aggregated level, This model aims at designing a demand balance model predictive controller (MPC), which can improve the internal flow inside the subnetwork by regulating the input flows from outside. At the second level, based on a more detailed traffic flow model, the signal timings of all intersections for each subnetwork are determined by a flow coordination MPC controller, which aims at distributing the number of vehicles in each subnetwork as homogeneously as possible. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is investigated via simulation under different scenarios on a hypothetical urban traffic network, and the performance is compared with other control strategies.

This paper reports on the use of a gradient based algorithm using automatic dilferentiation. The AHOL-C library is coupled with the METANET source code and this system is embedded within an optimisation algorithm based on RPROP. The result is a very efficient system which is able to be calibrate METANET's second order model by determining the density and speed equation parameters as well as the fundamental diagrams used. Information obtained from the system's Jacobian provides extra insight into the system dynamics.

The development relies on the following realistic assumptions: (i) The density and flow of connected vehicles are known at the (local or central) traffic monitoring and control unit on the basis of their regularly reported positions; and (ii) the average speed of conventional vehicles is roughly equal to the average speed of connected vehicles. Thus, complete traffic state estimation (for arbitrarily selected segments in the network) may be achieved by merely estimating the percentage of connected vehicles with respect to the total number of vehicles. A model is derived, which describes the dynamics of the percentage of connected vehicles, utilizing only well-known conservation law equations that describe the dynamics of the density of connected vehicles and of the total density of all vehicles. Based on this model, which is a linear parameter-varying system, an estimation algorithm for the percentage of connected vehicles is developed employing a Kalman filter. The estimation methodology is validated through simulations, using a second-order macroscopic traffic flow model as ground truth for the traffic state, as well as using real microscopic traffic data collected within the Next Generation SIMulation (NGSHM) program.

A generic integrated motorway traffic flow control concept is proposed in this paper. It is based on the combination and suitable extension of control algorithms and tools proposed or deployed in other studies, such as ramp metering or VSL (Variable Speed Limit)-enabled cascade-feedback mainstream traffic flow control, and allows for consideration of multiple bottlenecks. The new controller enables coordination of ramp metering actions at a series of on ramps, as well as integration with VSL control actions, towards a common control goal, which is bottleneck throughput maximisation. The approach enables a pre-specified (desired) balancing of the incurred delays upstream of the employed actuators, via a suitably designed knapsack algorithm. Despite the multitude of the offered configurations, options and possibilities, the overall control algorithm remains simple, efficient and suitable for field implementation. The control algorithm is evaluated and demonstrated using a validated macroscopic traffic flow model for a number of scenarios.

We consider continuous-time cell-based Dynamic Network Loading models that include the Cell Transmission Model with FIFO rule at the diverge junctions as well as non-FIFO diverge rules. We consider SO-DTA formulations ill which the total inflow into and the total outflow from the cells are independently constrained by concave supply and demand functions, respectively, thus prey, convexity. Vie design open-loop controllers that guarantee that the optimal solutions are feasible with respect to realistic traffic dynamics, and we develop this methodology for two variants of the SO-DTA problem, one of which accounts for exogenous turning ratios. Robustness of the system trajectory under the proposed controllers is evaluated by deriving bounds on the deviations induced by perturbations of the initial condition and of the external inflows.

In this paper, we propose a sector-based distributed air traffic flow scheduling strategy to minimize the airport arrival delay. The scheduling problem is formulated based on a simplified air traffic system model consisting of sectors, air-routes, waypoints and airports. A cell transmission flow dynamic model is adopted to describe the system dynamics and some safety-based constranits such as the sequence of en-routed aircraft and tyre limitations of cruising speeds are considered in the system model. To overcome the computational complexity involved in the centralized structure, we propose a sector-based distributed approach based on Lagrangian relaxation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling strategies. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The problem is motivated from the observation that in some cases extending a green traffic signal to have a heavy truck cross an intersection instead of :forcing it to stop and restart again may have benefits for all vehicles involved. The proposed traffic light control system uses a co-simulation optimization control approach to generate the traffic light sequence in a network of signalized intersections. The system has been evaluated using a road network simulator adjacent to the twin ports of Long Beach/Los Angeles. The evaluation results show consistent improvements in reducing the overall traffic delays, number of vehicle stops, fuel consumption and vehicle emissions.

However, researchers seldom have studied the integration of ACC and roadside control methods such as the variable speed limit (VSL) to improve safety. The primary objective of this study was to develop an infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) integrated system that incorporated both ACC and VSL to reduce rear-end collision risks on freeways.Methods: The intelligent driver model was firstly modified to simulate ACC behavior and then the VSL strategy used in this article was introduced. Next, the I2V system was proposed to integrate the 2 advanced techniques, ACC and VSL. Four scenarios of no control, VSL only, ACC only, and the I2V system were tested in simulation experiments. Time exposed time to collision (TET) and time integrated time to collision (TIT), 2 surrogate safety measures derived from time to collision (TTC), were used to evaluate safety issues associated with rear-end collisions. The total travel times of each scenario were also compared.Results: The simulation results indicated that both the VSL-only and ACC-only methods had a positive impact on reducing the TET and TIT values (reduced by 53.0 and 58.6% and 59.0 and 65.3%, respectively). The I2V system combined the advantages of both ACC and VSL to achieve the most safety benefits (reduced by 71.5 and 77.3%, respectively). Sensitivity analysis of the TTC threshold also showed that the I2V system obtained the largest safety benefits with all of the TTC threshold values. The impact of different market penetration rates of ACC vehicles in I2V system indicated that safety benefits increase with an increase in ACC proportions.Conclusions: Compared to VSL-only and ACC-only scenarios, this integrated I2V system is more effective in reducing rear-end collision risks. The findings of this study provide useful information for traffic agencies to implement novel techniques to improve safety on freeways.

J	Schafer, S; Nilsson, I				Schafer, Sarah; Nilsson, Isabelle			Effects of Public and Private Investments in Intelligent Transportation Systems on Freight Movement Outcomes	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							SUPPLY CHAIN; TECHNOLOGIES; MANAGEMENT; LOGISTICS	This paper examines the relationship between public and private investments in intelligent transportation system (ITS) technology and the effects on transportation performance through the highway system. ITS technology is an infrastructure that promotes integrated information sharing that can be used to improve system performance. ITS combines better infrastructure with information and control technologies to (a) reduce traffic congestion by maintaining traffic flow, (b) reduce transportation generated pollution, (c) improve transport efficiency, and (d) produce economic benefits. A statistical analysis of partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to test three hypothesized relationships. Primary data were collected from U.S.-based commercial vehicle transportation service providers. Respondents were parceled with a geographic information system analysis of secondary data from the U.S. Department of Transportation National ITS Deployment Tracking Survey. On the basis of their level of regional ITS experience, primary data respondents were matched to regions and split between regions with low ITS experience and high ITS experience as a proxy for regional public investments in ITS. Performance measures were based on efficiency, reliability, responsiveness; quality, carbon emissions reduction, and equipment utilization for commercial vehicle operators. Results indicate that private investments in ITS significantly positively affect the responsiveness performance measure for commercial vehicle operators in regions with high public ITS investments. The same relationship is not significant in regions with low public ITS investments, which indicates at least some transportation performance improvements for regions with higher investments in ITS. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

The main input is the Freight Analysis Framework version 3, best public data for truck movements in the United States. The method considers multicommodity flows in an equilibrium framework, associates monetary values to changes in traffic conditions that are specific to each user type, and links truck flows with commodity flows. This approach can consider transportation analysis zones smaller than those presented in the Freight Analysis Framework. A real-world numerical example is presented to estimate the DTEI due to severe floods that occurred in 2008 and disrupted key segments of the highway network in the northwestern Indiana region.

Running profiles can be gained from the applied large-size network model based on previous validations, which are sufficiently complex, complicated and built up by accelerations, decelerations and frequent stops. To develop accelerated methods for analyzing complex environmental impact on urban trajectories Our planned researches on emission encourage the further standardization and beyond that, the bilateral interoperability. According to our goals we point out on the differences, which have to be taken into account in the urban traffic also, and of which the lab measurements may vary. Real processes operate like this, which differ from those applied in laboratories and on roller brake test bench. In reality, however, vehicle emission strongly depends on driving style; moreover, it is also affected by any change in traffic flow. Significant differences can be realized in various regions and countries. The role of the optimal vehicle control is highlighted in every case. The same can be stated of the environmental loads of pollutant emissions and concerning the vehicle and environment dynamic. The detailed analysis introduced above has big impact on further automotive researches as being rapid and applicable for big number of vehicles providing statistical support.

J	Cao, JX; Liu, XH				Cao, Jin Xin; Liu, Xiao Han			RESEARCH ON THE EQUILIBRIUM SPEED-DENSITY RELATIONSHIP AROUND FLYOVER WORK ZONE	PROMET-TRAFFIC & TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						flyover; traffic flow characteristic; logistic model; work zone		Increasing traffic demand has already reached the capacity of existing traffic facilities in most cities. In order to alleviate the traffic pressure and expand the capacity of the road network, constructing flyovers has become an effective way in most cities in China. During the period of the flyover construction, work zones occupy road space, impact traffic flow characteristics and driver behaviour; therefore, this causes a significant reduction of the capacity. Researching of the traffic flow characteristics during the period of flyover construction can improve traffic organization and traffic safety around work zones. This study analyses the traffic flow characteristics around the flyover work zone based on the site data collected in Hohhot City, China. This study shows that the traditional Logistic model for the equilibrium speed-density relationship is not applied to the traffic flow around the flyover work zone. Based on an in-depth analysis of the traffic flow characteristics and specific driver behaviours, this paper proposes an improved Logistic model to depict the equilibrium speed-density relationship around the flyover work zone. To analyse the mathematical characteristics of the speed-density relationship, this paper proposes a method to insert virtual data points into the initial data, which can make the fit curve be continuous.

In this paper, we attempt to study this problem using a simulation approach. Largely inspired by an interesting observation from ant chain movement, we explore how such a vivid pattern can be mathematically modeled and whether the similar way of behavior is helpful for dealing traffic wave issue in our highway systems. Therefore, a decentralized fast adaptive clustering approach is proposed jointly with considerations for traffic optimization. To validate the proposed approach and to better understand its mechanism in lifting traffic flow, simulation study is carried out using real-world traffic data. Results have revealed the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach and have also indicated that both road configuration and traffic demand affect the effectiveness of the proposed model.

ESTIMATION OF CO2 EMISSIONS CONSIDERING THE DECISIONS OF MULTIPLE DRIVERS WITHIN CAR-FOLLOWING MODELS	INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2015, VOL 4			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference	AUG 02-05, 2015	Boston, MA	ASME, Design Engn Div, ASME, Comp & Informat Engn Div		Car following models; Decision Making; Tail-gating; Non-linear Driver Model	PERSONALITY; RISK	Decisions made by the drivers on the road have a significant impact on the traffic, as well as on their vehicular emissions. Simple decisions such as accelerating at a yellow traffic signal can alter the dynamics of traffic flow and engine operating points. Especially in cities, these decisions, cumulatively, can impact large complex systems like transportation network. For example, these can lead to unstable conditions such as traffic congestion or high concentration of emissions. In order to reduce these impacts, it is necessary to understand the drivers' decisions, their influence on other vehicles, and the resulting impacts on emissions. This need drives the main objective of this paper, which is, to understand the relationships between the drivers decisions and vehicular CO2 emissions. In this paper, we model the drivers' decisions by introducing a utility function for each driver in a micro-transportation model. Our hypothesis is that drivers have their own safe distance not only over front headway but also on rear headway. This usually happens when the driver chooses to change from acceleration to deceleration phases. We also propose a non-linear driver model to quantify the risk attitude of a driver based on factors such as age, experience, time of journey and the number of occupants. The Full Velocity Difference Method (FVDM) represents the traffic characteristics including speed, position, and vehicle acceleration at a traffic signal better than other car-following models. Hence, FVDM is used in our simulations. Numerical simulations show that a risk prone person results in a greater fuel consumption compared to the risk averse person. Simulation results also show that decisions made by a lead vehicle can be influenced by the follower vehicles properties such as speed and position and vice versa. The results show how driver decisions can alter the vehicular CO2 emissions. The proposed model is a step towards developing a decision support tool, which can help drivers in reducing CO2 emissions.

As the demand for air transport has grown, so have congestion, flight delays, and the resultant environmental impacts. With further growth in demand expected, we need new control techniques, and perhaps even redesign of some parts of the system, in order to prevent cascading delays and excessive pollution. In this survey, we consider examples of how we can develop control and optimization algorithms for air transportation systems that are grounded in real-world data, implement them, and test them in both simulations and in field trials. These algorithms help us address several challenges, including resource allocation with multiple stakeholders, robustness in the presence of operational uncertainties, and developing decision-support tools that account for human operators and their behavior.

Direct demand models are useful, comparatively simple tools for the estimation of volumes from nonmotorized traffic counts and do not require detailed information from travel behavior inventories. However, few demand models for bicycling and walking have been validated. This paper extends the practice of nonmotorized traffic monitoring and modeling in three ways. First, procedures recommended in the FHWA Traffic Monitoring Guide are followed to present estimates of annual average daily traffic (AADT) for each segment of the urban trail networks in two major U.S. cities: Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Columbus, Ohio. Second, independent variables constructed from nationally available data sets and the local characteristics of each trail system are used to estimate and validate direct demand models for AADT. Third, to assess the potential for the general application of the models, the results of cross -city validations are presented. Our results confirm that FHWA monitoring procedures can be used to characterize the variation in traffic flows on urban trail networks. Direct demand models for each city have reasonably good fits, but the predicted traffic volumes for more than one-third of the segments exceed the actual volumes by more than 60 %. Cross validation results indicate that these models cannot yet be applied as predictive tools across cities. More experimentation is needed to assess the feasibility of developing generalized direct demand models for trails and other nonmotorized transportation networks.

The shape, size and configuration of urban areas, the transport supply to meet people and goods mobility needs, as well as human behavior have huge influence on the road traffic volume and pattern and, hence, on the associated road crash risk. In this context, the paper reveals the effects of locating large shopping centers in the central areas of the city on the already over-congested road network. We use specific spatial analysis models in order to estimate vehicle and customers flows, attracted by one of the largest shopping malls in Bucharest. This approach gives theoretical and practical added value to the study: providing analysis tools to local decision makers for the ex-ante assessment of the consequences of locating large malls, in terms of traffic flow and associated crash risk.

However, the conventional traffic flow detection approaches are high cost or complex installation. In this paper, a reliably vision-based traffic flow detection approach is proposed. In this approach, Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is employed to model the dynamic background of traffic scene. Then, the binary foreground contours are extracted by image subtraction. Comparing the binary vehicle contours' location and the current frame, the real and complete vehicles are obtained for detecting and monitoring. In the part of vehicle counting, to gather the vehicle flow parameter in each lane of the road and avoid the trouble of counting vehicles repeatedly, a discriminative method is presented to classify vehicles into different lanes. Experiment shows that a desired result can be achieved in the traffic flow detection system by the vision-based approach.

However, the current researching suffers from two problems: (P1) it is difficult to distinguish an authorized attacker from other participators; (P2) the large scale of the system and high mobility set up an obstacle in key distribution with a security-based approach. In this paper, we develop a data-centric trust mechanism based on traffic flow theory expanding the notion of trust from intrusion-rejecting to intrusion-tolerant. First, we use catastrophe theory to describe traffic flow according to noncontinuous, catastrophic characteristics. Next, we propose an intrusion-tolerant security algorithm to protect traffic flow data collection in VANETs from malicious data injection attacks, that is, IA(2)P, without any security codes or authentication. Finally, we simulate two kinds of malicious data injection attack scenarios and evaluate IA(2)P based on real traffic flow data from Zhongshan Road in Dalian, China, over 24 hours.

Traffic flow model at fixed control signals with discrete service time distribution	CROATIAN OPERATIONAL RESEARCH REVIEW			English	Article						vehicle queue size; fixed cycle; road traffic intersection	QUEUES; INTERSECTIONS; LIGHT	Most of the models of road traffic flow at fixed-cycle controlled intersection assume stationary distributions and provide steady state results. The assumption that a constant number of vehicles can leave the system during the green phase is unrealistic in real life situations. A discrete time queuing model was developed to describe the operation of traffic flow at a road intersection with fixed-cycle signalized control and to account for the randomness in the number of vehicles that can leave the system. The results show the expected queue size in the system when the traffic is light and for a busy period, respectively. For the light period, when the traffic intensity is less than one, it takes a shorter green cycle time for vehicles to clear up than during high traffic intensity (the road junction is saturated). Increasing the number of cars that can leave the junction at the turn of the green phase reduces the number of cycle times before the queue is cleared.

Link connectivity under more realistic channel model for vehicle-to-vehicle communications	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AD HOC AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING			English	Article						V2V; vehicle-to-vehicle; connectivity performance; realistic channel model; moving obstacles		Since the antennas are very low in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) scenarios, the communication link is easily blocked by other vehicles. The shadowing effect caused by other vehicles has been ignored in most of the existing V2V channel models, and it is thus neglected in the system performance evaluation. By incorporating channel state transition with a measurement-based dual-slope path loss model, an obstacle-based model is presented in this paper for the V2V highway scenarios to capture the dynamic characteristics of radio channels, in the presence of other vehicles as moving obstacles. The joint effects of the radio environment and traffic flow on link connectivity are mainly investigated. The obstruction probability is represented, and the connectivity-related metrics are evaluated: inter vehicle connectivity probability and link duration. All the analytical results are validated by extensive simulations under the measurement-based path loss model, and are also compared to the existing models.

This paper focuses on the traffic engineering concerns on the driving behavior of left-turning vehicles caused by different degrees of pedestrian violations. The traffic characteristics of left-turning vehicles and pedestrians in the affected region at a signalized intersection were analyzed and a cellular-automata-based "following-conflict" driving behavior model that mainly addresses four basic behavior modes was proposed to study the conflict and behavior mechanisms of left-turning vehicles by mathematic methodologies. Four basic driving behavior modes were reproduced in computer simulations, and a logit model of the behavior mode choice was also developed to analyze the relative share of each behavior mode. Finally, the microscopic characteristics of driving behaviors and the macroscopic parameters of traffic flow in the affected region were all determined. These data are important reference for geometry and capacity design for signalized intersections. The simulation results show that the proposed models are valid and can be used to represent the behavior of left-turning vehicles in the case of conflicts with illegally crossing pedestrians. These results will have potential applications on improving traffic safety and traffic capacity at signalized intersections with mixed traffic conditions.

As such, the use of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) has become more and more popular. The implementation and improvement of real-time traffic information systems are an important parts of ITS. Compared with other traditional methods, traffic information estimations from cellular network data are now readily available, more cost-effective, and easier to deploy and maintain. This study assumed that nonvehicle calls could be filtered out and vehicles could be tracked on road segments. A novel ITS model was proposed to indicate the relationship between call arrival rate and traffic density. Moreover, the vehicle speed and traffic flow were estimated by using cellular floating vehicle data (CFVD) and the proposed novel ITS model. In experiments, this study used a VISSIM traffic simulator and adopted the average call inter-arrival time and call holding time to simulate communication behavior on road segments. The estimated traffic information was compared with the simulated traffic information from stationary vehicle detectors (VD). The results indicated that the average accuracies for vehicle speed estimation, traffic flow estimation, and traffic density estimation in the congested flow case were 97.63, 89.72, and 90.45 %, respectively.

It assumed that all vehicles on the road are floating vehicles in the current information feedback strategies research. In reality, not all vehicles can be equipped with vehicular terminals, which are non-floating vehicles. We proposed a new strategy, Estimated Weighted Mean Velocity Feedback Strategy (EWMVFS), which can estimate the road status in the scenario with the coexistence of floating and non-floating vehicles. Simulation results show that EWMVFS can decrease the negative influence of the non-floating vehicles, which means better stability, guidance performance and practicability.

J	Shao, MH; Sun, LJ; Shao, XZ				Shao, Minhua; Sun, Lijun; Shao, Xianzhi			Sensor Location Problem for Network Traffic Flow Derivation Based on Turning Ratios at Intersection	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							MODELS	The sensor location problem (SLP) discussed in this paper is to find the minimum number and optimum locations of the flow counting points in the road network so that the traffic flows over the whole network can be inferred uniquely. Flow conservation system at intersections is formulated firstly using the turning ratios as the prior information. Then the coefficient matrix of the flow conservation system is proved to be nonsingular. Based on that, the minimal number of counting points is determined to be the total number of exclusive incoming roads and dummy roads, which are added to the network to represent the trips generated on real roads. So the task of SLP model based on turning ratios is just to determine the optimal sensor locations. The following analysis in this paper shows that placing sensors on all the exclusive incoming roads and dummy roads can always generate a unique network flow vector for any network topology. After that, a detection set composed of only real roads is proven to exist from the view of feasibility in reality. Finally, considering the roads importance and cost of the sensors, a weighted SLP model is formulated to find the optimal detection set. The greedy algorithm is proven to be able to provide the optimal solution for the proposed weighted SLP model.

Impact factors of bridges in service under stochastic traffic flow and road surface progressive deterioration	ADVANCES IN STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						bridge; dynamic response; impact factor; road surface roughness; stochastic traffic flow	GIRDER BRIDGES; VEHICLE; MODEL; ROUGHNESS; LOADS	In this study, a three-dimensional vehicle-bridge coupled model is used to analyze the impact factors of bridges in service by considering the effect of the stochastic traffic flow and road surface progressive deterioration. A three-dimensional vehicle model with 18 degrees of freedom was adopted. An improved cellular automaton model considering the influence of the next-nearest neighbor vehicle and a progressive deterioration model for road roughness were introduced. Based on the equivalent dynamic wheel loading approach, the coupled equations of motion of the bridge and traffic flow are established by combining the equations of both the bridge and vehicles using the displacement relationship and interaction force relationship at the patch contact. The numerical simulations show that the proposed method can rationally simulate the impact factor of the bridge under the effect of stochastic traffic flow. Based on the existing highway bridge design code, expressions of impact factor for evaluating the dynamic responses of in-service bridges are proposed.	[Yin Xinfeng; Liu Yang; Cai, C.

Reduction in Probability of Traffic Congestion on High-Class Road Using Ramp Access Control	SCIENCE & TECHNIQUE			Russian	Article						O-D-trip matrices; recurrent traffic congestions; intelligent transportation systems; network access management; highway capacity; main road ramps; traffic demand		Merging traffic junctions on high-class roads are considered as bottlenecks in the network and quality of their operation determines a probability for formation of traffic congestions. Investigations on congestion situations in the merging zones of ramp and freeway traffic flows have demonstrated that queuing ramp traffic flow leads to formation of so called "turbulence" effect due to re-arrangement of transport facilities and reduction in their speed on main road direction. Having high queuing traffic flow on main road the "turbulence" component can result in formation of an impact blow in the main traffic flow. It has been proved that an impact of the ramp traffic flow on congestion probability is higher in comparison with main road traffic flow. The paper makes it possible to establish that some transport facilities moving along a high-way simultaneously occupy two lanes in the merging traffic zones and they reduce capacity of the used road section. It is necessary to take into account this specific feature and it is necessary to pay attention to it in the zones of "turbulence" effect formation. The paper presents main approaches, methodology, principles and stages required for access control of high-class roads which are directed on higher quality of their operation including improvement of road traffic safety. The paper proposes a methodology that allows to evaluate and optimize ramp control in the context of a transport queue length minimization at adjoining ramps for the purposes of probability reduction in transport congestion.

The least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) has been shown to provide a strong potential in forecasting problems, particularly by using appropriate heuristic algorithms to determine the value of its two parameters. However, the disadvantage of these meta-heuristics is that it is difficult to understand and slowly achieve the global optimal solution. As a new heuristic algorithm, the fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) has the advantages of easy to understand and quickly converge to the global optimal solution. Therefore, in order to improve the prediction performance of the model, this paper presents a traffic flow prediction model based on least squares support vector machine and automatically determines the least squares support vector machine model with two parameters in the appropriate value by FOA.

As an important part of the traffic demand forecast, traffic assignment model needs to be updated to fit the new characters of electric vehicles. Add distance constraint to original users equilibrium model and set different proportion for electric vehicles and gasoline vehicles, the new users equilibrium model that based on the distance constraint of the electric vehicles can be found. Make traffic assignment in the simulate road network and compare the results to those in the original users equilibrium model. The final results show that both the distance constraint and the proportion of electric vehicles in the whole network strongly influence the distribution of traffic flow. (C) 2016 The Authors.

In most situations, vehicles on these rural roads are of free traffic flow, and the driving stability of a vehicle is therefore mostly influenced by alignments and road surface. Single-vehicle run-off-road crashes are often associated with poor road conditions. Therefore, the improvement of alignment design of the roads can be effective to reduce the number of traffic accidents. This research targets at the analysis of driving in several sections of a four-class rural road in Yunan province, China, with varying alignments and complex shapes. In this context, a road creation module, a vehicle dynamics model, and driver module are established in computing environment, and integrated into a "roadway-driver-vehicle" virtual driving system. Driving simulations of a passenger car model on the test segments are conducted. Speed, driver workload, and ride comfort are analyzed in relation to varying geometric alignments. The simulation results show that: by balancing the design parameters of adjacent curve radii and the tangent length in-between, critical safety driving speed on lower standard rural roads can be obtained; the use of hairpin curves and the absence of spirals would lead to a rapid increase in both angular speed of steering wheel and lateral acceleration change rate, resulting in increasing driver nervousness and passenger discomfort.

Therefore, model and algorithm for the dynamic traffic assignment problem under emergent incidents have been highly concerned by government and scholars. This paper proposes a stochastic dynamic traffic assignment (SDTA) model based user optimum considering the loss of node capacity and change of network structure under traffic and environment emergencies. The Nested Logit model is used to describe the departure time and path choice. Then, the variational inequality formulation is proposed and discrete dynamic network loading algorithm is designed and validated by a numerical example. The results show that the model and algorithm can be used to express the development trend of actual dynamic network under emergency. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

According to the traffic characteristics of the expressway off-ramp, the parameters of traffic model are determined. Furthermore, this paper uses dichotomy and control variables to obtain the thresholds as vehicles start queuing in off-ramp, and draws comprehensive zoning map based on the traffic flow on the side roads and the main road. By selecting delay of main and side road as accessing indices, traffic control mode of the Shoushan entrance and exit of South Second Ring Expressway in Fuzhou was investigated. On account of the different stages of the comprehensive zoning map, the following simulation experiments are conducted: (1) the main roads' vehicles have priority, (2)simulation of induction control of off-ramp, (3)present situation simulation.

It plays an important role in alleviating road traffic congestion and improving traffic management quality. According to the problem that long-term traffic forecasting is short of systematic and effective methods, a long-term traffic situation forecasting model is proposed in this article based on functional nonparametric regression. In the functional nonparametric regression framework, autocorrelation analysis (ACF) is introduced to analyze the autocorrelation coefficient of traffic flow for selecting the state vector, and the functional principal component analysis is also used as distance function for computing proximities between different traffic flow time series. The experiments based on the traffic flow data in Beijing expressway prove that the functional nonparametric regression model outperforms forecast methods in accuracy and effectiveness.

A multiclass cell transmission model for shared human and autonomous vehicle roads	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Autonomous vehicles; Dynamic traffic assignment; Cell transmission model; Multiclass; Shared road	TRAFFIC-FLOW; KINEMATIC WAVES; CONSISTENT; IMPACT; ORDER	Autonomous vehicles have the potential to improve link and intersection traffic behavior. Computer reaction times may admit reduced following headways and increase capacity and backwards wave speed. The degree of these improvements will depend on the proportion of autonomous vehicles in the network. To model arbitrary shared road scenarios, we develop a multiclass cell transmission model that admits variations in capacity and backwards wave speed in response to class proportions within each cell. The multiclass cell transmission model is shown to be consistent with the hydrodynamic theory. This paper then develops a car following model incorporating driver reaction time to predict capacity and backwards wave speed for multiclass scenarios. For intersection modeling, we adapt the legacy early method for intelligent traffic management (Bento et al., 2013) to general simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment models. Empirical results on a city network show that intersection controls are a major bottleneck in the model, and that the legacy early method improves over traffic signals when the autonomous vehicle proportion is sufficiently high.

J	Roncoli, C; Papamichail, I; Papageorgiou, M				Roncoli, Claudio; Papamichail, Ioannis; Papageorgiou, Markos			Hierarchical model predictive control for multi-lane motorways in presence of Vehicle Automation and Communication Systems	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Motorway traffic control; Vehicle automation and communication systems; Model predictive control	VARIABLE-SPEED LIMITS; CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW; LANE ASSIGNMENT; OPTIMAL COORDINATION; OPTIMIZATION; WAVES	A widespread deployment of vehicle automation and communication systems (VACS) is expected in the next years. This may lead to improvements in traffic management efficiency because of the novel possibilities of using VACS both as sensors and as actuators, as well as of a variety of new communications channels (vehicle-to-vehicles, vehicle-to infrastructure) and related opportunities. To achieve this traffic flow efficiency, appropriate studies, developing potential control strategies to exploit the VACS availability, are essential. This paper describes a hierarchical model predictive control framework that can be used for the coordinated and integrated control of a motorway system, considering that an amount of vehicles are equipped with specific VACS. The concept employs and exploits the synergistic (integrated) action of a number of old and new control measures, including ramp metering, vehicle speed control, and lane changing control at a macroscopic level. The effectiveness and the computational feasibility of the proposed approach are demonstrated via microscopic simulation for a variety of penetration rates of equipped vehicles.

ALINEA uses real-time occupancy measurements from the ramp flow merging area that may be at most a few hundred meters downstream of the metered on-ramp nose. In many practical cases, however, bottlenecks with smaller capacities than the merging area may exist further downstream, which suggests using measurements from those downstream bottlenecks. Recent theoretical and simulation studies indicate that ALINEA may lead to poorly damped closed-loop behavior in this case, but PI-ALINEA, a suitable Proportional-Integral (PI) extension of ALINEA, can lead to satisfactory control performance. This paper addresses the same local ramp-metering problem in the presence of far-downstream bottlenecks, with a particular focus on the employment of PI-ALINEA to tackle three distinct cases of bottleneck that may often be encountered in practice: (1) an uphill case; (2) a lane-drop case; and (3) an un-controlled downstream on-ramp case. Extensive simulation studies are conducted on the basis of a macroscopic traffic flow model to show that ALINEA is not capable of carrying out ramp metering in these bottleneck cases, while PI-ALINEA operates satisfactorily in all cases. A field application example of PI-ALINEA is also reported with regard to a real case of far downstream bottlenecks. With its control parameters appropriately tuned beforehand, PI-ALINEA is found to be universally applicable, with little fine-tuning required for field applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Capacity drops at merges: New analytical investigations	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Active bottleneck; Capacity drop; Freeway merge; Kinematic wave; Heterogeneous vehicles	FREEWAY BOTTLENECKS; MOVING BOTTLENECKS; KINEMATIC WAVES; TRAFFIC FLOW; MODEL; RAMP; HIGHWAY	This paper focuses on the derivation of analytical formulae to estimate the effective capacity at freeway merges. It extends previous works by proposing a generic framework able to account for (i) heterogeneous vehicle characteristics and (ii) refined description of the physical interactions between upstream waves and downstream voids created by inserting vehicles within the merge area. The provided analytical formulae permit to directly compute the capacity values when the merge is self-active, i.e. when both upstream roads are congested while downstream traffic conditions are free-flow. They show that accounting for vehicle heterogeneity is not necessary when only the mean capacity is targeted. Calculations with the proper mean value for all parameters provide almost the same results as calculations that consider the full distributions for all parameters. This means that calibrating all distributions is not necessary only the mean parameter values are important. Finally, this paper also shows that vehicle heterogeneity plays a major role in the flow dynamics just upstream of the merge. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A new approach to quantifying vehicle induced turbulence for complex traffic scenarios	CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th Global Chinese Symposium of Chemical Engineering	JUL 16-19, 2014	Pokfulam, PEOPLES R CHINA			Computational fluid dynamics; Turbulent kinetic energy; Vehicle-induced turbulence; Road-induced turbulence; Mixed traffic		Traffic-related pollutants adversely affect air quality, especially in regions near major roadways. The vehicle-induced turbulence (VIT) is a significant factor that controls the initial dilution, dispersion, and ultimately the chemical and physical fate of pollutants by altering the conditions in the microenvironment. This study used a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software FLUENT to model the vehicle-induced turbulence (VIT) generated on roadways, with a focus on impact of vehicle-vehicle interactions, traffic density and vehicle composition on turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). We show, for the first time, that the overall TKE from multiple vehicles traveling in series can be estimated by superimposing the TKE of each vehicle, without considering the distance between them while the distance is greater than one vehicle length. This finding is particularly significant since it enables a new approach to VIT simulations where the overall TKE is calculated as a function of number of vehicles. We found that the interactions between vehicles traveling next to each other in adjacent lanes are insignificant, regardless the directions of the traffic flow. Consequently, simulations of different traffic scenarios can be substantially simplified by treating two-way traffic as one-way traffic, with less than 5% difference in the overall volume-averaged TKE. We also developed equations that allow the estimation of the overall volume-averaged TKE as a function of the number and the type of vehicles.

Pedestrian movement is investigated by using ant algorithms. Ants communicate with each other by dropping a chemical, called a pheromone, on the substrate while crawling forward. Similarly, it is considered that oppositely moving pedestrians drop 'visual pheromones' on their way and the visual pheromones might cause attractive or repulsive interactions. This pheromenon is introduced into modelling the pedestrians' walking preference. In this way, the decision-making process of pedestrians will be based on 'the instinct of following'. At some densities, the relationships of velocity-density and flux-density are analyzed for different evaporation rates of visual pheromones. Lane formation and phase transition are observed for certain evaporation rates of visual pheromones.

J	Adewumi, A; Kagamba, J; Alochukwu, A				Adewumi, Aderemi; Kagamba, Jimmy; Alochukwu, Alex			Application of Chaos Theory in the Prediction of Motorised Traffic Flows on Urban Networks	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Review							MODEL	In recent times, urban road networks are faced with severe congestion problems as a result of the accelerating demand for mobility. One of the ways to mitigate the congestion problems on urban traffic road network is by predicting the traffic flow pattern. Accurate prediction of the dynamics of a highly complex system such as traffic flow requires a robust methodology. An approach for predicting Motorised Traffic Flow on Urban Road Networks based on Chaos Theory is presented in this paper. Nonlinear time series modeling techniques were used for the analysis of the traffic flow prediction with emphasis on the technique of computation of the Largest Lyapunov Exponent to aid in the prediction of traffic flow. The study concludes that algorithms based on the computation of the Lyapunov time seem promising as regards facilitating the control of congestion because of the technique's effectiveness in predicting the dynamics of complex systems especially traffic flow.

J	Liu, TF; Lu, XS; Jiang, ZP				Liu, Tengfei; Lu, Xuesong; Jiang, Zhong-Ping			A junction-by-junction feedback-based strategy with convergence analysis for dynamic traffic assignment	SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						dynamic traffic assignment; user equilibrium (UE); system optimum (SO); convergence; LaSalle's invariance principle	URBAN ROAD NETWORKS; NONLINEAR-SYSTEMS; ROUTE GUIDANCE; INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION; ASYMPTOTIC STABILITY; MODEL; EQUILIBRIUM; LYAPUNOV; BEHAVIOR	By considering the traffic assignment problem as a control problem, this paper develops a new real-time route guidance strategy for accurate convergence of the traffic flows to user equilibrium (UE) or system optimum (SO), in the presence of drivers' response uncertainties. With the new guidance strategy, the drivers make routing decisions based on the route guidance information from junction to junction. Specifically, instead of total travel cost of every route from origin to destination, the travel cost of every alternative link plus the average cost to destination from the next junction corresponding to the alternative link is sent to the drivers at each specific junction. The drivers' response to the route guidance information is directly modeled by the splitting rates at the junctions, which are simply negatively correlated with the comparison of related cost information and are able to take into account the drivers' response uncertainties. With the propsed route guidance strategy, in the case of fixed travel demands, the accurate convergence of the traffic flows to a up is guaranteed in the presence of drivers' response uncertainties by using LaSalle's invariance principle: When marginal travel cost information, instead of travel cost information, is sent to the drivers, a system optimum can be achieved under a mild condition on the marginal cost function.

J	Di, X; Liu, HX; Ban, XG				Di, Xuan; Liu, Henry X.; Ban, Xuegang (Jeff)			Second best toll pricing within the framework of bounded rationality	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Bounded rationality (BR); Toll pricing; Risk-prone; Risk-averse	USER EQUILIBRIUM; NETWORK DESIGN; CHOICE; ALGORITHMS; BEHAVIOR; DRIVERS; MODELS	The network design problem is usually formulated as a bi-level program, assuming the user equilibrium is attained in the lower level program. Given boundedly rational route choice behavior, the lower-level program is replaced with the boundedly rational user equilibria (BRUE). The network design problem with boundedly rational route choice behavior is understudied due to non-uniqueness of the BRUE. In this study, thus, we mainly focus on boundedly rational toll pricing (BR-TP) with affine link cost functions. The topological properties of the lower level BRUE set are first explored. As the BRUE solution is generally non-unique, urban planners cannot predict exactly which equilibrium flow pattern the transportation network will operate after a planning strategy is implemented. Due to the risk caused by uncertainty of people's reaction, two extreme scenarios are considered: the traffic flow patterns with either the minimum system travel cost or the maximum, which is the "risk-prone" (BR-TP-RP) or the "risk-averse" (BR-TP-RA) scenario respectively. The upper level BR-TP is to find an optimal toll minimizing the total system travel cost, while the lower level is to find the best or the worst scenario. Accordingly BR-TP can be formulated as either a min -min or a min -max program. Solution existence is discussed based on the topological properties of the BRUE and algorithms are proposed. Two examples are accompanied to illustrate the proposed methodology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For that purpose, a field survey was carried out, in which a panel of 75 pedestrians were asked to take 8 short walking trips (each one corresponding to a different walking and crossing scenario) in the Athens city centre in Greece, allowing to record their crossing behaviour in different road and traffic conditions. The same individuals were asked to fill in a questionnaire on their travel motivations, their mobility characteristics, their risk perceptions and preferences with respect to walking and road crossing, their opinion on drivers, etc. The walking and crossing scenarios' data were used to develop mixed sequential logit models of pedestrian behaviour on the basis of road and traffic characteristics. The modelling results showed that pedestrian crossing choices are significantly affected by road type, traffic flow and traffic control. The questionnaire data were used to estimate human factors (components) of pedestrian crossing behaviour by means of principal component analysis. The results showed that three components of pedestrian crossing behaviour emerge, namely a "risk-taking and optimisation" component reflecting the tendency to cross at mid-block in order to save time, etc., a "conservative" component, concerning individuals with increased perceived risk of mid-block crossing, who also appear to be frequent public transport users, and a "pedestrian for pleasure" component, bringing together frequent pedestrians, walking for health or pleasure, etc. The introduction of these components as explanatory variables into the choice models resulted in improvement of the modelling results, indicating that human factors have additional explanatory power over road and traffic factors of pedestrian behaviour. Therefore, the development of integrated choice and latent variables models appears to be an appropriate field for further research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hu, SR; Peeta, S; Liou, HT				Hu, Shou-Ren; Peeta, Srinivas; Liou, Han-Tsung			Integrated Determination of Network Origin-Destination Trip Matrix and Heterogeneous Sensor Selection and Location Strategy	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Heterogeneous sensor deployment strategy; intelligent transportation systems; network sensor location problem; origin-destination matrix estimation	AUTOMATIC VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION; COUNTING LOCATION; PATH ENUMERATION; TRAFFIC COUNTS; OBSERVABILITY; MODEL	This paper proposes a two-stage optimization model to determine the origin-destination (O-D) trip matrix and the heterogeneous sensor deployment strategy in an integrated manner for a vehicular traffic network using sensor information from active (camera-based license plate recognition) and passive (vehicle detector) sensors. The first stage solves the heterogeneous sensor selection and location problem to determine the optimal sensor deployment strategy, in terms of the selection of the numbers of the two sensor types and their installation locations, to maximize the traffic information available for the O-D matrix estimation problem. The traffic information includes the observed link flow, path trajectory, and path coverage information. The second stage leverages this traffic information to determine the network O-D matrix that minimizes the error between the observed and estimated traffic flows (link, O-D, and/or path). Correspondingly, two network O-D matrix estimation models are proposed where the link-based model incorporates the flow conservation rule between O-D and link flows and uses the link-node incidence matrix, and the path-based model assumes a given link-path incidence matrix. An iterative solution procedure is designed to determine the network O-D matrix and link flow estimates. Results from numerical experiments suggest that the path-based model outperforms the link-based model in the estimation of network O-D matrices. The relative contributions of combinations of the two sensor types to the network O-D matrix estimation problem are also analyzed. They suggest that active sensors provide valuable path information to solve the O-D matrix estimation problem, but at the cost of a significantly higher unit price. The study results have key implications for heterogeneous sensor selection and location strategies.

However, most of the existing measures have been focusing on large road networks like highways between cities, even though urban networks are equally important. Also, the measures require full microscopic simulations for deriving the value of travel time increase, which is used for predicting network performance in case a disaster situation occurs. In order to overcome such issue, this study provides a new evaluation method for vulnerability of urban road network based on the concept of macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD). We call such measure as MFD-based Vulnerability Index (MVI), which is derived by comparing the MFD behaviours in normal condition and event condition, in which one or more links of a road network are failed by a disaster. For testing the measure, a simulation study based on the road network of Gangnam district, Seoul, South Korea is provided. The results show that the measure can help us investigate the different patterns of network performance loss by different traffic states. This work provides a different perspective of investigating road network vulnerability. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, these methods do not incorporate the risk of untimely inspection nor adopt the state-of-art intelligent transportation resources, such as traffic data from various infrastructures, flow prediction models with high accuracy, and empirical-mechanistic models for pavement deterioration process. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework to optimize a flexible inspection schedule within a risk boundary defined by pavement state prediction with traffic flow data and a more mechanistic deterioration model. The results validate the outperformance of the optimized inspection over two conventional inspection schemes-1-year and 2-year regular inspection. Also the optimized inspection is comparably more robust than the regular inspections with different traffic scenarios due to the uncertainty risk taken by regular inspections.

Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and aeronautical industries are both predicting a growth between 150% and 250% over the next two decades. With this increasing number of aircrafts in the air, airports need also to improve their scheduling strategies to better control the coordination of landing planes. Air Traffic Controllers (ATCO) seek to minimize the waiting time on the aircraft waiting queue. However the ATCO normally use a First Come First Served (FCFS) technique driven by its simplicity. However, it has the disadvantage of offering poor performance when opposed to other strategies. Aiming to characterize and evaluate this performance and compare it with other algorithms, we have tested the application of some scheduling meta-heuristics to this problem, namely Tabu Search (TS) and Simulated Annealing (SA). Experiments show that SA outperforms TS by up to 55% and FCFS by up to 19%. We recommend that using the SA could help managers enhance their decisions over the currently used policies (FCFS) by providing a better scheduling for landing control and saving companies' time and money.

B	Li, X; Bai, RB			IEEE	Li, Xia; Bai, Ruibin			Freight Vehicle Travel Time Prediction Using Gradient Boosting Regression Tree	2016 15TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING AND APPLICATIONS (ICMLA 2016)			English	Proceedings Paper	15th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)	DEC 18-20, 2016	Anaheim, CA	IEEE, Assoc Machine Learning & Applicat, IEEE SMC Tech Comm Machine Learning, IEEE Comp Soc			MODELS	Travel time prediction is important for freight transportation companies. Accurate travel time prediction can help these companies make better planning and task scheduling. For several reasons, most companies are not able to obtain traffic flow data from traffic management authorities, but a large amount of trajectory data were collected everyday which has not been fully utilised. In this study, we aim to fill this gap and performed travel time predictions for freight vehicles at individual level using Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT) models. All the features were extracted or composed from vehicles' temporally sparse trajectory data. Three routes were selected for the prediction experiments. Bayesian optimisation was adopted for model fitting while the results show that both pre-start (before trip starts) and post-start (after trip starts) predictions accuracies reach above 80%. The results also show that the prediction performance can be gradually improved by adding more mean speed estimates of traveled distance from the first 5 minutes as the real-time information. And the prediction performance can be further improved by about 2% by adding more mean speed estimates even if an unusual and non-recurring events occurred at a location of a route segment. This study shows the feasibility of both pre-start and continuous post-start prediction with limited amount of temporally sparse trajectory data for real-world practice.

Existing models such as ARMA, ARIMA are mainly linear models and cannot describe the stochastic and non-linear nature of traffic flow. In recent years, deep-learning-based methods have been applied as novel alternatives for traffic flow prediction. However, which kind of deep neural networks is the most appropriate model for traffic flow prediction remains unsolved. In this paper, we use Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) neural network (NN) methods to predict short-term traffic flow, and experiments demonstrate that Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based deep learning methods such as LSTM and GRU perform better than auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that GRU is applied to traffic flow prediction.

A novel approach is suggested for alleviating congestion, which utilizes identified models of driver behavior and traffic flow, as well as optimization of the target density to maximize throughput. Real-time traffic information from on-road sensors is integrated with historical information to provide feedback and preview for the dynamic toll price controller. The algorithm developed here provides an opportunity to improve on existing toll policy by guaranteeing minimum speeds for toll lane drivers, maintaining consistent traffic flow for the other drivers, and optimizing the overall traffic throughput.

Indeed, taxicab trajectories and online calling information have enabled us to provide more efficient and personalized services. However, existing approaches are not sufficient in exploiting cooperative scheduling techniques and utilizing real time calling information. To this end, in this paper, we model the time-varying regularities of traffic flows, activity ratios of passengers, and unoccupied taxicabs of road segments by mining statistical data on taxicab trajectories. Along this line, we propose a novel approach to calculate the expected revenue of possible routes for individual taxicabs while considering the influence of others, and at the same time, advance a dynamic taxicab scheduling mechanism with online taxicab calling information. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on real-world taxicab data. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing alternative solutions in terms of average revenue of taxi drivers.

In either case, information of how long an accident affects the traffic at nearby intersections is essential. Although there have been various approaches regarding prioraccident issues, only a few studies have been able to evaluate the impacts after an accident. With the emerging of new traffic sensor technologies, traffic data have exploded. This inspires us to rethink the accident impacts evaluation problem based more on intensive data. Accordingly, a practical data-driven method is proposed in this paper, whose functions are twofold: 1) to identify the flow characteristic of each intersection based on the processed data and then quantify the accident impacts through outlier detection and 2) to evaluate the duration of impacts by means of hazard-based model with heterogeneity. The procedure developed in this paper will be useful for capturing the accident impacts duration at or near urban intersections, as well as identifying the causal factors that affect these impacts, which includes the accident features, road environment and the temporal characteristics of nearby intersections. These findings could make some valuable conclusions for a better traffic management.

Errors in TDOD demand are often propagated into the network outputs causing unreliable planning and operational policies. In this study, a bi-level optimization problem is proposed where the upper level is an Ordinary Least-Squared (OLS) error minimization problem that minimizes the deviation between the estimated and observed traffic volumes from SCATS, while the lower level generates assignment proportions matrix using a mesoscopic simulation-based dynamic user equilibrium model. The interior point conjugate gradient method, as an exact gradient method, is applied to solve the TDOD demand estimation problem. The obtained results highlight the capability of the proposed approach in improving the performance of a dynamic large-scale network model of Melbourne CBD.

One of the main reasons behind traffic congestion is accidents which can not only result in casualties and losses for the participants, but also in wasted and lost time for the others that are stuck behind the wheels. Early detection of an accident can save lives, provides quicker road openings, hence decreases wasted time and resources, and increases efficiency. In this study, we propose a preliminary real-time autonomous accident-detection system based on computational intelligence techniques. Istanbul City traffic-flow data for the year 2015 from various sensor locations are populated using big data processing methodologies. The extracted features are then fed into a nearest neighbor model, a regression tree, and a feed-forward neural network model. For the output, the possibility of an occurrence of an accident is predicted. The results indicate that even though the number of false alarms dominates the real accident cases, the system can still provide useful information that can be used for status verification and early reaction to possible accidents.

To satisfy the demand of traffic flow prediction, this paper presents the method of real-time traffic flow prediction based on Bayesian classifier and support vector regression (SVR). We first model the traffic flow and its relations on the roads using 3D Markov random fields in spatiotemporal domain. Based on their relations, we define cliques as combination of current road and its neighbors. The dependencies on the defined cliques are estimated by using multiple linear regression and SVR. Finally, the traffic flow at next time stamp is predicted by finding the speed level with decreasing the energy function. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, it was tested on traffic data obtained from Gyeongbu expressway. The experimental results showed that the approach using SVR-based estimation had superior accuracy than linear-based regression.

This paper proposed an immunological method of image processing for detecting the fog/haze in the image to support Intelligent Transportation Systems. This state-of-the-art method is based on the theory of biological defence system, which unites the reducing of fog/haze and edge detection. The experimental results show that our proposed haze immunized algorithm can remove effect of haze on image processing algorithm. Compared to conventional de-haze image processing algorithm, our proposed algorithm unitizes bio-inspired algorithm to achieve efficient hardware consumption. The results of FPGA implementation show less hardware usage than conventional method.

The effects of meteorological conditions (temperature, relative humidity, wind direction, and speed) and the intensity of traffic flows on the results of the measurements were also evaluated. On the base of the measurements, there was developed a neural network modelling approach that allowed to quantify exhaust / non-exhaust PM10 and PM2.5 emissions and carry out numerical investigations of air pollution by transport related PM2.5 and PM10 on street and urban level in St. Petersburg.

Road traffic state estimation can be done using either data driven or model based or hybrid approaches. The data driven approach is preferable for real-time flow prediction but to get traffic data for performance evaluation, hybrid approach is recommended. In this paper, a neural network model is employed to estimate real-time traffic flow on urban road network. To model the traffic flow, the microscopic model Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) is used. The evaluation of the model using both simulation data and real-world data indicated that the developed estimation model could help to generate reliable traffic state information on urban roads.

J	Poole, A; Kotsialos, A				Poole, Adam; Kotsialos, Apostolos			Swarm intelligence algorithms for macroscopic traffic flow model validation with automatic assignment of fundamental diagrams	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Traffic flow model parameter estimation; Intelligent Transportation Systems; Particle swarm optimisation; Genetic algorithms; Cuckoo Search	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; OPTIMIZATION; CALIBRATION; NETWORKS; SEARCH; WAVES	This paper is concerned with the problem of macroscopic road traffic flow model calibration and verification. Thoroughly validated models are necessary for both control system design and scenario evaluation purposes. Here, the second order traffic flow model METANET was calibrated and verified using real data. A powerful optimisation problem formulation is proposed for identifying a set of model parameters that makes the model fit to measurements. For the macroscopic traffic flow model validation problem, this set of parameters characterise the aggregate traffic flow features over a road network. In traffic engineering, one of the most important relationships whose parameters need to be determined is the fundamental diagram of traffic, which models the non-linear relationship between vehicular flow and density. Typically, a real network does not exhibit the same traffic flow aggregate behaviour everywhere and different fundamental diagrams are used for covering different network areas. As a result, one of the initial steps of the validation process rests on expert engineering opinion assigning the spatial extension of fundamental diagrams. The proposed optimisation problem formulation allows for automatically determining the number of different fundamental diagrams to be used and their corresponding spatial extension over the road network, simplifying this initial step. Although the optimisation problem suffers from local minima, good solutions which generalise well were obtained. The design of the system used is highly generic and allows for a number of evolutionary and swarm intelligence algorithms to be used. Two UK sites have been used for testing it. Calibration and verification results are discussed in detail. The resulting models are able to capture the dynamics of traffic flow and replicate shockwave propagation. A total of ten different algorithms were considered and compared with respect to their ability to converge to a solution, which remains valid for different sets of data. Particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithms have proven to be particularly effective and provide the best results both in terms of speed of convergence and solution generalisation. An interesting result reported is that more recently proposed PSO algorithms were outperformed by older variants, both in terms of speed of convergence and model error minimisation.

However, the diagrams relating these variables (the fundamental and speed diagrams) show some peculiarities not yet fully reproduced nor explained by mathematical models. In this paper, resting on the methods of kinetic theory, we introduce a new traffic model which takes into account the heterogeneous nature of the flow of vehicles along a road. In more detail, the model considers traffic as a mixture of two or more populations of vehicles (e.g., cars and trucks) with different microscopic characteristics, in particular different lengths and/or maximum speeds.

In this work, a method to manage variable speed limits combined with coordinated ramp metering within the framework of the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) network model is introduced. Following a 'first-discretize-then-optimize' approach, the first order optimality system is derived and the switch of speeds at certain fixed points in time is explained, together with the boundary control for the ramp metering. Sequential quadratic programming methods are used to solve the control problem numerically. For application purposes, experimental setups are presented wherein variable speed limits are used as a traffic guidance system to avoid traffic jams on highway interchanges and on-ramps.

It makes a large amount of traffic flow into the expressway, resulting the congestion in the expressway in many big cities, including Beijing. Taking the Beijing southwest third ring expressway for example, a simulation model was built using Paramics. The simulation model was pre-evaluated before and after the bus lanes set, and the model was post-evaluated to verify the validity of the model after the bus lanes were implemented, it has important theoretical and practical value.

It has been proved that, compared with driving individually, such a platoon-based driving pattern can significantly improve road capacity and energy efficiency. Moreover, with the emerging vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), the performance of a platoon in terms of road capacity, safety, energy efficiency, etc., can be further improved. On the other hand, the physical dynamics of vehicles inside the platoon can also affect the performance of a VANET. Such a complex system can be considered a platoon-based vehicular cyber-physical system (VCPS), which has attracted significant attention recently. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on a platoon-based VCPS. We first review the related work of a platoon-based VCPS. We then introduce two elementary techniques involved in a platoon-based VCPS, i.e., the vehicular networking architecture and standards, and traffic dynamics, respectively. We further discuss the fundamental issues in a platoon-based VCPS, including vehicle platooning/clustering, cooperative adaptive cruise control, platoon-based vehicular communications, etc., all of which are characterized by the tightly coupled relationship between traffic dynamics and VANET behaviors. Since system verification is critical to VCPS development, we also give an overview of VCPS simulation tools. Finally, we share our view on some open issues that may lead to new research directions.

The model is extended to include the effects of ramp metering and variable speed limits. Next, an integrated freeway traffic control based on the new model is presented in order to minimize the total time spent in the network. The integrated scheme has the capability of controlling large-scale freeway networks in real time as the model is computationally efficient, and it is yet accurate enough for our control purposes. In addition, the extended model is reformulated as a system of linear inequalities with mixed binary and real variables. The reformulated model along with the linearized total travel time objective function establish a mixed-integer linear optimization problem that is more tractable and even faster than the original optimization problem integrated in the MPC scheme. Finally, to investigate the performance of the proposed approaches (nonlinear MPC and the mixed-integer linear counterpart), a freeway network layout based on the Leuven Corridor in Belgium is selected. The extended LTM is calibrated for this network using microsimulation data and then is used for prediction and control of the large network. Microsimulation results show that the proposed methods are able to efficiently improve the total travel time.

In order to make the best use of the existing road capacity, traffic-responsive control systems, including model-predictive controllers, are excellent choices. A model-predictive controller can minimize a cost function along a given time horizon. We propose a model predictive control system that aims to reduce the congestion, and uses an internal flow model, which is our proposed modified version of the S-model. In the formulation of the objective function for the controller, we take into account the effect of those vehicles that remain in the network at the end of the prediction horizon until the network is completely evacuated. We formulate this effect as endpoint penalties for the MPC optintization problem. Finally, we will apply the designed controller to an urban traffic network and Compare two scenarios, i.e., the fixed-time control case and the model-predictive control approach with the endpoint penalties proposed in this paper. The results prove the excellent performance of the model-predictive controller compared with the fixed-time controller. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic.

Variable speed limit (VSL) control is an approach that aims to reduce the impact congestion by controlling the speed of traffic along the highway lanes. In this study, we evaluate the environmental impact of a combined variable speed limit and lane change control strategy with two different fuel consumption/emission models: the EPA model MOVES and CHEM developed by the University of California at Riverside. Microscopic Monte-Carlo simulations of traffic on 1-710 freeway are used to demonstrate the environment effect of the combined control method. Both environmental models are used to evaluate fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions with and without the combined control strategy. Despite some differences between the two models, the evaluation results of both models confirm the benefits of the combined variable speed limit and lane change control strategy.

In this paper we briefly describe the agent-based simulation workflow and give the details of our data driven approach for (1) modeling the road network of Amsterdam metropolitan area extended by major national roads, (2) recreating the car owners population distribution from municipality demographic data, (3) modeling the agent activity based on travel survey, and (4) modeling the inflow and outflow boundary conditions based on the traffic sensor data. The models are implemented in scientific Python and MATSim agent-based freeware. Simulation results of 46.5 thousand agents -with travel plans sampled from the model distributions- show that travel demand model is consistent, but should be improved to correspond with sensor data. The next steps in our project are: extensive validation, calibration and testing of large-scale scenarios, including critical events like the major power outage in the Netherlands (doi: 10. 1016/1.procs.2015.11.039), and modelling emissions and heat islands caused by traffic jams.

Relatively, limited research has been done on the lane utilization behavior of different vehicle types on multilane urban roads. The lane utilization is affected by several factors such as vehicle composition, traffic flow rate and vehicular speeds. In the present study, eight hours of video graphic data was collected from a road stretch on Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, incorporating both peak and off peak hours. The lane discipline behavior is studied for five different vehicle categories. SPSS software is used for multivariate analysis in connection with lane utilization factor over a wider range of traffic flow rates. A structural equation model has been established for all the four lanes separately and the influence of the vehicles on lane utilization is studied ultimately. The results of the present study in the form of lane utilization and lane discipline behavior by different vehicle types may help in differentiating the characteristics of traffic on expressways in relation to the other roads in India. It may be also helpful to refine the microscopic simulation models and its parameters in order to validate them at micro-level, under traffic conditions prevailing on DelhiGurgaon Expressway.

J	Zhu, GY; Wang, L; Zhang, P; Song, K				Zhu, Guangyu; Wang, Li; Zhang, Peng; Song, Kang			A Kind of Urban Road Travel Time Forecasting Model with Loop Detectors	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article								Urban road travel time is an important parameter to reflect the traffic flow state. Besides, it is one of the important parameters for the traffic management department to formulate guidance measures, provide traffic information service, and improve the efficiency of the detectors group. Therefore, it is crucial to improve the forecast accuracy of travel time in traffic management practice. Based on the analysis of the change-point and the ARIMA model, this paper constructs a model for the massive data collected by loop detectors to forecast travel time parameters. Firstly, the preprocessing algorithm for the data of loop detectors is given, and the calculating model of the travel time is studied. Secondly, a change-point detection algorithm is designed to classify the sequence of large number of travel time data items into several patterns. Then, this paper establishes a forecast model to forecast travel time in different patterns using the improved ARIMA model. At last, the model is verified by simulation and the verification results of several groups of examples show that the model has high accuracy and practicality.

Instead of looking into temporal variations of traffic flow states of individual links, we focus on temporal evolution of the complete spatial configuration of congestions over the network. In our work, we pursue to describe the typical temporal patterns of the global traffic states and achieve long-term prediction of the large-scale traffic evolution in a unified data-mining framework. To this end, we formulate this joint task using regularized Non-negative Tensor Factorization, which has been shown to be a useful analysis tool for spatio-temporal data sequences. Clustering and prediction are performed based on the compact tensor factorization results. The validity of the proposed spatio-temporal traffic data analysis method is shown on experiments using simulated realistic traffic data.

Modeling Traffic at Sags	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						Sag; Traffic congestion; Microscopic traffic model; Model face-validity; Sensitivity analysis	FLOW	Freeway capacity decreases at sags due to local changes in car-following behavior. Consequently, sags are often bottlenecks in freeway networks. This article presents a microscopic traffic model that reproduces traffic flow dynamics at sags. The traffic model includes a new car-following model that takes into account the influence of freeway gradient on vehicle acceleration. The face-validity of the traffic model is tested by means of a simulation study. The study site is a sag of a Japanese freeway. The simulation results are compared to empirical traffic data presented in previous studies. We show that the model is capable of reproducing the key traffic phenomena that cause the formation of congestion at sags, including the lower capacity compared to normal sections, the location of the bottleneck around the end of the vertical curve, and the capacity drop induced by congestion. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis indicates that the traffic model is robust enough to reproduce those phenomena even if some inputs are modified to some extent. The sensitivity analysis also shows what parameters need to be calibrated more accurately for real world applications of the model.

The key of this concept is using intelligent vehicles as actuators for traffic control systems. Under this concept, we design and test a control system that connects a traffic controller with in-vehicle controllers via vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. The link-level traffic controller regulates traffic speeds through variable speed limits (VSL) gantries to resolve stop-and-go waves, while intelligent vehicles control accelerations through vehicle propulsion and brake systems to optimize their local situations. It is assumed that each intelligent vehicle receives VSL commands from the traffic controller and uses them as variable parameters for the local vehicle controller. Feasibility and effectiveness of the connected control paradigm are tested with simulation on a two-lane freeway stretch with intelligent vehicles randomly distributed among human-driven vehicles. Simulation shows that the connected VSL and vehicle control system improves traffic efficiency and sustainability; that is, total time spent in the network and average fuel consumption rate are reduced compared to (uncontrolled and controlled) scenarios with 100% human drivers and to uncontrolled scenarios with the same intelligent vehicle penetration rates.

This paper examined the multistep ahead prediction performance of eight different models using the 2-minute travel speed data collected from three Remote Traffic Microwave Sensors located on a southbound segment of 4th ring road in Beijing City. Specifically, we consider five machine learning methods: Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN), nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous inputs neural network (NARXNN), support vector machine with radial basis function as kernel function (SVM-RBF), Support Vector Machine with Linear Function (SVM-LIN), and Multilinear Regression (MLR) as candidate. Three statistical models are also selected: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Vector Autoregression (VAR), and Space-Time (ST) model. From the prediction results, we find the following meaningful results: (1) the prediction accuracy of speed deteriorates as the prediction time steps increase for all models; (2) the BPNN, NARXNN, and SVM-RBF can clearly outperform two traditional statistical models: ARIMA and VAR; (3) the prediction performance of ANN is superior to that of SVM and MLR; (4) as time step increases, the ST model can consistently provide the lowest MAE comparing with ARIMA and VAR.

Predicting Hourly Traflc Noise from Traflc Flow Rate Model: Underlying Concepts for the DYNAMAP Project	NOISE MAPPING			English	Article							TRAFFIC NOISE; VARIABILITY	The DYNAMAP project aims at obtaining a dynamic noise map of a large residential area such as the City of Milan (Italy), by recording traffic noise from a limited number of noise sensors. To this end, we perform a statistical analysis of road stretches and group them into different clusters showing a similar measured hourly traffic noise behavior. In the sameway, we group simulated hourly traffic flow rates and compare their compositions with those of the traffic noise groups. The best agreement with the traffic noise was found by using the so-called normal traffic flow rate, yielding overlaps between 68 and 97%. Finally, we derive a simple analytical model to predict the hourly traffic noise from the simulated normal traffic flow, in very good agreement with the measured values.

Take the one move 5 grids for one time as quick-vehicle, which is the results of aggressive behavior, such as overtaking and closely following behavior. And take the one which moves 3 grids for one time as slow-vehicle, which is on behalf of normally driving. The relationship among discrete of traffic flow, traffic density and chaos is researched, in the hope of preparing the solid theoretic basis for eliminating the bad chaos in traffic flow. And based on the distance headway condition and velocity condition, Rear-end accident risk assessment coefficient is advanced to research the influence of aggressive behavior on traffic safety lever on the urban road and on the freeway. The results show that aggressive behavior would emphasis the chaos of traffic flow and the happen opportunity is more, the chaos character in traffic flow is more. And aggressive driving behavior would decrease the safety character of traffic flow. The happen opportunity is more, the value of Rear-end accidents is bigger.

It can obtain the data of traffic flow, occupancy and speed of the road. As a principal component, insulated loop wire is easy to be affected by pavement deformation and environment, so the health status and life of the equipment are easily affected. In order to study the health status of the lane detection devices, a single equipment health index model was proposed. The health status of the inductive loop wire is evaluated according to the results of health index calculation. So as to establish a set of management measures for the loop wire equipment. The health index is calculated by the basic data and the maintenance record of the lane detection equipment in the Beijing to Tibet freeway, so as to complete the health assessment of the loop wire, and make clear its actual operation. The results are in line with the actual situation of the equipment by the verification and evaluation.

It has an important significance for traffic flow accurately and predicting traffic flow. But the traditional methods obtaining passenger flow only can get little information by field investigation which are not comprehensive. This paper utilizes IC card data and GPS data that passengers get on and get off to estimate the station. Based on the estimation, we have proposed a method to forecast passenger flow. The results show that the method of estimating the passenger flow based on the data of the public transport IC card and the GPS data has more than eighty percent accuracy. The forecasting method of autoregression has the highest accuracy rate compared with Holt-Winters and decision tree method.

The impact of accident duration on traffic dynamics are analyzed by counting the downstream discharge flow rates and drawing the spatial-temporal diagram. The effectiveness of VSL control strategy is then investigated. The simulation results indicate that the longer the accident duration, the more serious the traffic congestion and the lower the system discharge flow rates are; with appropriate speed limit value and speed limit region length, traffic congestion induced by accident can be alleviated and even the system discharge flow can be increased in some extend.

We detect traffic hotspots which lead to congestion using the betweenness centrality of the road graph. This is shown to have a power-law distribution which we set out to redistribute and equalize. Optimization at a macro-level is not feasible because of the graph size, and thus we recursively narrow down the methodology to a sub-optimization of city neighborhoods. To that end, the paper introduces a genetic algorithm which redistributes betweenness optimization at a neighborhood level, district level, and city level to reduce and/or eliminate congestion hotspots, by changing street directions, without adding any new roads. Experimental results yield an improvement with a factor of 4 times in terms of reducing load off from hotspots and transferring it to neighboring streets.

Regret model for resilience in road design	SUSTAINABLE CITY XI	WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment		English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Urban Regeneration and Sustainability (SC)	2016	Alicante, SPAIN	Wessex Inst, Univ Alicante, WIT Transact Ecol & Environm, Int Journal Sustainable Dev & Planning, Int Journal Design & Nat & Ecodynam		decision theory; multi-attribute utility; regret theory; road design	EXPECTED FEEDBACK; DECISION-MAKING; PROSPECT-THEORY; RISK; PREFERENCES; UNCERTAINTY	The goal of this study is to identify if regret theory may be used to decide between different road design alternatives to ensure the resilience of the design given future uncertainties. It formulates a matrix for the regret factor in the decision-making process. There are different, and often conflicting, parameters and variables that are taken into account whenever different road designs are considered. This paper uses an example of five variables and constraints such as planning (i.e. optimal usage of land use), traffic flow, traffic safety (i.e. to ensure low crash rates), along with constraints such as construction economics and time to completion. It is assumed that each variable may have its own performance indicator based on its own modelling techniques and each is weighed based on the objectives of the decision-makers. However, each model may have inherent uncertainties that may propagate in a multi-attribute decision system. The proposed theoretical framework allows the system to analyze different roads construction alternatives to aid in decision-making. This study does not induce a specific strategy to be utilized by decision-makers, but provides a systematic methodology to help making decisions once an objective-driven strategy has been established. Using a multi-attribute matrix, the framework considers how to practically use regret theory in deciding between different road designs given the uncertainties inherent in each model. It is found that the usage of regret theory can be beneficial. However, furthermore research needs to be conducted to illustrate how this framework would be utilized in a real-world scenario and how it may impact decision in road designs.

This study aimed to develop a simple and effective hybrid model for forecasting traffic volume that combines the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and the Genetic Programming (GP) models. By combining different models, different aspects of the underlying patterns of traffic flow could be captured. The ARIMA model was used to model the linear component of the traffic flow time series. Then the GP model was applied to capture the nonlinear component by modelling the residuals from the ARIMA model. The hybrid models were fitted for four different time-aggregations: 5, 10, 15, and 20 min. The validations of the proposed hybrid methodology were performed by using traffic data under both typical and atypical conditions from multiple locations on the I-880N freeway in the United States. The results indicated that the hybrid models had better predictive performance than utilizing only ARIMA model for different aggregation time intervals under typical conditions. The Mean Relative Error (MRE) of the hybrid models was found to be from 4.1 to 6.9% for different aggregation time intervals under typical conditions. The predictive performance of the hybrid method was improved with an increase in the aggregation time interval. In addition, the validation results showed that the predictive performance of the hybrid model was also better than that of the ARIMA model under atypical conditions.

Hence, this work aims to model traffic flow on Indian urban expressways with specific reference to Delhi-Gurgaon expressway and estimate its capacity using the micro-simulation model using VISSIM 5.40. For this purpose, the field data collected on traffic-flow characteristics on expressways was used in calibration and validation of the simulation model. The validated simulation model was then used to develop fundamental traffic-flow relationships, namely, speed-flow, speed-area occupancy, and flow-area occupancy for the traffic-flow levels, starting from near-zero until the capacity of the facility. The capacity of an eight-lane divided urban expressway in level terrain with 14.0-m wide road space (one direction of traffic flow) was found to be in the range of 9700-10000 vehicles/h. Moreover, through sensitivity analysis using simulation model, the following relationships, (i) percentage trucks in the traffic stream and capacity-level flow and (ii) percentage of trucks in the traffic stream and capacity-level traffic-stream speed, were developed. The results and the overall methodology followed in this study for modeling traffic flow on expressways in India to determine the capacity estimates under varying traffic compositions may be very useful for the practitioners and also for the continuing efforts to prepare an Indian Highway Capacity Manual.

J	Lin, DC; Ma, WJ; Li, L; Wang, YH				Lin, Dianchao; Ma, Wanjing; Li, Li; Wang, Yinhai			A driving force model for non-strict priority crossing behaviors of right-turn drivers	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Non-strict priority crossing; Driving force; Right-turn; Non-motorized traffic	SAFETY; PEDESTRIANS; VEHICLES; CAPACITY; BICYCLES; ANXIETY; STREET; IMPACT; SPEED; RISK	At urban intersections, conflicts between right-turn vehicles and through non-motorized vehicles are a critical cause of traffic congestion and safety challenges. Based on the fact that in different countries there is no strict priority in conflicts between motorized and non-motorized vehicles, this study focused on analysis of the inherent mechanism of this universal phenomenon. By the analogy of a force model for moving vehicles, this paper developed a micro driving force model, including the safety driving force and efficiency driving force, for right-turn drivers which constitute the dominant party during the non-strict priority crossing process. We further demonstrate that the strict priority crossing behavior is a special case of the proposed driving force model. All the parameters used in this model were calibrated through field data collected at twelve signalized intersection sites in Shanghai. Model validation results proved the accuracy and reliability of the proposed driving force model. The model was further proved that it can be used for right-turn vehicle's average crossing speed prediction. The sensitivity analysis identified the influence of vehicle type, non-motorized traffic flow rate, and non-motorized traffic speed on the average speed, and offered support for the rationality of the non-strict priority.

During 2014, Thessaloniki, Greece, experienced significant anomalies with respect to the expected amount and intensity of rainfalls, which severely influenced traffic flow and safety conditions. According to the National Meteorological Service, a 360% deviation in the total rainfall accumulation (compared with the 1959-1997 mean) was observed in the city for July 2014. Based on the increased intensity and occurrence of such events, this research studied the impacts of heavy rainfalls on road operations, with the road network of Thessaloniki, Greece, serving as a case study. Data for these analyses were obtained from floating car data of a 1,200-taxi fleet that contained GPS coordinates and speed information. Findings reveal that vehicle speed drops increase with precipitation intensity yet they differ depending on the examined road type. This paper highlights the importance of developing a sound quantitative understanding of the effects of such events in urban areas and considers the context of the changing climate and the concomitant increasing frequency of extreme events.

These traffic streams may experience various travel times due to multiple reasons, such as fluctuations in traffic demand/supply and stochastic arrivals/departures at signalised intersections. However, the current travel time estimation methods take traffic flow as a whole and produce a single estimation value. This approach can produce large errors. Furthermore, given the travel time information of each traffic stream, the results of dynamic traffic assignment models can be made much more accurate and the effect of signal controls improved. In this paper, a comparison analysis is conducted to verify the significant difference in link travel times of different traffic streams. Then, link travel time is redefined in consideration of traffic stream directions. This process is also successful in filtering noise, as shown in the numerical experiments. In addition, existing estimation methods cannot reflect real values or fluctuations of travel times in sampling intervals without any valid observational data. To solve this problem, a regression model is built and integrated into the travel time estimation model. Error analysis of several links on two different days demonstrates the improvements made by the model.

Generally, some of these inputs are substituted by raw or even inappropriate estimations, which in some cases come into conflict with the fundamentals of traffic flow theory. This paper refers to one common example of these bad practices. Many traffic management centres depend on the data provided by double loop detectors, which supply, among others, vehicle speeds. The common data treatment is to compute the arithmetic mean of these speeds over different aggregation periods (i.e. the time mean speeds). Time mean speed is not consistent with Edie's generalized definitions of traffic variables, and therefore it is not the average speed which relates flow to density. This means that current practice begins with an error that can have negative effects in later studies and applications. The algorithm introduced in this paper enables easily the estimation of space mean speeds from the data provided by the loops. It is based on two key hypotheses: stationarity of traffic and log-normal distribution of the individual speeds in each time interval of aggregation. It could also be used in case of transient traffic as a part of any data fusion methodology.

The main objective of the study is to quantify the effect of the decreasing average annual daily traffic of heavy duty vehicles (trucks) on road safety. As the road safety indicators the frequency road accidents is considered. The data used in the study were collected from one of the most crowded routes in Spain which connects Almeria (south-east) with Barcelona (northeast). The observed data covers year 2010 and were classified into 2 road types: dual carriageways and toll roads. The estimation was carried out using negative binomial model and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation. Using the estimation results new traffic scenarios were proposed where the traffic flow is assumed to change its values. A total of 33 scenarios were proposed and new accidents data were generated through MCMC sampling. The comparison of the simulated and observed accident data shows that the effect of decreasing truck traffic flow could meliorate road safety in the route. The simulation tool could be applied to evaluate the effects of freight modal shift from road to rail.

State of Alertness During Simulated Driving Tasks	XIV MEDITERRANEAN CONFERENCE ON MEDICAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTING 2016	IFMBE Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	14th Mediterranean Conference on Medical and Biological Engineering and Computing (MEDICON)	MAR 31-APR 02, 2016	Paphos, CYPRUS	Cyprus Assoc Med Phys & Biomed Engn, Univ Cyprus, IFMBE, EAMBES, Frederick Univ, European Univ		Alertness; Driving; Engagement Index; EEG; Kinematic parameters	PERFORMANCE; INDEXES; FATIGUE	Literature has shown the importance of studying alertness and attention in drivers by means of electroencephalographic (EEG) indexes. Moreover, many kinematic parameters can be used to give information about the safety of the road depending on the traffic flow. To our knowledge, no study, has focused the attention on the relationship between alertness indexes and kinematic parameters. The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of traffic conditions on alertness by assessing an EEG index (EI) and the relationship between EI and kinematic parameters. Nine volunteers participated in the study. The experiment was carried on by using the STISIM driving simulator. Three scenarios were simulated. Each scenario was characterized by a different traffic flow. From STISIM two kinematic parameters were considered: mean velocity and distance from the central line during driving. EEG data were recorded during driving simulations and the EI was derived from the power spectral bands of EEG. The results showed significant different values for EI among the three conditions, with the highest level of alertness in urban scenario. Significant differences for the kinematic parameters were also found. The mean velocity decreased when the traffic conditions were more demanding, and the capacity to maintain the vehicle in the centre of the road decreased when the traffic conditions were less demanding. The analysis suggests that when the mean velocity increases, the alertness decreases with a consequent increased risk of collision; conversely when the mean velocity decreases, also EI decreases so demonstrating a greater level of alertness accomplished by driving on the centre of the road, so reducing the probably of collision. These results suggest that the alertness of the drivers is influenced by the traffic flow.	[D'Anna, C.; Bibbo, D.; De Blasiis, M.

It includes the driver's behavior, the features of the vehicle, those of the road and the driving conditions. Security can be approached from the aspect of the vehicle and pavement design, of driving habits, traffic regulation and application of laws. The good coordination of the driver, the vehicle and the road enables for better estimation of the traffic safety relations and interrelations giving the possibilities of improvement of the situation at present and in future. The driver has the main role in the determination of the success or failure of the road system. Over 90% of the accidents are due to improper behavior of people in traffic. Understanding of the human factors is the key factor in the optimal road design and traffic flow. Nevertheless, engineers need more understanding about driving behavior, as they are responsible for road design, for the traffic flow, and for the regulations intended to avoid errors wherever possible. The purpose of this paper is to inform about the current situation both in practice and in the researches of traffic safety, as well as to yield a broader review of the actual traffic safety situation on the roads in Republic of Macedonia.

However, due to the increasing severity of urban environmental pollution issues and the development of a resource-saving and environmentally friendly social philosophy, the development of low-carbon and energy-efficient urban transport is required. This paper first defines vehicular trajectories and the calculation of vehicular emissions based on VSP. Next, a regression analysis method is used to quantify the relationship between vehicular emissions and delay, and a traffic signal control model is established to reduce emissions and delay using the enumeration method combined with saturation constraints. Finally, one typical intersection of Changchun is selected to verify the model proposed in this paper; its performance efficiency is also compared using simulations in VISSIM. The results of this study show that the proposed model can significantly reduce vehicle delay and traffic emissions simultaneously.

J	Kerner, BS				Kerner, Boris S.			Microscopic theory of traffic-flow instability governing traffic breakdown at highway bottlenecks: Growing wave of increase in speed in synchronized flow	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; SPATIAL-TEMPORAL PATTERNS; CAR-FOLLOWING THEORY; WIDE MOVING JAM; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES; EMPIRICAL OBSERVATIONS; JAMMING TRANSITION; METASTABLE STATES; 3-PHASE THEORY	We have revealed a growing local speed wave of increase in speed that can randomly occur in synchronized flow (S) at a highway bottleneck. The development of such a traffic flow instability leads to free flow (F) at the bottleneck; therefore, we call this instability an S -> F instability. Whereas the S -> F instability leads to a local increase in speed (growing acceleration wave), in contrast, the classical traffic flow instability introduced in the 1950s-1960s and incorporated later in a huge number of traffic flow models leads to a growing wave of a local decrease in speed (growing deceleration wave). We have found that the S -> F instability can occur only if there is a finite time delay in driver overacceleration. The initial speed disturbance of increase in speed (called "speed peak") that initiates the S -> F instability occurs usually at the downstream front of synchronized flow at the bottleneck. There can be many speed peaks with random amplitudes that occur randomly over time. It has been found that the S -> F instability exhibits a nucleation nature: Only when a speed peak amplitude is large enough can the S -> F instability occur; in contrast, speed peaks of smaller amplitudes cause dissolving speed waves of a local increase in speed (dissolving acceleration waves) in synchronized flow. We have found that the S -> F instability governs traffic breakdown-a phase transition from free flow to synchronized flow (F -> S transition) at the bottleneck: The nucleation nature of the S -> F instability explains the metastability of free flow with respect to an F -> S transition at the bottleneck.

Applicability of models to estimate traffic noise for urban roads	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Traffic noise; Models; Urban roads		Background: Traffic noise is a highly relevant environmental impact in cities. Models to estimate traffic noise, in turn, can be useful tools to guide mitigation measures. In this paper, the applicability of models to estimate noise levels produced by a continuous flow of vehicles on urban roads is investigated. The aim is to identify which models are more appropriate to estimate traffic noise in urban areas since several models available were conceived to estimate noise from highway traffic. Results: First, measurements of traffic noise, vehicle count and speed were carried out in five arterial urban roads of a brazilian city. Together with geometric measurements of width of lanes and distance from noise meter to lanes, these data were input in several models to estimate traffic noise. The predicted noise levels were then compared to the respective measured counterparts for each road investigated. In addition, a chart showing mean differences in noise between estimations and measurements is presented, to evaluate the overall performance of the models. Measured Leq values varied from 69 to 79 dB(A) for traffic flows varying from 1618 to 5220 vehicles/h. Mean noise level differences between estimations and measurements for all urban roads investigated ranged from -3.5 to 5.5 dB(A). Conclusions: According to the results, deficiencies of some models are discussed while other models are identified as applicable to noise estimations on urban roads in a condition of continuous flow. Key issues to apply such models to urban roads are highlighted.

TRAFFIC ANALYSIS AND PAVEMENT TECHNOLOGY AS A TOOL FOR URBAN NOISE CONTROL	ARCHIVES OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						traffic noise; traffic modelling and analysis; traffic forecast; road traffic organization; environment; asphalt pavement; tire/pavement interaction; technology		Traffic related noise is currently considered as an environmental pollution. Paper presents results of multidirectional study attempting to serve urban traffic without the need to erect noise barriers interfering urban space. Initial concept of the road expansion included construction of 1000 m of noise barriers dividing city space. Improvement in the acoustic conditions after construction completion is possible due to the applied noise protection measures: vehicle speed limit, smooth of traffic flow, use of road pavement of reduced noise emission and the technical improvement of the tramway.

J	Polson, N; Sokolov, V				Polson, Nicholas; Sokolov, Vadim			BAYESIAN ANALYSIS OF TRAFFIC FLOW ON INTERSTATE I-55: THE LWR MODEL	ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Traffic flow; intelligent transportation system; LWR model; particle filtering; Bayesian posterioor; traffic prediction	STATE ESTIMATION; NETWORK; INFORMATION; SIMULATION; FILTER; WAVES	Transportation departments take actions to manage traffic flow and reduce travel times based on estimated current and projected traffic conditions. Travel time estimates and forecasts require information on traffic density which are combined with a model to project traffic flow such as the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model. We develop a particle filtering and learning algorithm to estimate the current traffic density state and the LWR parameters. These inputs are related to the so-called fundamental diagram, which describes the relationship between traffic flow and density. We build on existing methodology by allowing real-time updating of the posterior uncertainty for the critical density and capacity parameters. Our methodology is applied to traffic flow data from interstate highway I-55 in Chicago. We provide a real-time data analysis of how to learn the drop in capacity as a result of a major traffic accident. Our algorithm allows us to accurately assess the uncertainty of the current traffic state at shock waves, where the uncertainty is a mixture distribution.

J	Jabbarpour, MR; Noor, RM; Khokhar, RH				Jabbarpour, Mohammad Reza; Noor, Rafidah Md; Khokhar, Rashid Hafeez			Green vehicle traffic routing system using ant-based algorithm	JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Green Vehicle Traffic Routing System; Ant-based Algorithm; Vehicular Networks; Vehicle Congestion Problem; Fuel Consumption; Air Pollution	FUEL CONSUMPTION; COLONY OPTIMIZATION; ALTERNATIVE FUELS; EMISSIONS; CHOICE; ENERGY	Vehicle traffic congestion leads to air pollution, driver frustration, and costs billions of dollars annually in fuel consumption. Finding a proper solution to vehicle congestion is a considerable challenge due to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the network topology of vehicular environments, especially in urban areas. Vehicle Traffic Routing Systems (VTRSs) are one of the most significant solutions for this problem. Although most of the existing VTRSs obtained promising results for reducing travel time or improving traffic flow, they cannot guarantee reduction of the traffic-related nuisances such as air pollution, noise, and fuel consumption. Hence, in this paper, we present a green VTRS that reduces fuel consumption and consequently CO2 emissions via ant-based algorithm combined with fuel consumption model. This VTRS is an Ant-based Vehicle Congestion Avoidance System (AVCAS) that uses Signalized Intersection Design and Research Aid (SIDRA) fuel consumption and emission model in its vehicle routing procedure. This approach is called AVCAS +SIDRA which utilizes various criterion such as average travel time, speed, distance, vehicle density along with road map segmentation to reduce fuel consumption as much as possible by finding the least congested shortest paths in order to reduce the vehicle traffic congestion and their pollutant emissions. The proposed approach is evaluated and validated through simulation environment and tools (i.e. NS-2, SUMO, TraNS). Experimental results conducted on three different scenarios (i.e. various vehicle densities, system usage rates and accident condition) considering average travel time, travel speed, travel distance and fuel consumption as evaluation metrics. The obtained results show that the AVCAS + SIDRA outperforms the existing approaches in terms of average travel time, average travel speed and fuel consumption rate, by an average of 25.5%, 19.5% and 17%, respectively. Consequently, our proposed green VTRS alleviates energy consumption as it is not only becoming scarce and expensive but also causing a dramatic climate change and emission. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	De Martinis, V; Weidmann, UA				De Martinis, Valerio; Weidmann, Ulrich A.			Definition of energy-efficient speed profiles within rail traffic by means of supply design models	RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS			English	Article						Railway systems; Energy efficiency; Supply design modelling	OPTIMIZATION	Nowadays, energy efficiency is a key requirement for railway systems in order to reduce operating costs. One of the main solutions for implementing energy efficiency is the optimization of train speed profiles to minimize tractive energy consumption. From a transportation systems point of view, the definition of optimized speed profiles should consider their possible impact on rail traffic flows, in order to evaluate their feasibility. To do so, an innovative optimization framework for the definition and the evaluation of energy efficient speed profiles, based on supply design modelling, is proposed. The framework operates on two levels: the first level generates energy efficient speed profiles with respect to timetable constraints, infrastructure characteristics and rolling stock features, and the second simulates these speed profiles on the rail network within the specific rail traffic conditions. Through this new integrated view, the evaluation of the proposed optimal speed profiles can fully take into account the operational requirements of the services, such as trains scheduling, absence of or small allowance for delays and respect for buffer times for passenger transfer at connecting stations. A numerical example based on a calibrated simulation model of the suburban S-Bahn S9 line that operates in the Canton of Zurich shows how energy efficient speed profiles can be defined considering the rail traffic influences, thus increasing the quality of the solutions.

The enabling applications have varied requirements such as low latency, specific forwarding patterns, and reliable data exchange between vehicles and infrastructure. Hence, a cross-layer architecture for vehicular applications should be defined according to the goals of the implementation, so as to consider proper routing and dissemination mechanisms, communication protocols, and the application's design and operation. Methods In this context, we propose the characterization of the upper layers of a safety-oriented Car-to-Car application. We propose a cross-layer application/network layer design for a Post Collision Notification (PCN) application, and by means of a coupled simulation model that combines the communication network with vehicular traffic flow, we assess the performance of the application design. Results Three main results can be derived from our work. First, the selected geocast protocol (DRG) shows to be an accurate protocol for safety applications and it may be a scalable routing mechanism for other applications. Second, that DRG is effective even for larger urban areas. And third, there is a reduction of acceleration and speed of the closest vehicles to the incident zone, which is a positive impact of the PCN application on the traffic flow. Conclusions Consequently, the proposed cross-layer architecture and the implementation of geocast routing has shown a suitable support and good performance for safety applications, and could be extended to other application on the Car-to-X domain.

This study is focused on the assessment of the interaction response of parallel tunnels, so this study uses the results from the simulation of two tunnels to illustrate a few observations that may aid in practical designs. In this article, simultaneous drilling of highway's twin tunnels is simulated by means of Finite Element Method (FEM) implemented in Plaxis program. So the treated subject appears in a setting of geotechnical where one can be to construct several tunnels sometimes in a ground of weak mechanical characteristics. The objective of this study is to simulate numerically the interaction effects caused by construction of two parallels tunnels. This is an important factor in the study of the total answer of the problem interaction between parallels underground works. The importance of the effects transmitted is function of several parameters as the type of the works, and the mechanical characteristics (tunnel size, depth, and the relative position between two tunnels, lining thickness...). This article describes numerical analyses of two parallels tunnels interaction. This study will be applied to a real case of a section tunnel T4 of the highway East-West (Algeria); the study presented below comprises a series of numerical simulations of two tunnels using the computer program Plaxis which is used in the analyses is based on Finite Element Method.

J	Li, D; Ranjitkar, P				Li, Duo; Ranjitkar, Prakash			A fuzzy logic-based variable speed limit controller	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						variable speed limits; logic tree; fuzzy logic; AIMSUN	CONTROL STRATEGY; TRAFFIC-FLOW; SAFETY; IMPACTS	Variable speed limit (VSL) is an emerging intelligent transportation system (ITS) measure to improve operational and safety performance of motorway systems. Rule-based algorithms have been widely used in VSL applications because of their comprehensibility and ease of application. However, most of the algorithms proposed in the literature under this category are rather rough for the speed control. Pre-specified rules show some difficulties in appropriately activating/deactivating control actions in real time because of non-stationary and nonlinear nature of the traffic system. This paper proposes a fuzzy logic-based VSL control algorithm as an alternative to the existing VSL control algorithms. The proposed algorithm uses fuzzy sets instead of crisp sets to allow the separation of attribute domains into several overlapping intervals. The discretization using fuzzy sets can help to overcome the sensitivity problem caused by crisp discretization used in the existing VSL algorithms. The proposed algorithm is assessed for a test bed in Auckland using AIMSUN micro-simulator and verified against a well-known VSL algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing one to improve the efficiency performance of the motorway system with the critical bottleneck capacity increased by 6.42% and total travel time reduced by 12.39% when compared to a no-control scenario.

Most existing research focuses on methodologies to improve prediction accuracy. However, applications of different forecast models have not been adequately studied yet. This research compares the performance of three representative prediction models with real-life data in Beijing. They are autoregressive integrated moving average, neutral network, and nonparametric regression. The results suggest that nonparametric regression significantly outperforms the other models. With Wilcoxon signed-rank test, the root mean square errors and the error distribution reveal that the nonparametric regression model experiences superior accuracy. In addition, the nonparametric regression model exhibits the best spatial-transferred application effect.

In this article, a fuzzy cellular automata (FCA) model, which incorporates traditional cellular automata (CA) and fuzzy logic (FL), is developed to simulate the decision-making process and estimate the effect of driving behavior on traffic performance. Different from existing models and applications, the proposed FCA model utilizes fuzzy interface systems (FISs) and membership functions to simulate the cognition system of individual drivers. Four FISs are defined for each decision-making process: car-following, lane-changing, amber-running, and right-turn filtering. A field observation study is conducted to calibrate membership functions of input factors, model parameters, and to validate the proposed FCA model. Simulation experiments of a two-lane system show that the proposed FCA model is able to replicate decision-making processes and estimate the effect on overall traffic performance.

J	Ponnu, B; Coifman, B				Ponnu, Balaji; Coifman, Benjamin			Speed-spacing dependency on relative speed from the adjacent lane: New insights for car following models	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Traffic flow theory; Car following; Fundamental relationship; Speed-spacing relationship; Loop detectors; HOV operations	CHANGE MANEUVERS; DYNAMICAL MODEL; FLOW; INFORMATION	This paper examines the traffic dynamics underlying a recently observed phenomenon, the so called "sympathy of speeds" whereby a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane seemingly exhibits lower vehicular capacity and lower flow at speeds throughout the congested regime compared to the adjacent general purpose (GP) lanes. Unlike previous studies this paper examines a time-of-day HOV lane. During the non-HOV periods the study lane reverts to a GP lane, thereby providing a control condition for the specific lane and location. This work uses the single vehicle passage (svp) method to group vehicle passages before measuring the traffic state and extends the svp to bin vehicles in the study lane based on the relative speed to the adjacent lane. The extended svp method allows the work to also study the impacts during the non-HOV periods when the study lane serves GP vehicles. This work finds that: (1) during the non-HOV periods the study lane exhibited behavior indistinguishable from the adjacent GP lane. (2) The sympathy of speeds persists throughout the day, even when the study lane serves GP vehicles. (3) The relative speed to the adjacent lane provided a better predictor of behavior than whether or not the HOV restriction is active. In short, the car following behavior that gives rise to the sympathy of speeds is unrelated to the HOV restriction per se, persisting under GP operations as well.. This dependency on the relative speed in the adjacent lane is an important finding given the fact that most existing car following models assume that the longitudinal acceleration of a following vehicle is strictly a function of the relationship to the leading vehicle in the same lane. Because drivers in general adopt a larger spacing when faced with a high differential in speed between lanes means that car following behavior also depends on the relative speed to the adjacent lane. This fact has likely gone unnoticed to date because generally the conditions that give rise to a differential in speeds between lanes are usually short lived, and thus, do not become apparent in conventional macroscopic data except under exceptional circumstances that include confounding factors like HOV operations.

J	Huang, BX; Pan, ZK; Wang, GD				Huang, Baoxiang; Pan, Zhenkuan; Wang, Guodong			A methodology to control urban traffic noise under the constraint of environmental capacity: A case study of a double-decision optimization model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Traffic noise; Environmental capacity; Double decisibn optimization; Noise control zone	BILEVEL PROGRAMMING PROBLEM; ABATEMENT; ROAD; CITY; ALGORITHMS; ASSIGNMENT; FRAMEWORK; POLLUTION; IMPACT	This paper presents a novel methodology to control urban traffic noise under the constraint of environmental capacity. Considering the upper limits of noise control zones as the major bottleneck to control the maximum traffic flow is a new idea. The urban road network traffic is the mutual or joint behavior of public self-selection and management decisions, so is a typical double decision optimization problem. The proposed methodology incorporates theoretically model specifications. Traffic noise calculation model and traffic assignment model for O-D matrix are integrated based on bi-level programming method which follows an iterated process to obtain the optimal solution. The upper level resolves the question of how to sustain the maximum traffic flow with noise capacity threshold in a feasible road network. The user equilibrium method is adopted in the lower layer to resolve the O-D traffic assignment. The methodology has been applied to study area of QingDao, China. In this illustrative case, the noise pollution level values of optimal solution could satisfy the urban environmental noise capacity constraints. Moreover, the optimal solution was intelligently adjusted rather than simply reducing the value below a certain threshold. The results indicate that the proposed methodology is feasible and effective, and it can provide a reference for a sustainable development and noise control management of the urban traffic.

J	Ahmad, A; Rastogi, R; Chandra, S				Ahmad, Abdullah; Rastogi, Rajat; Chandra, Satish			Estimation of critical gap on a roundabout by minimizing the sum of absolute difference in accepted gap data	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						gap acceptance; critical gap; roundabout; mixed traffic		Estimation of critical gap for a vehicle type under mixed traffic conditions prevailing in developing countries has been always a challenging task. This is due to the poor lane discipline and very limited priority being followed by the vehicles at priority intersections like roundabouts. A simple procedure, which is based on minimization of the sum of absolute difference between a gap value and accepted or rejected gap, is proposed in this paper. The iterative procedure provides a value of gap that is termed as the critical gap under mixed traffic conditions. The method is different from maximum likelihood method (MLM) in two aspects. First, it does not assume any predefined distribution for the critical gap and second, it does not fail even if there is no rejection of gaps which is very common under limited (or no) priority conditions. Field data are collected at a roundabout in India. Prominent methods available in literature to estimate critical gap are compared for different categories of vehicles. Based on the results of consistency test, the MLM and the proposed method are found to be the most acceptable estimation methods. It has been further observed that the proposed method is better than MLM when working with low sample size, as well as, in no-priority conditions, which arise due to heterogeneous traffic flow prevailing in developing countries. The results are validated on another roundabout having similar physical features.

J	Dell'Acqua, P; Bellotti, F; Berta, R; De Gloria, A				Dell'Acqua, Pietro; Bellotti, Francesco; Berta, Riccardo; De Gloria, Alessandro			Time-Aware Multivariate Nearest Neighbor Regression Methods for Traffic Flow Prediction	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Traffic flow prediction; nearest neighbor regression; multivariate analysis; context awareness; pattern recognition algorithm; Bayesian networks	ARIMA	Traffic flow prediction is a fundamental functionality of intelligent transportation systems. After presenting the state of the art, we focus on nearest neighbor regression methods, which are data-driven algorithms that are effective yet simple to implement. We try to strengthen their efficacy in two ways that are little explored in literature, i.e., by adopting a multivariate approach and by adding awareness of the time of the day. The combination of these two refinements, which represents a novelty, leads to the definition of a new class of methods that we call time-aware multivariate nearest neighbor regression (TaM-NNR) algorithms. To assess this class, we have used publicly available traffic data from a California highway. Computational results show the effectiveness of such algorithms in comparison with state-of-the-art parametric and non-parametric methods. In particular, they consistently perform better than their corresponding standard univariate versions. These facts highlight the importance of context elements in traffic prediction. The ideas presented here may be further investigated considering more context elements (e.g., weather conditions), more complex road topologies (e.g., urban networks), and different types of prediction methods.

J	Reilly, J; Bayen, AM				Reilly, Jack; Bayen, Alexandre M.			Distributed Optimization for Shared State Systems: Applications to Decentralized Freeway Control via Subnetwork Splitting	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Decentralized control; distributed algorithms; optimal control; traffic control	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW	Optimal control problems on dynamical systems are concerned with finding a control policy, which minimizes a desired objective, where the objective value depends on the future evolution of the system ( the state of the system), which, in turn, depends on the control policy. For systems which contain subsystems that are disjoint across the state variables, distributed optimization techniques exist, which iteratively update subsystems concurrently and then exchange information between subsystems with shared control variables. This article presents a method, based on the asynchronous alternating directions method of multiplier algorithm, which extends these techniques to subsystems with shared control and state variables, while maintaining similar communication structure. The method is used as the basis for splitting network flow control problems into many subnetwork control problems with shared boundary conditions. The decentralized and parallel nature of the method permits high scalability with respect to the size of the network. For highly nonconvex applications, an efficient method, based on adjoint gradient computations, is presented for solving subproblems with shared state. The method is applied to decentralized, coordinated ramp metering and variable speed limit control on a realistic freeway network model using distributed model predictive control.

This makes it inevitable to increase the capacity of passages and to devote more space to off-street parking spots. The present study aims at finding the most suitable sites for public parking lots in one of the most crowded cities of western Iran. Before the site selection process is getting started, the area required for construction of new parking lots was estimated using Parking Generation Method. Afterwards, site selection criteria including "distance from travel absorber centers", "distance from passages", "the cost of real estate", and "suitable land uses for parking lots" were determined while "unsuitable land uses for public parking spaces" such as historical monuments were recognized as a constraint factor and excluded from being further analyzed. The selected criteria were then weighted using pair wise comparisons. The map layers were finally overlaid once by Boolean Method. Since the selected spots on the output map had not adequate distribution throughout the study area, the overlaying was done once again by fuzzy Ordered Weighted Average (OWA) by which a total number of four spots were recognized suitable for public parking lots in the city.

OPTIMA AND EQUILIBRIA FOR TRAFFIC FLOW ON NETWORKS WITH BACKWARD PROPAGATING QUEUES	NETWORKS AND HETEROGENEOUS MEDIA			English	Article						Traffic flows; network of roads; scalar conservation laws; global optima; Nash equilibria	DYNAMIC USER EQUILIBRIUM; NASH EQUILIBRIA; MODEL; INTERSECTIONS; EXISTENCE; WAVES; ROADS	This paper studies an optimal decision problem for several groups of drivers on a network of roads. Drivers have different origins and destinations, and different costs, related to their departure and arrival time. On each road the flow is governed by a conservation law, while intersections are modeled using buffers of limited capacity, so that queues can spill backward along roads leading to a crowded intersection. Two main results are proved: (i) the existence of a globally optimal solution, minimizing the sum of the costs to all drivers, and (ii) the existence of a Nash equilibrium solution, where no driver can lower his own cost by changing his departure time or the route taken to reach destination.

A DESTINATION-PRESERVING MODEL FOR SIMULATING WARDROP EQUILIBRIA IN TRAFFIC FLOW ON NETWORKS	NETWORKS AND HETEROGENEOUS MEDIA			English	Article						Traffic; networks; source-destination model; multi-path model; multi-population model; multi-commodity model; Wardrop equilibrium; Nash equilibrium	NONCOOPERATIVE DIFFERENTIAL-GAMES; TO-USE ALGORITHM; SHORTEST-PATH; TRANSPORTATION; OPTIMIZATION; CONGESTION; JUNCTION; OPTIMA; CROWDS; WAVES	In this paper we propose a LWR-like model for traffic flow on networks which allows to track several groups of drivers, each of them being characterized only by their destination in the network. The path actually followed to reach the destination is not assigned a priori, and can be chosen by the drivers during the journey, taking decisions at junctions. The model is then used to describe three possible behaviors of drivers, associated to three different ways to solve the route choice problem: 1. Drivers ignore the presence of the other vehicles; 2. Drivers react to the current distribution of traffic, but they do not forecast what will happen at later times; 3. Drivers take into account the current and future distribution of vehicles. Notice that, in the latter case, we enter the field of differential games, and, if a solution exists, it likely represents a global equilibrium among drivers. Numerical simulations highlight the differences between the three behaviors and offer insights into the existence of equilibria.

Focussing on main traffic-related pollutants (CO, NO, NO2, NOx and PM10), two typical urban road configurations were analysed: a street canyon and an open road. In addition to traffic flows, basic meteorological parameters were considered: wind speed, air temperature and relative humidity. The influence of all drivers by period of the year and day of the week was analysed with correlation analysis, while a statistical model was developed to predict concentrations at traffic stations by using predictors as urban background concentrations, traffic flows and a site-specific constant. Trained on a 1-year period (2008), the model was validated over an independent 1-year period (2007). The highest correlation of urban traffic concentrations was found vs. background concentrations, markedly for PM10 (r=0.85-0.87). The influence of road traffic was the highest for NO2 (r=0.51-0.58) and the lowest for PM10 (r=0.36-0.40). Urban-scale poor advection conditions proved to affect PM10 peak levels more significantly than local traffic increase. For all pollutants, good forecasting capability was achieved by the developed statistical model, generally performing better at the street canyon (r=0.79-0.86) than at the open road (r=0.72-0.82).

J	Xu, CC; Liu, P; Wang, W; Li, ZB				Xu, Chengcheng; Liu, Pan; Wang, Wei; Li, Zhibin			Safety performance of traffic phases and phase transitions in three phase traffic theory	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Traffic flow; Three phase traffic theory; Crash likelihood; Freeway; Phase transition	MIXED LOGIT; CRASH; IMPACTS; WEATHER; FLOW	Crash risk prediction models were developed to link safety to various phases and phase transitions defined by the three phase traffic theory. Results of the Bayesian conditional logit analysis showed that different traffic states differed distinctly with respect to safety performance. The random-parameter logit approach was utilized to account for the heterogeneity caused by unobserved factors. The Bayesian inference approach based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method was used for the estimation of the random-parameter logit model. The proposed approach increased the prediction performance of the crash risk models as compared with the conventional logit model. The three phase traffic theory can help us better understand the mechanism of crash occurrences in various traffic states. The contributing factors to crash likelihood can be well explained by the mechanism of phase transitions. We further discovered that the free flow state can be divided into two sub-phases on the basis of safety performance, including a true free flow state in which the interactions between vehicles are minor, and a platooned traffic state in which bunched vehicles travel in successions. The results of this study suggest that a safety perspective can be added to the three phase traffic theory. The results also suggest that the heterogeneity between different traffic states should be considered when estimating the risks of crash occurrences on freeways. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

For this study, a MATLAB-based software tool, real EV cycle (REV-cycle) analyzer, is developed. The real-world driving data are recorded from the I-80 highway, CA, USA. In this study, driving cycles are classified into three styles as aggressive, mild, and gentle driving based on their average acceleration. Also, two standard driving cycles (EUDC and HWFET) are simulated by the software and the results are compared. The results show that the real driving cycles are very different from the standard cycles. Also, it is observed that the traffic flow affects the driving style, as the drivers tend to drive more aggressive during the light traffic hours of the highway, while the heavy traffic limits the driver's aggressive behavior. On the other hand, the driving style has considerable effect on the energy consumption and the battery aging. The aggressive driving style demands higher average power from the battery compared to the mild and gentle driving style. From the aging point of view, the aggressive driving style leads to higher Crate demand from the battery and it expedited the capacity fade process compared to the mild and gentle driving styles.

Wireless communication is a fundamental building block: It is needed to manage and maintain the platoons. To keep the system stable, strict constraints in terms of update frequency and communication reliability must be met. We investigate different communication strategies by explicitly taking into account the requirements of the controller, exploiting synchronized communication slots, and transmit power adaptation. As a baseline, we compared the proposed approaches to two state-of-the-art adaptive beaconing protocols that have been designed for cooperative awareness applications, namely, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) Decentralized Congestion Control (DCC) and Dynamic Beaconing (DynB). Our simulation models have been parameterized and validated by means of real-world experiments. Our results demonstrate that the combination of synchronized communication slots with transmit power adaptation is perfectly suited for cooperative driving applications, even on very crowded freeway scenarios.

J	Cuniasse, PA; Buisson, C; Rodriguez, J; Teboul, E; de Almeida, D				Cuniasse, Pierre-Antoine; Buisson, Christine; Rodriguez, Joaquin; Teboul, Emmanuel; de Almeida, David			Analyzing railroad congestion in a dense urban network through the use of a road traffic network fundamental diagram concept	PUBLIC TRANSPORT			English	Article						Railroad; Mass transit; Congestion; Line fundamental diagram		Transilien, the SNCF branch in charge of operating the main urban railroad network in the area of Paris, faces a regular increase of passenger flows. The planning of railway operations is made carefully through simulation runs which help to assess the timetable stability. However, many disturbances appear and cause train delays. Due to the nature of the railroad network those delays are cumulative and an on-line update of the timetable is not always successful in maintaining the trains schedules. In this tensed context, operators are searching solutions to enhance the use of the infrastructure capacity and achieve a better service quality. A needed step towards this objective is a better understanding of the phenomena of disruptions, in particular because the expansion of congestion is so far not clearly understood. This paper explores the possibility to transpose a traffic flow theory tool, the network fundamental diagram, in the field of dense railroad traffic. Railroad traffic is different from road traffic in many ways: railways are a planned system, traffic volume does not satisfy the continuum hypothesis, stations force stops and the signalization system brings a discrete behavior. Despite those big differences we show how to build a similar tool for a railroad system, the Line Fundamental Diagram (LFD), and how to interpret some obtained shapes for those diagrams. These diagrams give us some means to compare plan and reality. We also identify the limits that have to be overcome to take benefits of the road traffic tools in railroad traffic analysis.

J	Sun, J; Ma, ZA; Li, TA; Niu, DN				Sun, Jian; Ma, Zian; Li, Tienan; Niu, Dening			Development and application of an integrated traffic simulation and multi-driving simulators	SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY			English	Article						Driving simulator; Traffic simulation; Integration; Traffic flow; Experiment	GAP ACCEPTANCE; BEHAVIOR; IMPACT	Professional virtual reality experiment tools, including driving simulators and traffic simulators, have their strengths and weaknesses. The integration of the two simulators will enhance the ability of both traffic modeling and driving simulation and present a new area of applications. This paper develops, implements, and validates an experimental platform that integrated a traffic simulator with multiple driving simulators (TSMDS). As a connected multi-user framework that allows multiple drivers who are simultaneously handling many driving simulators, it not only allows driver behavior experiments to be more accurate, controlled, and versatile but also simulates special driving behavior or multi-vehicle interactions under more realistic traffic flow environments. To validate the performance of TSMDS, 27 drivers were recruited to attend the lane changing experiments at a recurring on-ramp bottleneck and left-turn experiments at a two-phase signalized intersection in Shanghai. Both experiments required several drivers to drive the TSMDS and fulfill several complicated lane changing/crossing behaviors through their interaction. The results show that both the participants' response and lane changing/crossing data that were obtained from the experiment are consistent with the field observation, which confirms the validity of the integrated platform.

Correlation velocities in heterogeneous bidirectional cellular automata traffic flow	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Cellular Automata; Bi-directional; Correlations velocity; Traffic flow; Inter-lane VCC; Intra-lane VCC	FUNDAMENTAL-DIAGRAM; 2-LANE ROADWAY; MODEL; RULES; TRANSITION; JAM	Traffic flow behavior and velocity correlation in a bidirectional two lanes road are studied using Cellular Automata (CA) model within a mixture of fast and slow vehicles. The behaviors of the Inter-lane and Intra-lane Velocity Correlation Coefficients (V.C.C.) due to the interactions between vehicles in the same lane and the opposite lane as a function of the density are investigated. It is shown that high densities in one lane lead to large cluster in the second one, which decreases the Intra-lane velocity correlations and thereby form clusters in the opposite lane. Moreover, we have found that there is a critical density over which the Inter-lane V.C.C. occurs, but below which no Inter-lane V.C.C. happens. The spatiotemporal diagrams correspond to those regions are derived numerically. Furthermore, the effect of the overtaking probability in one lane on the Intra-lane V.C.C. in the other lane is also investigated. It is shown that the decrease of the overtaking probability in one lane decreases slightly the Intra-lane V.C.C. at intermediate density regimes in the other lane, which improves the current, as well as the Inter-lane V.C.C. decreases.

J	Muller, S; Schiller, C				Mueller, Stephan; Schiller, Christian			Improvement of the volume-delay function by incorporating the impact of trucks on traffic flow	TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Transportation modelling; volume-delay function; correlation function; volume-delay modelling; truck impact; Germany; North America		In current transportation modelling, travel time is the most important factor in decisions regarding transport modes, destinations and routes. The calculation of travel time is deployed by volume-delay functions (VDFs), a sub-model of route assignment procedure, using the correlation between increasing numbers of vehicles on a road and the road's restrictive capacity. By investigating existing VDFs, a clear gap is seen, demonstrating that current functions are not suited to reflect the empirically known large impact of trucks on passenger car travel times. This issue becomes crucial when transport models are used to reflect future scenarios where goods transportation is expected to increase greatly, and when transport models combine passenger and commercial traffic. This paper presents a new VDF which successfully includes trucks' impact on traffic flow in the case of Germany and, with slight deviations, for North America. The function is developed using ideal-type data for German motorways. The differences between German and US data and their implications for VDFs are also discussed.

These real-time crash risk prediction models are constructed by associating crash data with the real-time traffic surveillance data (e.g., collected by loop detectors). The main objective of this article is to develop a real-time risk model that will potentially be utilized within traffic management systems. This model aims to predict the likelihood of crash occurrence on motorways.Methods: In this study, the potential prediction variables are confined to traffic-related characteristics. Given that the dependent variable (i.e., traffic safety condition) is dichotomous (i.e., no-crash or crash), a rule-based approach is considered for model development. The performance of rule-based classifiers is further compared with the more conventional techniques like binary logistic regression and decision trees. The crash and traffic data used in this study were collected between June 2009 and December 2011 on a part of the E313 motorway in Belgium between Geel-East and Antwerp-East exits, on the direction toward Antwerp.Results: The results of analysis show that several traffic flow characteristics such as traffic volume, average speed, and standard deviation of speed at the upstream loop detector station and the difference in average speed on upstream and downstream loop detector stations significantly contribute to the crash occurrence prediction. The final chosen classifier is able to predict 70% of crash occasions accurately, and it correctly predicts 90% of no-crash instances, indicating a 10% false alarm rate.Conclusions: The findings of this study can be used to predict the likelihood of crash occurrence on motorways within dynamic safety management systems.

J	Li, X; Sun, JQ				Li, Xiang; Sun, Jian-Qiao			Studies of vehicle lane-changing to avoid pedestrians with cellular automata	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic system; Vehicle lane-changing; Vehicle pedestrian interaction; Traffic fuel efficiency; Vehicle emissions; Cellular automata	MICRO-SIMULATION; TRAFFIC FLOW; NARROW CHANNEL; BEHAVIOR; MODEL; CROSSWALK; EMISSIONS	This paper presents studies of interactions between vehicles and crossing pedestrians. A cellular automata system model of the traffic is developed, which includes a number of subsystem models such as the single-lane vehicle model, pedestrian model, interaction model and lane-changing model. The random street crossings of pedestrians are modeled as a Poisson process. The drivers of the passing vehicles are assumed to follow a safety-rule in order not to hit the pedestrians. The results of both single and multiple car simulations are presented. We have found that in general, the traffic can benefit from vehicle lane-changing to avoid road-crossing pedestrians. The traffic flow and average vehicle speed can be increased, which leads to higher traffic efficiency. The interactions between vehicles and pedestrians are reduced, which results in shorter vehicle decelerating time due to pedestrians and less switches of the driving mode, thus leads to the better energy economy. The traffic safety can be improved in the perspective of both vehicles and pedestrians. Finally, pedestrians can cross road faster. The negative effect of lane-changing is that pedestrians have to stay longer between the lanes in the crossing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A microscopic stochastic three-phase traffic model of the nucleation of spontaneous traffic breakdown presented in the article explains the empirical findings. It turns out that in the most cases a nucleus for the breakdown occurs through an interaction of one of waves in free flow with an empirical permanent speed disturbance localized at a highway bottleneck. The wave is a localized structure in free flow, in which the total flow rate is larger and the speed averaged across the highway is smaller than outside the wave. The waves in free flow appear due to oscillations in the percentage of slow vehicles; these waves propagate with the average speed of slow vehicles in free flow.

J	Faccio, M; Gamberi, M				Faccio, Maurizio; Gamberi, Mauro			New City Logistics Paradigm: From the "Last Mile" to the "Last 50 Miles" Sustainable Distribution	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						eco-logistic; city logistics; sustainable transportation; outsourcing; Pedemontana Veneta	TRANSPORT; MODEL	The distribution of goods in urban areas, together with private traffic flows, are among the main sources of energy consumption, air pollution and noise. As a consequence, in the 2000s, several EU cities started to implement logistical solutions for the sustainable city. In this context, this study addresses the implementation of a new eco-logistic system, which serves multiple adjacent cities by using electric vehicles to deliver goods of any type within their urban areas. This paper describes the results of a project developed in the province of Vicenza (northern Italy) and covering the main cities (Bassano del Grappa, Thiene, Schio and Valdagno) in the foothills (the so-called Pedemontana Veneta zone). The eco-logistic system aims to cover the last 50 miles of distribution (typical area of an Italian province) with a centralised platform that performs green deliveries with electric vehicles from/to the downtown areas. A preliminary and extensive "on field" analysis by means of door-to-door questionnaires was conducted to identify the performance required by the eco-logistic system. Therefore, the design of such a distribution system is performed to assess and define the conditions that make this solution profitable from both the economic and the environmental perspective.

J	Cao, JL; Shi, ZK				Cao, Jin-Liang; Shi, Zhong-Ke			A Novel Lattice Model on a Gradient Road With the Consideration of Relative Current	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND NONLINEAR DYNAMICS			English	Article							TRAFFIC FLOW MODEL; VELOCITY DIFFERENCE MODEL; MODIFIED KDV EQUATION; JAMMING TRANSITION; HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL; THEORETICAL-ANALYSIS; NONLINEAR-ANALYSIS; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; DENSITY WAVES; TDGL	In this paper, a novel lattice model on a single-lane gradient road is proposed with the consideration of relative current. The stability condition is obtained by using linear stability theory. It is shown that the stability of traffic flow on the gradient road varies with the slope and the sensitivity of response to the relative current: when the slope is constant, the stable region increases with the increasing of the sensitivity of response to the relative current; when the sensitivity of response to the relative current is constant, the stable region increases with the increasing of the slope in uphill and decreases with the increasing of the slope in downhill. A series of numerical simulations show a good agreement with the analytical result and show that the sensitivity of response to the relative current is better than the slope in stabilizing traffic flow and suppressing traffic congestion. By using nonlinear analysis, the Burgers, Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), and modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equations are derived to describe the triangular shock waves, soliton waves, and kink-antikink waves in the stable, metastable, and unstable region, respectively, which can explain the phase transitions from free traffic to stop-and-go traffic, and finally to congested traffic. One conclusion is drawn that the traffic congestion on the gradient road can be suppressed efficiently by introducing the relative velocity.

Capacity uncertainty on urban road networks: A critical state and its applicability in resilience quantification	COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS			English	Article						Urban road network; Capacity uncertainty; Network resilience; Minimax optimization; Genetic algorithm	DEGRADABLE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS; EQUILIBRIUM TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT; GAME-THEORY; RELIABILITY; VULNERABILITY	There are many aspects of urban transportation that represent sources of uncertainty in the design of roadways, such as the level of capacity needed to ensure efficient traffic flow. As a result of uncertainty in roadway capacity, an urban road network can be deemed to operate at different Capacity levels. Some of these levels will have unused capacity, whereas some others will not be enough to cater traffic from all origins to all destinations. Past models assume knowledge over the pattern of these uncertainties. However, it is difficult to gather such knowledge from field observations, and it is absent for majority of the world's urban areas. We present an alternative methodology in which the capacities are considered as variables that can take any value from zero to a practically realizable maximum. Using a minimax optimization formulation, we determine bounds on urban roadway capacity levels, below which the traffic demand will go unmet. We call this the critical state, and define it as a state of link capacities which effects in the maximum irreducible operational cost on the network with the demand getting fulfilled. We prove that at a critical state, the total travel time ( or cost) of the system will be a unique value; i.e. for a given urban road network and a given traffic demand, there is an associated unique critical travel time. We illustrate that this unique travel time which is an aggregate value of the travel times from all roads on the network can be used as a benchmark to create various metrics for the urban road network. As an illustrative example on the applicability of critical state, we compare the unique travel time with the best possible travel time on the network, and develop a metric for network resilience. Network resilience is calculated as a normalized difference of the critical and best operation costs. Two-space genetic algorithm is used to solve the problem formulation. The formulation and the solution methodology are illustrated on test networks and results are presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Bhavathrathan, B.

J	Omer, I; Jiang, B				Omer, Itzhak; Jiang, Bin			Can cognitive inferences be made from aggregate traffic flow data?	COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS			English	Article						Urban movement; Cognitive distance; Network analysis; Space syntax; Agent-based simulation	AGENT-BASED SIMULATION; PEDESTRIAN MOVEMENT; SPACE SYNTAX; URBAN; ENVIRONMENT	Space syntax analysis or the topological analysis of street networks has illustrated that human traffic flow is highly correlated with some topological centrality measures, implying that human movement at an aggregate level is primarily shaped by the underlying topological structure of street networks. However, this high correlation does not imply that any individual's movement can be predicted by any street network centrality measure. In other words, traffic flow at the aggregate level cannot be used to make inferences about an individual's spatial cognition or conceptualization of space. Based on a set of agent-based simulations using three types of moving agents - to-pological, angular, and metric - we show that topological-angular centrality measures correlate better than does the metric centrality measure with the aggregate flows of agents who choose the shortest angular, topological or metric routes. We relate the superiority of the topological-angular network effects to the structural relations holding between street network to-movement and through-movement potentials. The study findings indicate that correlations between aggregate flow and street network centrality measures cannot be used to infer knowledge about individuals' spatial cognition during urban movement (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Lateral placement of U-turns at median openings on six-lane divided urban roads	TRANSPORTATION LETTERS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH			English	Article						Traffic flow; U-turns; Median openings; Lateral placement; Heterogeneous traffic	MOVEMENT; CAPACITY; SPEED; DRIVERS	Study on lateral placement of U-turning vehicle is carried out by collecting data at 13 different median openings of six-lane divided roads. It was found that the lateral placement of "all the vehicles'' taking U-turn at median opening may be unimodal or bimodal. The unimodal distribution was described by normal distribution, whereas bimodal distribution was described separately by two different normal distributions; one for "only 2-W'' and other for "all the vehicles excluding 2-W.'' Equations were developed and parameters were calculated to describe a bimodal placement distribution curve. The issue of bimodality in placement was investigated statistically and the separation factor (S(r)) and placement factor (PF) were used to describe the issue. This study on the lateral placement of U-turning vehicles holds significance in the better estimation of conflicting traffic volume, which is essential for the correct estimation of the capacity of U-turns at median openings in mixed traffic condition.

However, despite its importance in developing congestion mitigation strategies, the understanding of this common traffic phenomenon in a city scale is still missing. An open question is how the traffic in the network collapses from a global efficient traffic to isolated local flows in small clusters, i.e. the question of traffic percolation. Here we study the traffic percolation properties on a lattice by simulation of an agent-based model for traffic. A critical traffic volume in this model distinguishes the free state from the congested state of traffic. Our results show that the threshold of traffic percolation decreases with increasing traffic volume and reaches a minimum value at the critical traffic volume. We show that this minimal threshold is the result of longest spatial correlation between traffic flows at the critical traffic volume. These findings may help to develop congestion mitigation strategies in a network view.

J	Kerner, BS				Kerner, B. S.			Failure of classical traffic flow theories: a critical review	ELEKTROTECHNIK UND INFORMATIONSTECHNIK			English	Review						empirical fundament of transportation science; traffic control and optimization; automatic driving; failure of classical traffic theories; three-phase traffic theory	PROBABILISTIC BREAKDOWN PHENOMENON; CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; ON-RAMP BOTTLENECKS; PHYSICS; PATTERNS; DYNAMICS; WAVES	We explain that the fundamental empirical basis for automatic driving, reliable control and optimization of traffic and transportation networks is the set of empirical features of traffic breakdown at a road bottleneck. We show why generally accepted traffic and transportation theories and models are not consistent with this empirical fundament of traffic science. In particular, these classical traffic theories are as follows: (i) the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) theory and traffic flow models in the framework of the LWR theory (for example, Daganzo's cell transmission model) that explain traffic breakdown through a fundamental diagram of traffic flow, (ii) General Motors (GM) class of traffic-flow models that explain traffic breakdown through traffic flow instability due to a driver reaction time (for example, the following well-known models belong to the GM model class: Gipps's model, Payne's model, Newell's optimal velocity (OV) model, Wiedemann's model (VISSIM traffic simulation tool), Bando et al. OV model, Treiber's Intelligent Driver Model, Krau beta model (SUMO tool), the Aw-Rascle model), (iii) the classical understanding of stochastic highway capacity, and (iv) Wardrop's principles for dynamic control, assignment, and optimization of traffic and transportation networks. In turn, this can explain why dynamics network optimization and control approaches based on these classical traffic flow theories failed by their applications in the real world. We discuss why rather that the assumption about the existence of stochastic highway capacity, at any time instant there should be the infinite number of highway capacities within a range of the flow rate between a minimum capacity and a maximum capacity as assumed in three-phase theory introduced by the author. Because the assumption about the infinite number of highway capacities is consistent with the set of the fundamental empirical features of traffic breakdown at highway bottlenecks, this can be considered a theoretical fundament for the development of reliable automatic driving, control and optimization of vehicular traffic and transportation networks. We discuss briefly some features of the three-phase theory explaining the empirical fundament of transportation science.	[Kerner, B.

The mechanism of interest is for a VSL system to prevent the bottleneck from being activated and thus avoid detrimental capacity drop that arises at the activated bottleneck. We firstly consider a VSL system installed along the freeway towards the bottleneck, which adjusts commuters' cruising speeds in a continuous fashion and essentially regulates the upstream flow into the bottleneck. By investigating the resulting departure-time equilibrium of commuters, we find the VSL system can eliminate the efficiency loss caused by capacity drop, and further bound its improvements on various performance measures. We then turn to a more practical VSL system, which adjusts commuters' cruising speeds in a discrete fashion. The conditions for such a system to improve various performance measures are established and its efficiencies are bounded. Based on empirical data, we conclude that the discrete VSL system can avoid or delay capacity drop associated with an active bottleneck and thus reduce queuing delay. It can help reduce the schedule delay cost and total emissions cost. However, it is unlikely for the system to reduce total travel time, individual travel cost and social cost in this particular setting. These results shed light on the effectiveness of VSL systems on realistic freeway networks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By exploiting a symmetry property of the stochastic MFD, whereby it exhibits identical probability distributions in free-flow and congestion, it is found that the network MFD depends mainly on two dimensionless parameters: the mean block length to green ratio and the mean red to green ratio. The theory is validated with an exact traffic simulation and with the empirical data from the city of Yokohama. It is also shown that the effect of buses can be approximated with the proposed theory by accounting for their effect in the red to green ratio parameter. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Jin, WL; Gan, QJ; Lebacque, JP				Jin, Wen-Long; Gan, Qi-Jian; Lebacque, Jean-Patrick			A kinematic wave theory of capacity drop	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Capacity drop characteristics; Kinematic wave theory; Continuous fundamental diagram; Discontinuous entropy condition; Riemann problem; Stability	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW MODEL; FREEWAY BOTTLENECKS; CONSERVATION-LAWS; LANE-DROP; HIGHWAY; NETWORK; RAMP; DENSITY; MERGE	Capacity drop at active bottlenecks is one of the most puzzling traffic phenomena, but a thorough understanding of its mechanism is critical for designing variable speed limit and ramp metering strategies. In this study, within the framework of the kinematic wave theory, we propose a simple model of capacity drop based on the observation that capacity drop occurs when an upstream queue forms at an active bottleneck. Different from existing models, the new model still uses continuous fundamental diagrams but employs an entropy condition defined by a discontinuous boundary flux function, which introduces a traffic state-dependent capacity constraint. For a lane-drop area, we demonstrate that the model is well-defined, and its Riemann problem can be uniquely solved. After deriving the flow-density relations upstream and downstream to a bottleneck location, we find that the model can replicate the following three characteristics of capacity drop: the maximum discharge flow-rate can be reached only when both upstream and downstream traffic conditions are uncongested, capacity drop occurs when the bottleneck is activated, and some steady traffic states cannot be observed at both locations. We show that the new model is bistable subject to perturbations in initial and boundary conditions. With empirical observations at a merging bottleneck we also verify the three characteristics of capacity drop predicted by the new model. Through this study, we establish that the new model is physically meaningful, conceptually simple, computationally efficient, and mathematically tractable. We finally discuss future extensions and potential applications of the new model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this article, a new cellular automaton model is proposed to simulate road construction traffic flow in urban two-way-six-lane network systems with roundabout intersections. In the proposed model, a three-lane traffic rule is adopted to represent vehicle movements on road sections, turning lane changing and overtaking lane changing are allowed, and vehicle movements in intersection areas are determined by priority which relies on vehicle position. Simulation results show that increasing the closed lane number may lead to decline of the network speed. We also found that there is a relatively fixed influence range of road construction in different cases, and a proper proportion of vehicle bypass can improve the operation efficiency of road network when semi-closed construction.

There were lots of results for the speed characteristics of motorized vehicles. In this article, we studied the speed distribution for mixed bicycle traffic which was ignored in the past. Field speed data were collected from Hangzhou, China, under different survey sites, traffic conditions, and percentages of electric bicycle. The statistics results of field data show that the total mean speed of electric bicycles is 17.09km/h, 3.63km/h faster and 27.0% higher than that of regular bicycles. Normal, log-normal, gamma, and Weibull distribution models were used for testing speed data. The results of goodness-of-fit hypothesis tests imply that the log-normal and Weibull model can fit the field data very well. Then, the relationships between mean speed and electric bicycle proportions were proposed using linear regression models, and the mean speed for purely electric bicycles or regular bicycles can be obtained. The findings of this article will provide effective help for the safety and traffic management of mixed bicycle traffic.

J	Reina, P; Ahn, S				Reina, Paulina; Ahn, Soyoung			On macroscopic freeway merge behavior: Estimation of merge ratios using asymmetric lane flow distribution	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Freeway merge; Merge ratio; Lane flow distribution; Merging principle	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; TRAFFIC-FLOW; CAPACITY; TIME	Data from several freeway merges reveal that, contrary to some previous findings, merge ratio can vary within a site with respect to the merge outflow and that the existing merge ratio estimates based on lane counts are not able to predict this within-site variation. Furthermore, the merge ratios estimated based on two well-known merging principles, "fair-share" and "zipper," are found to be inaccurate for merges where merging streams compete directly due to a lane drop. In light of these findings, we estimate merge ratios using lane flow distribution (LFD) to better predict between and within site variations of merge ratio. In addition, we propose a merging principle specific for merges with a single lane-drop. The model was developed to better represent observed non-uniform redistribution of merging flow not captured by the current merge ratio estimation methods and merging principles. Empirical observations show that the proposed methods are able to improve merge ratio estimates, reproduce within-site variations of merge ratio, and represent more accurately non-uniform redistribution of merging flow dependent on the merge geometry.

By analyzing video traffic data from a section of the Nanjing Airport Highway, it is found that traffic states inside hypercongestion are not homogeneous, which contradicts the existence of a "Homogeneous Congested Traffic" state claimed in two-phase traffic theory. Analysis of vehicle trajectories and velocities obtained from an experimental car-following study with a platoon of 25 vehicles also confirms the above findings. Furthermore, it is also found from the video traffic data that the structure of hypercongested traffic varies only slightly with location, which might be due to small jams inside hypercongested traffic merging into larger ones slowly and/or larger jams sometimes breaking into small ones. Finally, the implications of our observations on traffic modeling have been discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Status-prediction and routing services also rely on historical data and as such the accuracy of such predictions cannot be fully relied upon. This paper models the traffic control problem as a multi-agent-multi-purpose system (MAMP) inspired by ant colony optimisation (ACO). Traffic information is collected by the vehicles, rather than fixed roadside infrastructure in this system. Moreover, the information is collected and shared among the vehicles in a distributed manner. The proposed distributed intelligent traffic system (DITS) is implemented in NetLogo and experiments are conducted on two variations of the system, one with ACO, the other without ACO to investigate the impact of ACO on the solution to the traffic problem. Three performance parameters; average speed, average waiting time of vehicles and the average number of stopped vehicles are recorded and studied for different traffic densities and road topologies. The results have shown that for various initial distributions of vehicles, the ACO-strategy obtains higher average speeds, smaller average waiting times and number of stopped vehicles than the non-ACO-strategy. This observation holds for all experiments with different traffic densities and different road network topologies.

The existence and precise properties of the long time average of the flux (effective Hamiltonian) have been obtained. We also prove that the car density and flux eventually exhibit a periodic pattern in time. Its minimum period is the same as the cycle length when the cycle length is large, and might be an integer multiple (>= 2) of the cycle length when the cycle length is small.

J	Jin, PJ; Li, J; Ran, B				Jin, Peter J.; Li, Jia; Ran, Bin			The identification and empirical characterization of vehicular (Lagrangian) fundamental diagrams in multilane traffic flow	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						intelligent transport systems; speed; flow; density; transport and traffic systems analysis; transportation analysis	KINEMATIC WAVES; BOUNDARY-CONDITIONS; HIGHWAY	Traditional macroscopic traffic flow modeling framework adopts the spatial-temporal coordinate system to analyze traffic flow dynamics. With such modeling and analysis paradigm, complications arise for traffic flow data collected from mobile sensors such as probe vehicles equipped with mobile phones, Bluetooth, and Global Positioning System devices. The vehicle-based measurement technologies call for new modeling thoughts that address the unique features of moving measurements and explore their full potential. In this paper, we look into the concept of vehicular fundamental diagram (VFD) and discuss its engineering implications. VFD corresponds to a conventional fundamental diagram (FD) in the kinematic wave (KW) theory that adopts space-time coordinates. Similar to the regular FD in the KW theory, VFD encapsulates all traffic flow dynamics. In this paper, to demonstrate the full potential of VFD in interpreting multilane traffic flow dynamics, we generalize the classical Edie's formula and propose a direct approach of reconstructing VFD from traffic measurements in the vehicular coordinates. A smoothing algorithm is proposed to effectively reduce the nonphysical fluctuation of traffic states calculated from multilane vehicle trajectories. As an example, we apply the proposed methodology to explore the next-generation simulation datasets and identify the existence and forms of shock waves in different coordinate systems. Our findings provide empirical justifications and further insight for the Lagrangian traffic flow theory and models when applied in practice. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Adjoint-Based Optimization on a Network of Discretized Scalar Conservation Laws with Applications to Coordinated Ramp Metering	JOURNAL OF OPTIMIZATION THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Control of discretized PDEs; Network of hyperbolic conservation laws; Adjoint-based optimization; Transportation engineering; Ramp metering	DISCONTINUOUS SOLUTIONS; TRAFFIC FLOW; MODEL; WAVES	The adjoint method provides a computationally efficient means of calculating the gradient for applications in constrained optimization. In this article, we consider a network of scalar conservation laws with general topology, whose behavior is modified by a set of control parameters in order to minimize a given objective function. After discretizing the corresponding partial differential equation models via the Godunov scheme, we detail the computation of the gradient of the discretized system with respect to the control parameters and show that the complexity of its computation scales linearly with the number of discrete state variables for networks of small vertex degree. The method is applied to the problem of coordinated ramp metering on freeway networks. Numerical simulations on the I15 freeway in California demonstrate an improvement in performance and running time compared with existing methods. In the context of model predictive control, the algorithm is shown to be robust to noise in the initial data and boundary conditions.

J	Percoco, M				Percoco, Marco			Heterogeneity in the reaction of traffic flows to road pricing: a synthetic control approach applied to Milan	TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						Road pricing; Synthetic control; Traffic flows; Milan	LONDON CONGESTION CHARGE; TENTATIVE ECONOMIC APPRAISAL; PRUDHOMME; LESSONS; SCHEME; IMPACT; COST	Local governments are increasingly adopting road pricing schemes to curb pollution and congestion in the cities. Despite its popularity, few empirical studies have made an attempt to estimate the effectiveness of such interventions. The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of road pricing on traffic flows by means of a synthetic control approach which allows for a wide heterogeneity of treatment effects. By using a large sample of 75 types of vehicles entering the centre of Milan between 2008 and 2012, we evaluate the enforcement of the road pricing scheme occurred in January 2012 across 20 types of vehicles. We have found a large variation in the reaction of traffic flows and a significant effect in terms of vehicles reduction after pricing for cars and for some types of commercial vehicles. Interestingly and surprisingly, no effect is detected for vehicles whose access in the city centre was forbidden.

J	Li, SE; Deng, K; Zheng, Y; Peng, H				Li, Shengbo Eben; Deng, Kun; Zheng, Yang; Peng, Huei			Effect of Pulse-and-Glide Strategy on Traffic Flow for a Platoon of Mixed Automated and Manually Driven Vehicles	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; NEURAL-NETWORK MODEL; FUEL CONSUMPTION; CONTROL-SYSTEMS; TIME; STABILITY; MINIMIZE; IMPACT; STATES	The fuel consumption of ground vehicles is significantly affected by how they are driven. The fuel-optimized vehicular automation technique can improve fuel economy for the host vehicle, but their effectiveness on a platoon of vehicles is still unknown. This article studies the performance of a well-known fuel-optimized vehicle automation strategy, i.e., Pulse-and-Glide (PnG) operation, on traffic smoothness and fuel economy in a mixed traffic flow. The mixed traffic flow is assumed to be a single-lane highway on flat road consisting of both driverless and manually driven vehicles. The driverless vehicles are equipped with fuel economy-oriented automated controller using the PnG strategy. The manually driven vehicles are simulated using the Intelligent Driver Models (IDM) to mimic the average car-following behavior of human drivers in naturalistic traffics. A series of simulations are conducted with three scenarios, i.e., a single car, a car section, and a car platoon. The simulation results show that the PnG strategy can significantly improve the fuel economy of individual vehicles. For traffic flows, the fuel economy and traffic smoothness vary significantly under the PnG strategy.

Representing Traffic Congestions on Moving Objects Trajectories	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Moving objects; trajectories; road network; traffic flow; traffic congestion		The discovery of moving objects trajectory patterns representing a high traffic density have been covered on different works using diverse approaches. These models are useful for the areas of transportation planning, traffic monitoring and advertising on public roads. Besides of the important utility, these type of patterns usually do not specify a difference between a high traffic and a traffic congestion. In this work, we propose a model for the discovery of high traffic flow patterns and traffic congestions, represented in the same pattern. Also, as a complement, we present a model that discovers alternative paths to the severe traffic on these patterns. These proposed patterns could help to improve traffic allowing the identification of problems and possible alternatives.

This method can be used to describe and predict the nonlinear traffic phenomena on the highway from a system global stability perspective. Based on a recently proposed speed gradient continuum traffic flow model, the types and stabilities of the equilibrium solutions are discussed and the existence of Hopf bifurcation and saddle-node bifurcation is proved. Then various bifurcations such as Hopf bifurcation, saddle-node bifurcation, Limit Point bifurcation of cycles, Cusp bifurcation and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation are found and the traffic flow behaviors at some of them are analyzed. When the Hopf bifurcation is selected as the starting point of density temporal evolution, it may help to explain the stop-and-go traffic phenomena. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Link travel time with and without EBLs for two modes is analyzed with link stochastic degradation. Furthermore, route general travel costs are formulated with the uncertainty of link travel time for both modes and the uncertainty of waiting time at a bus stop and in-vehicle congestion costs for the bus mode. The uncertainty of bus waiting time is considered to be relevant to the degradation of the front links of the bus line. A bi-modal user equilibrium model incorporating travelers' risk adverse behavior is proposed for evaluating EBLs. Finally, two numerical examples are used to illustrate how the road degradation level, travelers' risk aversion level and the front link's correlation level with the uncertainty of the bus waiting time affect the results of the user equilibrium model with and without EBLs and how the road degradation level affects the optimal EBLs setting scheme. A paradox of EBLs setting is also illustrated where adding one exclusive bus lane may decrease share of bus. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The stability condition is obtained by using linear stability theory. The result shows that the traffic flow becomes stable with the decrease of friction coefficient and radius of the curved road. Using nonlinear analysis method, the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) and modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation are derived to describe soliton waves and the kink-antikink waves in the meta-stable region and unstable region, respectively. Numerical simulations are carried out and the results are consistent with the theoretical results.

The model is an extension of the speed gradient model by taking into account the lane changing. The new source and sink terms of lane change rate are added into the continuity equations and the speed dynamic equations to describe the lane-changing behavior. The result of the steady state analysis shows that our model can describe the lane usage inversion phenomenon. The numerical results demonstrate that the present model effectively reproduces several traffic phenomena observed in real traffic such as shock and rarefaction waves, stop-and-go waves and local clusters.

The noise generated by road traffic is more disturbing near junctions, where multiple flows are intersecting. It is largely accepted that converting a cross intersection into a roundabout the noise level will decrease. This article presents a study made on a hypothetic intersection, for two different configurations: signalized cross intersection and roundabout. The traffic flow data were detailed near and inside the intersection, using traffic flow speeds measured in real conditions, for passenger cars. The analysis was made using the noise mapping software LimA. The results show that there are differences in the resulted noise levels when the intersection is detailed and these differences may affect the measures that can be undertaken by the local authorities for noise abatement. In most cases even the changes in the road network should be preceded by such analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The current indicator of its performance, air traffic flow management delays, is insufficient for planning and management purposes. Topological analysis of ATNs of this kind has highlighted betweenness centrality (BC) as an indicator of network robustness, although such an indicator assumes no knowledge of actual traffic flows and the network's operational characteristics. This paper conducts topological and operational analyses of the European ATN in order to derive a more relevant and appropriate indicator of robustness. By applying a flow maximisation model to the network influenced by a range of capacity reductions at the local level, we propose a new index called the Relative Area Index (RAI). The RAI quantifies the importance of an individual node relevant to the performance of the entire network when it suffers from capacity reduction at a local scale. Air traffic data from three typical busy days in Europe are utilised to show that the RAI is more flexible and capable than BC in capturing the network impact of local capacity degradation. This index can be used to assess network robustness and provide a valuable tool for airspace managers and planners.

Distributions of air pollutants associated with oil and natural gas development measured in the Upper Green River Basin of Wyoming	ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE			English	Article							VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; RADIAL DIFFUSIVE SAMPLER; NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; OZONE POLLUTION; UINTAH BASIN; OPERATIONS; EMISSIONS; URBAN; HYDROCARBONS; METHANE	Diffusive sampler monitoring techniques were employed during wintertime studies from 2009 to 2012 to assess the spatial distribution of air pollutants associated with the Pinedale Anticline and Jonah Field oil and natural gas (O&NG) developments in the Upper Green River Basin, Wyoming. Diffusive sampling identified both the extent of wintertime ozone (O-3) episodes and the distributions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and a suite of 13 C-5+ volatile organic compounds (VOC), including BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene isomers), allowing the influence of different O&NG emission sources to be determined. Concentration isopleth mapping of both diffusive sampler and continuous O-3 measurements show the importance of localized production and advective transport. As for O-3, BTEX and NOx mixing ratios within O&NG development areas were elevated compared to background levels, with localized hotspots also evident. One BTEX hotspot was related to an area with intensive production activities, while a second was located in an area influenced by emissions from a water treatment and recycling facility. Contrastingly, NOx hotspots were at major road intersections with relatively high traffic flows, indicating influence from vehicular emissions. Comparisons of observed selected VOC species ratios at a roadside site in the town of Pinedale with those measured in O&NG development areas show that traffic emissions contribute minimally to VOCs in these latter areas. The spatial distributions of pollutant concentrations identified by diffusive sampling techniques have potential utility for validation of emission inventories that are combined with air quality modeling.

The linear stability condition and the mKdV equation which are correlative to the driver's anticipation effect with passing are derived from linear stability analysis and nonlinear analysis, respectively. Numerical simulation shows that the driver's anticipation effects with passing can efficiently enhance the stability of traffic flow under lane changing on two-lane highway.

J	Sun, YX; Leng, B; Guan, W				Sun, Yuxing; Leng, Biao; Guan, Wei			A novel wavelet-SVM short-time passenger flow prediction in Beijing subway system	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Passenger flow prediction; Daubechies4 wavelet; Least squares support vector machine; Beijing subway system	ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; EXTENDED KALMAN FILTER; TRAFFIC FLOW; OBJECT RETRIEVAL; DEMAND MODEL; TRAVEL; FIELD; REGRESSION; SPEEDS	In order to effectively manage the use of existing infrastructures and prevent the emergency caused by the large gathered crowd, the short-term passenger flow forecasting technology becomes more and more significant in the field of intelligent transportation system. However, there are few studies discussing how to predict different kinds of passenger flows in the subway system. In this paper, a novel hybrid model Wavelet-SVM is proposed, and it combines the complementary advantages of Wavelet and SVM models, and meanwhile overcomes their shortcomings respectively. The Wavelet-SVM forecasting approach consists of three important stages. The first stage decomposes the passenger flow data into different high frequency and low frequency series by wavelet. During the prediction stage, the SVM method is applied to learn and predict the corresponding high frequency and low frequency series. In the last stage, the diverse predicted sequences are reconstructed by wavelet. The experimental results show that the approach not only has the best forecasting performance compared with the state-of-theart techniques but also appears to be the most promising and robust based on the historical passenger flow data in Beijing subway system and several standard evaluation measures.

J	Peng, GH; Liu, CQ; Tuo, MX				Peng, Guanghan; Liu, Changqing; Tuo, Manxian			Influence of the traffic interruption probability on traffic stability in lattice model for two-lane freeway	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow; Lattice model; Optimal current difference; Traffic interruption probability	CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; MODIFIED KDV EQUATION; JAMMING TRANSITION; MACRO MODEL; FLOW; CONGESTION; ROAD	In this paper, a new lattice model is proposed with the traffic interruption probability term in two-lane traffic system. The linear stability condition and the mKdV equation are derived from linear stability analysis and nonlinear analysis by introducing the traffic interruption probability of optimal current for two-lane traffic freeway, respectively. Numerical simulation shows that the traffic interruption probability corresponding to high reaction coefficient can efficiently improve the stability of two-lane traffic flow as traffic interruption occurs with lane changing.

Prediction of traffic convective instability with spectral analysis of the Aw-Rascle-Zhang model	PHYSICS LETTERS A			English	Article						Second order models; Aw-Rascle-Zhang; Spectral Analysis; Linear Systems; Linearization of PDEs	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; 2ND-ORDER MODELS; SHOCK-WAVES; FLOW; APPROXIMATIONS; DIAGRAM; STATES	This article starts from the classical Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) model for freeway traffic and develops a spectral analysis of its linearized version. A counterpart to the Froude number in hydrodynamics is defined that enables a classification of the nature of vehicle traffic flow using the explicit solution resulting from the analysis. We prove that our linearization about an equilibrium is stable for congested regimes and unstable otherwise. NGSIM data for congested traffic trajectories is used so as to confront the linearized model's predictions to actual macroscopic behavior of traffic. The model is shown to achieve good accuracy for speed and flow. In particular, it accounts for the advection of oscillations on boundaries into the interior domain where the PDE under study is solved. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The presented algorithm extends the capability of a model predictive control (MPC) VSL model with the input of SMS derived from vehicle probes and their corresponding space-based densities, instead of spot-based densities and detector speeds. The developed probe-based VSL was evaluated on an 8-km stretch of Highway 2, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, using Paramics microsimulation software. The performance of the probe-based VSL algorithm was examined under various traffic conditions and probe vehicle parameters. The findings of the probe-based VSL analysis support previous findings taking input from point detectors and showing that the efficiency of the VSL strategies was efficient only for a limited range of traffic conditions. The results of the analysis show the effectiveness of developing advanced freeway control algorithms that use the main input parameters from vehicle probes. The performance of the probe-based VSL system was also comparable to, and in some cases outperformed, the point-based detector algorithm. However, the algorithm was shown to be effective only for a high frequency of information updates and under a relatively high percentage of vehicles probe penetration percentage.

Flows at a junction are determined by downstream supply of capacity as well as upstream demand of traffic wishing to flow through the junction. This approach is rooted in the celebrated Cell Transmission Model for freeway traffic flow. Unlike related results which rely on certain system cooperativity properties, our model generally does not possess these properties. We show that the lack of cooperativity is in fact a useful feature that allows traffic control methods, such as ramp metering, to be effective. Finally, we leverage the results of the technical note to develop a linear program for optimal ramp metering.

J	Ferm, M; Sjoberg, K				Ferm, Martin; Sjoberg, Karin			Concentrations and emission factors for PM2.5 and PM10 from road traffic in Sweden	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						PM10; PM2.5; Air dispersion; Gothenburg; Umea; Traffic-related air pollution	PARTICLE NUMBER; TAILPIPE EMISSIONS; AIRBORNE PARTICLES; RESUSPENSION; STREET; URBAN; PAVEMENT; DUST; WEAR; STOCKHOLM	PM10 concentrations exceed the guidelines in some Swedish cities and the limit values will likely be further reduced in the future. In order to gain more knowledge of emission factors for road traffic and concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5, existing monitoring stations in two cities, Gothenburg and Umea, with international E-road thoroughfares, were complemented with some PM2.5 measurements. Emission factors for PM10 and PM2.5 were estimated using NOx as a tracer. Monitoring data from kerbside and urban background sites in Gothenburg during 2006-2010 and in Umea during 2006-2012 were used. NOx emissions were estimated from the traffic flow and emission factors calculated from the HBEFA3.1 model. PM2.5 constitutes the finer part of PM10. Emissions of the coarser part of PM10 (PM10-PM2.5) are suppressed when roads are wet and show a maximum during spring when the roads dry up and studded tyres are still used. Less than 1% of the road wear caused by studded tyres give rise to airborne PM2.5-10 particles. The NOx emission factors decrease with time in the used model, due to the renewal of the vehicle fleet. However, the NOx concentrations resulting from the roads show no clear trend. The air dispersion is an important factor controlling the PM concentration near the road. The dispersion has a minimum in winter and during midnight. The average street level concentrations of PK10 and PM2.5 in Gothenburg were 21 +/- 20 and 8 6 mu g m(-3) respectively, which is 36% and 22% higher than the urban background concentrations. Despite the four times lower traffic flow in Umea compared to Gothenburg, the average particle concentrations were very similar; 21 +/- 31 and 7 +/- 5 mu g m(-3) for PM10 and PM2.5 respectively. These concentrations were, however, 108% and 55% higher than the urban background concentrations in Umea. The emission factors for PM10 decreased with time, and the average factor was 0.06 g km(-1) vehichle(-1). The emission factors for PM2.5 are very uncertain due to the small increments in PM2.5 concentration at the thoroughfares, and were on average 0.02 g km(-1) vehichle(-1). (C) 2015 The Authors.

Essentially, this procedure targets the best value for the parameter vector of the model and this can be achieved using appropriate optimization algorithms. The parameter calibration problem is formulated as a nonlinear, non-convex, least-squares optimization problem, which is known to attain multiple local minima; for this reason gradient-based solution algorithms are not considered to be an option. The methodologies that are more appropriate for application to this problem are mainly some meta-heuristic algorithms which use direct search approaches that allow them to avoid bad local minima. This paper presents an overview of the most suitable nonlinear programming methods for the calibration procedure of macroscopic traffic flow models. Furthermore, an application example, where two well-known macroscopic traffic flow models are evaluated through the calibration procedure, is presented.

It considers route choice behaviour on both the strategic (pre-trip) and tactical (en-route) level. To achieve this, we put forward a class-specific equilibrium direction relation of the pedestrians, which is governed by two parts: one part describing the global route choice, which is pre-determined based on the expectations of the pedestrians, and one part describing the local route choice, which is a density-gradient dependent term that reflects local adaptations based on prevailing flow conditions. Including the local route choice term in the multi-class model causes first of all dispersion of the flow: pedestrians will move away from high density areas in order to reduce their overall walking costs. Second of all, for the crossing flow and bi-directional flow cases, local route choice causes well known self-organised patterns to emerge (i.e. diagonal stripes and hi-directional lanes). We study under which demand conditions self-organisation occurs and fails, as well as what the impact is of the choices of the different model parameters. In particular, the differences in the weights reflecting the impact of the own and the other classes appear to have a very strong impact on the self-organisation process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In the model, lane changing is considered as a stochastic behavior that can decrease an individual driver's disutility or cost, and is represented as dynamics toward the equilibrium of lane-flow distribution along with longitudinal traffic dynamics. The proposed method can be differentiated from those in previous studies because in this study, the motivation of lane changing is explicitly considered and it is treated as a utility defined by the current macroscopic traffic state. In addition, the entire process of lane changing is computed macroscopically by an extension of the kinematic wave theory employing IT principle; moreover, in the model framework, the lane-flow equilibrium curve is endogenously generated because of self-motivated lane changes. Furthermore, the parsimonious representation enables parameter calibration using the data collected from conventional loop detectors. The calibration of the data collected at four different sites, including a sag bottleneck, on the Chugoku expressway in Japan reveals that the proposed method can represent the lane-flow distribution of any observation site with high accuracy, and that the estimated parameters can reasonably explain the multilane traffic dynamics and the bottleneck phenomena uphill of sag sections.

This paper provides a comprehensive study on the effects of lateral gaps under non-lane discipline on the energy consumption for EV traffic stream by analyzing driving cycles produced by car-following models. In particular, the energy consumption model includes travel resistance power loss, motor power loss, regenerative braking power, and ancillary power loss. Then, three car-following models are implemented to evaluate the effects of lateral gaps: the FVD model with no lateral gap, the NLBCF model with one-sided lateral gap, and the TSFVD model with two-sided lateral gaps. Numerical experiments analyze three scenarios: start process, stop process, and evolution process for FVD model, NLBCF model, and TSFVD model, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that, although EVs under the non-lane discipline recuperate more energy during the deceleration phase, they overall consume more energy than under lane-based discipline. This study highlights that the characteristic in terms of lateral distribution of traffic flow may lead to different energy consumption in EV traffic stream. This study also provides policy insights that regularizing lane discipline contributes to the improvement in energy efficiency.

J	Cassidy, MJ; Kim, K; Ni, W; Gu, WH				Cassidy, Michael J.; Kim, Kwangho; Ni, Wei; Gu, Weihua			A problem of limited-access special lanes. Part II: Exploring remedies via simulation	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Managed lanes; Carpool lanes; Toll lanes; Traffic simulation		Spatiotemporal analyses of freeway sites in Part I have shown that special-lane access points are prone to become bottlenecks. These can degrade traffic flows, sometimes in all lanes. Part II explores select impacts of re-designing the means of entering and exiting a special lane, and of altering the policy governing its use. Parametric tests were conducted using a computer simulation model that was calibrated to one of the sites studied in Part I; one with a buffer-separated carpool lane. Though less reliable than what might have been observed via experiments in real settings, the simulated findings seem to offer useful insights nonetheless. The findings indicate that traffic conditions would improve at the site by elongating the carpool lane's buffer opening beyond its present length of 400 m. Yet, only modest improvements were predicted, even when the opening was elongated to 1000 m or more. Greater benefits were predicted from disentangling the movements made into and out of the carpool lane. This was achieved by placing first a buffer opening to serve only ingress, followed by another immediately downstream to serve egress. The benefits of this treatment were again limited, even when each tandem opening was elongated to a length of 700 m. Fully removing the buffer that physically separates the carpool lane from the regular ones was predicted to bring the greatest improvements to traffic. Also examined was pending legislation that would leave the carpool-lane buffer in place, while limiting the times of day when the lane is reserved for special use. Simulations predict that this legislation would degrade travel conditions below those that presently occur at the site. The extent of this predicted degradation varied, depending upon the time of day when the lane-use restriction went into effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Dynamic Prediction of Vehicle Cluster Distribution in Mixed Traffic: A Statistical Mechanics-Inspired Method	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Intelligent vehicles; traffic control; road transportation; self-organization; driver behavior; Potts model	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; FLOW; WAVES	The advent of intelligent vehicle technologies holds significant potential to alter the dynamics of traffic flow. Prior work on the effects of such technologies on the formation of self-organized traffic jams has led to analytical solutions and numerical simulations at the mesoscopic scale, which may not yield significant information about the distribution of vehicle cluster size. Since the absence of large clusters could be offset by the presence of several smaller clusters, the distribution of cluster sizes can be as important as the presence or absence of clusters. To obtain a prediction of vehicle cluster distribution, the included work presents a statistical mechanics-inspired method of simulating traffic flow at a microscopic scale via the generalized Ising model. The results of the microscopic simulations indicate that traffic systems dominated by adaptive cruise control (ACC)-enabled vehicles exhibit a higher probability of formation of moderately sized clusters, as compared with the traffic systems dominated by human-driven vehicles; however, the trend is reversed for the formation of large-sized clusters. These qualitative results hold significance for algorithm design and traffic control because it is easier to predict and take countermeasures for fewer large localized clusters as opposed to several smaller clusters spread across different locations on a highway.

A Program for Simultaneous Network Signal Timing Optimization and Traffic Assignment	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Network signal timing optimization; traffic assignment; genetic algorithms; weighted trip maximization; objective function upper-bound; system optimal	GENETIC ALGORITHM APPROACH; FORMULATION	This study formulates a program for simultaneous traffic signal optimization and system optimal traffic assignment for urban transportation networks with added degree of realism. The formulation presents a new objective function, i.e., weighted trip maximization, and explicit constraints that are specifically designed to address oversaturated conditions. This formulation improves system-wise performance while locally prevents queue spillovers, de-facto reds, and gridlocks. A meta-heuristic algorithm is developed that incorporates microscopic traffic flow models and system optimal traffic assignment in genetic algorithms. This solution technique efficiently optimizes signal timing parameters, at the same time solves system optimal traffic assignment, and accounts for oversaturated conditions and different driver's behaviors. This study also proposes a framework to calculate an upper bound on the value of the objective function by solving the problemwhile several constraints (i.e., network loading and traffic assignment) are relaxed. An empirical case study for a portion of downtown Springfield, Illinois has been conducted under four demand patterns. Findings indicate that our solution approach can solve the problem effectively. Several managerial insights have also been drawn.

This may affect the dynamics of congestion that is present and may also affect route choice by all vehicles on a network. The main contribution of this paper is to provide an analytical formulation for a mixed traffic system that includes cars and buses, which realistically replicates moving bottlenecks. We modify the CTM model using methods from the lagged CTM to recognize speed differentials between the free-flow speed of buses and cars. In addition, the impact of capacity reduction caused by buses was incorporated. These developments led to the replication of moving bottlenecks caused by buses within the CTM framework. The formulated variant of CTM was utilized to determine a system optimal assignment that minimizes the total passenger travel time across cars and buses. The proposed modified CTM model, defined as the BUS-CTM, has been applied on a road link and a more detailed network to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. The numerical results and the depiction of the bottleneck phenomenon within the model suggests that the BUS-CTM obtains more realistic results compared with the application of the traditional CTM in a mixed car-bus transportation system. The sensitivity analysis shows that bus passenger demand, passenger occupancy of bus, and bus free-flow speeds are the key parameters that influence the system performance.

Many cities are adopting intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) to improve traffic efficiency. ITSs can be used for monitoring traffic congestion using detectors, such as calculating an estimated time of arrival or suggesting a detour route. In this paper, we propose an urban traffic flow prediction system using a multifactor pattern recognition model, which combines Gaussian mixture model clustering with an artificial neural network. This system forecasts traffic flow by combining road geographical factors and environmental factors with traffic flow properties from ITS detectors. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model produces more reliable predictions compared with existing methods.

On-Street and Off-Street Parking Availability Prediction Using Multivariate Spatiotemporal Models	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Parking guidance systems; parking prediction; spatiotemporal models	SPACE AVAILABILITY; TRAFFIC FLOW; TREND; TIMES	Parking guidance and information (PGI) systems are becoming important parts of intelligent transportation systems due to the fact that cars and infrastructure are becoming more and more connected. One major challenge in developing efficient PGI systems is the uncertain nature of parking availability in parking facilities (both on-street and off-street). A reliable PGI system should have the capability of predicting the availability of parking at the arrival time with reliable accuracy. In this paper, we study the nature of the parking availability data in a big city and propose a multivariate autoregressive model that takes into account both temporal and spatial correlations of parking availability. The model is used to predict parking availability with high accuracy. The prediction errors are used to recommend the parking location with the highest probability of having at least one parking spot available at the estimated arrival time. The results are demonstrated using real-time parking data in the areas of San Francisco and Los Angeles.

Longitudinal ventilation using jet fans is the most popular system for pollutant discharge control of tunnels. Nowadays, jet fans equipped with the frequency conversion technology in the tunnel can shorten the control cycle and even conduct manipulation of step-less jet speeds. The longitudinal ventilation system has considerable inertia and non-linear characteristics, which are partly resulted from traffic flow dynamics such as traffic state transition. Therefore in this study an adaptive control method based on the artificial neural-network theory is proposed to be tailored to the traffic state transition. The model is based on aerodynamic equations and takes vehicle speed and density as main system disturbances, whose value can be determined by fundamental diagram when having incomplete field traffic data. The proposed controller can also cope with the parameters and uncertainties of the time-varying model. The authors simulation results show that the adaptive control method can track the desirable system output effectively whenever the traffic condition changes gently or dramatically. The results also show that their method performs better than the common-used proportional integral derivative controller in terms of system adaptability following the traffic state transition.

By using the Hurwitz criteria and the condition for transfer function in term of H-infinity-norm, we designed the feedback gain and delay time to stabilize the traffic flow and suppress the traffic jam. The Bode-plot of transfer function have been plotted and discussed that the stability region enhances with delayed-feedback control. It is shown that the delayed-feedback control method stabilizes the traffic flow and suppresses the traffic jam efficiently. The simulation results are in good agreement with the theoretical analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Macroscopic traffic flow modeling with adaptive cruise control: Development and numerical solution	COMPUTERS & MATHEMATICS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow dynamics; Macroscopic traffic flow models; Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control; Hyperbolic conservation laws; Numerical simulation; Finite volume relaxation schemes	CONSERVATION-LAWS; RELAXATION APPROXIMATIONS; CONTROL-SYSTEMS; SIMULATION; SCHEMES; CONVERGENCE; DIAGRAM	The incorporation of two macroscopic approaches reflecting Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) traffic dynamics in a gas-kinetic (GKT) traffic flow model is presented. The first approach was recently analyzed in the literature aiming to describe the effects induced by the ACC and CACC systems due to changes of the speed of the leading car(s) by the introduction of an acceleration/deceleration term. The second approach is a novel one and is based on the introduction of a relaxation term that satisfies the time/space-gap principle of ACC or CACC systems. In both approaches, the relaxation time is assigned on multiple leading vehicles in the CACC case; whereas in the ACC case this relaxation time is only assigned to the direct leading vehicle. We numerically approximate the resulting models by an accurate and robust high-resolution finite volume relaxation scheme, where the nonlinear system of partial differential equations is first recast to a diagonalizable semi-linear system and is then discretized by a higher-order WENO scheme. Numerical simulations investigate the effect of the different ACC and CACC approaches to traffic flow macroscopic stability with respect to perturbations introduced in a ring road and to flow characteristics in open freeways with merging flows at an on-ramp. Following from the numerical results, it can be concluded that CACC vehicles increase the stabilization of traffic flow, with respect to both small and large perturbations, compared to ACC ones. Further, the proposed CACC approach can better improve the dynamic equilibrium capacity and traffic dynamics, especially at the on-ramp bottleneck. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Butakov, VA; Ioannou, P				Butakov, Vadim A.; Ioannou, Petros			Personalized Driver/Vehicle Lane Change Models for ADAS	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Adaptation models; intelligent vehicles; machine learning; man machine systems	DRIVING BEHAVIOR; TRACKING	Lane changes are stressful maneuvers for drivers, particularly during high-speed traffic flows. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADASs) aim to assist drivers during lane change maneuvers. A system that is developed for an average driver or all drivers will have to be conservative for safety reasons to cover all driver/vehicle types. Such a conservative system may not be acceptable to aggressive drivers and could be perceived as too aggressive by the more passive drivers. An ADAS that takes into account the dynamics and characteristics of each individual vehicle/driver system during lane change maneuvers will be more effective and more acceptable to drivers without sacrificing safety. In this paper, we develop a methodology that learns the characteristics of an individual driver/vehicle response before and during lane changes and under different driving environments. These characteristics are captured by a set of models whose parameters are adjusted online to fit the individual vehicle/driver response during lane changes. We develop a two-layer model to describe the maneuver kinematics. The lower layer describes lane change as a kinematic model. The higher layer model establishes the kinematic model parameter values for the particular driver and represents their dependence on the configuration of the surrounding vehicles. The proposed modeling framework can be used as a kernel component of ADAS to provide more personalized recommendations to the driver, increasing the potential for more widespread acceptance and use of ADAS. We evaluated the proposed methodology using an actual vehicle and three different drivers. We demonstrated that the method is effective in modeling individual driver/vehicle responses during lane change by showing consistency of matching between the model outputs and raw data.

J	Keykhaie, S; Yousefi, S; Dehghan, M				Keykhaie, Sepehr; Yousefi, Saleh; Dehghan, Mehdi			Modeling of Propagation of Road Hazard Information in Sparse Vehicular ad hoc Networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUTOMATION AND COMPUTING			English	Article						Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs); store-and-forward; message propagation delay; informed platoon size; reception probability		In this paper, we study the propagation of road hazard information to vehicles which enter the hazard segment of a highway in a sparse 1D vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) with store-and-forward mechanism. Store-and-forward is an option for message propagation in sparse vehicular networks where connectivity is intermittent. Upon receiving the message, the vehicle becomes an informed vehicle, it carries the message for a while and then forwards it to the approaching vehicles which are about to enter the highway segment. In this way, a platoon of informed vehicles is formed. We establish an analytical model to obtain the probability that a vehicle receives the message and joins the informed platoon. Moreover, we prove that traffic dynamics increase the reception probability of messages. We find the expected message propagation delay in the platoon using the store-and-forward policy. We also show that the propagation delay in store-and-forward inter-vehicle communications is tightly related to traffic parameters such as traffic flow rate and vehicle speeds on the highway. Results show that for smaller transmission ranges, smaller platoons are formed, the expected message propagation delay in the platoon is low, and it increases very slightly as the traffic flow rate increases. But for larger transmission ranges, larger platoons are formed, the expected delay is high, and it increases remarkably with a small increase in the traffic flow rate. The impacts of some network and traffic parameters such as transmission range, speed of vehicles, and highway speed limits on the message propagation are investigated as well. Finally, the accuracy of the analytical results is evaluated by an extensive simulation study.

Consequently, it is vital to improve traffic efficiency to preserve urban air quality. Based on the environmental traffic capacity and the macroscopic fundamental diagram theory, the multi-objective programming model is adopted to describe the relationship between traffic emissions and traffic capacity. Then a dynamic traffic volume control method is developed for regional traffic management, which is the feedback gating control method based on the traffic conditions in controlled urban areas. As a case study, the proposed methodology is applied to a road network located in central area of Nanjing. The traffic flow going in and out the study area is controlled by gates via signals to make sure the vehicle amounts and emissions in study area are under the threshold obtained by multi-objective model. The results show that traffic efficiency has improved significantly and that the urban air quality is ensured. This paper can offer some recommendations regarding urban traffic management and air pollution control.

In this paper we extend our previous analysis of these experiments, and report new experimental findings. In particular, we reveal that the platoon length (hence the average spacing within a platoon) might be significantly different even if the average velocity of the platoon is essentially the same. The findings further demonstrate that the traffic states span a 2D region in the speed-spacing (or density) plane. The common practice of using a single speed-spacing curve to model vehicular traffic ignores the variability and imprecision of human driving and is therefore inadequate. We have proposed a car-following model based on a mechanism that in certain ranges of speed and spacing, drivers are insensitive to the changes in spacing when the velocity differences between cars are small. It was shown that the model can reproduce the experimental results well. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Two reduction properties regarding the problem size and some optimality conditions are derived. Based on these conditions, an exact polynomial algorithm is developed to determine the set of optimal locations for the refueling station. A small tree network example is solved to illustrate the algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Traffic flow optimization on roundabouts	MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN THE APPLIED SCIENCES			English	Article						traffic problems; conservation laws; macroscopic models; Riemann problem; optimal control	NETWORKS; BUFFER; WAVES	The aim of this article is to propose an optimization strategy for traffic flow on roundabouts using a macroscopic approach. The roundabout is modeled as a sequence of 2 x 2 junctions with one main lane and secondary incoming and outgoing roads. We consider two cost functionals: the total travel time and the total waiting time, which give an estimate of the time spent by drivers on the network section. These cost functionals are minimized with respect to the right of way parameter of the incoming roads. For each cost functional, the analytical expression is given for each junction. We then solve numerically the optimization problem and show some numerical results. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The aim of this study is to test its multi-fractality at spacial scales. The vehicular cellular automation (CA) model is chosen as a tool to get vehicle positions on a single lane road. First, multi-fractal of vehicle distribution is checked, and multi-fractal spectrums are plotted. Second, analysis results show that the width of a multi-fractal spectrum expresses the ratio of the maximum to minimum densities, and the height difference between the left and right vertexes represents the relative size between the numbers of sections with the maximum and minimum densities. Finally, the effects of the random deceleration probability and the average density on homogeneity of vehicle distribution are analyzed. The results show that random deceleration increases the ratio of the maximum to minimum densities, and deceases the relative size between the numbers of sections with the maximum and minimum densities, when the global density is limited to a specific range. Therefore, the multi-fractal spectrum can be used to quantify the homogeneity of spacial distribution of traffic flow.

This paper aims at exploring traffic accident and emission characteristics in heavy fog, as well as freeway intermittent release measures for heavy fog weather. A driving simulator experiment is conducted for obtaining driving behaviors in heavy fog. By proposing a multi-cell cellular automaton (CA) model based on the experimental data, the role of intermittent release measures on the reduction of traffic accidents and CO emissions is studied. The results show that, affected by heavy fog, when cellular occupancy rho < 0.8, the probability of traffic accidents is much higher; and CO emissions increase significantly when rho < 0.2. After an intermittent release measure is applied, the probability of traffic accidents and level of CO emissions become reasonable.

When applied to real situations, although the shortest path can be computed with Dijkstra's algorithm, it is not always the one that is chosen. In traffic situations, for example, the driver may not know the exact length of the lanes or the shortest path to follow. Even more compelling is the fact that although the driver knows the shortest route, he/she may prefer choosing a different route. In this paper we present the new algorithm PEDA (Probabilistic Extension of Dijkstra's Algorithm) which introduces probabilistic changes in the weight of the edges and also in the decisions when choosing the shortest path. When PEDA is applied to traffic flow, more realistic simulations, in which the shortest path is not always chosen, are obtained. This more accurately simulates the more normal behavior of drivers. As an example of an application, we introduce the ATISMART+ model, an extension of the ATISMART model, where an accelerated-time simulation of car traffic in a smart city was described. In that previous work, all cars in the system used Dijkstra's algorithm to choose improved ATISMART(+) model, for accelerated time simulations of traffic flow in smart cities, uses the new PEDA algorithm. The results obtained show that ATISMART+ produces more realistic simulations considering different drivers' behaviors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this study one traffic light is placed in the middle of the system. This work is based on Nagel and Schreckenberg (NaSch) model (Nagel and Schreckenberg (1992)) in parallel dynamics. The P-ac dependence on T and the (alpha,beta) phase diagrams are established, alpha and beta are the injecting and extracting rates of cars in the traffic lane respectively. The increase of the cycle time light T causes an important decrease of the accident probability P-ac, both in the open and periodic cases. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These roads have been proven to contribute to substantial benefits in terms of road safety. However, overtaking of slower vehicles is only possible on segments including an overtaking lane and not on the single-lane road segments. Driver and vehicle heterogeneity resulting in differences in desired speeds are consequently decisive for the traffic performance. Sufficient quality of service is relying on an appropriate design and distribution of single-lane segments and overtaking lanes. In this paper, we study the effect of the desired speed distribution on traffic performance on single-lane road segments. Expressions are derived for the travel time, delay and percent time spent following. The derived expressions link the desired speed distribution, the single-lane segment length and the traffic flow to the resulting traffic performance. The results are verified through comparison with measures based on microscopic traffic simulation. The conclusion is that there is a good agreement between derived measures and simulation results. The derived measures should therefore not only be of theoretical interest, but also of practical use to estimate traffic performance on single-lane road segments.

J	Kumar, SV; Vanajakshi, L				Kumar, S. Vasantha; Vanajakshi, Lelitha			Short-term traffic flow prediction using seasonal ARIMA model with limited input data	EUROPEAN TRANSPORT RESEARCH REVIEW			English	Article						Time-series analysis; SARIMA; Flow prediction; Intelligent transportation systems; Limited input data	NEURAL-NETWORKS	Background Accurate prediction of traffic flow is an integral component in most of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications. The data driven approach using Box-Jenkins Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models reported in most studies demands sound database for model building. Hence, the applicability of these models remains a question in places where the data availability could be an issue. The present study tries to overcome the above issue by proposing a prediction scheme using Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model for short term prediction of traffic flow using only limited input data. Method A 3-lane arterial roadway in Chennai, India was selected as the study stretch and limited flow data from only three consecutive days was used for the model development using SARIMA. After necessary differencing to make the input time series a stationary one, the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) were plotted to identify the suitable order of the SARIMA model. The model parameters were found using maximum likelihood method in R. The developed model was validated by performing 24 hrs. ahead forecast and the predicted flows were compared with the actual flow values. A comparison of the proposed model with historic average and naive method was also attempted. The effect of increase in sample size of input data on prediction results was studied. Short term prediction of traffic flow during morning and evening peak periods was also attempted using both historic and real time data. Concluding remarks The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between actual and predicted flow was found to be in the range of 4-10, which is acceptable in most of the ITS applications. The prediction scheme proposed in this study for traffic flow prediction could be considered in situations where database is a major constraint during model development using ARIMA.	[Kumar, S.

J	Cristea, M; Delhomme, P				Cristea, M.; Delhomme, P.			Factors influencing drivers' reading and comprehension of on-board traffic messages	EUROPEAN REVIEW OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY-REVUE EUROPEENNE DE PSYCHOLOGIE APPLIQUEE			English	Article						On-board traffic information system; Reading and comprehension; Pictograms; Warnings; Recommendations	CONCURRENT TASK; SIGNS; INFORMATION; PERFORMANCE; PICTOGRAMS; IMPACT; RISK; AGE	Introduction. - When variable message signs (VMS) or on-board traffic information systems are used, it is essential that while driving, motorists read and understand the information as soon as possible in order to make appropriate decisions to increase road safety and/or facilitate traffic flow. Thus, it is important to investigate the factors that may increase fast reading and comprehension of on-board traffic information. Objectives. - We examined the influence of the type of message (warnings vs. recommendations), location of the pictogram (top or bottom of the text), type of display device (IPhone, Blackberry, or Tablet) and its position (horizontal or vertical) on drivers' fast reading and comprehension of on-board messages provided via in-vehicle system. Moreover, we were interested in drivers' acceptability of in-vehicle system. Method. - Forty-nine drivers (M-Men = 32, 19-65 years) participated to a reading and comprehension task while travelling on a desktop driving simulator. Participants were exposed to two series of 11 traffic messages displayed on one of the three devices. Reading and comprehension times were measured (= milliseconds) for each message. At the end, they had to fill in a questionnaire on their beliefs about on-board traffic messages and in-vehicle system. Results. - Drivers expressed a positive attitude toward on-board traffic messages and in-vehicle system. Reading and comprehension times were of approximately 4 seconds and were longer for warnings as compared to recommendations. The pictogram placed at the top of the text, the tablet and the vertical display device facilitated fast reading and comprehension. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

J	Chattaraj, U; Subhashini, A				Chattaraj, Ujjal; Subhashini, Arumuga			Modelling Traffic Flow on Cloverleaf Interchange	EUROPEAN TRANSPORT-TRASPORTI EUROPEI			English	Article						Traffic flow; interchange; fuzzy inference system; fuzzy membership function; fuzzy clustering		The rapid urbanization alters the life style in high scale and metropolitan cities adapt traffic diverting stmctures like interchanges and bridges to handle the ever increasing traffic growth. It is high time to effectively utilize these traffic systems, hence a traffic model explaining the effective travel pattern is obligatory. Fuzzy logic is an effective concept in interpreting and reciprocating performance similar to human reasoning and can describe complex systems in linguistic terms instead of numerical values. In this study, a system was established based on Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) with output data as Vehicular Speed (5) and input data as various highway geometric elements. The study was conducted on two steps as for up-ramp condition and down-ramp condition. Two Traffic models (TF(up)and TFdn) were developed with radius of curvature, super elevation, frictional coefficient and slope as governing factors. The inferences show that these models can be used to predict and understand the traffic flow along the interchanges with the effect of gravity and friction on the travelling vehicle. A correlation was established between the geometric elements and speed of the vehicle. A simulation study and real life data analysis were performed to demonstrate model fitting the performances of the proposed model.

In this study externalities like congestion and environmental costs of urban transport are evaluated with respect to their marginal effects on others. Marginal costs are analyzed for different Level of Service in terms of Volume to Capacity ratio for urban road network. Marginal cost pricing methodology is developed and applied to the Greater Mumbai city road network to estimate marginal congestion effects. GIS based transportation planning software, TransCAD and GISDK is used for data storing, displaying and analyzing. Analysis results are compared to different operating conditions. The congestion cost for complete Greater Mumbai road network for the present traffic flow condition is found as 163.12 million Rupees.

Pedestrian Stream Flow Modeling using Single and Multi Regime Concepts	EUROPEAN TRANSPORT-TRASPORTI EUROPEI			English	Article						Clustering; LRM; MAPE; RMSE; Single and Multi-regime; Traffic Flow and Trust region Method	LEVEL	Analysis of stream flow parameters describes the relationships among the characteristics of pedestrian traffic stream. The level of functional effectiveness of pedestrian infrastructure can be measured and analyzed considering the relationships between stream flow parameters of pedestrian traffic. In this study single regime and multi regime models have been proposed for mixed pedestrian traffic condition on sidewalks and carriageways to develop a suitable traffic stream model for heterogeneous traffic condition. Very limitedstudied have been reported in this respect so far from India. Various types of pedestrian facilitiesand regimes based on density rangehave an impact on pedestrian walking behavior which differentiates the response of pedestrian micro-characteristics to its macro-characteristics. Two regime and three regime models have been explainedin the present study to characterize pedestrian traffic in different regimes such as free flow, transitional flow and congested flow regime. A suitable modelhas beendeveloped minimizing error values such as MAPE, RMSE valueand better fitness of predicted data to real situation. This study will be helpful for analyzing and improving pedestrian facilities in terms of efficiency and shall be used for developing the Highway Capacity Manual for India.

Based on previous literature, the source term addresses the impact of speed difference and density difference between adjacent lanes, which provides better precision for free lane-changing simulation; the viscosity term turns lane-changing behavior to a "force" that may influence speed distribution. Using a flux-splitting scheme for the model discretization, two cases are investigated numerically. The case under a homogeneous initial condition shows that the numerical results by our model agree well with the analytical ones; the case with a small initial disturbance shows that our model can simulate the evolution of perturbation, including propagation, dissipation, cluster effect and stop-and-go phenomenon.

Multi-objective traffic signal control model for traffic management	TRANSPORTATION LETTERS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH			English	Article						Multi-objective model; Traffic management strategy; Intersection signal controlling; Fuzzy analytic process; Q-learning algorithm		Traffic signals are one of the main traffic management tools used to control traffic flow on the roads and should reflect traffic managers' intentions in different tasks. This paper showed a multi-objective optimization model, and its algorithm was aimed at the intricate structure of traffic control. First, the indexes of queuing lengths, delay times, and stop times were chosen as the evaluation indexes of optimization model. Second, the weight of the optimization indexes was confirmed with a fuzzy analytic process (FAP) according to the traffic managers' strategy. Finally, the multi-objective optimization model was solved with the Q-learning algorithm, and thus the signal control scheme of the intersection was produced in real-time while considering the traffic management strategy. The results of the simulation showed that the method could effectively improve traffic efficiency at the intersection, and at the same time, the intentions of the traffic managers could be fully embodied.

For this purpose, ITS systems are steadily being rolled out, providing a wealth of information, and transitionary technologies, such as computer vision applied to low-cost surveillance or consumer cameras, are already leading the way. This paper presents, in detail, a practical framework for implementation of an automated, high-resolution, video-based traffic-analysis system, particularly geared towards researchers for behavioural studies and road safety analysis, or practitioners for traffic flow model validation. This system collects large amounts of microscopic traffic flow data from ordinary traffic using CCTV and consumer-grade video cameras and provides the tools for conducting basic traffic flow analyses as well as more advanced, pro-active safety and behaviour studies. This paper demonstrates the process step-by-step, illustrated with examples, and applies the methodology to a case study of a large and detailed study of roundabouts (nearly 80,000 motor vehicles tracked up to 30 times per second driving through a roundabout). In addition to providing a rich set of behavioural data about Time-to-Collision and gap times at nearly 40 roundabout weaving zones, some data validation is performed using the standard Measure of Tracking Accuracy with results in the 85-95% range.

J	Tan, Z; Gao, HO				Tan, Zhen; Gao, H. Oliver			Traffic control for air quality management and congestion mitigation in complex urban vehicular tunnels	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Tunnel traffic control; Ramp metering; Multiple emission targets; Nonlinear programming	VENTILATION CONTROL	Urban vehicular tunnels, generally connected to the ground road network via on- and off-ramps, are geometrically complex with multiple entrances and exits. They are designed with in-tunnel ventilation systems and multiple pollutant discharge points for air quality control. In addition to traditional mechanical ventilation tools, traffic control has been recognized as a useful approach for air quality management and congestion mitigation in tunnels. This study aims to develop quantitative system analytic models for optimal traffic control considering both traffic and air quality improvement goals for complex urban tunnels. Moving vehicles inside the tunnel are not only the emission source, but also a key factor affecting aerodynamics in the tunnel. For a control cycle, steady-state traffic flow, aerodynamics, and pollutant dispersion models are established by tunnel segment, in which the air flow speed under a given mechanical ventilation scheme is mainly affected by tunnel traffic. An optimal time-of-day ramp traffic metering and mainline inlet traffic control model is proposed using nonlinear programming (NP) techniques to meet multiple air quality/emission as well as traffic throughput requirements. In-tunnel air quality requirements and emission limits at discharge points are modeled as nonlinear constraints for traffic control decisions. For illustration, the model was applied to an urban tunnel in Hangzhou, China for optimal traffic control to (1) assist the tunnel ventilation to meet environmental requirements under varying traffic demand; (2) provide a mechanism for tunnel air pollution control when fan operation alone is not enough during peak traffic period; and (3) maintain traffic efficiency by preventing recurrent congestion in the tunnel. The proposed tunnel traffic control method proves a useful complementary strategy to traditional mechanical tunnel ventilation for the improvement of urban tunnel transportation environment.

J	Jin, HY; Jin, WL				Jin, Hui-Yu; Jin, Wen-Long			Control of a lane-drop bottleneck through variable speed limits	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Capacity drop; Variable speed limits; Kinematic wave model; Link queue model; Proportional-integral-derivative controller; Stability	TRAFFIC FLOW; KINEMATIC WAVES; FREEWAY; CAPACITY; MODEL; FEATURES; DENSITY	The discharging flow-rate of a lane-drop bottleneck can drop when its upstream is congested, and such capacity drop leads to additional traffic congestion as well as safety threats. Even though many studies have demonstrated that variable speed limits (VSL) can effectively delay and even avoid the occurrence of capacity drop, there lacks a simple approach for analyzing the performance of a VSL control system. In this study, we formulate the VSL control problem for the traffic system in a zone upstream to a lane-drop bottleneck based on two traffic flow models: the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model, which is an infinite-dimensional partial differential equation, and the link queue model, which is an ordinary differential equation and approximates the LWR model. In both models, the discharging flow-rate is determined by a recently developed model of capacity drop, and the upstream in-flux is regulated by the speed limit in the VSL zone. We first analytically study the properties of the control system with the link queue model. For an open-loop control system with a constant speed limit, we prove that a constant speed limit can introduce an uncongested equilibrium state, in addition to a congested one with capacity drop, but the congested equilibrium state is always exponentially stable. Then we apply a feedback proportional-integral (PI) controller to form a closed-loop control system, in which the congested equilibrium state and, therefore, capacity drop can be removed by both I- and PI-controllers. Both analytical and numerical results show that, with appropriately chosen controller parameters, the closed-loop control system is stable, effect, and robust. Finally, we show that the VSL strategies based on I- and PI-controllers are also stable, effective, and robust for the LWR model. Since the properties of the control system are transferable between the two models, we establish a dual approach for studying the control problems of nonlinear traffic flow systems. We also confirm that the VSL strategy is effective only if capacity drop occurs. The obtained method and insights can be useful for future studies on other traffic control methods and implementations of VSL strategies in lane-drop bottlenecks, work zones, and incident areas.

Freeway traffic incident reconstruction - A bi-parameter approach	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Freeway traffic modeling; Second order traffic flow models; Traffic incidents; Moving horizon algorithm; Direct and indirect incident parameters	FLOW; IDENTIFICATION	The paper suggests a novel alternative to generalized traffic incident descriptions within the macroscopic traffic model framework. The contribution of the paper is twofold. First, by extending already existing second order macroscopic conservation laws to characterize off-nominal traffic conditions, we define two main incident parameters such as direct and indirect ones. Physical interpretations of this incident parametrization is provided. These incident indicators are relative in view of the nominal traffic flow model parameters and carries physically meaningful macroscopic content. Second, the paper proposes to use a constrained and nonlinear, joint traffic state- and incident parameter reconstruction method and validates the suggested modeling idea via real traffic measurements fitting. Evaluation of the numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This study presents a new forward search algorithm based on dynamic programming (FSDP) under a decision tree, and explores an efficient solution for real-time adaptive traffic signal control policy. Traffic signal control with cases of fixed phase sequence and variable phase sequence are both considered in the algorithm. Owing to the properties of forward research dynamic programming and the process optimisation of repeated or invalid traffic states the authors proposed, FSDP algorithm reduces the number of states and saves much computation time. Consequently, FSDP is certain to be an on-line algorithm through its application to a complicated traffic control problem. Moreover, the labelled position method is firstly proposed in the author's study to search the optimal policy after reaching the goal state. For practical operations, this new algorithm is extended by adding the rolling horizon approach, and some derived methods are compared with the optimal fixed-time control and adaptive control on the evaluation of traffic delay. Experimental results obtained by the simulations of symmetrical and asymmetrical traffic flow scenarios show that the FSDP method can perform quite well with high efficiency and good qualities in traffic control.

Based on the empirical data of Liuzhong Highway Tianshui Road toll station (LHTR-station), the real-time arrival rates of the traffic flows in both directions have been characterized via statistical analysis. Using an M/D/1 queuing model and stationary independent period-by-period (SIPP) and peak-hour approximations for the time-varying arrival rates, (i.e. two hours per period and 12 periods a day), we develop the optimal staffing levels in both directions of highway toll station. Then, the optimal staffing schedules are developed for different scenarios, for example, four-hour working a day, six-hour working a day, eight-hour working a day, and four-hour working and two-hour resting and four-hour working a day. The operating costs are compared for different schedules used in practice. Finally, using the empirical data of LHTR-station, we evaluate the performance improvement with the schedules suggested by our analysis. It has been found that the operation efficiency for LHTR-station can be improved significantly. This paper shows the value of using the operations research models innovatively to solve real-world problems.

The fundamental diagram, which refers to the relationship between traffic flow and density at a given location, plays an important role in modeling the dynamics of traffic propagation. Many forms of fundamental diagrams have been proposed since the seminal work of Greenshields 80 years ago. Nevertheless, empirical validation of fundamental diagrams, in particular, for dynamic modeling purposes, is limited. The study is conducted with an extensive dataset collected from the U.K. M25 motorway. This paper highlights the difficulty in modeling congested traffic with single-valued fundamental diagrams and fine-grained loop detector data. Consequently, this paper first analyzes and discusses the effect of data granularity on model calibration and application. Following this, a set-valued fundamental diagram modeling approach with fine-grained data is also presented. This paper contributes to the development and validation of dynamic traffic simulation tools. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.	[Chow, Andy H.

First, the influence of the global average-and-optimal flux difference on the stability of traffic flow is investigated through linear stability theory. The results reveal that the unstable region will be shrunk by taking the global average-and-optimal flux difference effect into account. Additionally, by using the reductive perturbation method, the mKdV equation near the critical point is derived and traffic jam transition can be described by its kink-antikink soliton solution. The good agreement between the numerical simulations and the analytical results shows that traffic congestion can be suppressed efficiently by considering the global average-and-optimal flux difference and the local relative flux effects in two-lane traffic system and the local relative flux is more important than the global average-and-optimal flux difference in stabilizing traffic flow.

J	Wang, YH; Zhang, ZM				Wang, Yan-Hong; Zhang, Zhi-Ming			A two-lane lattice hydrodynamic model considering multiple information of preceding cars	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS			English	Article						Lattice hydrodynamic model; Multiple density difference and multiple flux difference; Traffic flow; Energy consumption; mKdV equation	INTER-VEHICLE COMMUNICATION; OPTIMAL VELOCITY MODEL; MODIFIED KDV EQUATION; TRAFFIC FLOW; JAMMING TRANSITION; FUEL CONSUMPTION; STABILIZATION; STABILITY	In this paper, a new lattice hydrodynamic model is proposed in two-lane traffic systems, considering multiple information of preceding cars. Multiple density difference and multiple flux difference effects are considered to improve traffic stability and reduce energy consumption. Stability condition is acquired by applying linear stability theory. Nonlinear analysis is conducted, the mKdV equation is derived, and the kink-antikink solution is obtained from the mKdV equation near the critical point. Numerical simulation validates theoretical analysis that the more information the drivers obtain, the smoother the traffic flow becomes, and the more the energy consumptions are reduced. Even it is found that considering only one preceding car with the combination of two types of information is better to improve traffic flow as well as save energy than considering three cars ahead with single type of information. This signifies that multiple density difference and multiple flux difference can enlarge the stable region and suppress traffic congestion as well as save energy effectively.

Rigorous Derivation of Nonlinear Scalar Conservation Laws from Follow-the-Leader Type Models via Many Particle Limit	ARCHIVE FOR RATIONAL MECHANICS AND ANALYSIS			English	Article							TRAFFIC FLOW; KINEMATIC WAVES; HYPERBOLIC SYSTEMS; HYDRODYNAMICS; EQUATIONS; EVOLUTION; DIFFUSION; BEHAVIOR; HIGHWAY; METRICS	We prove that the unique entropy solution to a scalar nonlinear conservation law with strictly monotone velocity and nonnegative initial condition can be rigorously obtained as the large particle limit of a microscopic follow-the-leader type model, which is interpreted as the discrete Lagrangian approximation of the nonlinear scalar conservation law. More precisely, we prove that the empirical measure (respectively the discretised density) obtained from the follow-the-leader system converges in the 1-Wasserstein topology (respectively in ) to the unique KruA3/4kov entropy solution of the conservation law. The initial data are taken in , nonnegative, and with compact support, hence we are able to handle densities with a vacuum. Our result holds for a reasonably general class of velocity maps (including all the relevant examples in the applications, for example in the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model for traffic flow) with a possible degenerate slope near the vacuum state. The proof of the result is based on discrete estimates and on a discrete version of the one-sided Oleinik-type condition. In particular, we prove that the regularizing effect for nonlinear scalar conservation laws is intrinsic to the discrete model.

J	Zhou, YF; Chen, SR				Zhou, Yufen; Chen, Suren			Dynamic Simulation of a Long-Span Bridge-Traffic System Subjected to Combined Service and Extreme Loads	JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Long-span bridges; Traffic system; Service loads; Extreme loads; Traffic flow; Dynamic performance; Dynamic effects	GROUND MOTION; ROAD VEHICLE; WIND	Long-span bridges support busy traffic and experience considerable wind loads on the bridge decks nearly every day. In addition to these two major service loads, some extreme loads such as earthquake, vehicle collision, or blast may also occur on the bridges simultaneously. Excessive dynamic responses of the bridge under extreme and service loads may not only cause local member damage, serviceability issues, or even global failure of the bridge structure, but also traffic safety concern on moving vehicles. A general simulation platform is established to investigate the dynamic performance of the bridge-traffic system under multiple service and extreme loads. The fully coupled bridge-traffic interaction model is developed by coupling the mode-based bridge model and all individual moving vehicles of the simulated stochastic traffic flow considering excitations from bridge deck roughness and other external dynamic loads. Through the established simulation platform, the global dynamic responses of the bridge and each individual vehicle subjected to various service and extreme loads can be rationally predicted in the time domain. As a demonstration, the proposed strategy is applied to a bridge-traffic system consisting of a prototype long-span cable-stayed bridge and stochastic traffic subjected to the excitations of road surface roughness, turbulent wind, and seismic ground motions. The vertical and lateral responses for the bridge and a representative vehicle are obtained and analyzed in different loading scenarios. Some observations are made based on the performance of both the prototype bridge and representative vehicle subjected to multiple dynamic (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

To investigate how the results may be affected by explicitly considering lanes and lane changing, we consider a road link that consists of two adjacent homogeneous lanes. We assume that traffic entering each lane already knows in which lane it wishes to exit at the end of the link, whether it wishes to exit in the same lane or in the other lane. We model the traffic flows in each lane using a cell transmission model but adapt it to allow for traffic moving from cells in one lane to cells in the other lane. The CTM is used because it handles the modelling of queues and their spillback in an intuitive and widely accepted manner, and our extensions of it allow congestion in one lane to spill back into adjacent lanes. In particular, we investigate how lane-changing and congestion are affected by varying the assumptions concerning two key behavioural parameters, namely the locations at which drivers wish to change lanes and the vehicle spacing needed for lane changing (gap acceptance) as compared to the spacing needed when staying in the same lane (car following). We conclude that there are many situations where modelling a link as a single lane will give a poor approximation to the underlying multi-lane behaviour, or be unable to capture issues of interest, and for those situations multi-lane modelling is appropriate.

Assessment of the effectiveness of fuel and toll pricing policies in motorway emissions: An ex-post analysis	RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS			English	Article						Fuel pricing; Toll pricing; Road pricing; Transportation policies; Elasticity; Emissions cost	IMPACTS	In this paper the environmental impacts of fuel and toll pricing policies were evaluated for eight Portuguese motorways for the period between 2008 and 2011. To perform such study, firstly the analysis of the elasticity was done to assess the sensitive of traffic demand. Then emission costs were estimated considering an integrated approach of environmental and human health impacts. Two motorway groups were analyzed: one originally built with both conventional and electronic toll systems (G1); and another recently equipped with non-stop electronic tolls (G2). The results show that the elasticity of the system changes with the fluctuation prices, particularly influenced by toll prices variation. During the analysis period, traffic volumes decreased (8-11% in G1, and 15-41% in G2). About 75% of traffic flow shows a high statistical significance correlation (p < 0.05) with toll prices, which highlight the impact of toll prices. Differences between emission costs can be close to 50% in those motorway groups. Nevertheless, due the absence of data in alternative routes, the obtained results show only the potential maximum environmental gains of these policies in motorways. This limitation is very important in the quantification of the environmental global impacts. Non-toll roads are usually characterized by slower speeds and higher emissions. Therefore the above mentioned gains can be converted, in these cases, in losses. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Fontes, T.; Pereira, S. R.; Bandeira, J. M.; Coelho, M.

J	Collotta, M; Pau, G				Collotta, Mario; Pau, Giovanni			NEW SOLUTIONS BASED ON WIRELESS NETWORKS FOR DYNAMIC TRAFFIC LIGHTS MANAGEMENT: A COMPARISON BETWEEN IEEE 802.15.4 AND BLUETOOTH	TRANSPORT AND TELECOMMUNICATION JOURNAL			English	Article						wireless sensor networks; road monitoring; traffic lights; intelligent transportation systems		The Wireless Sensor Networks are widely used to detect and exchange information and in recent years they have been increasingly involved in Intelligent Transportation System applications, especially in dynamic management of signalized intersections. In fact, the real-time knowledge of information concerning traffic light junctions represents a valid solution to congestion problems. In this paper, a wireless network architecture, based on IEEE 802.15.4 or Bluetooth, in order to monitor vehicular traffic flows near to traffic lights, is introduced. Moreover, an innovative algorithm is proposed in order to determine dynamically green times and phase sequence of traffic lights, based on measured values of traffic flows. Several simulations compare IEEE 802.15.4 and Bluetooth protocols in order to identify the more suitable communication protocol for ITS applications. Furthermore, in order to confirm the validity of the proposed algorithm for the dynamic management of traffic lights, some case studies have been considered and several simulations have been performed.

J	Kim, A; Hansen, M				Kim, Amy; Hansen, Mark			Some insights into a sequential resource allocation mechanism for en route air traffic management	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Air transportation; En route air traffic flow management (ATFM); Collaborative Trajectory Options Program (CTOP); Sequential resource allocation; Airline competition; Applied game theory		This paper presents a game theoretic model of a sequential capacity allocation process in a congestible transportation system. In this particular application, we investigate the governing principles at work in how airlines will time their requests for en route resources under capacity shortfalls and uncertain conditions, when flights are not able to take their preferred route at their preferred departure time slot due to the shortfalls. We examine a sequential "First Submitted First Assigned" (FSFA) capacity allocation process within an en route air traffic flow management (ATFM) program such as the Collaborative Trajectory Options Program (CTOP), which is a Federal Aviation Administration initiative that aims to manage en route capacity constraints brought on by inclement weather and capacity/demand imbalances. In the FSFA process, flights are assigned the best available routes and slots available at the time flight operators submit their preference requests during the planning period, in a sequential manner. Because flight operators compete with one another for resources, in such an allocation process they would be expected to make their requests as early as possible. However, because weather and traffic conditions - and therefore, the values of resources - can change significantly, flight operators may prefer to request resources later in the process rather than earlier. We use a game theoretic setup to understand how flight operators might tradeoff these conflicts and choose an optimal time to submit their preferences for their flights, as submission times are competitive responses by flight operators looking to maximize their benefits. We first develop a loss function that captures the expected utility of submitting preferences under uncertainty about operating conditions. Then, a conceptual model of the FSFA process is constructed using a simultaneous incomplete information game, where flight operators compete for the "prizes" of having submitted their inputs before others. A numerical study is performed in which it is demonstrated that preference submission times are heavily influenced by the general uncertainty surrounding weather and operational conditions of the ATFM program, and each flight operator's internal ability to handle this uncertainty. A key finding is that, in many of the scenarios presented, an optimal strategy for a flight operator is to submit their preferences at the very beginning of the planning period. If air traffic managers could expect to receive more submissions at the beginning of the planning period, they could more easily coordinate the ATFM program with other ATFM programs taking place or scheduled to take place, and they would have more opportunity to call another FSFA allocation route before the ATFM program begins, should conditions change enough to warrant this. Outputs of the model may provide some general insights to flight operators in planning submission strategies within competitive allocation processes such as FSFA. Also, this work may have a broader application to other sequential resource allocation strategies within congestible and controlled transportation systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The size of the data, the hidden causal dependence and the complexity of traffic time series are some of the obstacles that affect making reliable forecast at a reasonable cost, both time-wise and computationwise. To better prepare the data for traffic modeling, we introduce a multiple-step strategy to process the raw "Big Data" into compact time series that are better suited for regression and causality analysis. First, we use the Granger causality to define and determine the potential dependence among data, and produce a much condensed set of times series who are also highly dependent. Next, we deploy a decomposition algorithm to separate daily-similar trend and nonstationary bursts components from the traffic flow time series yielded by the Granger test. The decomposition results are then treated by two rounds of Lasso regression: the standard Lasso method is first used to quickly filter out most of the irrelevant data, followed by a robust Lasso method to further remove the disturbance caused by bursts components and recover the strongest dependence among the remaining data. Test results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the costs of building prediction models. Moreover, the obtained causal dependence graph reveals the relationship between the structure of road networks and the correlations among traffic time series.

J	Zhang, YR; Haghani, A				Zhang, Yanru; Haghani, Ali			A gradient boosting method to improve travel time prediction	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Short-term forecasting; Travel time; Ensemble learning; Machine learning; Gradient boosting regression tree; Random forest	TRAFFIC FLOW	Tree based ensemble methods have reached a celebrity status in prediction field. By combining simple regression trees with 'poor' performance, they usually produce high prediction accuracy. In contrast to other machine learning methods that have been treated as black-boxes, tree based ensemble methods provide interpretable results, while requiring little data preprocessing, are able to handle different types of predictor variables, and can fit complex nonlinear relationship. These properties make the tree based ensemble methods good candidates for solving travel time prediction problems. However, applications of tree-based ensemble algorithms in traffic prediction area are limited. In this paper, we employ a gradient boosting regression tree method (GBM) to analyze and model freeway travel time to improve the prediction accuracy and model interpretability. The gradient boosting tree method strategically combines additional trees by correcting mistakes made by its previous base models, therefore, potentially improves prediction accuracy. Different parameters' effect on model performance and correlations of input-output variables are discussed in details by using travel time data provided by INRIX along two freeway sections in Maryland. The proposed method is, then, compared with another popular ensemble method and a bench mark model. Study results indicate that the GBM model has its considerable advantages in freeway travel time prediction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Pang, MB; Zheng, SS; Cai, ZH				Pang Ming-bao; Zheng Sha-sha; Cai Zhang-hui			Simulation of three lanes one-way freeway in low visibility weather by possible traffic accidents	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Freeway; Low visibility weather; Vehicle accident; CA model; Road capacity	CAR ACCIDENTS; STOPPED CARS; COLLISION; VELOCITY; BLOCKAGE	The aim of this work is to investigate the traffic impact of low visibility weather on a freeway including the fraction of real vehicle rear-end accidents and road traffic capacity. Based on symmetric two-lane Nagel-Schreckenberg (STNS) model, a cellular automaton model of three-lane freeway mainline with the real occurrence of rear-end accidents in low visibility weather, which considers delayed reaction time and deceleration restriction, was established with access to real-time traffic information of intelligent transportation system (ITS). The characteristics of traffic flow in different visibility weather were discussed via the simulation experiments. The results indicate that incoming flow control (decreasing upstream traffic volume) and inputting variable speed limits (VSL) signal are effective in accident reducing and road actual traffic volume's enhancing. According to different visibility and traffic demand the appropriate control strategies should be adopted in order to not only decrease the probability of vehicle accidents but also avoid congestion.

Traffic jerk means the sudden braking and acceleration of vehicles, which has a significant impact on traffic movement. The nature of the model is researched by using linear and nonlinear analysis method. A thermodynamic theory is formulated to describe the phase transition and critical phenomenon in traffic flow. The time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation and the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation are derived to describe the traffic flow near the critical point and the traffic jam. In addition, the connection between the TDGL and the mKdV equations are also given. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Because of its irregular motion, a car performing JAD perturbs other cars following it, and these perturbations may grow to become the so-called secondary traffic jams. A basic theory for JAD (Nishi et al. 2013) does not consider accelerations of cars or the stability of traffic flow. In this paper, by introducing car-following behaviors, we implement these elements in JAD. Numerous previous studies on the instability of traffic flow showed that even in a region whose density is below a critical density, perturbation may grow if its initial magnitude is large. According to these previous studies, we expect that the perturbations caused by JAD, if they are sufficiently small, do not grow to become secondary traffic jams. Using a microscopic car-following model, we numerically confirmed that the stability of a flow obeying the model depends on the magnitude of JAD perturbations. On the basis of this knowledge, numerical results indicate that parameter regions exist where JAD allows traffic jams to be removed without causing secondary traffic jams. Moreover, JAD is robust against a parameter of acceleration in the model, as well as the choice of car-following models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A Riemann Solver is constructed, where the incoming and outgoing fluxes depend Holder continuously on the traffic density and on the drivers' turning preferences. However, various examples show that, if junction conditions are assigned in terms of Riemann Solvers, then the Cauchy problem on a network of roads can be ill posed, even for initial data having small total variation.

The difference between traffic demand-supply and boundary fluxes actually reflects the congestion level of freeway travel. This study investigates simultaneous traffic density and boundary flux estimation with data extracted from on-road detectors. The existing studies for traffic estimation mainly focus on the traffic parameters (density, velocity etc.) of mainline traffic and ignore flux fluctuations at boundary sections of the freeway. The authors propose a stochastic hybrid traffic flow model by extending the cell transmission model with Markovian multi-mode switching. A novel interacting multiple model filtering for simultaneous input and state estimation is developed for discrete-time Markovian switching systems with unknown input. A freeway segment of Interstate 80 East (I-80E) in Berkeley, Northern California, is chosen to investigate the performance of the developed approach. Traffic data is obtained from the performance measurement system.

J	Chen, Q; Wang, Y				Chen, Qun; Wang, Yan			Cellular automata (CA) simulation of the interaction of vehicle flows and pedestrian crossings on urban low-grade uncontrolled roads	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Vehicle; Pedestrian; Crossing; Uncontrolled road; Cellular automata (CA)	PARTICLE HOPPING MODELS; GAP ACCEPTANCE; TRAFFIC FLOW; STREET; BEHAVIOR; AGE; SELECTION	This paper discusses the interaction of vehicle flows and pedestrian crossings on uncontrolled low-grade roads or branch roads without separating barriers in cities where pedestrians may cross randomly from any location on both sides of the road. The rules governing pedestrian street crossings are analyzed, and a cellular automata (CA) model to simulate the interaction of vehicle flows and pedestrian crossings is proposed. The influence of the interaction of vehicle flows and pedestrian crossings on the volume and travel time of the vehicle flow and the average wait time for pedestrians to cross is investigated through simulations. The main results of the simulation are as follows: (1) The vehicle flow volume decreases because of interruption from pedestrian crossings, but a small number of pedestrian crossings do not cause a significant delay to vehicles. (2) If there are many pedestrian crossings, slow vehicles will have little chance to accelerate, causing travel time to increase and the vehicle flow volume to decrease. (3) The average wait time for pedestrians to cross generally decreases with a decrease in vehicle flow volume and also decreases with an increase in the number of pedestrian crossings. (4) Temporal and spatial characteristics of vehicle flows and pedestrian flows and some interesting phenomena such as "crossing belt" and "vehicle belt" are found through the simulations.

Due to the lack of modeling pedestrian behaviors under attracting incidents (incidents which attract pedestrians around to gather), this paper proposes a new cellular automata model aiming to reproduce the behaviors induced by such attracting incidents. When attracting incidents occur, the proposed model will classify pedestrians around the incidents into three groups: the "unaffected" type, the "stopped" type and the "onlooking" type. The "unaffected" type represents the pedestrians who are not interested in the attracting incidents and its dynamics are the same as that under normal circumstances which are the main target in the previous works. The "stopped" type represents the pedestrians are somewhat interested in the attracting incidents, but unwilling to move close to the venues. Its dynamics are determined by "stopped" utility which can make the pedestrians stop for a while. The "onlooking" type represents the pedestrians who show strong interest in the attracting incidents and intend to move close to the venues to gain more information. The "onlooking" pedestrians will take a series of reactions to attracting incidents, such as approaching to the venues, stopping and watching the attracting incidents, leaving the venues, which have all been considered in the proposed model. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model can capture the macro-characteristics of pedestrian traffic flow under normal circumstances and possesses the fundamental characteristics of the pedestrian behaviors under attracting incidents around which a torus-shaped crowd is typically formed.

Previous studies reveal that congestion not only slows down the traffic flow but also significantly increases emissions. This highlights the need of accounting for congestion-related emissions in transportation planning. In this paper, congestion-related emission is incorporated into a transit bus scheduling problem by a nonlinear programming model to minimize the total respirable suspended particle emissions during rush hours. A real-world instance is then formulated using the proposed model and solved by CPLEX in a case study. Computation results from the case study indicate that by taking congestion-related emission into account, the urban transportation planning can not only significantly reduce the total particle emissions, but also save passengers' travel time at the cost of relatively small increases in distance traveled.

J	Sheng, N; Tang, UW				Sheng, Ni; Tang, U. Wa			Spatial Techniques to Visualize Acoustic Comfort along Cultural and Heritage Routes for a World Heritage City	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						spatial techniques; acoustic comfort; cultural and heritage route; route-based tourism	GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION-SYSTEM; TRAFFIC NOISE; TOURISM; POLLUTION; GIS	This paper proposes to visualize acoustic comfort along tourist routes. Route-based tourism is crucial to the sustainability of tourism development in historic areas. Applying the concept of route-based tourism to guide tourists rambling along cultural and heritage routes can relieve overcrowded condition at hot scenic spots and increase the overall carrying capacity of the city. However, acoustic comfort along tourist routes is rarely addressed in academic studies and decision-making. Taking Macao as an example, this paper has studied pedestrian exposure to traffic noise along the cultural and heritage routes. The study is based on a GIS-based traffic noise model system with a high spatial resolution down to individual buildings along both sides of the street. Results show that tourists suffer from excessive traffic noise at certain sites, which may have negative impact on the promotion of route-based tourism in the long run. In addition, it is found that urban growth affects urban form and street layout, which in turn affect traffic flow and acoustic comfort in urban area. The present study demonstrates spatial techniques to visualize acoustic comfort along tourist routes, and the techniques are foreseen to be used more frequently to support effective tourism planning in the future.

Mountain roads where probability of land sliding is the highest, causes hurdles not only in the traffic flow but generate various traffic problems in the form of congestion, high accidents rate and waste of time. This paper introduces an agent-based model for modeling and simulation of the effects of landslide on the circulation of transports on mountain roads. This model is applied to the National Road No6 of Vietnam to visualize and analyze the effects of landslide on the road when it occurs. This model could help us to improve and optimally organize of landslide warning and rescue system on the road.

The existing rule-based algorithms are a substantial improvement over the uncoordinated case, but this way of coordination still lacks flexibility. This is because the traditional algorithms take the existing ramp metering systems as starting point, which has inherent limitations, as these systems were not designed to operate in a setting with coordination. In this study, a more fundamental approach is taken, by considering the network of a motorway segment with a small number of on-ramps, and addressing both internal performance and the role the network should play in its surrounding network. The fundamental approach has been expressed in a generic, scalable model for network management, and the quantitative hierarchical model. When this model is applied to ramp metering, it becomes easy to assign priorities to the different on-ramps and to the motorway. This way of coordinating on-ramps offers far greater flexibility to support various traffic management policies. Moreover, it offers a perspective to extend the managed area to networks of virtually any size.	[Meshkat, Amir; Zhi, Min; Vrancken, Jos L.

Work zone events create conditions that are different from both normal operating conditions and incident conditions. In this paper, four models were developed for forecasting traffic flow for planned work zone events. The four models are random forest, regression tree, multilayer feedforward neural network, and nonparametric regression. Both long-term and short-term traffic flow forecasting applications were investigated. Long-term forecast involves forecasting 24 h in advance using historical traffic data, and short-term forecasts involves forecasting 1 h and 45, 30, and 15 min in advance using real-time temporal and spatial traffic data. Models were evaluated using data from work zone events on two types of roadways, a freeway, i.e., I-270, and a signalized arterial, i.e., MO-141, in St. Louis, MO, USA. The results showed that the random forest model yielded the most accurate long-term and short-term work zone traffic flow forecasts. For freeway data, the most influential variables were the latest interval's look-back traffic flows at the upstream, downstream, and current locations. For arterial data, the most influential variables were the traffic flows from the three look-back intervals at the current location only.

Model-Based Methodology for Validation of Traffic Flow Detectors by Minimizing Human Bias in Video Data Processing	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Flow detectors; human observation bias; traffic videos; validation; Welch's t-test		This paper provides a model-based method for analysis and hypothesis testing for paired data where one source of data has to be validated against another source of data that contains subjective and dynamic errors. This study deals with human-observed flow counts collected from traffic videos of freeway cameras. The available videos are mainly used for the purpose of manual observation by transportation personnel in case of emergency. This amounts to a varying inconsistency of the quality of the videos, which presents an additional challenge when analyzing the data. Video processing cannot be performed due to the mentioned issues with regard to the video quality. The processing has to be manually performed by humans who unfortunately have an inherent bias. If the video data have to be used for validating flow detector sensors, then a technique that performs validation with subjective and dynamic erroneous data as a result of the human bias is needed. This paper presents a methodology to deal with this issue. It is based on statistical testing with heteroscedasticity, which is demonstrated through a case study using data from traffic flow detectors and traffic cameras installed on highways in the Southern Nevada Region. A model for the relationship between the video ratings and the distribution of the human errors is developed taking into consideration the human bias. A method for identification of faulty detectors is also demonstrated based on the developed technique.

J	Ding, ZM; Yang, B; Guting, RH; Li, YG				Ding, Zhiming; Yang, Bin; Gueting, Ralf Hartmut; Li, Yaguang			Network-Matched Trajectory-Based Moving-Object Database: Models and Applications	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Moving-object database; network-matched trajectory; spatiotemporal database; traffic flow analysis	TRACKING	Tracking and managing the locations of moving objects are essential in modern intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). However, a number of limitations in existing methods make them unsuitable for real-world ITS applications. In particular, Euclidean-based methods are not accurate enough in representing locations and in analyzing traffic, unless the locations are frequently updated. Network-based methods require either digital maps to be installed in moving objects or transmission of prediction policies, which inevitably increase the cost. To solve these problems, we propose a network-matched trajectory-based moving-object database (NMTMOD) mechanism and a traffic flow analysis method using the NMTMOD. In the NMTMOD, the locations of moving objects are tracked through a dense sampling and batch uploading strategy, and a novel edge-centric networkmatching method, which is running at the server side, is adopted to efficiently match the densely sampled GPS points to the network. In addition, a deviation-based trajectory optimization method is provided to minimize the trajectory size. Empirical studies with large real trajectory data set offer insight into the design properties of the proposed NMTMOD and suggest that the NMTMOD significantly outperforms other mobile-map free-moving-object database models in terms of precision of both location tracking and network-based traffic flow analysis.

J	Yeung, JS; Wong, YD; Secadiningrat, JR				Yeung, Jian Sheng; Wong, Yiik Diew; Secadiningrat, Julius Raditya			Lane-harmonised passenger car equivalents for heterogeneous expressway traffic	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Passenger car equivalent; Passenger car units; Urban expressways; Heterogeneous traffic; Differential speed limits; Multiple linear regression	FLOW; VEHICLES; HIGHWAYS; TRUCKS; TIME; PCU	In order to account for variations in traffic composition during traffic analysis, passenger car equivalent (PCE) factors are used to convert flow rates of various vehicle classes into flow rates in terms of passenger car units (PCUs). Earlier studies have developed various methods to estimate PCE values but only a few of them are based on uninterrupted traffic flow, particularly for flow regimes with heterogeneous traffic where differential (lower) speed limits are imposed on commercial vehicles. This paper proposes a lane-harmonisation approach, which leverages on the high variation in traffic composition across the lanes, to estimate PCE factors for urban expressways. Multiple linear regression is used and the PCE factors obtained for motorcycles, light goods vehicles, and heavy goods vehicles are 0.65, 1.53, and 2.75, respectively. The estimated capacity flow rate after the application of the obtained PCE factors is around 2200 PCUs per hour per lane. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, JL; Yang, H				Zhang, Junlin; Yang, Hai			Modeling route choice inertia in network equilibrium with heterogeneous prevailing choice sets	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Inertia; Route choice; Network equilibrium; Equilibrium preservation; Information provision; Bounded rationality	ROAD NETWORK; INFORMATION	The notion of inertia is originally a term in physics that describes the tendency of an object sustaining the same mode and its resistance of change in the state of motion. In the context of social and behavioral sciences, inertia is often understood as the endurance of stable relationships or reluctance in adjustment of status quo. In this paper, a precise definition of inertia under the criteria of route choice in the transportation network is presented. We then incorporate the concept of route choice inertia into the traffic assignment problem and propose a model of inertial user equilibrium (IUE). The inertial user equilibrium is compatible with the standard user equilibrium and extends UE with heterogeneous route choice inertia patterns. The variational inequality formulation is established. We show how travelers' heterogeneous inertia patterns may redistribute traffic flow and affect the original network equilibrium. Useful equivalent conditions for equilibrium preservation are obtained. The impact of traffic information provision to alleviate inertia is analyzed. The relationship between IUE and epsilon-BRUE is briefly discussed. And a number of numerical examples are conducted. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Roncoli, C; Papageorgiou, M; Papamichail, I				Roncoli, Claudio; Papageorgiou, Markos; Papamichail, Ioannis			Traffic flow optimisation in presence of vehicle automation and communication systems - Part I: A first-order multi-lane model for motorway traffic	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Traffic flow modelling; Multi-lane traffic models; Motorway traffic control; Model-based control	MERGES	Proposed or emerging vehicle automation and communication systems (VACS) may contribute to the mitigation of motorway traffic congestion on the basis of appropriate traffic control strategies. In this context, this paper presents,a novel first-order multi-lane macroscopic traffic flow model for motorways which is mainly intended for use within a related optimal control problem formulation. The model's starting point is close to the well-known CTM (cell-transmission model), which is modified and extended to consider additional aspects of the traffic dynamics, such as lane changing and the capacity drop, via appropriate procedures for computing lateral and longitudinal flows. The model has been derived with a view to combine realistic traffic flow description with a simple (linear or piecewise linear) mathematical form, which can be exploited for efficient optimal control problem formulations, as described in a companion (Part II) paper. Although the model has been primarily derived for use in future traffic conditions including VACS, it may also be used for conventional traffic flow representation. In fact, the accuracy of the proposed modelling approach is demonstrated through calibration and validation procedures using real data from an urban motorway located in Melbourne, Australia.

J	Zou, YJ; Hua, XD; Zhang, YR; Wang, YH				Zou, Yajie; Hua, Xuedong; Zhang, Yanru; Wang, Yinhai			Hybrid short-term freeway speed prediction methods based on periodic analysis	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						spatial and temporal correlation; multi-step prediction; freeway speed; periodic analysis; trigonometric regression	TRAFFIC FLOW PREDICTION; TRAVEL-TIME PREDICTION; SPACE NEURAL-NETWORKS; MULTIVARIATE; DYNAMICS; SERIES	Short-term traffic speed forecasting is an important issue for developing Intelligent Transportation Systems applications. So far, a number of short-term speed prediction approaches have been developed. Recently, some multivariate approaches have been proposed to consider the spatial and temporal correlation of traffic data. However, as traffic data often demonstrates periodic patterns, the existing methodologies often fail to take into account spatial and temporal information as well as the periodic features of traffic data simultaneously in the multi-step prediction. This paper comprehensively evaluated the multi-step prediction performance of space time (ST) model, vector autoregression (VAR), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models using the 5 minute freeway speed data collected from five loop detectors located on an eastbound segment of Interstate 394 freeway, in Minnesota. To further consider the cyclical characteristics of freeway speed data, hybrid prediction approaches were proposed to decompose speed into two different components: a periodic trend and a residual part. A trigonometric regression function is introduced to capture the periodic component and the residual part is modeled by the ST, VAR, and ARIMA models. The prediction results suggest that for multi-step freeway speed prediction, as the time step increases, the ST model demonstrates advantages over the VAR and ARIMA models. Comparisons among the ST, VAR, ARIMA, and hybrid models demonstrated that modeling the periodicity and the residual part separately can better interpret the underlining structure of the speed data. The proposed hybrid prediction approach can accommodate the periodic trends and provide more accurate prediction results when the forecasting horizon is greater than 30 min.

J	Zhou, YF; Chen, SR				Zhou, Yufen; Chen, Suren			Fully coupled driving safety analysis of moving traffic on long-span bridges subjected to crosswind	JOURNAL OF WIND ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL AERODYNAMICS			English	Article						Long-span bridges; Stochastic traffic; Crosswind; Vehicle safety; Accident	ROAD VEHICLES; WINDS	High-sided vehicles often experience considerable single-vehicle accident risks under crosswinds. Long-span cable-supported bridges are usually flexible, wind-sensitive and support considerable amount of vehicles on a daily basis. When vehicles are driven through a long-span bridge, the complex dynamic interactions among wind, vehicles and the bridge significantly affect not only the safety of the bridge members, but also passing vehicles. Therefore, realistic modeling of the bridge-traffic system by characterizing these critical coupling effects becomes essential for rationally assessing traffic safety of passing traffic through a long-span bridge. In most existing studies about traffic safety study on bridges, vehicle safety was assessed for only one single vehicle or uniformly distributed vehicles at a constant driving speed. It is known that the traffic flow on a long-span bridge is typically stochastic and vehicle speeds vary following some traffic rules. Based on the stochastic traffic flow simulation, two new analytical frameworks, one using mode superposition and the other using the finite element (FE) formulation, were proposed recently for the bridge-stochastic traffic system. By considering the full-coupling effects among all the vehicles of the traffic flow, bridge and wind, the dynamic response of each individual vehicle of the stochastic traffic can be accurately obtained for the first time. Built based on the recent advances made by the authors, an integrated dynamic interaction and safety assessment model of the fully-coupled bridge-traffic system is further developed without considering vehicle aerodynamic interference and shielding effects. Traffic safety of vehicles in the stochastic traffic through the prototype long-span cable-stayed bridge is investigated as a demonstration. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Solving the minimum toll revenue problem in real transportation networks	OPTIMIZATION LETTERS			English	Article						Transportation network; Toll pricing; minimum toll revenue; Large-scale optimization; Path generation	ALGORITHM	As a means to relieve traffic congestion, toll pricing has recently received significant attention by transportation planners. Inappropriate use of transportation networks is one of the major causes of network congestion. Toll pricing is a method of traffic management in which traffic flow is guided to proper time and path in order to reduce the total delay in the network. This article investigates a method for solving the minimum toll revenue problem in real and large-scale transportation networks. The objective of this problem is to find link tolls that simultaneously cause users to efficiently use the transportation network and to minimize the total toll revenues to be collected. Although this model is linear, excessive number of variables and constraints make it very difficult to solve for large-scale networks. In this paper, a path-generation algorithm is proposed for solving the model. Implementation of this algorithm for different networks indicates that this method can achieve the optimal solution after a few iterations and a proper CPU time.

J	Ramanujam, V; Balakrishnan, H				Ramanujam, Varun; Balakrishnan, Hamsa			Data-Driven Modeling of the Airport Configuration Selection Process	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Airport runway configuration; air traffic control; air transportation; decision processes; discrete-choice models; maximum-likelihood estimation	TRAFFIC FLOW MANAGEMENT; MULTINOMIAL PROBIT	The runway configuration is the set of the runways at an airport that are used for arrivals and departures at any time. While many factors, including weather, expected demand, environmental considerations, and coordination of flows with neighboring airports, influence the choice of runway configuration, the actual selection decision is made by air traffic controllers in the airport tower. As a result, the capacity of an airport at any time is dependent on the behavior of human decision makers. This paper develops a statistical model to characterize the configuration selection decision process using empirical observations. The proposed approach, based on the discrete-choicemodeling framework, identifies the influence of various factors in terms of the utility function of the decision maker. The parameters of the utility functions are estimated through likelihood maximization. Correlations between different alternatives are captured using a multinomial "nested logit" model. A key novelty of this study is the quantitative assessment of the effect of inertia, or the resistance to configuration changes, on the configuration selection process. The developed models are used to predict the runway configuration 3 h ahead of time, given operating conditions such as wind, visibility, and demand. Case studies based on data from Newark (EWR) and La-Guardia (LGA) airports show that the proposed model predicts runway configuration choices significantly better than a baseline model that only considers the historical frequencies of occurrence of different configurations.

J	Coifman, B				Coifman, Benjamin			Empirical flow-density and speed-spacing relationships: Evidence of vehicle length dependency	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Traffic flow theory; Fundamental relationship; Highway traffic; Macroscopic models; Microscopic models; Congested traffic	TRAFFIC FLOW; FUNDAMENTAL RELATIONSHIP; KINEMATIC WAVES; HIGHWAY; BOTTLENECKS; FREEWAYS; MODEL	Traffic flow theory has come to a point where conventional, fixed time averaged data are limiting our insight into critical behavior both at the macroscopic and microscopic scales. This paper develops a methodology to measure relationships of density and vehicle spacing on freeways. These relationships are central to most traffic flow theories but have historically been difficult to measure empirically. The work leads to macroscopic flow-density and microscopic speed-spacing relationships in the congested regime derived entirely from dual loop detector data and then verified against the NGSIM data set. The methodology eliminates the need to seek out stationary conditions and yields clean relationships that do not depend on prior assumptions of the curve shape before fitting the data. Upon review of the clean empirical relationships a key finding of this work is the fact that many of the critical parameters of the macroscopic flow-density and microscopic speed-spacing relationships depend on vehicle length, e.g., upstream moving waves should travel through long vehicles faster than through short vehicles. Thus, the commonly used assumption of a homogeneous vehicle fleet likely obscures these important phenomena. More broadly, if waves travel faster or slower depending on the length of the vehicles through which the waves pass, then the way traffic is modeled should be updated to explicitly account for inhomogeneous vehicle lengths.

Exhaust samples from petrol and diesel cars (Euro 3 to Euro 5) were collected in a chassis dynamometer facility. To simulate the real-world driving conditions, three ARTEMIS cycles were followed: road, to simulate a fluid traffic flow and urban with hot and cold starts, to simulate driving conditions in cities. Samples were analysed for the water-soluble ions, for the elemental composition and for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), respectively, by ion chromatography, inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Nitrate and phosphate were the major water-soluble ions in the exhaust particles emitted from diesel and petrol vehicles, respectively. The amount of material emitted is affected by the vehicle age. For vehicles >= Euro 4, most elements were below the detection limits. Sodium, with emission factors in the ranges 23.5-62.4 and 78.2-227 mu g km(-1), for petrol and diesel Euro 3 vehicles, respectively, was the major element. The emission factors of metallic elements indicated that diesel vehicles release three to five times more than petrol automobiles. Element emissions under urban cycles are higher than those found for on-road driving, being three or four times higher, for petrol vehicles, and two or three times, for diesel vehicles. The difference between cycles is mainly due to the high emissions for the urban cycle with hot start-up. As registered for elements, most of the PAH emissions for vehicles >= Euro 4 were also below the detection limits. Regardless of the vehicle models or driving cycles, the two- to four-ring PAHs were always dominant. Naphthalene, with emission factors up to 925 mu g km(-1), was always the most abundant PAH. The relative cancer risk associated with naphthalene was estimated to be up to several orders of magnitude higher than any of the chemical species found in the PM phase. The highest PAH emission factors were registered for diesel-powered vehicles. The condition of the vehicle can exert a decisive influence on both element and PAH emissions.

J	Kaygisiz, O; Duzgun, S; Yildiz, A; Senbil, M				Kaygisiz, Omur; Duzgun, Sebnem; Yildiz, Ahmet; Senbil, Metin			Spatio-temporal accident analysis for accident prevention in relation to behavioral factors in driving: The case of South Anatolian Motorway	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						Driver characteristics; Driver choices; Behavioral factors in driving; Spatio-temporal accident analysis; Hotspot identification; Network kernel density estimation	SPATIAL-ANALYSIS; SPEED; NETWORK	Analyzing the pattern of traffic accidents on road segments can highlight the hazardous locations where the accidents occur frequently and help to determine problematic parts of the roads. The objective of this paper is to utilize accident hotspots to analyze the effect adifferent measures on the behavioral factors in driving. Every change in the road and its environment affects the choices of the driver and therefore the safety of the road itself. A spatio-temporal analysis of hotspots therefore can highlight the road segments where measures had positive or negative effects on the behavioral factors in driving. In this paper 2175 accidents resulted in injury or death on the South Anatolian Motorway in Turkey for the years between 2006 and 2009 are considered. The network-based kernel density estimation is used as the hotspot detection method and the K-function and the nearest neighbor distance methods are taken into account to check the significance of the hotspots. A chi-square test is performed to find out whether temporal changes on hotspots are significant or not. A comparison of characteristics related driver attributes like age, experience, etc. for accidents in hotspots vs. accidents outside of hotspots is performed to see if the temporal change of hotspots is caused by structural changes on the road. For a better understanding of the effects on the driver characteristics, the accidents are analyzed in five groups based on three different grouping schemes. In the first grouping approach, all accident data are considered. Then the accident data is grouped according to direction of the traffic flow. Lastly, the accident data is classified in terms of the vehicle type. The resultant spatial and temporal changes in the accident patterns are evaluated and changes on the road structure related to behavioral factors in driving are suggested. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To avoid clashes, different lane-changing rules are required. In this paper, a two-lane cellular automata model is proposed to investigate the traffic flow patterns in narrow water channels. Numerical experiments show that ship interaction can form "lumps" in traffic flow which will significantly depress the flux. We suggest that the lane-changing frequency of fast ships should be limited. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our results show that considering each commuter's fuel cost and emission cost only enhances his trip cost and the system's total cost, but does not influence on his optimal time headway at the origin under the minimum total cost. The results can help commuters to optimize their time headway at the origin. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results indicate that two preceding cars' average velocity has significant effects on the following car's motion. Then an improved car-following model considering two preceding cars' average velocity was proposed and calibrated based on full velocity difference model and some numerical simulations were carried out to study how two preceding cars' average speed are affected the starting process and the traffic flow evolution process with an initial small disturbance, the results indicate that the improved car-following model can qualitatively describe the impacts of two preceding cars' average velocity on traffic flow and that taking two preceding cars' average velocity into account in designing the control strategy for the cooperative adaptive cruise control system can improve the stability of traffic flow, suppress the appearance of traffic jams and increase the capacity of signalized intersections.

J	Zhang, G; Sun, DH; Liu, WN; Liu, H				Zhang, Geng; Sun, Di-Hua; Liu, Wei-Ning; Liu, Hui			Traffic stability of a car-following model considering driver's desired velocity	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B			English	Article						Traffic flow; car-following model; driver's desired velocity; Burgers equation; mKdV equation	DYNAMICAL MODEL; FULL VELOCITY; SIMULATION; DELAY	In this paper, a new car-following model is proposed by considering driver's desired velocity according to Transportation Cyber Physical Systems. The effect of driver's desired velocity on traffic flow has been investigated through linear stability theory and nonlinear reductive perturbation method. The linear stability condition shows that driver's desired velocity effect can enlarge the stable region of traffic flow. From nonlinear analysis, the Burgers equation and mKdV equation are derived to describe the evolution properties of traffic density waves in the stable and unstable regions respectively. Numerical simulation is carried out to verify the analytical results, which reveals that traffic congestion can be suppressed efficiently by taking driver's desired velocity effect into account.

In this paper, the dynamic road risk for pedestrian evacuation in a densely populated area of Beijing was studied with consideration of different influencing factors. Firstly, the eight influencing factors including road width, node degree, safety betweenness, road resistor coefficient, building threat, pedestrian counterflow, illegal vehicle parking and traffic flow were considered to assess the road risk for pedestrian evacuation. Secondly, based on complex network theory, electric circuit theory and real situation of the roads, the comprehensive assessment function for road risk was developed quantitatively based on the eight influencing factors. Thirdly, we analyzed road risk for pedestrian evacuation considering different situations: current condition, regular condition, and optimal condition; the risk distribution maps were drawn to directly show the risk level. Through assessments, the roads with high risk for pedestrian evacuation were found, and an optimized evacuation plan was obtained and analyzed. This mathematical model can guide the emergency evacuation in real time. The process and the results are essential for improving the efficiency of evacuations which should considerably reduce the possibility of injuries, deaths and other losses in the disaster.

The numerical results illustrate that the electric vehicle's behavior of exchanging battery at the charge station can destroy the stability of traffic flow and produce some prominent jams, and that the influences are related to the electric vehicle's driving range, i.e., the shorter the driving range is, the greater the effects are.

J	Astarita, V; Guido, G; Mongelli, D; Giofre, VP				Astarita, Vittorio; Guido, Giuseppe; Mongelli, Domenico; Giofre, Vincenzo Pasquale			A CO-OPERATIVE METHODOLOGY TO ESTIMATE CAR FUEL CONSUMPTION BY USING SMARTPHONE SENSORS	TRANSPORT			English	Article						fuel consumption; traffic flow; smartphone; sustainable transportation; co-operative systems	INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS	The European Commission has recently promoted research programs aimed at finding solutions to the ever more compelling problem of air pollution from road vehicles and has also indicated a better sustainability among the possible impacts of co-operative Intelligent Transportation Systems. In fact, many practical solutions can be developed that allow drivers and management to optimise resources and to contain costs and the emissions of pollutants by applying communication systems between vehicles (Vehicle-to-Vehicle - V2V) and between vehicles and infrastructure (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure - V2I). Along this mainstream this paper present a co-operative system which offer drivers the ability to manage their consumption and driving style, suggesting corrections to the usually adopted behaviour. The new contribution of this paper is both the co-operative approach between drivers to achieve a common goal of a better common energy consumption strategy and a methodology to estimate fuel consumption just by using Satellite data obtained from a simple smartphone. Since the fuel consumption has to be evaluated with regards to the specific vehicle type the system is based also on crowdsourcing of the specific vehicle consumption performances. The paper describes a system that gathers data on fuel consumption from the co-operating drivers that can build together the data set necessary to the system itself once they accept this paper paradigm: crowd sourced co-operation for a smarter and more sustainable transport system.

J	Fang, J; Jin, J				Fang, Jie; Jin, Jing			Intelligent Algorithms for Reducing Short-Term Traffic State Prediction Error in Active Traffic Management	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						ATDM; Heterogeneous Links; Macroscopic Traffic Flow Model; METANET	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; FLOW; HIGHWAY	Macroscopic traffic flow models have been widely used to provide reliable prediction inputs for active transportation and demand management (ATDM). The representative models include METANET, FREFLOW, and KRONOS. In recent development of ATDM, METANET-based prediction models have started to more attention with their convenience of formulating several important macroscopic control variables, such as speed limit and ramp flow. However, applying METANET models on real-world observations (e.g., loop detector data) may experience significant performance issues, especially when applied to a corridor with heterogeneous links. Heterogeneous links refer to adjacent links that have different macroscopic traffic flow characteristics such as free flow speed and capacity. The heterogeneity is usually caused by changes in road geometry and environment, which commonly exist in urban freeway networks. This article provides an in-depth study to investigate the error mechanism of this problem and proposes several effective methods to improve the performance of METANET model over heterogeneous links. It is found in this article that applying some dynamic formulations to the convention term of the speed equation in METANET can significantly reduce the impact of link heterogeneity issue. The proposed method was evaluated using field loop detector data collected at I-894 corridor in Milwaukee, WI.

J	Jamshidnejad, A; De Schutter, B				Jamshidnejad, A.; De Schutter, B.			Estimation of the generalised average traffic speed based on microscopic measurements	TRANSPORTMETRICA A-TRANSPORT SCIENCE			English	Article						time-space-mean speed; average traffic speed; microscopic point measurements	SINGLE-LOOP DETECTORS; SPACE-MEAN-SPEED; DUAL-LOOP; TRAVEL	The average speed of vehicles plays an important role in traffic engineering. In almost any model-based traffic monitoring, analysis, or control application the average speed is required as a measure of performance or as an input for traffic models used to simulate fuel consumption, vehicle emissions, or traffic noise. The average speed is also used in algorithms that estimate the travel time. It also appears in the fundamental equation of traffic where density is calculated based on the average speed and flow. This article presents a new methodology for estimating the time-space-mean speed (TSMS), which is an equivalent for the generalised speed introduced by Edie [1963. "Discussion of Traffic Stream Measurements and Definitions". Proceedings of the 2nd international symposium on the theory of traffic flow. Paris, France, 139-154]. To this aim, first tight upper and lower bounds are developed for the TSMS using individual vehicle speeds that are obtained via point measurements. To estimate the TSMS from these bounds, and to deal with the cases where the trajectories of the vehicles might not be straight lines, a convex combination of the upper and lower bounds is introduced. In order to assess the convex combination and to compare its performance with other formulas in the literature, two real-life data sets corresponding to the NGSIM data for the I-880 highway in the San Francisco Bay Area, and the A13 data near Rotterdam-Delft are used. At the end, MATLAB simulations are presented to cover scenarios that are not included in the available real-life data sets. The results produced by the new formula, both for the real-life data sets and for MATLAB simulations, are found to be more accurate compared with other available formulas in the literature.

The author used manual recording, live cameras, vehicle dynamic weighing system (WIM) to conduct traffic investigation in a continuous 24-hour period. Basing on these data in Hebei province, we established typical vehicle load spectrum using probabilistic and statistical methods, and deduced a standard fatigue vehicle model on this basis. Then we prepared random load spectrum by MATLAB and realized loading it on a finite element model (FEM). Next, the paper assessed the fatigue life of in-service highway bridges that in Hebei by comparing typical vehicle load and random vehicle load. Results showed that vehicle speed has significant influence on fatigue damage under typical vehicle load. Equivalent stress amplitude is small in two operational states under random vehicle load, the general operation state and intensive operation state. Fatigue damage to bridge under general operation is obvious. After verified the applicability of the standard fatigue vehicle model, we can believe that this model developed in this article can be further used as a reference to check highway fatigue damage in the entire Hebei province. Moreover, all the results showed that the bridges wouldn't get fatigue failure under a normal operation state when there is no impact of environmental factors.

The noise of an isolated sound event is assessed by short term measurement of the sound exposure level, L-AE. On the other hand, much legislation and many regulations and guidelines employ the day and the night average sound level, L-AeqT, with needs long term measurements. It is shown how to estimate the mean L-AeqT and its uncertainty from a representative sample of L-AE and traffic flow records. Non-Gaussian distribution of L-AeqT is assumed. For illustrative purposes, aircraft noise measurements were carried out. With any type of transportation noise, the presented methods are restricted to the extrapolation of noise events measurements at discrete monitoring stations from where the data comes.

We assume the capability of a MoD system to be enhanced by deploying robotic shared vehicles that can autonomously cruise the streets to be hailed by users. A key challenge of the MoD system is that of real-time, fine-grained mobility demand and traffic flow sensing and prediction. This paper presents novel Gaussian process (GP) decentralized data fusion and active sensing algorithms for real-time, fine-grained traffic modeling and prediction with a fleet of MoD vehicles. The predictive performance of our decentralized data fusion algorithms are theoretically guaranteed to be equivalent to that of sophisticated centralized sparse GP approximations. We derive consensus filtering variants requiring only local communication between neighboring vehicles. We theoretically guarantee the performance of our decentralized active sensing algorithms. When they are used to gather informative data for mobility demand prediction, they can achieve a dual effect of fleet rebalancing to service mobility demands. Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets shows that our algorithms are significantly more time-efficient and scalable in the size of data and fleet while achieving predictive performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art algorithms. Note to Practitioners-Knowing, understanding, and predicting spatiotemporally varying traffic phenomena in real time has become increasingly important to the goal of achieving smooth-flowing, congestion-free traffic in densely populated urban cities, which motivates our work here. This paper addresses the following fundamental problem of data fusion and active sensing: How can a fleet of autonomous robotic vehicles or mobile probes actively cruise a road network to gather and assimilate the most informative data for predicting a spatiotemporally varying traffic phenomenon like a mobility demand pattern or traffic flow? Existing centralized solutions are poorly suited because they suffer from a single point of failure and incur huge communication, space, and time overheads with large data and fleet. This paper proposes novel efficient and scalable decentralized data fusion and active sensing algorithms with theoretical performance guarantees. The practical applicability of our algorithms is not restricted to traffic monitoring [1]-[4]; they can be used in other environmental sensing applications such as mineral prospecting [5], precision agriculture, monitoring of ocean/freshwater phenomena (e.g., plankton bloom) [6]-[9], forest ecosystems, pollution (e.g., oil spill), or contamination. Note that the decentralized data fusion component of our algorithms can also be used for static sensors and passive mobile probes and, interestingly, adapted to parallel implementations to be run on a cluster of machines for achieving efficient and scalable probabilistic prediction (i.e., with predictive uncertainty) with large data. Empirical results show that our algorithms can perform well with two datasets featuring real-world traffic phenomena in the densely-populated urban city of Singapore. A limitation of our algorithms is that the decentralized data fusion components assume independence between multiple traffic phenomena while the decentralized active sensing components only work for a single traffic phenomenon. So, in our future work, we will generalize our algorithms to perform active sensing of multiple traffic phenomena and remove the assumption of independence between them.

J	Xiong, ZT; Olstam, J				Xiong, Zhitao; Olstam, Johan			Orchestration of driving simulator scenarios based on dynamic actor preparation and automated action planning	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Driving simulators; Scenario orchestration; Surrounding vehicles; Experimental design; Autonomous vehicle		In driving simulation, a scenario includes definitions of the road environment, the traffic situation, simulated vehicles' interactions with the participant's vehicle and measurements that need to be collected. The scenarios need to be designed in such a way that the research questions to be studied can be answered, which commonly imply exposing the participant for a couple of predefined specific situations that has to be both realistic and repeatable. This article presents an integrated algorithm based on Dynamic Actor Preparation and Automated Action Planning to control autonomous simulated vehicles in the simulation in order to generate predefined situations. This algorithm is thus able to plan driving actions for autonomous vehicles based on specific tasks with relevant contextual information as well as handling longitudinal transportation of simulated vehicles based on the contextual information in an automated manner. The conducted experiment shows that the algorithm is able to guarantee repeatability under autonomous traffic flow. The presented algorithm can benefit not only the driving simulation community, but also relevant areas, such as autonomous vehicle and in-vehicle device design by providing them with an algorithm for target pursue and driving task accomplishment, which can be used to design a human-vehicle cooperation system in the coming era of autonomous driving.

Marginal cost congestion pricing based on the network fundamental diagram	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Network fundamental diagram; Spatial spread of congestion; Marginal cost congestion pricing; Time-varying cordon toll; Agent-based transport simulation	URBAN; MODEL; EQUILIBRIUM; HYSTERESIS; DEMAND; TOLL	Congestion pricing schemes have been traditionally derived based on analytical representations of travel demand and traffic flows, such as in bottleneck models. A major limitation of these models, especially when applied to urban networks, is the inconsistency with traffic dynamics and related phenomena such as hysteresis and the capacity drop. In this study we propose a new method to derive time-varying tolling schemes using the concept of the Network Fundamental Diagram (NFD). The adopted method is based on marginal cost pricing, while it also enables to account realistically for the dynamics of large and heterogeneous traffic networks. We derive two alternative cordon tolls using network-aggregated traffic flow conditions: a step toll that neglects the spatial distribution of traffic by simply associating the marginal costs of any decrease in production within the NFD to the surplus of traffic; and a step toll that explicitly accounts for how network performance is also influenced by the spatial variance in a 3D-NFD. This pricing framework is implemented in the agent-based simulation model MATSim and applied to a case study of the city of Zurich. The tolling schemes are compared with a uniform toll, and they highlight how the inhomogeneous distribution of traffic may compromise the effectiveness of cordon tolls. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Schulte, N; Tan, S; Venkatram, A				Schulte, Nico; Tan, Si; Venkatram, Akula			The ratio of effective building height to street width governs dispersion of local vehicle emissions	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Building effects; Urban dispersion; Vertical mixing; Traffic related pollutants; Building aspect ratio; Transit oriented development	OKLAHOMA-CITY; WIND-TUNNEL; MEAN FLOW; PART I; TURBULENCE; URBAN; MODEL; CANYON; FIELD; MANHATTAN	Analysis of data collected in street canyons located in Hanover, Germany and Los Angeles, USA, suggests that street-level concentrations of vehicle-related pollutants can be estimated with a model that assumes that vertical turbulent transport of emissions dominates the governing processes. The dispersion model relates surface concentrations to traffic flow rate, the effective aspect ratio of the street, and roof level turbulence. The dispersion model indicates that magnification of concentrations relative to those in the absence of buildings is most sensitive to the aspect ratio of the street, which is the ratio of the effective height of the buildings on the street to the width of the street.

J	Yigiter, OC; Tanyel, S				Yigiter, Ozlem Ceyhan; Tanyel, Serhan			Lane by lane analysis of vehicle time headways - Case study of Izmir ring roads in Turkey	KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						freeway; lane by lane analysis; Kolmogorov - Smirnov test; Cowan M3 distribution; proportion of free vehicles	PARAMETERS	The studies on headway characteristics of traffic flow in Turkey are mainly dealing with signalized arterials, intersection approaches or roundabouts. Only a few studies can be found on headway characteristics of uninterrupted flow facilities and nearly none of them are on lane by lane basis. In this study, the authors are modeling headways of vehicles at zmir ring roads by lane by lane principle. The study demonstrates that lognormal distribution is an effective tool to define headways. In addition, the applicability of Cowan M3 distribution to time headways is investigated. Proportion of free vehicles is modeled for different lanes. The results show that traffic flow in the middle lane is highly affected by the vehicles in other lanes. Vehicles in the outer lane can be assumed to arrive randomly, but they are also disturbed by vehicles in other lanes. These results can be used in capacity and performance analysis of freeway segments, ramp junctions and weaving areas.

The stability condition is deduced from the linear stability analysis for two-lane freeways. Also, the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation is obtained to describe the traffic phase transition resulted from traffic interruption probability through nonlinear analysis in two-lane system. The numerical simulation results validate that the traffic interruption probability further improves the stability of traffic flow on two-lane freeways.

The neutral stability condition of the new model is obtained through linear stability analysis theory. The results show that the stable region on the phase diagram will be enlarged by considering driver's anticipation effect but shrunk with the consideration of on-ramp effect. In order to depict traffic jamming transition, the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation near the critical point is derived via nonlinear reductive perturbation method. The propagation behavior of traffic densitywave can be described by the kink-antikink solution of the mKdV equation. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the analytical results, and all the results confirm that both driver's anticipation effect and on-ramp effect affect the traffic stability of the main road importantly.

J	Sharma, S				Sharma, Sapna			Effect of driver's anticipation in a new two-lane lattice model with the consideration of optimal current difference	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS			English	Article						Traffic flow; Driver's anticipation effect; Two-lane system; Optimal current difference	TRAFFIC INTERRUPTION PROBABILITY; JAMMING TRANSITION; HYDRODYNAMIC MODELS; NUMERICAL TESTS; CONTINUUM MODEL; FLOW MODEL; EQUATION	In this paper, a new lattice hydrodynamic traffic flow model is proposed by considering the driver's anticipation effect (DAE) in sensing optimal current difference (OCD) for two-lane system. The effect of anticipation parameter on the stability of traffic flow is examined through linear stability analysis and shown that it can significantly enlarge the stability region on the phase diagram. Nonlinear analysis is conducted, and mKdV equation is derived to describe propagation behavior of a density wave near the critical point. The driver's physical delay in sensing optimal current difference effect is also investigated and found that it has different effect on two-lane traffic based on whether lane changing is allowed or not. Simulation results are found in good agreement with the theoretical findings, which confirms that traffic jam can be suppressed efficiently by considering the DAEOCD effect in a two-lane traffic system.

However, there are many traffic jams every day and the number of accidents is on the increase. Vehicle ad hoc network (VANET) is a high speed mobile network that enables various application services for driver safety and traffic flow improvement. It has low reliability in multi-hop communication environment. The major causes for this are link breakage and increased transmission delay due to high moving speed of vehicles and frequent change in topology for maintaining a communication network. To improve the reliability of VANET routing protocols, many studies have been carried out but to apply the findings from these studies for practical purposes in the real world, many problems still exist. It is because existing simulators only evaluate network performance such as packet delivery rate, packet delay, and throughput via numerical method. Therefore, the real world factors such as road patterns and traffic signal system are not taken into account in existing NS-2 simulation. However, the real world factors are very import in vehicle communication environment because it decided vehicle velocity, vehicle density and network topology. These are important factors influencing the performance of the protocol. Therefore, this paper proposes a new simulation method based on the real world factors to improve reliability of VANET routing protocols. We experimented to demonstrate the performance differences between the proposed simulation and only NS-2 simulation on existing VANET routing protocols.

J	Hosseinlou, MH; Kheyrabadi, SA; Zolfaghari, A				Hosseinlou, Mansour Hadji; Kheyrabadi, Salman Aghidi; Zolfaghari, Abbas			Determining optimal speed limits in traffic networks	IATSS RESEARCH			English	Article						Speed limit; Societal cost; Environment pollutants; Travel time; Traffic accidents; Fuel consumption		Determining the speed limit of road transport systems has a significant role in the speedmanagement of vehicles. In most cases, setting a speed limit is considered as a trade-off between reducing travel time on one hand and reducing road accidents on the other, and the two factors of vehicle fuel consumption and emission rate of air pollutants have been neglected. This paper aims to evaluate optimal speed limits in traffic networks in a way that economized societal costs are incurred. In this study, experimental and field data as well as data from simulations are used to determine how speed is related to the emission of pollutants, fuel consumption, travel time, and the number of accidents. This paper also proposes a simple model to calculate the societal costs of travel and relate them to speed. As a case study, using emission test results on cars manufactured domestically and by simulating the suburban traffic flow by Aimsun software, the total societal costs of the Shiraz-Marvdasht motorway, which is one of the most traversed routes in Iran, have been estimated. The results of the study show that from a societal perspective, the optimal speed would be 73 km/h, and from a road user perspective, it would be 82 km/h (in 2011, the average speed of the passing vehicles on that motorway was 82 km/h). The experiments in this paper were run on three different vehicles with different types of fuel. In a comparative study, the results show that the calculated speed limit is lower than the optimal speed limits in Sweden, Norway, and Australia.

In this brief, we study the resource allocation from a more comprehensive perspective where both allocating the capacities of networks and distributing the rates of traffic flows are considered. We build an optimization problem to optimize the resource allocation and maximize the network utility at the same time. Moreover, we design an iterative algorithm to find the optimal solution. The convergence of this algorithm is supported by theoretical proofs and simulation results. Our work may give insights to the plan of resource allocation in future communication networks.

The study is based on field observations and, accordingly, traffic data were collected on a two-lane National Highway in India. The measures, percent time-spent-following (PTSF) and average travel speed (ATS) w ere estimated using easily collectible field data considering both two-way and directional segments. The actual PTSF values were observed to be lower than the expected values. This lack of conformity is probably because of drivers' impatience that increases with the platoon length and delay. The ATS was also measured in the field and compared to those obtained using HCM. ATS was observed to be insensitive to flow in mixed traffic situations because of frequent platoon formation. In addition, a direct assessment of LOS in the field indicates over-prediction, which is attributed to the presence of a sizable proportion of slower vehicles based on users' opinion poll.

The developing economy and changing social status of the population increases the need for mobility. Therefore, urban transport flow is increasing, resulting in traffic congestions, since the street network throughput in practice does not change. The negative effect caused by the traffic congestions is most notable in the largest cities, where traffic density is relatively high, with characteristically low and often variable speed (acceleration and deceleration). We present in this paper a modification of General Motors (GM) traffic flow simulation model in order to identify best possible prerequisites for traffic flow management. The forecasting model employs the following independent variables: vehicle movement speeds, service time (traffic light signal duration), traffic flow intensity, average service frequencies, and the lengths of formed queues. By specifying different functional forms of response time we propose a generalized methodology for traffic management and obtain a theory, which is demonstrated in this paper through both numerical simulation and theoretical analyses. The developed simulation model based on GM's car following model shows good correlation to the field data. To this end, this paper presents a designed assessment method for the short-term congestion, expressing the negative impact of the transport system in monetary units.

J	Oh, S; Yeo, H				Oh, Simon; Yeo, Hwasoo			Impact of stop-and-go waves and lane changes on discharge rate in recovery flow	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Capacity drop; Lane change; Stop-and-go wave; Discharge rate; Asymmetric traffic flow theory	CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; TRAFFIC OSCILLATIONS; CAPACITY DROP; RELAXATION; MERGES	In an effort to uncover traffic conditions that trigger discharge rate reductions near active bottlenecks, this paper analyzed individual vehicle trajectories at a microscopic level and documented the findings. Based on an investigation of traffic flow involving diverse traffic situations, a driver's tendency to take a significant headway after passing stop-and-go waves was identified as one of the influencing factors for discharge rate reduction. Conversely, the pattern of lane changers caused a transient increase in the discharge rate until the situation was relaxed after completing the lane-changing event. Although we observed a high flow from the incoming lane changers, the events ultimately caused adverse impacts on the traffic such that the disturbances generated stop-and-go waves. Based on this observation, we regard upstream lane changes and stop-and-go waves as the responsible factors for the decreased capacity at downstream of active bottlenecks. This empirical investigation also supports the resignation effect, the regressive effect, and the asymmetric behavioral models in differentiating acceleration and deceleration behaviors.

J	Zhao, HT; Li, JR; Nie, C				Zhao, Han-Tao; Li, Jing-Ru; Nie, Cen			Cellular automaton models for traffic flow considering opposite driving of an emergency vehicle	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Traffic flow; cellular automaton; emergency vehicle; opposite driving	EVACUATION; CARS	Aiming at two-lane road, this paper establishes three models to analyze the opposite-overtaking rules of emergency vehicle based on cellular automaton (CCA) model. Based on the simulation of mixed traffic flow for multi-density conditions, the density-speed diagrams have been obtained consequently. According to the analysis, when the traffic density of the opposite lane is low, the opposite driving behavior of emergency vehicle can improve the average speed effectively. At the same time, if the cocurrent lane is in high-density traffic, the traffic in the opposite lane will be disturbed, but the vehicles in the cocurrent lane will not be affected. The paper has further discussed the influence of different emergency vehicle driving behaviors on traffic. The results reveal that as the traffic of the opposite lane is in a low-density range, if emergency vehicle operates overtaking behavior precisely, the greater the density of the cocurrent lane is, the more obviously the speed improve. Meanwhile large random fluctuation of overtaking times will occur. While the risky lane change behavior displays different traffic characteristics, that is when the same direction lane is in high density, the speed increases slightly and the lane change number is changed regularly.

The effect of lane-changing aggressiveness parameter on traffic stability is derived through employing linear stability analysis with finding that the driver's lane-changing aggressiveness has an important impact on the stability of the traffic flow in a two-lane system. To describe the phase transition, the mKdV equation near the critical point is derived by using the reductive perturbation method, with obtaining the dependence of the propagation kink solution for traffic jams on the lane-changing aggressiveness. It can be concluded from the phase diagram of stability criterion that the higher lane-changing aggressiveness leads to a more stable traffic flow. In addition, the stabilizing effect of the optimal current difference weakens gradually with the increasing of the lane-changing aggressiveness adjusting coefficient, even vanishes when the value of lane-changing aggressiveness adjusting coefficient is greater than a critical value. Theoretical conclusions are also confirmed by the numerical simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To address such problems, we propose a forked exclusion model and investigate the behavior of traffic flow in two routes, providing various types of information to a limited number of traveling particles according to the share rate of information. To analytically understand the phenomena, we develop a coarse-grained representation of the model. By analyzing the model, we find the most effective types of information to minimize particles' travel time and the existence of an optimal share rate according to route conditions.

J	Feng, SM; Li, JY; Ding, N; Nie, C				Feng, Shumin; Li, Jinyang; Ding, Ning; Nie, Cen			Traffic paradox on a road segment based on a cellular automaton: Impact of lane-changing behavior	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic paradox; Road segment; Cellular automaton; Free lane-changing; Critical boundary	MODEL; FLOW; 2-LANE; VEHICLE; SIMULATION; VELOCITY	The traffic paradox "faster is slower" does not always apply. To study when and where it is valid, a simulation for a real road segment is performed using a novel cellular automaton. This simulation is used to analyze the change in global traffic flow status during free lanechanging behavior under general urban traffic conditions. The impact of lane-changing behavior is quantified into two aspects, time and space, and are described by average delay and transitable flow, respectively. Then surfaces are obtained, which adopt the arriving probability of vehicles and the green ratio as dual independent variables. Thus by the comparison of two surfaces, free lane-changing and straight proceeding, the horizontal projection of the intersecting lines is solved. Finally, the range of occurrence and reasons for the paradox are analyzed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A modified two-lane traffic model considering drivers' personality	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow; Cellular automaton model; Driving behavioral difference; Dynamic headway; High speed car-following	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; FLOW; BLOCKAGE; DYNAMICS; JAMS	Based on the two-lane traffic model proposed by Chowdhury et al., a modified traffic model (R-STCA model, for short) is presented, in which the new symmetric lane changing rules are introduced by considering driving behavioral difference and dynamic headway. After the numerical simulation, a broad scattering of simulated points is exhibited in the moderate density region on the flow-density plane. The synchronized flow phase accompanied with the wide moving jam phase is reproduced. The spatial temporal profiles indicate that the vehicles move according to the R-STCA model can change lane more easily and more realistically. Then vehicles are convenient to get rid of the slow vehicles that turn into plugs ahead, and hence the capacity increases. Furthermore the phenomenon of the high speed car-following is discovered by using the R-STCA model, which has been already observed in the traffic measured data. All these results indicate that the presented model is reasonable and more realistic. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Zhu, H. B.; Wu, W.

J	Sun, XY; Zhu, JF				Sun Xiao-Yan; Zhu Jun-Fang			Study of the shock wave induced by closing partial road in traffic flow	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						traffic flow; shock wave; phase transition	BOTTLENECK; BEHAVIOR; MODEL	There often occurs traffic accident or road construction in real traffic, which leads to partial road closure. In this paper, we set up a traffic model for the partial road closure. According to the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NS) cellular automata update rules, the road can be separated into cells with the same length of 7.5 m. L = 4000 (corresponding to 30 km) is set to the road length in the simulations. For a larger system size, our simulations show that the results are the same with those presented in the following. In our model, v(max) denotes the maximum velocity of vehicle. Without loss of generality, we assume v(max 1) = 1 (corresponding to 27 km/h), where partial road is closed (for convenience, we define the road length as L-1), v(max 2) = 2 (corresponding to 54 km/h) in the section of normal road (we define the road length as L-2). In our simulations, let L-1 = L-2 = 2000. We would like to mention that changing these parameter values does not have a qualitative influence on the simulation results. The simulation results demonstrate that three stationary phases exist, that is, low density (LD), high density (HD) and shock wave (SW). Two critical average densities are found: the critical point rho(cr1) = 3/8 separates the LD phase from the SW phase, and rho(cr2) = 1/2 separates the SW phase from the HD phase. We also analyze the relationship between the average flux J and average density rho. In the LD phase J = 4/3 rho, in the HD phase J = 1 - rho and J is 0.5 in the SW phase. We investigate the dependence of J on rho. It is shown that with the increase of rho, J first increases, at this stage J corresponds to the LD phase. Then J remains to be a constant 0.5 when the critical average density rho(cr1) is reached, and J corresponds to the SW phase (this time, J reaches the maximum value 0.5). One goal of traffic-management strategies is to maximize the flow. We find that the optimal choice of the average density is 3/8 < rho < 1/2 in the present model. Similar road situation often occurs in everyday life, so the traffic managers can control the car density in order to alleviate the traffic congestion and enhance the capacity of existing infrastructure. After the second critical average density rho(cr2) is reached, J decreases with the increase of average density, which corresponds to the HD phase. We also obtain the relationship between the shock wave position and the average density by theoretical calculations, i.e. S-i = i + 4 - 8 rho, which is in agreement with simulations.

We propose a mathematical model of the foraging behaviour of slime mould P. polycephalum to solve the network design problem and construct optimal transport networks. In our algorithm, a traffic flow between any two cities is estimated using a gravity model. The flow is imitated by the model of the slime mould. The algorithm model converges to a steady state, which represents a solution of the problem. We validate our approach on examples of major transport networks in Mexico and China. By comparing networks developed in our approach with the man-made highways, networks developed by the slime mould, and a cellular automata model inspired by slime mould, we demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of our approach.

MODELS FOR DETERMINING ANNUAL AVERAGE DAILY TRAFFIC ON THE NATIONAL ROADS	ARCHIVES OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						roads; traffic flow variability; Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT); multiple regression; artificial neural networks		One of the basic parameters which describes road traffic is Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT). Its accurate determination is possible only on the basis of data from the continuous measurement of traffic. However, such data for most road sections is unavailable, so AADT must be determined on the basis of short periods of random measurements. This article presents different methods of estimating AADT on the basis of daily traffic (VOL), and includes the traditional Factor Approach, developed Regression Models and Artificial Neural Network models. As explanatory variables, quantitative variables (VOL and the share of heavy vehicles) as well as qualitative variables (day of the week, month, level of AADT, the cross-section, road class, nature of the area, spatial linking, region of Poland and the nature of traffic patterns) were used. Based on comparisons of the presented methods, the Factor Approach was identified as the most useful.

J	Juste, N; Ghiara, H				Juste, Ndayishimiye; Ghiara, Hilda			ICT POLICIES IN MEDITERRANEAN MOTORWAYS OF THE SEA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT ECONOMICS			English	Article						Port Hinterland; Logistics Systems; Modal Shift; Road; Motorways of the Sea	TRANSPORT; COSTS	Port authorities are modifying their nature and their role, acquiring more and more an active role in the governance of logistics systems and often adopting managerial and entrepreneurial behaviours. One common supporting tool of port authorities evolution and strategies could be identified into transportation flows modelization in order to assess the impact of policies in the modal distribution of the traffic flows (e.g. from road to sea) and the impacts that this shift may have in term of reduction of the emissions. The proposed methodology is based on the construction of a transport simulation model in order to check the modal distribution in different scenarios. The model can be used to compare the market dynamics (based on transport costs) with reference to different scenarios (number and frequencies of lines) and to the different costs involved. In such a way it is possible to compare and simulate the introduction of new lines on one side and the impact of Mos policies and projects on territories (in terms of regional impact in modal shift from road to MoS). The gravity model used in this work shows that the socio-economic and environment impact of Motorways of the Sea (MoS) depends more on environmental policies integration in the transport and logistics chain, territorial potential and importance of logistics systems rather than distance and transportation cost factors.

J	Zhang, F; Han, ZK; Ge, HY; Zhu, YP				Zhang, Fan; Han, Zhike; Ge, Hanyu; Zhu, Yingping			Optimization Design of Traffic Flow under Security Based on Cellular Automata Model	COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Optimization; Cellular Automata Model; Collision Model		Cellular Automata is a discrete model studied in computability theory, mathematics, physics, complexity science, theoretical biology and microstructure modeling. This paper proposes a model to balance the flux and safety, to maximize the flux on each road whilst ensuring work well with safety based on the Cellular Automata. In order to analyze the flow of traffic, the traffic of three-lane freeway and four-lane freeway are simulated based on the cellular automata model with the factors of velocity and density in the first step. For safety, a rear-end collision model and overtaking lateral collision model were employed to analyze the relation among safety. Reaction time and distance are introduced in the model, and different vehicles are considered. Safety-related factors are also chosen based on back propagation neural network. At last, this paper establishes a model to examine the performance of the traffic flow under the multi-lane freeway in light and heavy traffic. It simulates the situation in real life based on actual data. The optimal relation and optimal value has worked out between flux and safety through simulating the situation in real life based on actual data. To achieve a better model, further discussion, is made on how to adapt to different situations with the keep-left, the unrestricted, and the intelligent system controlled. The experimental result shows that the number of lanes is not an influential factor under any circumstances. The maximum speed limit plays a significant role in light traffic while it is of no importance in heavy traffic. However, the minimum speed limit plays a significant role in heavy traffic while it is of no importance in light traffic.

Using a two-way communication network, vehicles approaching the intersection from all sections are globally coordinated, by considering their states all together in a model predictive control framework, in order to achieve smooth traffic flows at the intersection. The optimal trajectories of the vehicles are computed based on avoidance of their cross-collision risks around the intersection under relevant constraints and preferences. The scheme efficiently utilizes the intersection area by preventing each pair of conflicting vehicles from approaching their cross-collision point at the same time, instead of reserving the whole intersection area for the conflicting vehicles one after another. The scheme also enables left- or right-turning movements of vehicles under constrained velocity without using any auxiliary lanes. The proposed vehicle-intersection coordination scheme is evaluated through numerical simulation in a typical test intersection consisting of both multilanes and single-lane approaches with turning movements of vehicles. Observations under different traffic flow conditions reveal that the proposed scheme significantly improves intersection performance compared with the traditional signalized intersection scheme.

J	Desiraju, D; Chantem, T; Heaslip, K				Desiraju, Divya; Chantem, Thidapat; Heaslip, Kevin			Minimizing the Disruption of Traffic Flow of Automated Vehicles During Lane Changes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Automated highways; cooperative systems; intelligent vehicles; lane change; optimization; scheduling	BEHAVIOR; MODEL	Vehicles that are becoming more highly automated are revolutionizing the world's transportation systems for their promise of increased safety and efficiency. The advantage of vehicles incorporating automation is that they do not suffer from the same limitations as human drivers, such as being distracted or impaired. In order to realize the potential of these vehicles, which operate in highly dynamic environments, online techniques are needed. This paper presents such an algorithm to minimize the disruption of traffic flow by optimizing for the number of safe lane changes, thereby increasing throughput and reducing congestion. The proposed algorithm is distributed in nature and makes use of vehicle-to-vehicle and/or vehicle-to-infrastructure communication technologies to judiciously make local lane-change decisions while guaranteeing that no collisions will occur. In contrast to existing work, the proposed technique requires no assumption on the number of lanes, nor on the dynamic attributes of the vehicles such as velocity and acceleration. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is both efficient and effective in maximizing the number of lane changes on a given stretch of a highway.

The system also provides solutions to analyze the traffic flow under the challenging nighttime raindrop-tampered conditions. To deal with the challenging scenes, we extract effective features via salient region detection and block segmentation. The extracted features are used to train a support vector machine to achieve self-diagnosis. For traffic flow analysis, we use the extracted features in the region of interest and construct a regression model to get an estimated vehicle count for each frame. The vehicle counts in consecutive frames form a vehicle count sequence. We propose a mapping model to acquire the desired per-minute traffic flow from the vehicle count sequence. The model utilizes state transfer likelihoods and takes into account the length of the segmented vehicle count sequence. The experiments on highly challenging data sets have demonstrated that the proposed system can effectively estimate the traffic flow for raindrop-tampered highway surveillance cameras at night.

The upper level model aims at minimizing the average travel time of travelers, as well as minimizing the difference of passengers' comfort among all the bus lines by optimizing bus frequencies. The lower level model is a multi-modal transport network equilibrium model for the joint modal split/traffic assignment problem. The column generation algorithm, the branch-and-bound algorithm and the method of successive averages are comprehensively applied in this paper for the solution of the bi-level model. A simple numerical test and an empirical test based on Dalian economic zone are employed to validate the proposed model.

A novel variable selection method based on frequent pattern tree for real-time traffic accident risk prediction	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Frequent Pattern tree (FP tree); Fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM); Bayesian network; k Nearest Neighbor (k-NN); Variable importance; Variable selection; Random forest; Real time; Relative Object Purity Ratio (ROPR); Traffic accident risk prediction	CRASH PREDICTION; FREEWAY; FRAMEWORK; MODEL	With the availability of large volumes of real-time traffic flow data along with traffic accident information, there is a renewed interest in the development of models for the real-time prediction of traffic accident risk. One challenge, however, is that the available data are usually complex, noisy, and even misleading. This raises the question of how to select the most important explanatory variables to achieve an acceptable level of accuracy for real-time traffic accident risk prediction. To address this, the present paper proposes a novel Frequent Pattern tree (FP tree) based variable selection method. The method works by first identifying all the frequent patterns in the traffic accident dataset Next, for each frequent pattern, we introduce a new metric, herein referred to as the Relative Object Purity Ratio (ROPR). The ROPR is then used to calculate the importance score of each explanatory variable which in turn can be used for ranking and selecting the variables that contribute most to explaining the accident patterns. To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed variable selection method, the study develops two traffic accident risk prediction models, based on accident data collected on interstate highway 1-64 in Virginia, namely a k-nearest neighbor model and a Bayesian network. Prior to model development, two variable selection methods are utilized: (1) the FP tree based method proposed in this paper; and (2) the random forest method, a widely used variable selection method, which is used as the base case for comparison. The results show that the FP tree based accident risk prediction models perform better than the random forest based models, regardless of the type of prediction models (i.e. k-nearest neighbor or Bayesian network), the settings of their parameters, and the types of datasets used for model training and testing. The best model found is a FP tree based Bayesian network model that can predict 61.11% of accidents while having a false alarm rate of 38.16%. These results compare very favorably with other accident prediction models reported in the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Nowadays, technological advances have significantly improved our traffic data collection capabilities. Conventional car following models rely on mathematical formulas and are derived from traffic flow theory; a property that often makes them more restrictive. On the other hand, data-driven approaches are more flexible and allow the incorporation of additional information to the model; however, they may not provide as much insight into traffic flow theory as the traditional models. In this research, an innovative methodological framework based on a data-driven approach is proposed for the estimation of car-following models, suitable for incorporation into microscopic traffic simulation models. An existing technique, i.e. locally weighted regression (loess), is defined through an optimization problem and is employed in a novel way. The proposed methodology is demonstrated using data collected from a sequence of instrumented vehicles in Naples, Italy. Gipps' model, one of the most extensively used car-following models, is calibrated against the same data and used as a reference benchmark. Optimization issues are raised in both cases. The obtained results suggest that data-driven car-following models could be a promising research direction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Because of this instability, flow distribution is significantly imbalanced on a macroscopic level. To mitigate the congestion, we consider a simple control method, in which congested nodes are closed temporarily, and investigate how it influences the overall system. Depending on the timing of the node closure and opening, and congestion level of a network, the system displays three different phases: free-flow phase, controlled phase, and deadlock phase. We show that when the system is in the controlled phase, the average flow is significantly improved, whereas when in the deadlock phase, the flow drops to zero. We study how the control method increases the network flow and obtain their transition boundary analytically.

J	Moridpour, S; Mazloumi, E; Mesbah, M				Moridpour, Sara; Mazloumi, Ehsan; Mesbah, Mahmoud			Impact of heavy vehicles on surrounding traffic characteristics	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						heavy vehicles; passenger cars; travel time; lane changing manoeuvre	SAFETY	This work examines the impact of heavy vehicle movements on measured traffic characteristics in detail. Although the number of heavy vehicles within the traffic stream is only a small percentage, their impact is prominent. Heavy vehicles impose physical and psychological effects on surrounding traffic flow because of their length and size (physical) and acceleration/deceleration (operational) characteristics. The objective of this work is to investigate the differences in traffic characteristics in the vicinity of heavy vehicles and passenger cars. The analysis focuses on heavy traffic conditions (level of service E) using a trajectory data of highway I-80 in California. The results show that larger front and rear space gaps exist for heavy vehicles compared with passenger cars. This may be because of the limitations in manoeuvrability of heavy vehicles and the safety concerns of the rear vehicle drivers, respectively. In addition, heavy vehicle drivers mainly keep a constant speed and do not change their speed frequently. This work also examines the impact of heavy vehicles on their surrounding traffic in terms of average travel time and number of lane changing manoeuvres using Advanced Interactive Microscopic Simulator for Urban and Non-Urban Networks (AIMSUN) microscopic traffic simulation package. According to the results, the average travel time increases when proportion of heavy vehicles rises in each lane. To reflect the impact of heavy vehicles on average travel time, a term related to heavy vehicle percentage is introduced into two different travel time equations, Bureau of Public Roads and Akcelik's travel time equations. The results show that using an exclusive term for heavy vehicles can better estimate the travel times for more than 10%. Finally, number of passenger car lane changing manoeuvres per lane will be more frequent when more heavy vehicles exist in that lane. The influence of heavy vehicles on the number of passenger car lane changing is intensified in higher traffic densities and higher percentage of heavy vehicles. Large numbers of lane changing manoeuvres can increase the number of traffic accidents and potentially reduce traffic safety. The results show an increase of 5% in the likelihood of accidents, when percentage of heavy vehicles increases to 30% of total traffic. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

CONSERVATION LAW MODELS FOR TRAFFIC FLOW ON A NETWORK OF ROADS	NETWORKS AND HETEROGENEOUS MEDIA			English	Article						Traffic flows; network of roads; scalar conservation laws; Hamilton Jacobi equations; Lax type formula	EQUILIBRIA; EXISTENCE; OPTIMA; WAVES	The paper develops a model of traffic flow near an intersection, where drivers seeking to enter a congested road wait in a buffer of limited capacity. Initial data comprise the vehicle density on each road, together with the percentage of drivers approaching the intersection who wish to turn into each of the outgoing roads. If the queue sizes within the buffer are known, then the initial-boundary value problems become decoupled and can be independently solved along each incoming road. Three variational problems are introduced, related to different kind of boundary conditions. From the value functions, one recovers the traffic density along each incoming or outgoing road by a Lax type formula. Conversely, if these value functions are known, then the queue sizes can be determined by balancing the boundary fluxes of all incoming and outgoing roads. In this way one obtains a contractive transformation, whose fixed point yields the unique solution of the Cauchy problem for traffic flow in an neighborhood of the intersection.

J	Ryoo, I; Na, W; Kim, S				Ryoo, Intae; Na, Wonshik; Kim, Seokhoon			Information exchange architecture based on software defined networking for cooperative intelligent transportation systems	CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Information exchange architecture; C-ITS; Interworking; SDN	SERVICES; MANAGEMENT; RESOURCES	Recently, the software defined networking (SDN) technologies have been highlighted because these are not only the alternative to improve the legacy network efficiency, but also the power source to develop the new business ecosystem. Most of all, the SDN technique can be used in several areas because it is one of the software technology. However, the SDN technology is applied partially in the cloud computing until now because it is corresponded well with the cloud computing concepts and applications. Although these are very natural and common instances so far, the problem is very narrow the applying scope of SDN. Due to the fact that cooperative intelligent transportation system (C-ITS) has many variable features, it is very suitable for applying SDN technique. So, we propose the new information exchange architecture, which is based on the SDN technology, for CITS. The proposed architecture has improved the throughput than the legacy systems and can be adjusted the traffic flow based on the necessity. The proposed information exchange architecture can be transmitted data, which can be handled various information like as the road traffic flows, tracking the car, based on the interworking data forwarding scheme. Based on these schemes, the proposed architecture outperforms than the legacy systems in several aspects, and we have verified these results through the computer simulations using the OPNet.

Vehicle speed prediction via a sliding-window time series analysis and an evolutionary least learning machine: A case study on San Francisco urban roads	ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL-JESTECH			English	Article						Vehicle powertrains; Speed prediction; Sliding window time series forecasting; Predictive control; Intelligent tools	TRAFFIC FLOW PREDICTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; OPTIMAL-DESIGN; ENGINE	The main goal of the current study is to take advantage of advanced numerical and intelligent tools to predict the speed of a vehicle using time series. It is clear that the uncertainty caused by temporal behavior of the driver as well as various external disturbances on the road will affect the vehicle speed, and thus, the vehicle power demands. The prediction of upcoming power demands can be employed by the vehicle powertrain control systems to improve significantly the fuel economy and emission performance. Therefore, it is important to systems design engineers and automotive industrialists to develop efficient numerical tools to overcome the risk of unpredictability associated with the vehicle speed profile on roads. In this study, the authors propose an intelligent tool called evolutionary least learning machine (E-LLM) to forecast the vehicle speed sequence. To have a practical evaluation regarding the efficacy of E-LLM, the authors use the driving data collected on the San Francisco urban roads by a private Honda Insight vehicle. The concept of sliding window time series (SWTS) analysis is used to prepare the database for the speed forecasting process. To evaluate the performance of the proposed technique, a number of well-known approaches, such as auto regressive (AR) method, back-propagation neural network (BPNN), evolutionary extreme learning machine (E-ELM), extreme learning machine (ELM), and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), are considered. The performances of the rival methods are then compared in terms of the mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), median absolute percentage error (MDAPE), and absolute fraction of variances (R-2) metrics. Through an exhaustive comparative study, the authors observed that E-LLM is a powerful tool for predicting the vehicle speed profiles. The outcomes of the current study can be of use for the engineers of automotive industry who have been seeking fast, accurate, and inexpensive tools capable of predicting vehicle speeds up to a given point ahead of time, known as prediction horizon (H-p), which can be used for designing efficient predictive powertrain controllers.

This study assesses the efficiency and effectiveness of road traffic systems, using the Atlas Hotel road intersection, Gwagwalada, Abuja Nigeria as a case study. Queue theory analytic methodologies are applied and parameters such as average arrival and service rate are calculated based on the data obtained at the said junction on daily basis for a period of one week. Inter-arrival time is 10 seconds and M/M/3 queue model was found appropriate. Considering the 15278 vehicles observed, major arrivals and departure were on the SDP leg, while the least arrivals and departure was witnessed on the Town-Hall leg, the El-Rufai and NITEL legs had varying degrees of arrivals and departure. Based on the data gathered, it was observed that the evenings record the highest magnitude of vehicular traffic at the intersection while mornings had the least. It was concluded that with reference to the intersection studied, road traffic system performance within the Gwagwalada metropolis is stable as Level of Service is A with Average Control Delay (seconds/vehicle) <= 10 seconds per vehicle. Modernization and re-design of roadways, traffic education, as well as introduction of road traffic utilities were recommended.

After a brief review of the main principles of the NTFM and its associated sub-models, the paper describes how a maintenance worksite can be modelled using a roadwork-node sub-model and a network solution routine in the NTFM. In order to model the two-way traffic flow in the road network, an iterative simulation method is used to generate the evolution of dependent traffic flows and queues. The NTFM has been applied to model the traffic characteristics and the effects of maintenance activities on the local Loughborough-Nottingham highway network. The study has demonstrated that the methodology is useful in selecting various worksite arrangements in order to reduce the effects of maintenance on road users.

Optimization of traffic forecasting: Intelligent surrogate modeling	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Short-term prediction; Optimization; Surrogate models; Computational intelligence; Traffic flow	FLOW PREDICTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS	Transportation modelers are frequently faced with several optimization challenges related to model selection and parameter optimization for forecasting. The concept of surrogate modeling is discussed in order to tackle some limitations related to the practice of developing short-term forecasting algorithms. An automated meta-modeling technique is presented that uses heterogeneous information from multiple types of statistical and computationally intelligent models, along with multi-objective evolutionary strategies to optimize the model and parameter selection. A number of different models from the family of Support Vector Machines, Radial Base Functions and Neural Networks are jointly considered and optimized with the aim to improve the short-term predictability of travel speed. Results are presented and discussed in both a univariate and multivariate framework. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Yildirimoglu, M; Limniati, Y; Geroliminis, N				Yildirimoglu, Mehmet; Limniati, Ypatia; Geroliminis, Nikolas			Investigating empirical implications of hysteresis in day-to-day travel time variability	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Travel time variability; Hysteresis; Freeways; Macroscopic fundamental diagrams	TRAFFIC CONGESTION; RELIABILITY; DEMAND; SYSTEM; MODEL	Day-to-day travel time variability plays a significant role in travel time reliability. Nowadays, travelers not only seek to minimize their travel time on average, but also value its variation. The variation in the mean and the variance of travel time (across days, for the same departure time) has not been thoroughly investigated. A temporary decrease in capacity (e.g. congestion caused by an active bottleneck) leads to a quite significant difference in the variance of travel time for congestion onset and offset periods. This phenomenon results in hysteresis loops where the departure time periods in congestion offset exhibit a higher travel time variance than the ones in congestion onset with the same mean travel time. The aim of this paper is to identify empirical implications that yield to the hysteresis phenomenon in day-to-day travel times. First, empirical hysteresis loop observations are provided from two different freeway sites. Second, we investigate the potential link with the hysteresis observed in traffic networks on macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD). Third, we build a piecewise linear function that models the evolution of travel time within the day. This allows us to decompose the problem into its components, e.g. start time of congestion, peak travel time, etc. These components, along with their probability distribution functions, are employed in a Monte Carlo simulation model to investigate their partial effects on the existence of hysteresis. Correlation among critical variables is the most influential factor in this phenomenon, which should be further investigated regarding traffic flow and traffic equilibrium principles.

J	Zhu, F; Ukkusuri, SV				Zhu, Feng; Ukkusuri, Satish V.			A linear programming formulation for autonomous intersection control within a dynamic traffic assignment and connected vehicle environment	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Linear programming; Autonomous intersection control; Dynamic traffic assignment; System optimum; Connected vehicles	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; USER EQUILIBRIUM; WAVES; FLOW	This paper develops a novel linear programming formulation for autonomous intersection control (LPAIC) accounting for traffic dynamics within a connected vehicle environment. Firstly, a lane based bi-level optimization model is introduced to propagate traffic flows in the network, accounting for dynamic departure time, dynamic route choice, and autonomous intersection control in the context of system optimum network model. Then the bi-level optimization model is transformed to the linear programming formulation by relaxing the nonlinear constraints with a set of linear inequalities. One special feature of the LPAIC formulation is that the entries of the constraint matrix has only 1,0,1 values. Moreover, it is proved that the constraint matrix is totally unimodular, the optimal solution exists and contains only integer values. It is also shown that the traffic flows from different lanes pass through the conflict points of the intersection safely and there are no holding flows in the solution.

Previous studies in China have mainly focused on vehicle emissions and ventilation control technologies in road tunnels, resulting in a research gap on urban tunnel ventilation engineering design. Therefore, a detailed monitoring investigation was conducted from May 22 to June 2, 2013 in Changsha Yingpan Road Tunnel, China. The study aim was to measure the traffic characteristics, air velocity and the carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO,) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in this tunnel, which has two lanes per bore and multiple ramps. Measurement results show that during the workday morning peak, the maximum traffic flow was 1560 passenger-car-unit/h per lane with vehicle speed around 33.6 km/h in the eastbound tunnel, the average air velocity was 3.07 m/s, and the proportion of the light-duty vehicles (LDV) was 97.3%. Under the traffic force (not open fan), the CO and NO average concentrations at the main tunnel outlet were 20.3 ppm and 1.65 ppm, respectively. The gas pollutant concentrations are effectively controlled within the multiple-ramps tunnel and the design air volume flow is noticeably reduced. The traffic air flow was found to provide 32.5% of the required air volume to dilute NOx in blocked traffic condition (vehicle speed of 10 km/h). In addition, the PM2.5 concentration is mainly affected by the value of background outside the tunnel. The result can provide a quantitative assessment method to support pollutant concentration control and contribution of requested air volume by traffic flow in urban complex structure tunnel.

J	Ramezani, M; Geroliminis, N				Ramezani, Mohsen; Geroliminis, Nikolas			Queue Profile Estimation in Congested Urban Networks with Probe Data	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							LENGTH ESTIMATION; TIME ESTIMATION; TRAVEL-TIMES; DELAY; MODEL; WAVES	Queues at signalized intersections are the main cause of traffic delays and travel time variability in urban networks. In this article, we propose a method to estimate queue profiles that are traffic shockwave polygons in the time-space plane describing the spatiotemporal formation and dissipation of queues. The method integrates the collective effect of dispersed probe vehicle data with traffic flow shockwave analysis and data mining techniques. The proposed queue profile estimation method requires position and velocity data of probe vehicles; however, any explicit information of signal settings and arrival distribution is indispensable. Moreover, the method captures interdependencies in queue evolutions of successive intersections. The significance of the proposed method is that it is applicable in oversaturated conditions and includes queue spillover identification. Numerical results of simulation experiments and tests on NGSIM field data, with various penetration rates and sampling intervals, reveal the promising and robust performance of the proposed method compared with a uniform arrival queue estimation procedure. The method provides a thorough understanding of urban traffic flow dynamics and has direct applications for delay analysis, queue length estimation, signal settings estimation, and vehicle trajectory reconstruction.

It collects traffic condition, driving behavior, and video through telematics and digital tachygraphy and road-side cameras to facilitate advanced data analytics for the reduction of fuel consumption. There are three specific features regarding this framework. First, a transportation cloud is built for the storage of massive data and video. This cloud-based system not only avoids the use of hard disks at client-site for energy conservation and reliability improvement, but also allows the back-end data analytics at both server and client sites. Second, a real-time traffic condition analytic was developed by mobile machine vision techniques based on video and data collected from road-side cameras to analyze and recognize traffic conditions, such as traffic flow, braking events, traffic lights, and count-down timers. Then, a fuel-efficient route navigation technology is also developed for eco-driving based on real time traffic information and a dynamic shortest path algorithm for saving time and fuel consumption. Third, a sequential pattern mining model was proposed to diagnose misguided driving behavior for eco-driving based on the real-time data collected from digital tachygraphy and on-board diagnostics system. Furthermore, an e-Learning visualization system was developed to provide advice and instruction for correction of misguided driving behavior. Indeed, the fuel consumption and power consumption can be reduced simultaneously based on the proposed framework regarding cloud-based system and eco-driving. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A traffic accident, which might occur as a result of traffic congestion, will impact an evacuation process because of accident-related delays experienced by the downstream vehicles. This paper establishes a safety-based SO-DTA linear programming model in which the generalized system cost incorporates both the travel time and the accident-related delay. The goal is to minimize the generalized system cost under the cell transmission setup. Furthermore, the authors provide strategic guidance information that considers both the objective of the decision maker and the route choice behavior of the evacuees. Mathematically, the authors propose an unconstrained non-linear programming model aimed at minimizing the gap between the safety-based flows and the stochastic real-world evacuation flows, to provide strategic travel time information to be published on variable message signs (VMS). In the case study, the authors found that the safety-based SO-DTA model can reduce congestion and improve the evacuation efficiency; the stochastic real-world evacuation flows, guided by strategic information, can approach the safety-based flows.

The influence of average density difference effect on the stability of traffic flow is investigated through linear stability theory and nonlinear reductive perturbation method. The linear analysis results reveal that the unstable region would be reduced by considering the average density difference effect. The nonlinear kink antikink soliton solution derived from the mKdV equation is analyzed to describe the properties of traffic jamming transition near the critical point. Numerical simulations confirm the analytical results showing that traffic jam can be suppressed efficiently by considering the average density difference effect for two-lane traffic system.

The analytical and numerical results illustrate that each person's travel time and the system's total cost are directly related to each person's time headway at the origin when the road is long enough and the number of persons is large enough in the traffic system.

J	Wu, WT; Shen, LU; Jin, WZ; Liu, RH				Wu, Weitiao; Shen, Luou; Jin, Wenzhou; Liu, Ronghui			Density-based mixed platoon dispersion modelling with truncated mixed Gaussian distribution of speed	TRANSPORTMETRICA B-TRANSPORT DYNAMICS			English	Article						EM algorithm; mixed traffic flow; platoon dispersion model; truncated mixed Gaussian distribution; signal coordination	TRAVEL-TIME	In China, urban arterial traffic presents a mixed-flow feature because the percentage of bus flow is relatively high. This affects the applicability of traditional platoon dispersion models, which are generally only suitable for homogeneous traffic flow. Based on field observations, this paper proposes a mixed platoon dispersion model (MPDM) to macroscopically simulate the mixed platoon dispersion process along the road segment between two successive signalised intersections from the density view. In order to capture the heterogeneity in mixed platoon speeds, the truncated mixed Gaussian distribution is adopted here to fit the speed data collected in the field, and expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm is employed to estimate the distribution parameters. Later, the piecewise platoon density function is developed to examine the platoon dispersion characteristics. By applying this density function, the formulations of the expected number of vehicles in the front of the platoon that have passed and the expected number of vehicles at the rear of the platoon that have not passed a downstream intersection, as well as the downstream arriving flow function, are derived. Furthermore, numerical calculation for signal coordination verifies the effectiveness of the proposed MPDM.

Microscopic Simulation for Modeling Exclusive Stopping Space for Motorcycles under Non-lane Based Mixed Traffic Conditions	EUROPEAN TRANSPORT-TRASPORTI EUROPEI			English	Article						Mixed Traffic; Signalized Intersections; Microscopic simulation Model; Motorcycles; Exclusive Storage Space for Motorcycles	SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS	Mixed traffic flow with high composition of motorcycles is a common situation in many urban areas in South Asian countries like India. It consists of vehicles having diverse static and dynamic characteristics. This type of traffic is characterized by lack of queue and lane disciplines. Motorcycles, due to their smaller size, have greater freedom to manoeuver in a mixed traffic stream. They tend to accumulate near the stop line by weaving through gaps between other vehicles during the red phase. The provision of Exclusive Stopping Space for Motorcycles (ESSM) near the stop line is believed to be beneficial in discharging the motorcycles faster, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the intersection. A microscopic traffic simulation model for a signalized intersection developed specifically for mixed traffic was used in this study. The model was calibrated and tested with data from Chermai city, India. This model was used to simulate traffic flow at an intersection assuming the presence of ESSM. The efficacy of ESSM was evaluated by varying the vehicular composition, traffic volume and ESSM lengths. The findings show that for certain composition, volume levels and lengths of ESSM, delays to vehicles decrease, thereby indicating its benefits.

Combining the techniques employed by Li-Kong with the modified Glimm's functional, the author obtains the almost global existence and lifespan of classical discontinuous solutions to a class of the generalized nonlinear initial-boundary Riemann problem, which can be regarded as a small BV perturbation of the corresponding nonlinear initial-boundary Riemann problem. This result is also applied to the system of traffic flow on a road network using the Aw-Rascle model.

However, the parametric uncertainties caused from measurement noise in T-CPS lead to the dynamic performance deterioration of the engine cylinder pressure estimation. Considering the high accuracy requirement under V2V communications, a high gain observer based on the engine dynamic model is designed to improve the accuracy of pressure estimation. Then, the analyses about convergence, converge speed and stability of the corresponding error model are conducted using the Laplace and Lyapunov method. Finally, results from combination of Simulink with GT-Power based numerical experiments and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with respect to robustness and accuracy.

By introducing an interactional potential of vehicles into the randomization step, an improved cellular automata traffic flow model with variable probability of randomization is proposed in this paper. In the proposed model, the driver is affected by the interactional potential of vehicles before him, and his decision-making process is related to the interactional potential. Compared with the traditional cellular automata model, the modeling is more suitable for the driver's random decision-making process based on the vehicle and traffic situations in front of him in actual traffic. From the improved model, the fundamental diagram (flow-density relationship) is obtained, and the detailed high-density traffic phenomenon is reproduced through numerical simulation.

Controlling the state of a motorway using express lanes	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER AND SYSTEMS SCIENCES INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; KINEMATIC WAVES	An algorithm for controlling the state of a motorway using express lanes is proposed. The aim of the control is to support the maximum speed on the express lanes by redistributing flows at the entrances. This is achieved with regard to the state of general purpose lanes and the condition of minimal growth of queues at the entrances. To describe the algorithm and its properties, the discretized hydrodynamic traffic flow model of Lighthill, Whitham, and Richards is used.	[Dorogush, E.

These missing values can be as high as 60% in some cases. Although invested significantly in legacy systems that rely primarily on inductive loop detectors to collect traffic volumes, transportation agencies are faced with a challenge of relying only on a small set of the traffic data. Despite the fact that transportation agencies are often required to report on various annual traffic statistics such as average annual daily traffic (AADT) and vehicles miles travelled, little research is available on how transportation practitioners handled missing values in their traffic data collection efforts. In this paper, a simple iterative approach is introduced-based on the integration of an imputation algorithm and a time series model - to impute missing PDCS data. The approach is deigned such that the imputation algorithm is implemented first to impute relatively small to medium gaps forming a library of complete datasets; then a time series model is fitted to these stations to form the base for imputing large gaps. The data imputation algorithm is applied on a case study on Ministry of Transportation of Ontario PDCS stations, Canada. The average errors for imputing as high as 90% of missing data - with maximum continuous gaps of 76 h - were approximately 16% with an average median error of 11 veh/h. After all traffic data are imputed, a time series model is estimated to capture the multiple seasonalities and trends in the traffic data across multiple years. The estimated "model" is then used to calculate and produce seasonal variation factors and graphs that are typically required for planning, design, control, operation, and management of traffic and highway facilities. By estimating the model parameters using existing raw data, the model was then tested to assess its accuracy to forecast future years.

We suspect that an intrinsic selection bias may exist in the competitive project appraisal process, in addition to the many other factors that contribute to inaccurate traffic forecasts. In this paper, we examine the potential for selection bias in the governmental process of Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) transportation project appraisals. Although the simultaneous consideration of multiple criteria is typically used in practice, traffic flow estimate is usually a key criterion in these appraisals. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on the selection bias associated with the highest flow estimate criterion. We develop two approaches to quantify the level and chance of inaccuracy caused by selection bias: the expected value approach and the probability approach. The expected value approach addresses the question "to what extent is inaccuracy caused by selection bias?". The probability approach addresses the question "what is the chance of inaccuracy due to selection bias?". The results of this analysis confirm the existence of selection bias when a government uses the highest traffic forecast estimate as the priority criterion for BOT project selection. In addition, we offer some insights into the relationship between the extent/chance of inaccuracy and other related factors. We do not argue that selection bias is the only reason for inaccurate traffic forecasts in BOT projects; however, it does appear that it could be an intrinsic factor worthy of further attention and investigation.

J	Martinez-Diaz, M; Perez, I				Martinez-Diaz, Margarita; Perez, Ignacio			A simple algorithm for the estimation of road traffic space mean speeds from data available to most management centres	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Space mean speed; Time mean speed; Travel time; Traffic loop detector; Stationarity; Log-normality	TIME; LOOP	The control of the evolution of road traffic streams is highly related to productivity, safety, sustainability and, even, comfort. Although, nowadays, the findings from research efforts and the development of new technologies enable accurate traffic forecasts in almost any conditions, these calculations are usually limited by the data and the equipment available. Most traffic management centres depend on the data provided, at best, by double-loop detectors. These loops supply time means over different aggregation periods, which are indiscriminately used as the bases for subsequent estimations. Since space mean speeds are those needed in most applications (note the fundamental relationship between flow and density in traffic flow theory), most current practice begins with an error. This paper introduces a simple algorithm that the allows estimation of space mean speeds from the data provided by the loops without the need for any additional financial outlay, as long as the traffic in each time interval of aggregation is stationary and its speed distribution is log-normal. Specifically, it is focused on the calculation of the variance of the speeds with regard to the time mean, thus making possible to use the relationship between time mean speeds and space mean speeds defined by Rakha (2005). The results obtained with real data show that the algorithm behaves well if the calculation conditions help fulfil the initial hypotheses. The primary difficulties arise with transient traffic and, in this case, other specific methodologies should be used. Data fusion seems promising in this regard. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the improvement provided by the algorithm turns out to be highly beneficial both when used alone in the case of stationarity or as a part of a fusion.

J	Pirc, J; Turk, G; Zura, M				Pirc, Jure; Turk, Goran; Zura, Marijan			Using the robust statistics for travel time estimation on highways	IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article							TOLL DATA; PREDICTION	Highway operators around the world are using automated vehicle identification (AVI)-based techniques as a technological input for travel time estimation on highways. Various AVI technologies provide various travel time measurement samples: some of them are able to identify only personal cars (e.g. tolling tags), while others provide mixed samples of all vehicle classes (e.g. license plate matching). As the adequate information on travel times should concern the personal cars, the influence of heavy vehicles (HVs) should be eliminated from the samples, which is not feasible with the use of existing travel time estimation algorithms. It was observed that also during congestion travel times of personal cars and HVs remain dispersed. The motivation for the present study was to introduce an algorithm that would be able to exclude the influence of slower HVs in travel time estimation for technologies, providing mixed samples of travel time measurements. This was achieved by the use of robust statistics. The results of the study could be used by all highway agencies and operators who are encountering problems with unreasonably extended estimations of travel times because of the presence of slow HVs in the traffic flow.

Investigation of pedestrian crashes on two-way two-lane rural roads in Ethiopia	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Pedestrian crash prediction models; Random parameter model; Ethiopia; Two-way two-lane roads; Count-based statistical model	MODELS; SAFETY; INTERSECTIONS; ENVIRONMENT; POISSON	Understanding pedestrian crash causes and contributing factors in developing countries is critically important as they account for about 55% of all traffic crashes. Not surprisingly, considerable attention in the literature has been paid to road traffic crash prediction models and methodologies in developing countries of late. Despite this interest, there are significant challenges confronting safety managers in developing countries. For example, in spite of the prominence of pedestrian crashes occurring on two-way two-lane rural roads, it has proven difficult to develop pedestrian crash prediction models due to a lack of both traffic and pedestrian exposure data. This general lack of available data has further hampered identification of pedestrian crash causes and subsequent estimation of pedestrian safety performance functions. The challenges are similar across developing nations, where little is known about the relationship between pedestrian crashes, traffic flow, and road environment variables on rural two-way roads, and where unique predictor variables may be needed to capture the unique crash risk circumstances. This paper describes pedestrian crash safety performance functions for two-way two-lane rural roads in Ethiopia as a function of traffic flow, pedestrian flows, and road geometry characteristics. In particular, random parameter negative binomial model was used to investigate pedestrian crashes. The models and their interpretations make important contributions to road crash analysis and prevention in developing countries. They also assist in the identification of the contributing factors to pedestrian crashes, with the intent to identify potential design and operational improvements.

J	Ou, CH; Liang, H; Zhuang, WH				Ou, Chia-Ho; Liang, Hao; Zhuang, Weihua			Investigating Wireless Charging and Mobility of Electric Vehicles on Electricity Market	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Electric vehicles (EVs); electricity markets; mobility; queuing networks; wireless charging	DEMAND; INTEGRATION; IMPACT	To avoid inconvenient vehicle stops at charging stations, on-road wireless charging of electric vehicles (EVs) is a promising application in the future smart grid. In this paper, we study a critical yet open problem for this application, i.e., the impact of wireless charging and mobility of EVs on the wholesale electricity market based on locational marginal price (LMP), which is mainly determined by the EV mobility patterns. To capture the dynamics in vehicle traffic flow and state of charge of EV batteries, we model the EV mobility as a queuing network based on the statistics obtained via traffic information systems. Then, the load on each power system bus with respect to EV wireless charging is obtained using the stationary distribution of the queuing network. An economic dispatch problem is formulated to incorporate the EV wireless charging demand, and the LMP of each power system bus is obtained. Furthermore, a pricing mechanism based on the LMP variations of power system buses is investigated to enhance the social welfare. The performance of our proposed analytical model is verified by a realistic road traffic simulator (SUMO) based on a 3-bus test system and an IEEE 30-bus test system, respectively. Simulation results indicate that our proposed analytical model can accurately provide an estimation of the LMP variations due to EV wireless charging.

MODELING TRAFFIC FLUCTUATIONS AND CONGESTION ON A ROAD NETWORK	ADVANCES IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS			English	Article						Traffic models; networks dynamics; stochastic dynamical systems	COMPLEX NETWORKS; PHYSICS	Statistical mechanics points out as fluctuations have a relevant role for systems near critical points. We study the effect of traffic fluctuations and the transition to congested states for a stochastic dynamical model of traffic on a road network. The model simulates a finite population that moves from one road to another according to random transition probabilities. In such a way, we mimic the traffic fluctuations due to the granular feature of traffic and the dynamics at the crossing points. Then the amplitude of traffic flow fluctuations is proportional to the average flow as suggested by empirical observations. Assuming a parabolic shaped flow-density relation, there exists an unstable critical point for the road dynamics and the system can perform a phase transition to a congested state, where some roads reach their maximal capacity. We apply a statistical physics approach to study the onset congestion and we characterize analytically the relation between the fluctuations amplitude and the appearance of congested nodes. We verify the results by means of numerical simulations on a Manhattan-like road network. Moreover we point out the existence of oscillating regimes, where traffic oscillations back propagate on the road network, whose onset depend sensitively from the traffic fluctuations and that have a strong influence on the hysteresis cycles of the systems when the traffic load is modulated. The comparison between the numerical simulations and the empirical traffic data recorded by an inductive-loop traffic detector system (MTS system) on the county roads of the Emilia Romagna region in Italy is shortly discussed.

A novel framework of model predictive control (MPC) is designed that overcomes the limitations of other MPC based traffic signal control strategies, which are mostly restricted to control only split or green time in a fixed cycle ignoring signal offset. A simple macroscopic model of traffic tailored to MPC is formulated that describes traffic dynamics in the network at a short sampling interval. The proposed framework is demonstrated using a small road network with dynamically changing traffic flows. The parameters of the proposed model are calibrated by using data obtained from detailed microscopic simulation that yields realistic statistics. The model is transformed into a mixed logical dynamical system that is suitable to a finite horizon, and traffic signals are optimized using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) for a given performance index. The framework makes the signals flexibly turn to red and green by adapting quickly to any changes in traffic conditions. Results are also verified by microscopic traffic simulation and compared with other signal control schemes.

J	Cong, Z; De Schutter, B; Babuska, R				Cong, Zhe; De Schutter, Bart; Babuska, Robert			Co-design of traffic network topology and control measures	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Network topology design; Dynamic traffic control; Co-design	MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; VARIABLE-SPEED LIMITS; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; OPTIMAL COORDINATION; MOTORWAY NETWORKS; ALGORITHM; FLOW; OPTIMIZATION; INFORMATION; TIME	The two main directions to improve traffic flows in networks involve changing the network topology and introducing new traffic control measures. In this paper, we consider a co-design approach to apply these two methods jointly to improve the interaction between different methods and to get a better overall performance. We aim at finding the optimal network topology and the optimal parameters of traffic control laws at the same time by solving a co-optimization problem. However, such an optimization problem is usually highly non-linear and non-convex, and it possibly involves a mixed-integer form. Therefore, we discuss four different solution frameworks that can be used for solving the co-optimization problem, according to different requirements on the computational complexity and speed. A simulation-based study is implemented on the Singapore freeway network to illustrate the co-design approach and to compare the four different solution frameworks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Some previous studies have attempted this but have been limited to hypothetical scenarios or simplified traffic modelling, with no validation or sensitivity analysis. In this study, micro-simulation modelling of traffic was used to estimate emissions caused by delays at road works, for several traffic management options. The emissions were compared to those created by the maintenance operation, estimated using an LCA model. In this case study, the extra traffic emissions caused by delays at road works are relatively small, compared to those from the maintenance process, except for hydrocarbon emissions. However, they are generally close to, or above, the materiality threshold recommended in PA52050 for estimating carbon footprints, and reach 5-10% when traffic flow levels are increased (hypothetically) or when traffic management is imposed outside times of lowest traffic flow. It is recommended, therefore, that emissions due to traffic disruption at road works should be included within the system boundary of road pavement LCA and carbon footprint studies and should be considered in developing guidelines for environmental product declarations of road pavement maintenance products and services.

An increasing volume of maritime container traffic requires the application of modern container transportation technologies and the implementation of new technical solutions. The container terminal efficiency, along with numerous factors, is the result of the accurately estimated capacity requirements and adequate means of transshipment. In this paper, the authors have analyzed the Ports of Rijeka, Ploce and Koper container terminals with a particular emphasis on the analysis and evaluation of the existing situation of transshipment capacities within the listed terminals. The aim of this paper is to present a comparative analysis of the existing transshipment capacities and the development tendencies of the above mentioned terminals.

Corresponding macroscopic transport equations for large time and homogenized behavior are obtained and studied numerically. This work continues a recent discussion [Averaged kinetic models for flows on unstructured networks, Kinetic Related Models 4 (2011) 1081-1096] and provides additionally explicit equilibrium solutions, second-order macroscopic approximations as well as numerical simulations on a large scale homogenized network.

The linear stability condition is obtained by linear stability analysis and the mKdV equation is deducted from nonlinear analysis via considering the traffic interruption probability of the optimal current, respectively. The results of numerical simulation show that the traffic interruption probability of the optimal current can efficiently suppress traffic jams under high response coefficient and deteriorate traffic situations under low response coefficient.

The local fundamental diagram and the cross correlation near the entry of the reduced lane have been analyzed. The typical two-dimensional scatter diagram in the local fundamental diagram and the non-correlation of the cross correlation between the local density and the flow reveal the characteristics of synchronized traffic flow near the entry of the reduced lane. By using the rescaled range analysis (R/S) method to calculate the Hurst exponent, we can obtain the long-range correlated characteristics of the synchronized flow at a traffic bottleneck. We have found that the larger the length of bottleneck, the higher the Hurst's exponent does as well as the stronger the correlations of the system. Applying our correlation analysis to traffic flow simulations with the NaSch model, which cannot reproduce synchronized flow of the three-phase theory, we have indeed found that the NaSch model does not exhibit long-range correlation characteristics found for synchronized flow.

The proposed model discriminates the four types of car-truck following combination, car-following-car (CC), car-following-truck (CT), truck-following-car (TC) and truck-following-truck (TT). The four combinations are considered in terms of the safety distance, reaction time and randomization probability. The parameter values in the proposed model are derived from NGSIM data. Simulations are conducted based on the new model and some new conclusions about the characteristics of the car-truck traffic flow are drawn. First, in the density range of (23-36) vehs/km, the fundamental diagram mainly depends on the car-truck following combination, especially, on the proportion of CC combination. In this range, the fundamental diagram curves with the same proportion of CC gather into a cluster, and the flow rate increases with the increment of the proportion of CC for the same traffic density. Second, traffic congestion can be effectively reduced up to 6.3% by increasing the proportion of TC or CT combination. This finding provides a possible way to alleviate traffic congestion on freeway. Third, reducing randomization probability of the four combinations can effectively increase traffic capacity and alleviate traffic congestion. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Pan, D; Zheng, YP				Pan Deng; Zheng Ying-Ping			Spatiotemporal evolution model of vehicular movement behavior under path constraints	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						vehicular movement behavior; spatiotemporal evolution; path constraint; Serret-Frenet moving frame	CONTROL-SYSTEMS; STABILITY	The path of vehicle movement in a complex geographical environment has the 3D space feature, which is evidently the constraint for vehicular movement behaviors and cannot be described in one-dimensional or two-dimensional space. But the path of vehicle movement in a complex geographical environment can be abstracted into a space curve. By introducing theories in differential geometry, we can build a Serret-Frenet frame moving along this space curve with the geometric invariants of arc length, curvature, and torsion. And then, we can give a mathematical description to the dynamic behavior of the Serret-Frenet frame with the time-varying property at an arbitrary point of space curve. Finally, the spatiotemporal evolution model of the vehicle movement behaviors under the path constraint conditions is established and is rigidly proven in mathematics to be suitable for the longitudinal movement and uniform circular motion of a vehicle (in Serret-Frenet frame). It will lay the theoretical foundation for the future study of vehicular movement behaviors on the transport line in a complex geographical environment, including vehicular microscopic behaviors such as the vehicle following operation, lane changing, as well as the vehicular macroscopic behavior in traffic flows.

Joint Analysis of Queuing Delays Associated With Secondary Incidents	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Microscopic Simulation; Secondary Incidents; Incident Delays	FREEWAY CAPACITY; MANAGEMENT; CONGESTION; HIGHWAY; CRASHES	Incidents cause substantial travel delays on urban freeways. Travel delays due to incidents are typically estimated for each incident independently. However, when multiple incidents occur on the same stretch of a roadway, treating them independently and ignoring their interactions leads to inaccurate results, which ultimately may lead to inefficient incident management strategies. This study examines delays due to primary-secondary incident pairs that occur on the same stretch of a freeway within a short time gap. Depending on their correlation in time and space, they can have varying degrees of impacts on the traffic flow. This article assesses the total delays induced by primary-secondary incident pairs by jointly modeling their occurrences. First, incident data combined with roadway inventory data from Hampton Roads, Virginia, are analyzed to understand the attributes of primary-secondary incident pairs, e.g., durations, lane blockages, and time gaps (between start times of the primary and its secondary incidents). Then using microscopic simulation as a primary evaluation tool, the effects of three critical parameters are investigated: time gap, distance between primary and secondary incidents, and traffic demand level. The historical incident analysis shows that, on average, primary-secondary incident pairs have substantially longer durations than single incidents. The joint analysis of queuing delays induced by primary incident and its secondary incident suggests that time gap and distance between a primary incident and its secondary incident are significantly associated with the total delays after controlling for other factors (e.g., the two associated incidents' durations and lane blockages). Furthermore, based on the scenarios tested (i.e., two incidents both blocking the right lane in a three-lane basic freeway section), it is found that the sum of delays induced by a primary incident and its secondary incident separately will over- or underestimate the actual delays. For those secondary incidents that end after their associated primary incidents, total delays increase as time gap increases; increasing the distance between primary and secondary incidents is associated with reduction in delays. Other results and the implications of the findings for traffic operations are presented in the article.

J	Horvat, R; Kos, G; Sevrovic, M				Horvat, Rajko; Kos, Goran; Sevrovic, Marko			TRAFFIC FLOW MODELLING ON THE ROAD NETWORK IN THE CITIES	TEHNICKI VJESNIK-TECHNICAL GAZETTE			English	Article						density and volume; road infrastructure design; road network; traffic flow; traffic modelling; traffic speed	CONGESTION	Planning of road transport infrastructure is a complex process. One of the major issues is determining the design elements of road infrastructure (road type and number of traffic lanes, cross-sectional profile, etc.). When designing roads, parameters from the international literature are used, containing values derived empirically from local data on traffic flow (mostly from northern American cities). The goal of this paper was to explore traffic flows for the purpose of developing a model that will enable scientifically exact description of traffic flows in urban areas of Central Europe. Study of basic parameters of traffic flow included the selection of road location, survey time, traffic survey, analysis of video recordings, as well as statistical analysis and calculation of basic parameters of traffic flow. Added value of this research is demonstrated through the method of collecting and analysing the data for each lane (or roadway) separately in order to detect the difference in the values of the basic parameters of traffic flows. The research was conducted on various urban roads and in various traffic conditions and in this way the basic parameters of traffic flow were obtained. These parameters were used to develop diagrams of relations between speed, traffic density and volume, resulting in cumulative functions of traffic flow parameters for the entire urban traffic network. This made it possible to develop new equations enabling theoretical determination of flow volume, speed and density for a given road. Methods established in this work and the results of the research present a useful and applicable tool for benchmarking road capacity and finding relevant coefficients significant for dimensioning the road cross-sections in urban areas, but also on all other categories of roads.

J	Jin, WL				Jin, Wen-Long			Continuous formulations and analytical properties of the link transmission model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Newell's model; Link transmission model; Link demand and supply; Link queue and vacancy sizes; Invariant junction model; Stationary states and stability	KINEMATIC WAVES; TRAFFIC FLOW; VARIATIONAL FORMULATION; NETWORK; SIMULATION	The link transmission model (LTM) has great potential for simulating traffic flow in large-scale networks since it is much more efficient and accurate than the Cell Transmission Model (CTM). However, there lack general continuous formulations of LTM, and there has been no systematic study on its analytical properties such as stationary states and stability of network traffic flow. In this study we attempt to fill the gaps. First we apply the Hopf-Lax formula to derive Newell's simplified kinematic wave model with given boundary cumulative flows and the triangular fundamental diagram. We then apply the Hopf-Lax formula to define link demand and supply functions, as well as link queue and vacancy functions, and present two continuous formulations of LTM, by incorporating boundary demands and supplies as well as invariant macroscopic junction models. With continuous LTM, we define and solve the stationary states in a road network. We also apply LTM to directly derive a Poincare map to analyze the stability of stationary states in a diverge-merge network. Finally we present an example to show that LTM is not well-defined with non-invariant junction models. We can see that Newell's model and continuous LTM complement each other and provide an alternative formulation of the network kinematic wave theory. This study paves the way for further extensions, analyses, and applications of LTM in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In particular, a car-following model is proposed to capture the impacts from the lateral gaps of the leading vehicles on both sides of the following vehicle. Linear stability analysis of the proposed model is performed using the perturbation-method to obtain the stability condition. Nonlinear analysis is performed using the reductive perturbation method to derive the modified Korteweg de Vries equation to describe the density wave propagation. Results from numerical experiments illustrate that the proposed car-following model has larger stable region compared to a car-following model that considers the effect of lateral gap on only one side. Also, it is able to more rapidly dissipate the effect of a perturbation such as a sudden stimulus from a leading vehicle. In addition, the findings of this study provide insights in analyzing system performance of a non-lane-discipline road system in the future.

In this paper, we propose an extended optimal velocity model with consideration of velocity difference between the current velocity and the historical velocity of the considered vehicle. We conduct the linear stability analysis to the extended model with concluding that the traffic flow can be stabilized by taking into account the velocity difference between the current velocity and the historical velocity of the considered vehicle. Namely, the traffic stability can be improved only by each vehicle's self-stabilizing control, without the cooperative driving control from others. It is also found that the time gap between the current velocity and the historical velocity has an important impact on the stability criterion. To describe the phase transition, the mKdV equation near the critical point is derived by using the reductive perturbation method. The theoretical results are verified using numerical simulation. Finally, it is clarified that the self-stabilizing control in velocity is essentially equivalent to the parameter adjusting of the sensitivity.

J	Seo, T; Kusakabe, T; Asakura, Y				Seo, Toru; Kusakabe, Takahiko; Asakura, Yasuo			Estimation of flow and density using probe vehicles with spacing measurement equipment	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Probe vehicle; Lagrangian sensing; Traffic flow; Traffic state estimation; Advanced driver assistance system	TRACKING; SENSOR; SYSTEM	Probe vehicles provide some of the most useful data for road traffic monitoring because they can acquire wide-ranging and spatiotemporally detailed information at a relatively low cost compared with traditional fixed-point observation. However, current GPS-equipped probe vehicles cannot directly provide us volume-related variables such as flow and density. In this paper, we propose a new probe vehicle-based estimation method for obtaining volume-related variables by assuming that a probe vehicle can measure the spacing to its leading one. This assumption can be realized by utilizing key technologies in advanced driver assistance systems that are expected to spread in the near future. We developed a method of estimating the flow, density, and speed from the probe vehicle data without exogenous assumptions on traffic flow characteristics, such as a fundamental diagram. In order to quantify the characteristics of the method, we performed a field experiment at a real-world urban expressway by employing prototypes of the probe vehicles with spacing measurement equipment. The result showed that the proposed method could accurately estimate the 5 min and hourly traffic volumes with probe vehicle penetration rate of 3.5% and 0.2%, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Since their shares of emissions vary across space and time, so do air pollution concentrations. Despite these variations, panel data have rarely been used in land-use regression (LUR) modeling of air pollution. In addition, the complex interactions between traffic flows, land uses, and meteorological variables, have not been satisfactorily investigated in LUR models. The purpose of this research is to develop and estimate nitrogen dioxide (NO2) panel models based on the LUR framework with data for Seoul, Korea, accounting for the impacts of these variables, and their interactions with spatial and temporal dummy variables. The panel data vary over several scales: daily (24 h), seasonally (4), and spatially (34 intra-urban measurement locations). To enhance model explanatory power, wind direction and distance decay effects are accounted for. The results show that vehicle-kilometers-traveled (VKT) and solar radiation have statistically strong positive and negative impacts on NO2 concentrations across the four seasonal models. In addition, there are significant interactions with the dummy variables, pointing to VKT and solar radiation effects on NO2 concentrations that vary with time and intra-urban location. The results also show that residential, commercial, and industrial land uses, and wind speed, temperature, and humidity, all impact NO2 concentrations. The R-2 vary between 0.95 and 0.98.

A Study of Truck Platooning Incentives Using a Congestion Game	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Atomic congestion game; heavy-duty vehicle platooning; learning algorithm; pure strategy Nash equilibrium	NETWORK EQUILIBRIUM; FICTITIOUS PLAY; MULTICLASS; FUEL	We introduce an atomic congestion game with two types of agents, namely, cars and trucks, to model the traffic flow on a road over various time intervals of the day. Cars maximize their utility by finding a tradeoff between the time they choose to use the road, the average velocity of the flow at that time, and the dynamic congestion tax that they pay for using the road. In addition to these terms, the trucks have an incentive for using the road at the same time as their peers because they have platooning capabilities, which allow them to save fuel. The dynamics and equilibria of this game-theoretic model for the interaction between car traffic and truck platooning incentives are investigated. We use traffic data from Stockholm, Sweden, to validate parts of the modeling assumptions and extract reasonable parameters for the simulations. We use joint strategy fictitious play and average strategy fictitious play to learn a pure strategy Nash equilibrium of this game. We perform a comprehensive simulation study to understand the influence of various factors, such as the drivers' value of time and the percentage of the trucks that are equipped with platooning devices, on the properties of the Nash equilibrium.

In this paper, an extended feedback control strategy is proposed for MTFC enabled via VSLs, considering multiple-bottleneck locations. Feedback-based results are compared with optimal control results for the evaluation of the controller using a validated macroscopic model. The performance of the feedback controller is shown to approach the optimal control results, despite the fact that many practical and safety restrictions are additionally considered by the feedback controller.

J	Knoop, VL; Buisson, C				Knoop, Victor L.; Buisson, Christine			Calibration and Validation of Probabilistic Discretionary Lane-Change Models	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Calibration and validation; freeway operations; lane changing; road transportation; traffic flow modeling		Lane changes (LCs) are important in traffic flow operations. They cause differences in flow over lanes and in some cases determine the start of congestion. Whereas calibration and validation are commonly used with car-following models, this is not common practice with LC models. Even then, it is not clear what calibration and validation entails for probabilistic LC models. Therefore, this paper reviews methodologies to calibrate and validate probabilistic LC models, both microscopically and macroscopically. A likelihood is often used in calibration but does not intuitively show the quality of the model. An example shows that it is possible to have the model calibrated and validated with accurate parameters all having the same error in the validation as in the calibration, but the quality of the model is still bad. Using a likelihood ensures the stochastic effects are well captured, but the conclusion is that for validation purposes, one can better use a measure that has physical interpretation and gives a value indicating the quality of the model for the purpose for which it needs to be used.

J	Qiu, F; Li, WQ; Zhang, J; Zhang, XC; Xie, QF				Qiu, Feng; Li, Wenquan; Zhang, Jian; Zhang, Xuechi; Xie, Qiufeng			Exploring suitable traffic conditions for intermittent bus lanes	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						public transport; intermittent bus lane; bus priority; moving bottleneck theory; cellular automaton	MODEL; TRANSIT	As one of the most promising bus priority techniques, the innovative intermittent bus lane (IBL) strategy has drawn more attention in the past few years. In this paper, some improvements on the operation of the IBL strategy are proposed, and two cellular automaton models for a roadway section with two lanes, one with no bus priority and the other with an intermittent bus lane, are built to study the characteristics of urban traffic flow. Computer simulations and analytical models are developed to conduct quantitative research on the influence of IBL on the traffic density distribution, traffic velocity, and traffic capacity of the roadway section. By comparing the average paces in the two cases, this paper proposes a methodology to determine suitable traffic conditions for the IBL strategy implementation. The results indicate that for the designed scenarios, the IBL strategy is effective only when the traffic density is in the range of 25 to 74pcu/km, which suggests that level of service C is the inflection point for implementing the IBL strategy.

J	Wang, F; Tang, KS; Li, KP				Wang, Fen; Tang, Keshuang; Li, Keping			A stochastic computational model for yellow time determination and its application	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						stochastic model; traffic randomness; dilemma zone; Monte Carlo Simulation	SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS; DILEMMA ZONE; RELIABILITY	This paper proposes a stochastic model to determine the yellow time according to the occurring probability of Type-I dilemma zone (P-DZ). Unlike the conventional methods generally based on the deterministic traffic flow theory, the proposed model fully accounts for the randomness of input variables such as approaching speed, deceleration rate, perception-and-reaction time, and distance to stop-line at the yellow onset. A theoretical model is firstly established, and a computational program incorporating Monte Carlo Simulation is then developed to facilitate its general solution. These two alternative solution approaches to derive P-DZ and Y are proposed, depending upon whether D/V and (+V/2d) follow certain analytical distributions or not. In addition, field data at a typical high-speed highway intersection are collected to validate the model. Based on the validated model, comprehensive sensitivity analysis is conducted to look into the entire picture of the relationship between P-DZ and the distributions as well as correlations of the input variables. To demonstrate the application of the proposed model, the required yellow times for various conditions are calculated based on the acceptable levels of P-DZ, and representative application tables for typical cases are finally provided. With the aid of the proposed methodology, traffic engineers are capable of designing yellow time in a more sophisticated manner. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A mathematical model is first presented, including a validated macroscopic traffic flow model and a measurement model. The traffic state estimator is designed on the basis of extended Kalman filtering. The estimator's performance in tracking capability and automatic incident detection is then carefully examined via real-data tests or field applications, under various conditions involving large-scale networks, sparse measurements, infrastructure heterogeneity, changes of environmental conditions, traffic incidents, detector faults, and measurement inaccuracy. The paper is closed with discussions and conclusions. This paper overviews the state-of-the-art research on real-time freeway traffic state estimation using extended Kalman filtering. Ongoing research in this area addresses several extensions of the work reported, including: Comparison with other filtering methods (particle or unscented filters); decentralisation of the filtering structure; state estimation in urban road networks; new issues arising from the increasing presence of connected and even automated vehicles; and more.

This study is to develop a probabilistic model to extensively investigate the effects of traffic flow randomness and driver's decision errors on the determination of intergreen times. An analytical framework was proposed based on a safety reliability model earlier developed by the authors and validated based on field data at a typical high-speed intersection in Shanghai. Then, comprehensive sensitivity analysis was performed to look into the fluctuation of safety reliability towards critical variables as well as their variations and correlations. Two logistic regression models were developed to quantify the effects of each random component on the probabilities of risky behaviour and clearance failure, that is, safety reliability indicators for intergreen intervals. To facilitate easy applications of the proposed approach, a set of scenario analysis were done to calculate the required intergreen intervals under different traffic conditions and safety reliability levels. Application tables were finally provided for signal design, which are able to recommend more sophisticated intergreen times and thus aid the practitioners to select proper intergreen times according to local conditions without complicated calculation.

According to the introduced method, selected segments of vehicle detector data are searched for records similar to the current traffic conditions, instead of the entire database. The data segments are determined on the basis of a segmentation procedure, which aims to select input data that are useful for the prediction algorithm. Advantages of the proposed method were demonstrated in experiments on real-world traffic data. Experimental results show that the proposed method not only improves the accuracy of the traffic volume prediction, but also significantly reduces its computational cost.

Reducing vehicle emissions and fuel consumption in the city by using particle swarm optimization	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Traffic lights timing; SUMO Microscopic Simulator of Urban MObility; HBEFA traffic emission model	TRAFFIC FLOW; INTERSECTIONS; ALGORITHM; MODEL	Nowadays, the increasing levels of polluting emissions and fuel consumption of the road traffic in modern cities directly affect air quality, the city economy, and especially the health of citizens. Therefore, improving the efficiency of the traffic flow is a mandatory task in order to mitigate such critical problems. In this article, a Swarm Intelligence approach is proposed for the optimal scheduling of traffic lights timing programs in metropolitan areas. By doing so, the traffic flow of vehicles can be improved with the final goal global target of reducing their fuel consumption and gas emissions (CO and N O (x) ). In this work we optimize the traffic lights timing programs and analyze their effect in pollution by following the standard HBEFA as the traffic emission model. Specifically, we focus on two large and heterogeneous urban scenarios located in the cities of Malaga and Seville (in Spain). When compared to the traffic lights timing programs designed by experts close to real ones, the proposed strategy obtains significant reductions in terms of the emission rates (23.3 % CO and 29.3 % N O (x) ) and the total fuel consumption.

J	Hill, C; Elefteriadou, L; Kondyli, A				Hill, Corey; Elefteriadou, Lily; Kondyli, Alexandra			Exploratory Analysis of Lane Changing on Freeways Based on Driver Behavior	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Driver behavior; Models; Traffic flow	CAR-FOLLOWING MODELS; INSTRUMENTED VEHICLE	Lane changing has received much attention as it is a significant component of microscopic traffic simulation. Many studies have focused on the details of the lane changing maneuver from external observation-based data which do not consider the type of driver performing the maneuver. The research reported in this paper relates the physical details of freeway lane changing to the type of driver performing the maneuver. Forty-six research participants drove an instrumented vehicle and performed a combined total of 726 freeway lane changes. Each research participant was categorized into one of four groups ranging from conservative to aggressive based on cluster analysis. The data were analyzed to identify any trends between the different driver types and their lane changing characteristics, specifically lane changing duration and gap acceptance characteristics. In general, more conservative drivers have greater lane changing durations than aggressive drivers. The gap acceptance comparison among driver types did not yield any conclusive trend. In addition, distributions were fitted to lane changing duration and gap acceptance histograms. The results suggest that driver type impacts freeway lane changing behavior, and therefore should be taken into account when developing or refining simulation-based lane changing models.

J	Canic, S; Piccoli, B; Qiu, JM; Ren, T				Canic, Suncica; Piccoli, Benedetto; Qiu, Jing-Mei; Ren, Tan			Runge-Kutta Discontinuous Galerkin Method for Traffic Flow Model on Networks	JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING			English	Article						Scalar conservation laws; Traffic flow; Hyperbolic network; Discontinuous Galerkin; Bound preserving	WAVES	We propose a bound-preserving Runge-Kutta (RK) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method as an efficient, effective and compact numerical approach for numerical simulation of traffic flow problems on networks, with arbitrary high order accuracy. Road networks are modeled by graphs, composed of a finite number of roads that meet at junctions. On each road, a scalar conservation law describes the dynamics, while coupling conditions are specified at junctions to define flow separation or convergence at the points where roads meet. We incorporate such coupling conditions in the RK DG framework, and apply an arbitrary high order bound preserving limiter to the RK DG method to preserve the physical bounds on the network solutions (car density). We showcase the proposed algorithm on several benchmark test cases from the literature, as well as several new challenging examples with rich solution structures. Modeling and simulation of Cauchy problems for traffic flows on networks is notorious for lack of uniqueness or (Lipschitz) continuous dependence. The discontinuous Galerkin method proposed here deals elegantly with these problems, and is perhaps the only realistic and efficient high-order method for network problems.

Traffic Flow Prediction for Road Transportation Networks With Limited Traffic Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Historical time traffic flows; least squares method; optimization; traffic flow prediction	TRAVEL-TIME PREDICTION; TRIP MATRICES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; KALMAN FILTER; MISSING DATA; MODELS; VOLUME	Obtaining accurate information about current and near-term future traffic flows of all links in a traffic network has a wide range of applications, including traffic forecasting, vehicle navigation devices, vehicle routing, and congestion management. A major problem in getting traffic flow information in real time is that the vast majority of links is not equipped with traffic sensors. Another problem is that factors affecting traffic flows, such as accidents, public events, and road closures, are often unforeseen, suggesting that traffic flow forecasting is a challenging task. In this paper, we first use a dynamic traffic simulator to generate flows in all links using available traffic information, estimated demand, and historical traffic data available from links equipped with sensors. We implement an optimization methodology to adjust the origin-to-destination matrices driving the simulator. We then use the real-time and estimated traffic data to predict the traffic flows on each link up to 30 min ahead. The prediction algorithm is based on an autoregressive model that adapts itself to unpredictable events. As a case study, we predict the flows of a traffic network in San Francisco, CA, USA, using a macroscopic traffic flow simulator. We use Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate our methodology. Our simulations demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach. The traffic flow prediction errors vary from an average of 2% for 5-min prediction windows to 12% for 30-min windows even in the presence of unpredictable events.

Over the last few years, traffic data have been exploding, and we have truly entered the era of big data for transportation. Existing traffic flow prediction methods mainly use shallow traffic prediction models and are still unsatisfying for many real-world applications. This situation inspires us to rethink the traffic flow prediction problem based on deep architecture models with big traffic data. In this paper, a novel deep-learning-based traffic flow prediction method is proposed, which considers the spatial and temporal correlations inherently. A stacked autoencoder model is used to learn generic traffic flow features, and it is trained in a greedy layerwise fashion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep architecture model is applied using autoencoders as building blocks to represent traffic flow features for prediction. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the proposed method for traffic flow prediction has superior performance.

J	Zheng, L				Zheng Liang			Detailed string stability analysis for bi-directional optimal velocity model	JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY			English	Article						traffic flow; string stability; optimal velocity model; linearized stability theory; transfer function	CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; DELAYED-FEEDBACK CONTROL; CONTROLLING TRAFFIC JAMS; ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; REACTION-TIME DELAY; MULTIPLE INFORMATION; DYNAMICAL MODEL; FLOW; VEHICLES; STABILIZATION	The class of bi-directional optimal velocity models can describe the bi-directional looking effect that usually exists in the reality and is even enhanced with the development of the connected vehicle technologies. Its combined string stability condition can be obtained through the method of the ring-road based string stability analysis. However, the partial string stability about traffic fluctuation propagated backward or forward was neglected, which will be analyzed in detail in this work by the method of transfer function and its H (a) norm from the viewpoint of control theory. Then, through comparing the conditions of combined and partial string stabilities, their relationships can make traffic flow be divided into three distinguishable regions, displaying various combined and partial string stability performance. Finally, the numerical experiments verify the theoretical results and find that the final displaying string stability or instability performance results from the accumulated and offset effects of traffic fluctuations propagated from different directions.

Such models are required in macro-, mesoscopic traffic flow models, including dynamic network loading models for dynamic traffic assignment. Based on the behaviour of drivers approaching and passing through intersections, the model family is presented. The headway and the turn delay of vehicles are key variables. Having demand and supply as input creates a natural connection to macroscopic link models. Properties like the invariance principle and the conservation of turning fractions are satisfied. The inherent non-uniqueness is analysed by providing the complete set of feasible solutions. The node models proposed by Tampere et al. (2011), Flotterod and Rohde (2011) and Gibb (2011) are members of the family. Furthermore, two new models are added to the family. Solution methods for all family members are presented, as well as a qualitative and quantitative comparison. Finally, an outlook for the future development of empirically verified models is given.

The choice probability can be either destination specific or origin-destination specific, resulting into two formulations. To capture the effect of physical queues in these FP formulations, the link transmission model is modified for the network loading and travel time determination. The self-regulated averaging method (SRAM) was adopted to solve the FP formulations. Numerical examples were developed to illustrate the properties of the problem and the effectiveness of the solution method. The proposed models were further used to evaluate the effect of information quality and road network improvement on the network performance in terms of total system travel time (TSTT) and the cost of total vehicle emissions (CTVE). Numerical results show that providing better information quality, enhancing link outflow capacity, or constructing a new road can lead to poor network performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The corresponding free boundary problem is studied by means of introduction of Lagrangian coordinates, which render the free boundary stationary. It is proved that the equivalent problem posed in a time-independent domain admits unique local and global in time classical solutions. The proof of the local in time existence is performed with standard methods, to prove the global in time existence the system is reduced to a system of two second-order quasilinear parabolic equations.

Investigating freeway traffic hypercongestion between an on-ramp and its immediate upstream off-ramp	TRANSPORTMETRICA A-TRANSPORT SCIENCE			English	Article						merge; freeway congestion dynamics; traffic hypercongestion; kinematic wave model of traffic flow	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; KINEMATIC WAVES; FLOW	This paper applies the freeway traffic congestion dynamics proposed in Laval and Leclercq [2010. "Continuum Approximation for Congestion Dynamics Along Freeway Corridors." Transportation Science 44 (1): 87-97] but with a modified distribution scheme of freeway merging flows to investigation of traffic hypercongestion on a freeway between an on-ramp and its immediate upstream off-ramp. The reason to make this modification is that the original merging scheme of this dynamics is found to possibly give undesired full priority to the traffic from the on-ramp and also occasionally make the resulting flow going through the merge greater than the available capacity. Traffic hypercongestion in this paper refers to a state where speed and flow change in the same direction as density varies. A homogeneous freeway segment chosen for this investigation includes an on-ramp and an off-ramp, which may correspond to a freeway passing by a city or town, with an off-ramp lying upstream towards the city and an on-ramp downstream. The entry flow from the upstream approach of the freeway was fixed and constant within the time horizon while both deterministic and random on-ramp inflow rates were used in this investigation. Then the formation and dissipation of traffic hypercongestion is investigated as on-ramp demand and off-ramp departure profiles vary. The first finding of this investigation is that the density in the hypercongestion area behind the merge never reached the jam density. Second, the hypercongested area continued to grow as long as the sum of the demand from the upstream of the freeway and that from the on-ramp was greater than the available capacity at the merge. Third, as long as the rate of flow leaving from the freeway via the off-ramp was not smaller than the entry flow rates from the on-ramp, no hypercongestion had been observed. In addition, in analysing the numerical results, a series of discussions was carried out to build the linkage between the on- and off-ramp flow profiles and the generated and attracted demand of the city plus its adjacent area the two ramps served for; these discussions suggest that the balanced generated and attracted demand of the city plus its adjacent area can reduce or even remove traffic hypercongestion behind the merge on the chosen freeway segment.

The linear analysis results show that the stable region for aggressive drivers is much larger than that for timid drivers, which means that aggressive drivers are much more prompt than timid drivers in stabilizing traffic flow. Moreover, we derive the mKdV equation near the critical point and obtain its kink-antikink soliton solution to describe the feature of traffic jamming transition. The good agreement between numerical simulations and analytical results reveals that drivers' characteristics have an important role in the stability of traffic flow and traffic jamming transition in two-lane traffic system.

See 185, 2016)	EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article; Retracted Publication						Intelligent transportation systems; Dynamic ramp metering; Dynamic speed limit control		In this study, dynamic traffic control strategies, namely dynamic ramp metering and dynamic speed limit control, have been examined through microscopic traffic simulation based on site measurements. In this context, the traffic flow data at a particular highway intersection have been analyzed to determine the pattern of the traffic. Then, the traffic model has been built in a traffic micro-simulation software and calibrated with the field data. The foci of the study are to measure the efficiency of the dynamic traffic control strategies and to compare it with the uncontrolled case considering various performance indicators such as total travel time, average delay time per vehicle, and average number of stops per vehicle. For the dynamic ramp metering strategies, the ALINEA (Asservissement Lineaire d'Entree Autoroutiere - French for Linear Utilization for Highway Entrances) control algorithm is implemented with different fixed-time cycle lengths. It has been observed that various ramp metering implementations decreased the average delay time per vehicle up to 30%. The dynamic speed limit control strategies are set according to the occupancy rates that are measured at the bottleneck downstream. The examined speed limit control strategies decreased the average delay time per vehicle to around 7%. The results also revealed that the implemented dynamic traffic control strategies help alleviate congestion by increasing the capacity of the bottleneck section.

The cross section traffic data collected provides models opportunity for travel time prediction. However, the sparseness of data somewhat constrains the prediction accuracy. To tackle this problem, the paper presents a highway travel time prediction algorithm based on pattern matching method. First, a pattern library is established by choosing traffic volume and speed as its certain state components and time as its uncertain state component. Then, the space-time two-dimensional linear interpolation method is used to calculate the mean speed and subsequently the travel time. Finally, similar patterns are obtained using K Nearest Neighbor approach and predicted travel time is calculated by the Weighted Average method. The case study shows that the pattern matching method for travel time prediction based on microwave detection data produces sufficient accuracy, which solves the problem of sparse detectors effectively.

Fatigue assessment of existing riveted truss bridges: case study	BULLETIN OF THE POLISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES-TECHNICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						durability; fatigue; steel structure; bridge; riveted truss; Eurocodes	LIFE	Many steel riveted bridges have been built in Poland since 1950 and they have not reached their design working lives yet. Nevertheless, a number of fatigue damages are found, especially with structural joints. Moreover, in the past 25 years the traffic on the Polish road network has increased significantly leading to the increasing number of heavy vehicles in the traffic flows. This may affect the safety, serviceability and durability of existing bridges. The road administration is therefore interested in reliable and agreed methods to assess the safety and durability of existing bridges. The special procedure has been prepared to provide technical insight on the way in which existing steel structures could be assessed and the remaining fatigue life could be estimated. This approach follows the principles and application rules in the Eurocodes and provides a scheme with various levels of analysis: a basic level with general methods and further levels, more complex and sophisticated and requiring specific experience and knowledge. This procedure has been used for the fatigue assessment of the 60-year-old riveted truss bridge. The applied procedure as well as the main results of the assessment have been presented in the paper.

J	Gowri, A; Sivanandan, R				Gowri, A.; Sivanandan, R.			Evaluation of right-turn lanes at signalized intersection in non-lane-based heterogeneous traffic using microscopic simulation model	TRANSPORTATION LETTERS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH			English	Article						Heterogeneous traffic; Signalized intersections; Microscopic simulation; Evaluation; Right-turn lanes	MICRO-SIMULATION; QUEUE LENGTH; CALIBRATION; CAPACITY	In developing countries like India, the traffic on urban roads is highly heterogeneous in nature, with vehicles of widely varying static and dynamic characteristics. This type of traffic is characterized by lack of queue and lane discipline (lane-less movement) based on availability of spaces near intersections. Moreover, at intersections, straight-through, left-, and right-turning vehicles seek to occupy the same physical space. In such situations, the through vehicles are susceptible to delays in the absence of turn lanes for the left-turning and right-turning vehicles and vice versa. Models suitable for analysis of such traffic flow hardly exist, and most of the available models are limited in scope. In the current study, a microscopic traffic simulation model for signalized intersection is developed specifically for heterogeneous traffic. This model covers different vehicle types and allows for some special behavior, such as seepage of two-wheelers to fronts of queues. Detailed study of queue formation and dissipation were done microscopically under non-lane-based traffic conditions near intersection area. The model was calibrated and tested with data from Chennai city, India, and its predictions were found to be in close agreement with the field data. In addition, the model makes a significant contribution to the study of right-turn lane (RTL) on delays to vehicles. In general, RTL is found to be advantageous for most cases of approach volumes and right-turn proportions. The optimal lengths of RTL are suggested for various approach volumes and right-turn proportions.

On two-lane highways, the complexity of passing and the interaction with oncoming traffic requires specific models. This study focused on the development of a passing desire, decision and execution model. Results of the observation of 1752 maneuvers on 10 rural roads in Spain were used for this development. The model incorporated the effect of new factors such as available sight distance, delay and remaining travel time until the end of the highway segment. Outputs of the model were compared to observed data: firstly, individual passing maneuvers; secondly, traffic flow, percent followers and number of passing maneuvers in four single passing zones with two different traffic levels. The model was validated in four alternative passing zones. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The objectives of variable speed limit system installations are often to decrease the number of accidents and to increase traffic efficiency. Currently, there is an interest in exploring the potential of cooperative intelligent transport systems including communication between vehicles and/or vehicles and the infrastructure. In this paper, we study the potential benefits of introducing infrastructure to vehicle communication, autonomous vehicle control and individualized speed limits in variable speed limit systems. We do this by proposing a cooperative variable speed limit system as an extension of an existing variable speed limit system. In the proposed system, communication between the infrastructure and the vehicles is used to transmit variable speed limits to upstream vehicles before the variable message signs become visible to the drivers. The system is evaluated by the means of microscopic traffic simulation. Traffic efficiency and environmental effects are considered in the analysis. The results of the study show benefits of the infrastructure to vehicle communication, autonomous vehicle control and individualized speed limits for variable speed limit systems in the form of lower acceleration rates and thereby harmonized traffic flow and reduced exhaust emissions.

The proposed control scheme is based on an innovative reformulation of the adopted prediction model. The control approach is stated in a centralized framework, in two different cluster-based distributed architectures and in a decentralized one. Specifically, control distribution is exploited in this paper as a means to increase the practical applicability of an advanced control scheme that is often limited, due to its computational complexity and to the typical size of the systems under concern. The novelty of the proposed approach mainly relies on the way in which the control distribution is operated, since it is dictated by the subdivision of the freeway system into portions, possibly with heterogeneous features and of different sizes, called clusters. A cluster, in our view, is a system, so that the whole freeway can be regarded as a system of systems. The performance of the control scheme in its different versions is assessed in simulation, making reference to a case study developed on the basis of real data.

J	Chang, JY; Lai, WC				Chang, Jau-Yang; Lai, Wun-Cing			Simulation study of traffic accidents on a three-lane highway	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Driving behaviors; traffic accidents; three-lane traffic flow model; highway	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; CAR ACCIDENTS; FLOW	Unsuitable driving behaviors often lead to the occurrence of traffic accidents. To reduce accidents and to prolong human life, simulated investigations are highly desirable to evaluate the effect of traffic safety in terms of number of traffic accidents. In this paper, a three-lane traffic flow model is proposed to analyze the probability of the occurrence of traffic accidents on highway. We define appropriate driving rules for the forward moving and lane changing of the vehicles. Three types of vehicle accidents are designed to investigate the relationships between different driving behaviors and traffic accidents. We simulate four road driving strategies, and compute the traffic flow, velocity, lane-changing frequency and the probability of the occurrence of traffic accidents for different road driving strategies. According to the simulation and analysis, it is shown that the probability of the occurrence of traffic accidents can be reduced by using the specified road driving strategies. Additionally, we found that the occurrence of traffic accidents can be avoided when the slow vehicles are suitably constrained to move on a three-lane highway.

Traffic dynamics around weaving section influenced by accident: Cellular automata approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Traffic flow; cellular automata; weaving section; accident	MODELS; ROAD; BEHAVIOR; PHYSICS; SYSTEM; STATES; RAMPS; FLOW	The weaving section, as a typical bottleneck, is one source of vehicle conflicts and an accident-prone area. Traffic accident will block lanes and the road capacity will be reduced. Several models have been established to study the dynamics around traffic bottlenecks. However, little attention has been paid to study the complex traffic dynamics influenced by the combined erects of bottleneck and accident. This paper presents a cellular automaton model to characterize accident-induced traffic behavior around the weaving section. Some effective control measures are proposed and verified for traffic management under accident condition. The total flux as a function of inflow rates, the phase diagrams, the spatial-temporal diagrams, and the density and velocity profiles are presented to analyze the impact of accident. It was shown that the proposed control measures for weaving traffic can improve the capacity of weaving section under both normal and accident conditions; the accidents occurring on median lane in the weaving section are more inclined to cause traffic jam and reduce road capacity; the capacity of weaving section will be greatly reduced when the accident happens downstream the weaving section.

Simulation results show that the intermediate stable phase identified in the original model can be observed and maintained in a wide range of the vehicle density in our model. Some new kinds of space configurations have been first presented and discussed. One also notes that the geometric structure of such intermediate stable phases is highly regular for square and rectangular aspect rations.

J	Yang, XF; Lu, Y; Chang, GL				Yang, Xianfeng; Lu, Yang (Carl); Chang, Gang-Len			Exploratory analysis of an optimal variable speed control system for a recurrently congested freeway bottleneck	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						variable speed limit; optimal control; Kalman Filter; traffic flow model	LIMITS	This study presents two models for proactive variable speed limit (VSL) control on a recurrently congested freeway segment. The proposed model uses embedded traffic flow relations to predict the evolution of congestion patterns over the projected time horizon, and then computes the time-varying optimal speed limit to smooth traffic flows. To contend with the uncertainties associated with drivers' responses to VSL control, this study has also proposed an advanced model that further adopts Kalman Filter to enhance the traffic state estimation. Both models have been investigated with two control objectivestravel time minimization and speed variance minimization. Our extensive simulation analysis with a VISSIM simulator, calibrated with field data from our previous VSL field demonstration, has revealed the benefits of the proposed VSL control models. Also, the experimental results indicated that the proposed advanced models with both control objectives can significantly reduce the travel time over the recurrent bottleneck locations. With respect to several selected measure of effectiveness (MOEs), such as average number of stops and average travel time, the research results confirm that the control models with the objective of minimizing speed variance can offer the promising properties for field implementation.

Real-Time Traffic Density Estimation without Reliable Side Road Data	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Traffic congestion; Intelligent transportation systems; Traffic models; Data analysis; Traffic congestion; Intelligent transportation systems; Traffic modeling; Density estimation	MODEL; FLOW; WAVES	One of the most popular intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications is to provide real-time road traffic congestion information to the users. Traffic density is a major congestion indicator, and because its measurement is difficult, it is usually estimated from other readily measurable parameters. Several studies have explored various approaches for density estimation for homogeneous and lane-disciplined traffic conditions. However, Indian traffic is different with its heterogeneity of traffic and absence of lane discipline. Another characteristic is the lack of access control, making automated measurement of net entry into a study section difficult. An added difficulty is that the roads in India are not yet equipped with traffic sensors, leading to limitation in data collection. The present study mainly addresses the issue of estimating traffic density in the absence of automated sensors at the side roads/ramps on Indian roadways. A lumped parameter macroscopic traffic flow model has been formulated, and using this model, a model-based estimation scheme has been designed based on the Kalman filtering technique. The only data required for implementing this method in the field are the flow passing the entry location and the spot speeds of vehicles passing through the entry and exit locations. The proposed method was corroborated using data measured from a road stretch in Chennai, and the performance was found to be satisfactory.

Probabilistic Fuzzy Logic Signal and Ramp Metering at a Diamond Interchange	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article							CONTROLLER; SYSTEM	In this paper, a probabilistic fuzzy logic control is developed for the signalized control of a diamond interchange to improve the traffic flow on the surface streets and highways. The signal phasing, green-time extension, and ramp metering are decided in response to real-time traffic conditions. The probabilistic fuzzy logic for diamond interchange (PFLDI) includes the following three modules: probabilistic fuzzy phase timing that controls the green-time extension process of the current running phase, phase-selection logic that decides the next phase based on the presetup phase logic by the local transport authority, and probabilistic fuzzy ramp metering that determines the on-ramp-metering rate based on the traffic conditions of the arterial streets and highways. The advanced interactive microscopic simulator for urban and nonurban network software was used to model the diamond interchange and measure the effectiveness of the proposed PFLDI algorithm. The performance of the PFLDI was compared with that of an actuated diamond interchange (ADI) control based on the asservissement lineaire d'entre autoroutiere (ALINEA) algorithm and a conventional fuzzy logic control for a diamond interchange (FLDI) algorithm. Simulation results show that the PFLDI lowers system total travel time and average delay, improves the downstream average speed, and lowers the downstream average delay compared with ADI and FLDI.

In this paper, a novel traffic sensor location approach is proposed to determine the maximum number of traffic flows by considering the time-spatial correlation. The problem is formulated as three 0-1 programming models to maximise the number of obtained flows under different cases. To solve these novel sensor location problems, an ant colony optimisation algorithm with a local search procedure is designed. Numerical experiments are conducted in both a simulated network and in the Sioux-Falls network. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm, which is believed to possess potential applicability in real surveillance network design.

Some numerical simulations were carried out by employing the improved car-following model to explore how headway changes with memory affected each car's velocity, acceleration, headway and fuel consumptions. The research results show that headway changes with memory have significant effects on car-following behaviors and fuel consumptions and that considering headway changes with memory in designing the adaptive cruise control strategy can improve the traffic flow stability and minimize cars' fuel consumptions.

J	Fermo, L; Tosin, A				Fermo, Luisa; Tosin, Andrea			A fully-discrete-state kinetic theory approach to traffic flow on road networks	MATHEMATICAL MODELS & METHODS IN APPLIED SCIENCES			English	Article						Kinetic equations; traffic granularity; flows on networks; junction conditions	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; FUNDAMENTAL DIAGRAMS	This paper presents a new approach to the modeling of vehicular traffic flows on road networks based on kinetic equations. While in the literature the problem has been extensively studied by means of macroscopic hydrodynamic models, to date there are still not, to the authors' knowledge, contributions tackling it from a genuine statistical mechanics point of view. Probably one of the reasons is the higher technical complexity of kinetic traffic models, further increased in case of several interconnected roads. Here such difficulties of the theory are overcome by taking advantage of a discrete structure of the space of microscopic states of the vehicles, which is also significant in view of including the intrinsic microscopic granularity of the system in the mesoscopic representation.

J	Sharma, S				Sharma, Sapna			Lattice hydrodynamic modeling of two-lane traffic flow with timid and aggressive driving behavior	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow; Driver's characteristics; mKdV equation; Two-lane system	CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; NUMERICAL TESTS; CONTINUUM MODEL; MACRO MODEL; DIFFERENCE; TRANSITION; EQUATION; SYSTEMS; PHYSICS; JAMS	In this paper, a new two-lane lattice hydrodynamic traffic flow model is proposed by considering the aggressive or timid characteristics of driver's behavior. The effect of driver's characteristic on the stability of traffic flow is examined through linear stability analysis. It is shown that for both the cases of lane changing or without lane changing the stability region significantly enlarges (reduces) as the proportion of aggressive (timid) drivers increases. To describe the propagation behavior of a density wave near the critical point, nonlinear analysis is conducted and mKdV equation representing kink-antikink soliton is derived. The effect of anticipation parameter with more aggressive (timid) drivers is also investigated and found that it has a positive (negative) effect on the stability of two-lane traffic flow dynamics. Simulation results are found consistent with the theoretical findings which confirm that the driver's characteristics play a significant role in a two-lane traffic system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hartman, BC; Clott, C				Hartman, Bruce C.; Clott, Christopher			Intermodal chassis supply in the US - A Bayesian game model	RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Game theory; Intermodal transportation; Port logistics; Container chassis; Bayesian games		A container requires a chassis for every over the road move. In North America, unlike Europe, approximately 30% of chassis have been owned by ocean carriers, who are divesting their chassis. Older chassis bring higher risk for damage or disruption on a trip, though they cost much less than new chassis. Who will provide chassis to facilitate containe rmoves by truck for the growing amount of intermodal traffic flowing through the US? The issue is important for successful port operation, and may require at least operational improvements, and governance decisions by ports or terminal operators. We examine strategic possibilities for a trucker and shipper supplying chassis, using a Bayesian game. We find equilibrium and estimate typical values of decision parameters to make predictions about the signals shippers will send and corresponding truckers' strategy. Making truckers supply chassis may not be practical in North America, so additional specific policies and practices are needed. Inducing truckers to supply chassis under present economic conditions may require capital subsidies or higher freight costs, as well as improved operations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Qu, XB; Wang, SA; Zhang, J				Qu, Xiaobo; Wang, Shuaian; Zhang, Jin			On the fundamental diagram for freeway traffic: A novel calibration approach for single-regime models	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Traffic volume; Speed; Density; Fundamental diagram; Traffic flow theory	SPEED-DENSITY RELATIONSHIP; FUNCTIONAL FORM; NETWORKS; CONGESTION; HIGHWAY; WAVES; FLOW	The speed-density or flow-density relationship has been considered as the foundation of traffic flow theory. Existing single-regime models calibrated by the least square method (LSM) could not fit the empirical data consistently well both in light-traffic/free-flow conditions and congested/jam conditions. In this paper, first, we point out that the inaccuracy of single-regime models is not caused solely by their functional forms, but also by the sample selection bias. Second, we apply a weighted least square method (WLSM) that addresses the sample selection bias problem. The calibration results for six well-known single-regime models using the WLSM fit the empirical data reasonably well both in light-traffic/free-flow conditions and congested/jam conditions. Third, we conduct a theoretical investigation that reveals the deficiency associated with the LSM is because the expected value of speed (or a function of it) is nonlinear with regard to the density (or a function of it).

J	Gottlich, S; Herty, M; Ziegler, U				Goettlich, Simone; Herty, Michael; Ziegler, Ute			Modeling and optimizing traffic light settings in road networks	COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article						Traffic networks; Discretized conservation laws; Optimization; Mixed-integer programming	FLUID DYNAMIC-MODEL; SIGNAL OPTIMIZATION; FLOW; FORMULATION; SYSTEMS	We discuss continuous traffic flow network models including traffic lights. A mathematical model for traffic light settings within a macroscopic continuous traffic flow network is presented, and theoretical properties are investigated. The switching of the traffic light states is modeled as a discrete decision and is subject to optimization. A numerical approach for the optimization of switching points as a function of time based upon the macroscopic traffic flow model is proposed. The numerical discussion relies on an equivalent reformulation of the original problem as well as a mixed-integer discretization of the flow dynamics. The large-scale optimization problem is solved using derived heuristics within the optimization process. Numerical experiments are presented for a single intersection as well as for a road network.

The slope effect is reflected in both the maximal velocity and the relative current. The stability condition of the model is derived by applying the linear stability method. By using the nonlinear analysis method, we obtain the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation near the neutral stability line and the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation near the critical point. The analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the stability of traffic flow is enhanced on the uphill but is weakened on the downhill when the slope angle increases.

J	Huisingh, C; Griffin, R; Mcgwin, G				Huisingh, Carrie; Griffin, Russell; Mcgwin, Gerald, Jr.			The Prevalence of Distraction Among Passenger Vehicle Drivers: A Roadside Observational Approach	TRAFFIC INJURY PREVENTION			English	Article						driver; distraction; safety; prevalence; observational; epidemiology	PHONE; RISK	Objective: Distracted driving contributes to a large proportion of motor vehicle crashes, yet little is known about the prevalence of distracted driving and the specific types of distracting behaviors. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of driver distraction using a roadside observational study design. Methods: A cross-sectional survey involving direct roadside observation was conducted at 11 selected intersections. Trained investigators observed a sample of passenger vehicles and recorded distraction-related behaviors, driver characteristics, and contextual factors such as vehicle speed and traffic flow. Results: Of the 3,265 drivers observed, the prevalence of distracted driving was 32.7%. Among those involved in a distracting activity, the most frequently observed distractions included interacting with another passenger (53.2%, where passengers were present), talking on the phone (31.4%), external-vehicle distractions (20.4%), and texting/dialing a phone (16.6%). The prevalence of talking on the phone was higher among females than males (38.6% vs. 24.3%), whereas external vehicle distractions were higher among males than females (25.8% vs. 24.3%). Drivers <30years were observed being engaged in any distracting activity, interacting with other passengers, and texting/dialing more frequently than drivers aged 30-50 and >50years. Drivers were engaged in distracting behaviors more frequently when the car was stopped. Conclusions: When using similar methodology, roadside observational studies generate comparable prevalence estimates of driver distraction as naturalistic driving studies. Driver distraction is a common problem among passenger vehicle drivers. Despite the increased awareness on the dangers of texting and cell phone use while driving, these specific activities were 2 of the most frequently observed distractions. There is a continued need for road safety education about the dangers of distracted driving, especially for younger drivers.

For efficiently regulating the traffic flows and mitigating the traffic congestion in cities, a network-wide control strategy should be implemented. Control of large-scale traffic networks is often infeasible by only using a single controller, that is, in a centralised way, because of the high dimension, complicated dynamics and uncertainties of the system. In this study, the authors propose a multi-agent control approach using a congestion-degree-based serial scheme. Each agent employs a model-based predictive control approach and communicates with its neighbours. The congestion-degree-based serial scheme helps the agents to reach an agreement on their decisions regarding traffic control actions as soon as possible. A simulation study is carried out on a hypothetical large-scale urban traffic network based on the presented control strategy. The results illustrate that this approach has a better performance with regard to computation time compared with the centralised control method and a faster convergence speed compared with the classical parallel scheme.

En-Route Vehicular Traffic Optimization	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						IoT; IP; POC; Central Node; Dynamic Board; Accident detection model		The pathways of information are changing, the physical world itself is becoming a type of information system. In what's called the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors and actuators embedded in physical objects-from roadways to pacemakers-are linked through wired and wireless networks, often using the same Internet Protocol (IP) that connects the Internet. When objects can both sense the environment and communicate, they become tools for understanding complexity and responding to it swiftly. The revolutionary part in all this is that these physical information systems are now beginning to be deployed, and some of them even work largely without human intervention. This paper has addressed the traffic congestion problem with the help of Internet of Things. Increase in the number of vehicles in cities caused by the population and development of economy, has stimulated traffic congestion problems. It is becoming more serious day after day in the present scenario of developing countries. The reason for the same could be categorized as mismanagement of vehicular movement, ineffective system for controlling the mobility of vehicles, uneven roads and traffic snarl-up. Unexpected vehicular queuing is a major concern leading to wasting time of passengers and thwarting ambulance to reach the destination in time. In addition to that, traffic congestion makes it difficult to forecast the travel time accurately causing drivers to allocate more time in travel than scheduled previously. To ease these mounting traffic problems a demonstration is made on the Proof of Concept (POC) using the smart city data set provided by Telecom Italia of Milan city, to verify that these concepts have the potential for real world application and could be used by the government sectors or private transport organizations to ameliorate the passenger's comfort on road which are as follows. A central node is developed which sets the speed limit and predicts a normalized speed separately for each locality from the available data set. For efficient control in mobility of vehicles an advanced dynamic digital board is introduced, which displays the speed limit set by the central node time to time. The normalized speed could be used to estimate the effective time taken between destinations precisely. By comparing normalized speed with real time values anomalies in the locality like congestion and presence of uneven roads is predicted. Accident detection model is integrated with the central node which sends a message to dynamic board indicating location of the accident along with the time taken. It even improves traffic flow around the accident occurred location. Central node together with navigation tools could provide rerouted path to the drivers during congestion or accident.

Compared with real-time information, prediction traffic information obtained by a reliable and effective prediction algorithmhas many undisputable advantages. In prediction information environment, a traveler is prone to making amore rational route-choice. For these considerations, a mean velocity prediction information feedback strategy (MVPFS) is presented. The approach adopts the autoregressive-integrated moving average model (ARIMA) to forecast short-term traffic flow. Furthermore, prediction results ofmean velocity are taken as feedback contents and displayed on a variable message sign to guide travelers' route-choice. Meanwhile, discrete choice model (Logit model) is selected to imitate more appropriately travelers' route-choice behavior. In order to investigate the performance of MVPFS, a cellular automaton model with ARIMA is adopted to simulate a two-route scenario. The simulation shows that such innovative prediction feedback strategy is feasible and efficient. Even more importantly, this study demonstrates the excellence of prediction feedback ideology.

The traffic flow is also generally devoid of lane discipline, with vehicles occupying any available road space ahead. In such a regime of traffic flow, the phenomena of merging of vehicles at intersections of two roads is complex, warranting further study. The merging maneuvers at T-intersections under congested traffic conditions were studied microscopically through video-recording. In congested situations, the merging vehicle attempts a complex merging maneuver to enter the main traffic stream. Two unique merging processes are commonly observed in mixed traffic: group and vehicle cover merging (these are generally not observed in countries such as US). The author is using these words first time in this study. These reflect the different types of driver behavior - merging in groups, and by taking cover of another vehicle. Probabilistic models for group and vehicle cover merging are developed that capture this unique merging behavior. Comprehensive microscopic data collection and extraction were carried out to study the merging process at T-intersection under congested conditions. Merging models were then estimated using maximum likelihood method with disaggregate data that was collected for a case study T-intersection in Chennai city, India. Such models can find applications in simulation of highly congested traffic flow in a realistic manner under mixed traffic conditions. They can also give insights on devising better traffic control measures at such intersections. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A three-dimensional nonlinear fully-coupled analytical model is developed in this study to improve the dynamic performance prediction of long cable-stayed bridges under combined traffic and wind loads. The modified spectral representation method is introduced to simulate the fluctuating wind field of all the components of the whole bridge simultaneously with high accuracy and efficiency. Then, the aerostatic and aerodynamic wind forces acting on the whole bridge including the bridge deck, pylon, cables and even piers are all derived. The cellular automation method is applied to simulate the stochastic traffic flow which can reflect the real traffic properties on the long span bridge such as lane changing, acceleration, or deceleration. The dynamic interaction between vehicles and the bridge depends on both the geometrical and mechanical relationships between the wheels of vehicles and the contact points on the bridge deck. Nonlinear properties such as geometric nonlinearity and aerodynamic nonlinearity are fully considered. The equations of motion of the coupled wind-traffic-bridge system are derived and solved with a nonlinear separate iteration method which can considerably improve the calculation efficiency. A long cable-stayed bridge, Sutong Bridge across the Yangze River in China, is selected as a numerical example to demonstrate the dynamic interaction of the coupled system. The influences of the whole bridge wind field as well as the geometric and aerodynamic nonlinearities on the responses of the wind-traffic-bridge system are discussed.

J	Kemel, E				Kemel, Emmanuel			Wrong-way driving crashes on French divided roads	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Wrong-way driving; Logistic regression; Elderly driver; Drunk driving	PERFORMANCE; ALCOHOL; SIMULATOR; INJURY; RISK; ACCIDENTS; SIGNS; BELT	Context: The objective of divided roads is to increase users' safety by posting unidirectional traffic flows. It happens however that drivers proceed in the wrong direction, endangering themselves as well as other users. The crashes caused by wrong-way drivers are generally spotlighted by the media and call for public intervention. Objectives: This paper proposes a characterization of wrong-way driving crashes occurring on French divided road on the 2008-2012 period. The objective is to identify the factors that delineate between wrong-way driving crashes and other crashes. Method: Building on the national injury road crash database, 266 crashes involving a wrong-way driver were identified. Their characteristics (related to timing, location, vehicle and driver) are compared to those of the 22,120 other crashes that occurred on the same roads over the same period. The comparison relies on descriptive statistics, completed by a logistic regression. Results: Wrong-way driving crashes are rare but severe. They are more likely to occur during night hours and on non-freeway roads than other crashes. Wrong-way drivers are older, more likely to be intoxicated, to be locals, to drive older vehicles, mainly passenger cars without passengers, than other drivers. Perspectives: The differences observed across networks can help prioritizing public intervention. Most of the identified WW-driving factors deal with cognitive impairment. Therefore, the specific countermeasures such as alternative road signs should be designed for and tested on cognitively impaired drivers. Nevertheless, WW-driving factors are also risk factors for other types of crashes (e.g. elderly driving, drunk driving and age of the vehicle). This suggests that, instead of (or in addition to) developing WW-driving specific countermeasures, managing these risk factors would help reducing a larger number of crashes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Pahukula, J; Hernandez, S; Unnikrishnan, A				Pahukula, Jasmine; Hernandez, Salvador; Unnikrishnan, Avinash			A time of day analysis of crashes involving large trucks in urban areas	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Truck accidents; Injury severity; Mixed logit; Time-of-day; Interstate; Freight	INJURY SEVERITIES; SINGLE-VEHICLE; MODELS; ACCIDENTS	Previous studies have looked at different factors that contribute to large truck-involved crashes, however a detailed analysis considering the specific effects of time of day is lacking. Using the Crash Records Information System (CRIS) database in Texas, large truck-involved crashes occurring on urban freeways between 2006 and 2010 were separated into five time periods (i.e., early morning, morning, mid-day, afternoon and evening). A series of log likelihood ratio tests were conducted to validate that five separate random parameters logit models by time of day were warranted. The outcomes of each time of day model show major differences in both the combination of variables included in each model and the magnitude of impact of those variables. These differences show that the different time periods do in fact have different contributing factors to each injury severity further highlighting the importance of examining crashes based on time of day. Traffic flow, light conditions, surface conditions, time of year and percentage of trucks on the road were found as key differences between the time periods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Short-term associations between traffic-related noise, particle number and traffic flow in three European cities	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Air pollution; Spatiotemporal variation; Traffic; Traffic noise; Ultrafine particles	AIR-POLLUTION; EXPOSURE; OUTDOOR; MODELS	Outdoor noise and particulate matter concentration share common sources, including road traffic in urban areas, raising the potential for mutual confounding in epidemiological studies of their health effects. While some studies evaluated their long-term correlation, little is known about their short-term correlation. Our aim was to study the correlation of short-term noise, ultrafine (<0.1 mu m) particulate matter number concentration (UFP), and traffic flow in urban areas. A secondary aim was to document the temporal variability of these short-term measurements. We simultaneously measured traffic noise levels, UFP concentrations as well as motor vehicles' flows for 20 min in 141 locations, on one to three occasions, in three middle size European cities (Basel, Girona, Grenoble). The reproducibility of the short-term noise measurements and traffic counts over time was high, as reported by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), which quantified the agreement between repeated measurements (ICC = 0.86-0.97, according to city, for noise and ICC = 0.93-0.94 for traffic counts); this was not the case for UFP number concentrations (ICC = -0.11 to 0.14). The Pearson correlations of simultaneous 20-min measurements of UFP number concentrations and noise levels were in the 0.43-0.55 range, depending on the city; correlations between noise levels and vehicle counts varied from 0.54 to 0.72; and correlations between UFP concentrations and vehicle counts were lower (r = 0.15-0.37 depending on the city). Measurements during as little time as 20 min of outdoor noise and traffic, but not of UFP, were strongly reproducible over durations of a couple of days or months in middle-size European cities. In these areas, on the short-term, noise levels and UFP concentrations exhibited relatively moderate correlations, which may allow adjustment for mutual confounding in epidemiological studies, thus allowing to disentangle their possible short-term health effects.

J	Abdi, J; Moshiri, B				Abdi, Javad; Moshiri, Behzad			Application of temporal difference learning rules in short-term traffic flow prediction	EXPERT SYSTEMS			English	Article						artificial neural networks; back-propagation algorithm; forecasting; temporal difference learning; traffic flows	NEURAL-NETWORKS; TIME-SERIES; VOLUME; MODEL; PERFORMANCE	Studying dynamic behaviours of a transportation system requires the use of the system mathematical models as well as prediction of traffic flow in the system. Therefore, traffic flow prediction plays an important role in today's intelligent transportation systems. This article introduces a new approach to short-term daily traffic flow prediction based on artificial neural networks. Among the family of neural networks, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF) neural network and wavenets have been selected as the three best candidates for performing traffic flow prediction. Moreover, back-propagation (BP) has been adapted as the most efficient learning scheme in all the cases. It is shown that the coefficients produced by temporal signals improve the performance of the BP learning (BPL) algorithm. Temporal signals provide researchers with a new model of temporal difference BP learning algorithm (TDBPL). The capability and performance of TDBPL algorithm are examined by means of simulation in order to prove that the wavelet theory, with its multi-resolution ability in comparison to RBF neural networks, is a suitable algorithm in traffic flow forecasting. It is also concluded that despite MLP applications, RBF neural networks do not provide negative forecasts. In addition, the local minimum problems are inevitable in MLP algorithms, while RBF neural networks and wavenet networks do not encounter them.

J	Du, LL; Dao, H				Du, Lili; Dao, Hoang			Information Dissemination Delay in Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication Networks in a Traffic Stream	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Dynamic traffic flow; time delay; vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication	AD HOC NETWORKS; HEADWAY DISTRIBUTION; WIRELESS NETWORKS; ANALYTICAL-MODEL; PROPAGATION; CONNECTIVITY; CAPACITY	Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication networks, as one of the core components of connected vehicle systems, have been granted many promising applications to address traffic mobility, safety, and sustainability. However, only a limited amount of work has been completed to understand the fundamental properties of information propagation in such systems, while comprehensively considering traffic and communication reality. Motivated by this view, this proposed research develops analytical formulations to estimate information propagation time delay via a V2V communication network formed on a one-way or two-way road segment with multiple lanes. Distinguished to previous efforts, the proposed study carefully involves several critical communication and traffic flow features in reality, such as wireless communication interference, intermittent information transmission, and dynamic traffic flow. Moreover, this study elaborately analyzes the interactions between information and traffic flow under sparse and congested traffic flow conditions. The numerical experiments based on Next-Generation Simulation field data illustrate that the proposed analytical formulations are able to provide very good estimation, with the relative error less than 5%, for the information propagation time delay on a one-way or two-way road segment under various traffic conditions. The proposed work can be further extended to characterize information propagation time delay and coverage over local transportation networks.

J	Hamdar, SH; Talebpour, A; Dong, J				Hamdar, Samer H.; Talebpour, Alireza; Dong, Jing			Travel Time Reliability Versus Safety: A Stochastic Hazard-Based Modeling Approach	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Car following; hazard functions; lane changing; Monte Carlo simulation; prospect theory; safety; travel time reliability	TRAFFIC FLOW; VARIABILITY; DYNAMICS; RISK	This paper presents a modeling approach to linking stochastic acceleration and lane-changing behavior to travel time reliability on congested freeways. Individual driving behavior is represented by a prospect-theory-based model that takes into account uncertainty and risk evaluation in terms of gains and losses while following a lead vehicle. Given a set of stimuli (i.e., headways, relative speeds, etc.), the stochastic acceleration model generates acceleration probability distribution functions rather than deterministic acceleration values. Such distribution functions may be associated with travel time reliability through the construction of travel time distributions. In addition, lane-changing decision is represented by a stochastic hazard-based duration model that accounts for the surrounding traffic conditions (i.e., traffic density, distance to ramp, etc.). Numerical results from Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed microscopic stochastic modeling approach produces realistic macroscopic traffic flow patterns and can be used to generate travel time distributions. With proper experimental setup and sensitivity analysis, travel time distributions may be estimated and linked to safety-based parameters.

Previous studies in a macroscopic simulator have shown optimal and feedback MTFC potential to improve traffic conditions. In this paper, local feedback MTFC is applied in microscopic simulation for an on-ramp merge bottleneck. Traffic behavior reveals important aspects that had not been previously captured in macroscopic simulation. Mainly, the more realistic VSL application at specific points instead of along an entire freeway section produces a slower traffic response to speed limit changes. In addition, the nonlinear capacity flow/speed limit relation observed in the microscopic model is more pronounced than what was observed at the macroscopic level. After appropriate modifications in the control law, significant improvements in traffic conditions are obtained.

We derive the stability condition and the mKdV equation near the critical point by the linear and nonlinear analysis, respectively. The results of the theoretical analysis manifest that the stable region is enlarged and traffic congestion is suppressed. Also, energy consumption and traffic emission are analyzed and are reduced by multiple density difference effect. The reason is that with considering more vehicles, more comprehensive information could be obtained for drivers to increase speed. This will be helpful to enhance the stability and reduce energy consumption as well as traffic emission. Numerical simulations validate theoretical analysis. We also discover that multiple density difference effect of three sites ahead is enough to improve traffic flow.

J	Jin, WL				Jin, Wen-Long			Analysis of Kinematic Waves Arising in Diverging Traffic Flow Models	TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						kinematic wave models; cell transmission model; diverging traffic; Riemann problem; demand-supply space; stationary states; interior states; flux functions; evacuation strategies	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; FREEWAY; GODUNOV; SCHEMES; NETWORK; RAMP	Diverging junctions are important network bottlenecks, and a better understanding of diverging traffic dynamics has both theoretical and practical implications. In this paper, we present a new framework for constructing kinematic wave solutions to the Riemann problem of kinematic wave models of diverging traffic with jump initial conditions. Within this framework, the function space of weak solutions is enlarged to include interior states that occur with stationary discontinuities, and various discrete flux functions in cell transmission models of diverging traffic are used as entropy conditions to pick out unique physical solutions. Then in demand-supply space, we prove that the Riemann problem can be uniquely solved for existing discrete flux functions, in the sense that stationary states and, therefore, shock or rarefaction waves on all links, can be uniquely determined under given initial conditions. We show that the two diverge models by Lebacque and Daganzo are asymptotically equivalent. We also prove that the supply proportional and priority-based diverge models are locally optimal evacuation strategies. With numerical examples, we demonstrate the validity of the analytical solutions of interior states, stationary states, and corresponding kinematic waves. This study presents a unified framework for analyzing traffic dynamics arising at diverging junctions and could be helpful for developing emergency evacuation strategies.

To prove the concept, the Saudi-Bahrain corridor through King Fahd causeway is selected as our area of study. These two countries have strong cultural ties and a wide variety of variables affects the incoming and outgoing traffic flows. Various models of artificial neural networks are constructed for different prediction horizons and look-back periods using a dataset prepared for the period from 2003 till 2013. In our study, stock market indices are proposed, for the first time, to be used in border traffic forecasting. These indices are added as a surrogate measure of the political and economic conditions of the countries which are under study. Their effects on models with varying ranges of time-series inputs and different prediction horizons are studied in detail. It is found that including stock market indices and other most relevant local factors has generally improved the prediction performance of the neural network models in all cases. Additional reduction in the prediction error is achieved by the proposed ensemble model trained with different time lags. Yet, the degree of improvement depends on the look-ahead horizon for prediction.

Land subsidence caused by urbanization is an increasingly significant problem in Beijing, China; therefore, it is important to investigate the relationship between urbanization and land subsidence. Landsat TM images covering the Beijing plain were used to acquire spatial changes information of built-up areas by calculating an index-based built-up index (IBI). We used ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar data acquired from 2003 to 2009 and persistent scatterers for SAR interferometry (PSI) technology to estimate land subsidence. Geographic information systems spatial analysis method was used to identify the relationship between the settlement rate and the IBI value for three different sampling units. The result showed that it was a positive correlation between construction density and land subsidence; for land subsidence, the effect from the combination of high-density building clusters and extensive transportation networks was more significant than the presence of buildings alone. However, there may be a delay between the completion of building construction and the development of land subsidence.

In the traffic situation, drivers brake according to taillights of the forward vehicle. The first crash may induce more collisions. We investigate whether or not the first collision induces the chain-reaction crash, numerically and analytically. The dynamic transitions occur from no collisions through a single collision, double collisions and triple collisions, to multiple collisions with decreasing the headway. Also, we find that the dynamic transition occurs from the finite chain reaction to the infinite chain reaction when the headway is less than the critical value.

Parallel updates rules are employed for both roads. At the crossing point, in order to avoid colliding, the consideration of yield dynamics may be suitable herein. Different from previous studies, the deterministic Nagel and Schreckenberg model is adopted in this work. Based on theoretical analysis and computer simulations, the phase diagrams of traffic flow have been presented and the flow formulas in all regions have been derived in the phase diagram. The results of theoretical analysis are in good agreement with computer simulation ones. One finds an interesting phenomenon: there exist bistable states in some regions of the phase diagrams.

We analyze the stability against a small perturbation by use of the linear stability method for the proposed traffic flow model on a single lane under open boundary condition, with the finding that the traffic flow stability can be improved by increasing the proportion of the direct power cooperation of the preceding vehicle. The participation of forward power cooperation can help to stabilize the traffic flow and suppress the traffic jams. In addition, the simulations under open boundary single lane are conducted to validate the correctness on theoretical deduction, which shows that numerical results in large-wave and short-wave stability are in good agreement with those of theoretical analysis.

It is very important for the research of traffic flow theory, to study on drivers' information processing pattern in mixed traffic environment. In this paper, bicycle is regarded as a kind of information source to vehicle drivers; the "conflict point method" is brought forward to analyze the influence of bicycles on driving behavior. The "conflict" is studied to be translated into a special kind of car-following or lane-changing process. Furthermore, the computer clocked scan step length is dropped to 0.1 s, in order to scan and analyze the dynamic (static) information which influences driving behavior in a more exact way. The driver's decision-making process is described through information fusion based on duality contrast and fuzzy optimization theory. The model test and verification show that the simulation results with the "conflict point method" and the field data are consistent basically. It is feasible to imitate driving behavior and the driver information fusion process with the proposed methods. Decision-making optimized process can be described more accurately through computer precision clocked scan strategy. The study in this paper can provide the foundation for further research of multiresource information fusion process of driving behavior.

To characterize noise in the evaluated road stretches, 232 measurements were taken at different points. The Predictor software package was used for the noise mapping calculations. Noise sensitive areas, e.g., hospitals, were identified in the evaluated road stretches. Noise maps were calculated for two hospitals, showing the current levels of noise that reach their facades. Hypothetical scenarios were simulated by making changes in the composition of traffic and total number of vehicles, and an assessment was made of the potential influence of these modifications in reducing the noise levels reaching the facades of the buildings in question. The simulations indicated that a 50% reduction in total traffic flow, or a 50% reduction in heavy vehicle traffic flow, would reduce the noise levels by about 3 dB(A). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

J	Higgs, B; Abbas, M				Higgs, Bryan; Abbas, Montasir			Segmentation and Clustering of Car-Following Behavior: Recognition of Driving Patterns	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Clustering methods; data mining; driver behavior; traffic flow theory		Driving behavior can be influenced by many factors that are not feasible to collect in driving behavior studies. The research presented in this paper investigates the characteristics of a wide range of driving behaviors linking driving states to the drivers' actions. The proposed methodology is structured such that a known state can be linked to multiple actions, thus accounting for the effects of unknown driving state factors. A two-step algorithm was developed and used for the segmentation and clustering of driving behaviors. The algorithm segments and clusters car-following behaviors based on eight state-action variables: the longitudinal acceleration, the lateral acceleration, the yaw rate, the vehicle speed, the lane offset, the yaw angle, the range, and the range rate. The results of this methodology are state-action clusters that define the driving pattern of drivers. The sample used in this paper included 20 different drivers, i.e., ten car and ten truck drivers. The results revealed that behavior patterns were different between car drivers but not between truck drivers. The results also show that car drivers exhibit behaviors that are unique to each driver, whereas truck drivers show a common driving pattern. The characteristics and frequency of recognized driving patterns are provided in this paper, along with the corresponding modeling parameters of each pattern.

J	Meng, M; Shao, CF; Wong, YD; Wang, BB; Li, HX				Meng Meng; Shao Chun-fu; Wong Yiik-diew; Wang Bo-bin; Li Hui-xuan			A two-stage short-term traffic flow prediction method based on AVL and AKNN techniques	JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY			English	Article						engineering of communication and transportation system; short-term traffic flow prediction; advanced k-nearest neighbor method; pattern recognition; balanced binary tree technique	TRAVEL-TIME PREDICTION; SPACE NEURAL-NETWORKS; MODEL	Short-term traffic flow prediction is one of the essential issues in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). A new two-stage traffic flow prediction method named AKNN-AVL method is presented, which combines an advanced k-nearest neighbor (AKNN) method and balanced binary tree (AVL) data structure to improve the prediction accuracy. The AKNN method uses pattern recognition two times in the searching process, which considers the previous sequences of traffic flow to forecast the future traffic state. Clustering method and balanced binary tree technique are introduced to build case database to reduce the searching time. To illustrate the effects of these developments, the accuracies performance of AKNN-AVL method, k-nearest neighbor (KNN) method and the auto-regressive and moving average (ARMA) method are compared. These methods are calibrated and evaluated by the real-time data from a freeway traffic detector near North 3rd Ring Road in Beijing under both normal and incident traffic conditions. The comparisons show that the AKNN-AVL method with the optimal neighbor and pattern size outperforms both KNN method and ARMA method under both normal and incident traffic conditions. In addition, the combinations of clustering method and balanced binary tree technique to the prediction method can increase the searching speed and respond rapidly to case database fluctuations.

J	Moon, YS				Moon, Yun Seob			Estimation of Chemical Speciation and Temporal Allocation Factor of VOC and PM2.5 for the Weather-Air Quality Modeling in the Seoul Metropolitan Area	JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN EARTH SCIENCE SOCIETY			Korean	Article						source profile; chemical speciation; temporal allocation factor; stack telemetry system; hourly traffic flows		The purpose of this study is to assign emission source profiles of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulate matters (PMs) for chemical speciation, and to correct the temporal allocation factor and the chemical speciation of source profiles according to the source classification code within the sparse matrix operator kernel emission system (SMOKE) in the Seoul metropolitan area. The chemical speciation from the source profiles of VOCs such as gasoline, diesel vapor, coating, dry cleaning and LPG include 12 and 34 species for the carbon bond IV (CBIV) chemical mechanism and the statewide air pollution research center 99 (SAPRC99) chemical mechanism, respectively. Also, the chemical speciation of PM2.5 such as soil, road dust, gasoline and diesel vehicles, industrial source, municipal incinerator, coal fired, power plant, biomass burning and marine was allocated to 5 species of fine PM, organic carbon, elementary carbon, NO3-, and SO42-. In addition, temporal profiles for point and line sources were obtained by using the stack telemetry system (TMS) and hourly traffic flows in the Seoul metropolitan area for 2007. In particular, the temporal allocation factor for the ozone modeling at point sources was estimated based on NOX emission inventories of the stack TMS data.

We measured the variation of total travel time triangle T when a road segment is closed, and found that vertical bar triangle T vertical bar follows a power-law distribution if triangle T < 0 or triangle T > 0. This implies that most roads have a negligible effect on the efficiency of the road network, while the failure of a few crucial links would result in severe travel delays, and closure of a few inefficient links would counter-intuitively reduce travel costs considerably. Generating three theoretical networks, we discovered that the heterogeneously distributed travel demand may be the origin of the observed power-law distributions of vertical bar triangle T vertical bar. Finally, a genetic algorithm was used to pinpoint inefficient link clusters in the road network. We found that closing specific road clusters would further improve the transportation efficiency.

The piezoelectricity of the cement-based piezoelectric sensors enables powerful and accurate real-time detection of the pressure induced by the traffic flow. To describe the mechanical-electrical conversion mechanism between traffic flow and the electrical output of the embedded piezoelectric sensors, a mathematical model is established based on Duhamel's integral, the constitutive law and the charge-leakage characteristics of the piezoelectric composite. Laboratory tests show that the voltage magnitude of the sensor is linearly proportional to the applied pressure, which ensures the reliability of the cement-based piezoelectric sensors for traffic monitoring. A series of on-site road tests by a 10 tonne truck and a 6.8 tonne van show that vehicle weight-in-motion can be predicted based on the mechanicalelectrical model by taking into account the vehicle speed and the charge-leakage property of the piezoelectric sensor. In the speed range from 20 km h(-1) to 70 km h(-1), the error of the repeated weigh-in-motion measurements of the 6.8 tonne van is less than 1 tonne. The results indicate that the embedded cement-based piezoelectric sensors and associated measurement setup have good capability of smart traffic monitoring, such as traffic flow detection, vehicle speed detection and weigh-in-motion measurement.

Hence, this study focuses on understanding the nature of traffic flow on a very busy eight-lane divided urban freeway namely the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway. To this end, we first present the statistics such as vehicle-class mix and lane utilization on the selected section of expressway and move on to fit time-gap models for the flow values of 7189 and 9114 vehicles h(-1) (vph) in one direction of traffic flow on the expressway. A k-sample A-D test was conducted to assess the goodness of fit of the time-gap models. It was found from the study that the combination of Weibull and Extreme Value mixture distribution gives the best fit for modeling time gaps at observed flow levels of 7189 and 9114 vph with 5 and 1% level of significance, respectively.

The relationship between the flow rate and the traffic density is obtained by the numerical simulation, and it shows a two-dimensional region in the flow density plane. The three traffic phases, i.e., free flow, synchronized flow, and wide moving jams, are exhibited. It indicates that the synchronized flow and traffic jams can appear even if there is no traffic bottleneck. Besides, the high speed car-following phenomenon is indicated when the traffic is in the synchronized flow. The rate of the high speed car-following is in good agreement with the measured result.

Using the model, we study the influences of mixed ratio, the idling energy consumption of vehicle, vehicle peak velocity, dwell time and random deceleration probability on energy consumption of Electronic Toll Collection or Manual Toll Collection mixed traffic flow on single lane under periodic condition. Simulating results indicate that the above five parameters are all increasing functions of total energy consumption, in which the idling energy consumption represents the major amounts with the increase of mixed ratio and occupancy rate.

J	Huang, ML				Huang, Min-Liang			Intersection traffic flow forecasting based on v-GSVR with a new hybrid evolutionary algorithm	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Short-term traffic flow forecasting; Support vector machine; Gaussian loss function; Genetic algorithm; Chaos map; Cloud model	GENETIC ALGORITHMS	To deal well with the normally distributed random error existed in the traffic flow series, this paper introduces the v-Support Vector Regression (v-GSVR) model with the Gaussian loss function to the prediction field of short-term traffic flow. A new hybrid evolutionary algorithm (namely CCGA) is established to search the appropriate parameters of the v-GSVR, coupling the Chaos map, Cloud model and genetic algorithm. Consequently, a new forecasting approach for short-term traffic flow, combining v-GSVR model and CCGA algorithm, is proposed. The forecasting process considers the traffic flow for the road during the first few time intervals, the traffic flow for the upstream road section and weather conditions. A numerical example from the intersection between Culture Road and Shi-Full Road in Banqiao is used to verify the forecasting performance of the proposed model. The experiment indicates that the model yield more accurate results than the compared models in forecasting the short-term traffic flow at the intersection. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Luo, Y; Turgut, D; Boloni, L				Luo, Yi; Turgut, Damla; Boeloeni, Ladislau			Modeling the Strategic Behavior of Drivers for Multi-Lane Highway Driving	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Workshop on Agents in Traffic and Transportation	JUN 05, 2012	Valencia, SPAIN			Driver Behavior; Highway Simulation; Multi-Agent Simulation	ROUTE CHOICE; TRAVEL; SIMULATION; CARS	Current state-of-the-art highway traffic flow simulators rely extensively on models using formulas similar to those describing physical phenomena, such as forces, viscosity, or potential fields. These models have been carefully calibrated to represent the overall flow of traffic and they can also be extended to account for the cognitive limitations of the driver, such as reaction times. However, there are some aspects of driver behavior, such as strategic planning, that are difficult to formulate mathematically. In this article, we describe the YAES-DSIM highway simulator, which integrates virtual physics models with an agent-based model. The virtual physics component models the physical vehicle and the subconscious aspects of the driver behavior, while the agent component is responsible for the strategic and tactical decisions, which are difficult to model using virtual physics. We focus on the lane change decisions of the drivers, with special attention to the optimal lane positioning for a safe exit. We have used the model to simulate the flow of traffic on Highway 408 in Orlando, Florida, and to study the impact of various tactical and strategic decisions on the efficiency and safety of the traffic.

J	Aghabayk, K; Sarvi, M; Young, W				Aghabayk, Kayvan; Sarvi, Majid; Young, William			A State-of-the-Art Review of Car-Following Models with Particular Considerations of Heavy Vehicles	TRANSPORT REVIEWS			English	Article						traffic flow modelling; heterogeneous traffic; car-following models; driving behaviour; heavy vehicles	DYNAMICS; BEHAVIOR; DRIVER; TIME; SIMULATION	Car-following (CF) models are fundamental in the replication of traffic flow and thus they have received considerable attention. This attention needs to be reflected upon at particular points in time. CF models are in a continuous state of improvement due to their significant role in traffic micro-simulations, intelligent transportation systems and safety engineering models. This paper presents a review of existing CF models. It classifies them into classic and artificial intelligence models. It discusses the capability of the models and potential limitations that need to be considered in their improvement. This paper also reviews the studies investigating the impacts of heavy vehicles in traffic stream and on CF behaviour. The findings of the study provide promising directions for future research and suggest revisiting the existing models to accommodate different behaviours of drivers in heterogeneous traffic, in particular, heavy vehicles in traffic.

A Bayesian inference approach to the development of a multidirectional pedestrian stream model	TRANSPORTMETRICA A-TRANSPORT SCIENCE			English	Article						Bayesian inference; measurement; empirical studies; multidirectional flow; pedestrian	OBLIQUE INTERSECTING ANGLE; DYNAMIC CONTINUUM MODEL; HONG-KONG; FLOW; FACILITIES; BEHAVIOR; CROWDS	In this paper, we develop a mathematical model to represent the conflicting effects of multidirectional pedestrian flows in a large crowd. The model is formulated based on Drake's model of traffic flow. Rather than relate the speed of a pedestrian stream solely to the pedestrian density, we introduce the flow ratio and intersecting angle between streams as variables. To calibrate the model, data collection was conducted through the video recording of pedestrian movements on a pedestrian street in Mong Kok, Hong Kong. Bayesian inference was adopted to calibrate the parameters based on the information from a previous experiment. Finally, we study the relationships among the speed, density, flow and intersecting angles of the pedestrian streams and predict how these variables affect the pedestrian movements.

J	Lim, GJ; Rungta, M; Baharnemati, MR				Lim, Gino J.; Rungta, Mukesh; Baharnemati, M. Reza			Reliability analysis of evacuation routes under capacity uncertainty of road links	IIE TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						stochastic capacity; Dynamic network flow problem; emergency evacuation; reliability; chance-constrained programming	NETWORK; MODEL; ALGORITHMS; FLOWS	This article presents a reliability-based evacuation route planning model that seeks to find the relationship between the clearance time, number of evacuation paths, and congestion probability during an evacuation. Most of the existing models for network evacuation assume deterministic capacity estimates for road links without taking into account the uncertainty in capacities induced by myriad external conditions. Only a handful of models exist in the literature that account for capacity uncertainty of road links. A dynamic network-based evacuation model is extended by incorporating probabilistic arc capacity constraints and a minimum-cost network flow problem is formulated that finds a lower bound on the clearance time within the framework of a chance-constrained programming technique. Network breakdown minimization principles for traffic flow in evacuation planning problem are applied and a path-based evacuation routing and scheduling model is formulated. Given the horizon time for evacuation, the model selects the evacuation paths and finds flows on the selected paths that result in the minimum congestion in the network along with the reliability of the evacuation plan. Numerical examples are presented and the effectiveness of the stochastic models in evacuation planning is discussed. It is shown that the reliability-based evacuation plan is conservative compared with plans made using a deterministic model. Stochastic models guarantee that congestion can be avoided with a higher confidence level at the cost of an increased clearance time.

Methods: The crash, traffic, and geometric data were collected on the I-880N freeway in California in 2008 and 2009. This study considered 4 different traffic states in Wu's 4-phase traffic theory. They are free fluid traffic, bunched fluid traffic, bunched congested traffic, and standing congested traffic. Several different statistical methods were used to accomplish the research objective. Results: The preliminary analysis showed that traffic states significantly affected crash likelihood, collision type, and injury severity. Nonlinear canonical correlation analysis (NLCCA) was conducted to identify the underlying phenomena that made certain traffic states more hazardous than others. The results suggested that different traffic states were associated with various collision types and injury severities. The matching of traffic flow characteristics and crash characteristics in NLCCA revealed how traffic states affected traffic safety. The logistic regression analyses showed that the factors contributing to crash risks were quite different across various traffic states. To incorporate the varying crash mechanisms across different traffic states, random parameters logistic regression was used to develop a real-time crash risk model. Bayesian inference based on Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations was used for model estimation. The parameters of traffic flow variables in the model were allowed to vary across different traffic states. Compared with the standard logistic regression model, the proposed model significantly improved the goodness-of-fit and predictive performance. Conclusions: These results can promote a better understanding of the relationship between traffic flow characteristics and crash risks, which is valuable knowledge in the pursuit of improving traffic safety on freeways through the use of dynamic safety management systems.

Effect of the car-following combinations on the instability of heterogeneous traffic flow	TRANSPORTMETRICA B-TRANSPORT DYNAMICS			English	Article						car-following combinations; heterogeneous traffic flow; traffic instabilities; linear method	MODEL; STABILITY; DYNAMICS; TIME	Heterogeneous traffic flow contains the mixed operation of the different vehicle classes such as cars, trucks and buses. Previous study has indicated that the overall stability of the heterogeneous traffic flow is governed by a weighted mean of stability parameters corresponding to each vehicle class and is not affected by the order in which a vehicle class is put into the system, for example either car or truck. However, it has been recently reported that the effect of mixed composition on traffic flow dynamics is also determined by the car-following vehicle type, that is either car following a car or car following a truck. This paper aims at investigating analytically how different car-following combinations (i.e. the following type) influence the overall stability of heterogeneous traffic flow dynamics. More specifically, we will consider the four types of car-following behaviour such as car-car, car-truck, truck-car, and truck-truck. The effect of such car-following types on the overall linear stability condition of the heterogeneous traffic flow will be studied using a generalised multi-class car-following model in which the optimal speed function is not only dependent on the the space headway between two consecutive vehicles as in previous study of Mason and Woods [1997. "Car-following Model of Multispecies Systems of Road Traffic." Physical Review E: 2203-2214] but also on the and the relative speed between those two consecutive vehicles.
