These are human to human communication (H2H), machine to human communication (M2H) and machine to machine communication (M2M). H2H communication is based mostly on human gestures involving the hands, face, eyes or other body parts. M2M communication is a hybrid system that is installed in autonomous vehicles (AVs) and responds to human gestures. It is found in three forms: vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to everything (V2X). In this paper, V2I communication will be studied to improve the internet communication of autonomous vehicles in 50 environment. V2I communication used to manage the platooning of vehicles on urban roads, which is a strategy for increasing road capacity. The performance of V2I communication is measured in terms of QoS parameters such as delay and interference. The interference analysis of wireless communications becomes increasingly difficult as the environment becomes increasingly complex This paper proposes an analytical model that integrate pathloss and cochannel interference, which are considered the most important factors contributing to the performance degradation of V2I communication. A discussion of the challenges of V2I communication and their impact on urban road management is presented. Improvements in V2I communication are intended to overcome the shortcomings of human divers by improving traffic flow, reducing accidents, and reducing social exclusion.

The problem aims at designing a feasible network of automated truck dedicated lanes to minimize the impact on the overall network. We formulate a nonlinear programming model for the considered problem, and apply a novel reformulation skill (Second Order Cone Programming) to simplify the nonlinear model. The commercial Optimizer Solver of CPLEX is applied to solve the model. A small instance is conducted to verify the accuracy of the proposed model.

In this paper, we propose an encoder-decoder model with temporal attention mechanism for multi-step forward traffic flow prediction task, which uses LSTM as the encoder and decoder to learn the long dependencies features and nonlinear characteristics of multivariate traffic flow related time series data, and also introduces a temporal attention mechanism for more accurately traffic flow prediction. Through the real traffic flow dataset experiments, it has shown that the proposed model has better prediction ability than classic shallow learning and baseline deep learning models. And the predicted traffic flow value can be well matched with the ground truth value not only under short step forward prediction condition but also under longer step forward prediction condition, which validates that the proposed model is a good option for dealing with the realtime and forward-looking problems of traffic flow prediction task.

Proficient Signaling Systems are indispensable for reducing traffic congestion at intersections. This work tries to design a model according to constraint markov decision process for a given reinforcement learning problem statement which prediction of traffic congestion at the intersection and lanes in a busy roads. A Green Light Simulator is used to simulate real time data set of the Bangalore Roads and Traffic. After that several TLC algorithms are run and efficiency is computed manually. In the third step policy is build using parameters that contain features like acceleration, velocity, no of vehicles plying on the road. Based on these parameters, the policy generated helps to predict congestion at the busy roads. The dataset includes traffic data from Bangalore Roads.

This paper presents a tool chain, which enables the selection of relevant scenarios and evaluates their criticality for the ego vehicle. It combines traffic flow simulation in SUMO with vehicle dynamics simulation in CarMaker. The communication between these two software tools takes place via MATLAB, which identifies the relevant scenarios based on the vehicle parameters and the road network. Since SUMO uses a simplified vehicle model, which does not take into account the slip behaviour and the lateral dynamics, the vehicle dynamics in these situations is not described with sufficient precision. For this reason, a transformation to CarMaker is performed. Special attention has to be paid to the consistency of the road network. Therefore, the trajectories of the vehicles must be the same in both systems. With the ego vehicle, this is realized by generating the control signals at the accelerator, the brake pedal and the steering wheel by means of a MPC controller. The main steps of the tool chain are illustrated using an intersection scenario.

Existing traffic management solutions have proven to be largely ineffective in medium-size African cities. Wireless sensor networks have emerged as possible cost-effective solutions, especially in under-developed countries. In this paper, we present a solution for detection and quantification of traffic congestion at signaled isolated four-way junctions in order to optimize traffic flow. The research utilizes optical sensors to collect road parameters and fuzzy logic to quantify and then prioritize entry. Simulations are used to compare strategies employed by traffic signals; the interest being to observe which of the two traffic light management schemes is more effective. The two schemes compared in this paper implement fairly weighted round-robin and fuzzy algorithms.

Although Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) techniques can contribute to reduce this figure, many of the proposed ITS-related techniques have not yet been fully developed and/or deployed. This is especially the case of techniques that use the potential of the Internet. Thus, this paper proposes methods for retrieving and using data from heterogeneous sources currently available in the Internet, in order to provide information for both authorities and for the citizens, using machine learning (ML) tools. It is important to stress that such Internet data goes beyond the traditional ones (e.g., traffic sensors), as it also refers to sources such as: social networks (e.g., Twitter); meteorological bulletins; sports and cultural events; images of traffic flow; videos (webcams); intervehicular communication and mobility Internet. This involves text and image processing, thus making the overall task not trivial. Underlying this effort, we propose a framework in which ML techniques play a key role in several tasks, from image and text processing to prediction. Specifically, our applications deal with named entities extraction in tweets, classification of event, pothole detection, and classification of traffic state from images	[Bazzan, A. L.

In this paper, energy consumption is determined by studying all the trips occurring in the Chicago Metropolitan Area in a 24 hour period. The data is generated by combining Polaris, an agent based traffic flow model with SVTrip, a stochastic model that generates 1 Hz vehicle speed profiles and Autonomic, a detailed vehicle level modeling tool used to predict fuel consumption. Different scenarios are constructed to define trips for different timeframes and assumptions. Vehicle fleet distribution, vehicle technologies and automation levels are applied to represent an appropriate vehicle fleet for each scenario. Analysis of energy consumption is then discussed with a particular emphasis on the impact of powertrain technology and vehicle types.

This paper presents a novel hybrid algorithm for travel time estimation that leverages historical and sparse real-time trajectory data. Given a path and a departure time we estimate the travel time taking into account the historical information, the real-time trajectory data and the correlations among different road segments. We detect similar road segments using historical trajectories, and use a latent representation to model the similarities. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

However, it is challenging because traffic flows are affected by multiple complex factors, such as spatial and temporal dependencies of regions and external factors. In this paper, we propose a deep hybrid spatio-temporal dynamic neural network, called DHSTNet, to predict both inflows and outflows in every region of a city. More specifically, it consists of four main components, i.e.,, closeness influence taking the instantaneous variations of traffic flows, period influence regularly identifying daily changes of traffic crowd flows, weekly component identifying the patterns of weekly traffic flows and external component acquiring external factors. We design a branch of deep hybrid recurrent convolutional neural network units to model the first three temporal properties, i.e.,, closeness, period influence, and weekly influence. The external components are feed into two fully connected neural networks. For different branches, our proposed model assigns different weights and then combines the output of the four components. Experimental results based on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the existing state-of-the-art methods.

However, the use of EVs is still in its infancy with limited numbers of users worldwide. Public charging infrastructures can be one of the drivers to enhance the prevalence of EVs. In this paper, we aim to develop a framework to establish a reliable urban public charging infrastructure. We first determine the optimal locations and size of those stations by a robust optimization model incorporating uncertain traffic flows and existing power grid networks; and then we use a discrete event simulation approach to model more realistic charging demands. We further improve these optimal solutions and verify the EV charging infrastructure considering both power and transportation networks. We validate our models with real traffic and power grid data from a Southeast Chinese municipality.

CV applications can improve safety, efficiency, and capacity of transportation systems while reducing their environmental footprints. A large number of CV applications have been proposed towards these goals, with the US Department of Transportation (US DOT) recently initiating three deployment sites. Unfortunately, the security of these protocols has not been considered carefully, and due to the fact that they affect the control of vehicles, vulnerabilities can lead to breakdowns in safety (causing accidents), performance (causing congestion and reducing capacity), or fairness (vehicles cheating the intersection management system). In this paper, we perform a detailed analysis of a recently published CV-based application protocol, Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC), and use this analysis to classify the types of vulnerabilities that occur in the context of connected Cyber-physical systems such as CV. We show using simulations that these attacks can be extremely dangerous: we illustrate attacks that cause crashes or stall emergency vehicles. We also carry out a more systematic analysis of the impact of the attacks showing that even an individual attacker can have substantial effects on traffic flow and safety even in the presence of message security standard developed by US DOT. We believe that these attacks can be carried over to other CV applications if they are not carefully designed. The paper also explores a defense framework to mitigate these classes of vulnerabilities in CV applications.

The station is located in a medium size town in Poland (Kielce) situated at the national road to Cracow. The traffic flow was measured over the period between January and December 2013 for twenty four hours a day. Statistical analysis methods were used to determine the variability and uncertainty of the results. The measurements from two vehicular lanes running towards the town and two lanes running towards Cracow were analyzed. The variability of the results was described using parameters such as the coefficient of variation and positional variation. The results of vehicle traffic measurements were used to simulate changes in the noise measurand variation within 1-hour intervals. The Nordic Prediction Method was used for this purpose. It was found that in most cases, the distribution of the tested variable was not normal. Box plots were used to assess whether outliers data occurred in the recorded results. The variability of noise and type A uncertainty was evaluated.

Even after this improvement, right now it is only a fraction of what is being expected in the future. Vehicles in the future will be able to sense its environment and navigate the surroundings without any sort of human input. These vehicles are introduced as Connected and Autonomous Vehicles. These data can be used to develop different applications that can enhance the road safety, better manage the traffic flow and provide additional comfort services to the vehicle drivers. To do so, autonomous vehicles need to have accurate and real time localization estimation. Obviously, when talking about the vehicle position the Global positioning System (GPS) is the first possibility that comes to mind. However, the GPS system shows that it cannot keep the same evolution speed as the vehicles. This paper evaluates the state-of-the-art vehicle localization techniques and investigates their applicability on autonomous vehicles. Each of the localization techniques has cons and pros and cannot work alone.

To detect rain-drop tampered scenes, features are extracted via salient region detection and block segmentation. Feature selection is performed to select more discriminative features. For traffic flow estimation, daytime and night time models are performed separately to adapt to the characteristics of the surveillance scenes. Finally, an effective graph-based mapping method is designed to map the vehicle count sequences to per minute traffic flow. The system is tested with a highly challenging dataset. The accuracy of the traffic flow analysis is satisfying with low mean absolute errors even when the cameras are seriously tampered by rain.

Real-time analysis of traffic flow information is crucial for efficiently managing urban traffic. This paper aims to conduct traffic analysis using UAV-based videos and deep learning techniques. The road traffic video is collected by using a position-fixed UAV. The most recent deep learning methods are applied to identify the moving objects in videos. The relevant mobility metrics are calculated to conduct traffic analysis and measure the consequences of traffic congestion. The proposed approach is validated with the manual analysis results and the visualization results. The traffic analysis process is real-time in terms of the pretrained model used.

Integrating the management and design of urban road network to alleviate tide traffic	2019 IEEE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (ITSC)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (IEEE-ITSC)	OCT 27-30, 2019	Auckland, NEW ZEALAND	IEEE, Intel, Griffith Univ, Auckland Tourism Events & Econ Dev			OPTIMIZATION; EVACUATION; MODELS	During the morning and evening rush hour in big cities, roads present tide traffic feature, which not only worsens the traffic congestion but also wastes road resources. In this paper, we use the lane reversal to balance the asymmetric traffic flow distribution in the two directions of one road and lane addition to increase road supply. Moreover, we use the tradable credits scheme to manage the mobility. Thus, we integrate the lane reversal, lane addition and tradable credits scheme to alleviate the traffic congestion due to tide traffic, which is modeled into a mix-integer bilevel programming. In this model, the network authority decides the lane reversal scheme, lane addition scheme and credits charging scheme to minimize the total system travel time, while the travelers follow the user equilibrium (UE) to minimize their generalized travel cost. After proposing the algorithm for the model, the Sioux Falls network is adopted to illustrate the numerical experiments, which show that the integration of the management and design can obtain the better performance to alleviate tide traffic and traffic congestion.

Even polycentric cities experience converging traffic flows to a degree, albeit towards multiple centers. This concentration of travel eventuates in congested city centers when the maximum throughput of the road network is exceeded, resulting in inefficient networks affecting the economic productivity and overall quality of city life. To address this issue, policies can be developed to encourage more spatially effi'cient travel, such as walking, cycling, or transit, by charging for parking or creating a dedicated bicycle/pedestrian zone. This paper presents a continuous approximation model using the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) of network traffic flow to provide insights into the placement and pricing of parking, as well as the required perimeter roadway capacity for the pedestrianization of the city center. This model is then empirically applied to the case study of Melbourne, Australia; a highly monocentric rectilinear grid city with a partially pedestrianized city center.

Truck platooning on highways has been widely studied and showed the aforementioned effects. However, the platooning of buses in urban environments have not been investigated thoroughly in the literature. This paper examines the effects of bus platooning with respect to traffic control and energy consumption. Microscopic traffic simulations have been conducted to demonstrate that bus platooning improves the quality of service of buses and maintains the quality of the traffic flow. Subsequently, driving cycles of buses generated from the simulation study serve as input for an energy consumption analysis, showing that not only bus platooning itself result in a reduction of energy consumption but the traffic signal prioritisation for bus platooning lead to additional energy savings.

To support traffic operation and management, this study proposed a hybrid approach integrating Wiedemann car-following model and cellular automation (CA) to reconstruct the trajectories of fully-sampled traffic flow on freeways. First, Wiedemann car-following model is applied to classify the vehicle driving states into following and closing. Then, human-driven vehicles (HVs) are inserted between the leading and following AVs based on the vehicle's behavior within the following AV's detection range. Next, the trajectories of inserted HVs are reconstructed by resorting to CA with four update rules set to determine vehicles' acceleration, deceleration, randomization and position. Last, the proposed hybrid approach is performed under different traffic densities and AVs penetration rates. Results show that the proposed method for trajectory reconstruction performs satisfactorily on freeways even at low penetration rates of AVs.

In the context of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), this paper is concerned with the impacts of smart lane changes of CAVs on their own travel performance as well as on the entire traffic flow with the increase of the market penetration rate (MPR). On the basis of intensive microscopic traffic simulation and reinforcement learning technique, an egoefficient lane-changing strategy was first developed in this work to enable foresighted lane changing decisions for CAVs to improve their travel efficiency. The overall impacts of such smart lane changes on traffic flow of both CAVs and human-driven vehicles were then examined on the same simulation platform, which reflects a real freeway infrastructure with real demands. It was found that smart lane changes were beneficial for both CAVs and the entire traffic flow, if MPR was not more than 60%.

However, most of these models require the costly origin-destination (OD) data. In this paper, through the ideal flow network (IFN) and the maximum entropy principle, traffic flows can be estimated even with limited road network data. The macro level OD matrix is mathematically transformed into micro level OD on each intersection, which yields richer transportation structure data such as capacity and lane width. When data available is limited to only a few links or intersections, the remaining missing data can be set by computing for the stochastic matrix from the capacity ratio. Even if the capacity ratio is not available, the connectivity of the road network structure can be used to derive the stochastic matrix. With this characteristic of the IFN, even with limited and parsimonious data that can be collected from any link or intersection using a video camera, GPS, or any ITS sensing device, link flows of an entire network can be updated dynamically. Link flow results using IFN are almost the same as actual results, which is illustrated using the Sioux Falls transportation network.

The increasing amounts of generated traffic data have been used to train machine learning predictors for traffic, however this is a challenging task due to inter-dependencies of traffic flow both in time and space. Recently, deep learning techniques have shown significant prediction improvements over traditional models, however open questions remain around their applicability, accuracy and parameter tuning. This paper proposes an advanced deep learning framework for simultaneously predicting the traffic flow on a large number of monitoring stations along a highly circulated motorway in Sydney, Australia, including exit and entry loop count stations, and over varying training and prediction time horizons. The spatial and temporal features extracted from the 36.34 million data points are used in various deep learning architectures that exploit their spatial structure (convolutional neuronal networks), their temporal dynamics (recurrent neuronal networks), or both through a hybrid spatio-temporal modelling (CNN-LSTM). We show that our deep learning models consistently outperform traditional methods, and we conduct a comparative analysis of the optimal time horizon of historical data required to predict traffic flow at different time points in the future.

This paper addresses freeway ramp metering and mainstream traffic flow control (MTFC) at active bottlenecks, with an aim of avoiding capacity drop. A special attention was paid to the effects of capacity drop on the performance of control measures. Via mathematical analyses, it was first shown that the significance and usefulness of the control measures are justified by the presence of capacity drop in field. This was then verified via macroscopic simulation studies, with ramp metering, MTFC, and their integration formulated in a framework of coordinated and integrated optimal control. It was also demonstrated that an appropriate usage of the control measures can effectively prevent the activation of potential bottlenecks on freeways and hence avoid capacity drop there.

The introduction of connected automated vehicles (CAV) provides the opportunity to coordinate the vehicle movements during the lane-changing maneuver to deal with this issue. Accordingly, this paper proposes an approach to jointly optimize the lateral trajectory of a lane-changing CAV and the longitudinal control of an impacted CAV in the target lane. Towards this objective: i) we first design a model predictive controller (MPC) for the vehicle in the target lane to properly respond to a discretionary lane-changing maneuver; ii) we then specify a set of possible lateral trajectories that may be adopted by the lane-changing vehicle; iii) we then compute the required deceleration of the vehicle directly impacted by the lane-changing based on the estimated set of the lateral trajectories; iv) we finally choose the trajectory that minimizes the total deceleration effort (i.e., minimizes the disturbance in the platoon of vehicles). Analytical and simulation-based investigations are performed to assess the capability of the proposed approach in minimizing the acceleration disturbance and shockwave magnitude.

Recent advances in simulation methods are often based on simulation techniques where test scenarios are built considering stochastic traffic or deterministic predefined manoeuvres. To ensure realism, numerical robustness and usability of the test scenarios for both approaches, increasing effort must be invested in modelling the driving environment as well as vehicle and traffic dynamics. Especially traffic models are rarely realistically modelled in most current scenario generation and testing techniques. The goal of the present paper is to introduce a co-simulation framework for automated scenario generation with calibrated traffic flow models using measured data from an official test road in Austria and modelled in PTV Vissim. Combined with the Multi-Body-System vehicle development software IPG CarMaker, the presented co-simulation framework provides an approach for generation of realistic scenarios. This approach is demonstrated for a Highway Chauffeur function and allows future systematic testing.

In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning approach, called graph and attention-based long short-term memory network (GLA), to efficiently capture the spatial-temporal features in Traffic flow. Firstly, we apply graph convolutional network (GCN) to mine the spatial relationships of Traffic flow over multiple observation stations, in which the adjacent matrix is determined by a data-driven approach. Then, we feed the output of the GCN model to the long short-term memory (LSTM) model which extracts temporal features embedded in Traffic flow. Further, we implement a soft attention mechanism on the extracted spatial-temporal Traffic features to make final prediction. We test the proposed method over the PeMS data sets. Experimental results show that the proposed model performs better than the competing methods.

Usually, these traffic states are inferred from the bivariate relationship between traffic flow and density using a deterministic approach. However, due to traffic congestion and position of detection sites especially in urban networks, this relation is highly scattered making these methods not suitable to handle the associated uncertainty in the process. We propose a probabilistic model that allows the inclusion of prior knowledge on traffic states and part of their relative parametrization according to the expert user's judgment. The model is formulated in a Bayesian framework where we also introduce several constraints as per the fundamental diagram shape to solve the common problem of identifiability in this kind of generative models used to estimate latent variables. Derived probability distributions can be efficiently updated in real-time with new data observations. The model performance has been evaluated in three networks: M4 Western Motorway in Sydney, and urban city centers of Santander and Leicester. Results demonstrate the robustness of our approach to infer traffic states even with low data availability in some parts of the fundamental diagram.

A discrete first-order model which considers capacity drop of jam waves is extended in this study to incorporate impact of the novel VSL control. Based on the extended model, we cast an MPC scheme into a multi-layer control structure to develop a VSL control strategy in a connected vehicle environment. For the purposes of validation of the extended model and evaluation of the proposed control strategy, a set of microscopic simulation experiments are conducted on a hypothetical multi-lane freeway with temporary jam waves.

Research in this area has stimulated a vibrant activity, yielding a plethora of new forecasting methods contributed to the community on a yearly basis. Efforts in this domain are mainly oriented to the development of prediction models featuring with ever-growing levels of performances and/or computational efficiency. After the swerve towards Artificial Intelligence that gradually took place in the modeling sphere of traffic forecasting, predictive schemes have ever since adopted all the benefits of applied machine learning, but have also incurred some caveats. The adoption of highly complex, black-box models has subtracted comprehensibility to forecasts: even though they perform better, they are more obscure to ITS practitioners, which hinders their practicality. In this paper we propose the adoption of explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) tools that are currently being used in other domains, in order to extract further knowledge from black-box traffic forecasting models. In particular we showcase the utility of xAI to unveil the knowledge extracted by Random Forests and Recurrent Neural Networks when predicting real traffic. The obtained results are insightful and suggest that the traffic forecasting model should be analyzed from more points of view beyond that of prediction accuracy or any other regression score alike, due to the treatment each algorithm gives to input variables: even with the same nominal score value, some methods can take advantage of inner knowledge that others instead disregard.

Although many data-driven learning methods, e.g. Markov Chain (MC) model, have been utilized to estimate the traffic state variables including flow, density, and speed, it is still difficult to update the evolution of traffic states by integrating traffic flow fundamentals and real-time data. This paper aims to combine Newell's kinematic wave (KW) model with the MC model to overcome the limitation. The MC is used to capture the regular patterns of dynamic traffic states, and the impacts of daily deviations are inferred based on the forward and backward propagation of kinematic waves on freeways. A Bayesian Classifier and weight average model allow the merging of scores of probabilities. A discretized state representation on fundamental diagrams is used to express the traffic state variables. The traffic speed and count data from detectors of the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) are applied in training and validating the method. Through a case study, we also attempt to provide insights for the following question: What kinds of state sets should we need to achieve the best estimation?

We present a novel approach for static O-D matrix estimation using traffic flow dynamics. A path-based cell transmission model is developed to capture the dynamics of a network and associate link count observations with path demand patterns. We assume that the path demand follows a Poisson distribution with unknown rates and definition of path choice probabilities is not required. A state space model is utilised to associate link densities (observations) with per path densities (state vector). The proposed model is combined with Bayesian inference techniques to develop an efficient methodology for estimating accurate posterior probability density functions of the path demand from which we obtain the O-D demand. This involves numerical techniques such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, that make use of the Metropolis-Hastings update. We illustrate the proposed approach in a network studied in the literature and present results that show the advantage of the proposed methodology compared to existing methods studied in the literature. Finally, we discuss the findings of the analysis that suggest that the path-based CTM combined with the Bayesian principles can be utilised to efficiently approximate unknown path demand patterns and obtain static O-D matrices, along with a future direction for further advances of the methodology.

The interactions between vehicle classes display unique features that are distinct from homogeneous traffic flows. Modeling and estimation methods for heterogeneous traffic, however, still remain relatively unexplored. This article adopts a particle-filtering approach to sequentially estimate the traffic state with a heterogeneous traffic flow model that allows overtaking and creeping behaviors. Numerical experiments are introduced to evaluate the estimator performance, indicating that the filter can reduce estimation errors by up to 48% when compared to pure forward simulation of the model.

It quantifies the impact of CAVs' speed change on traffic state. The model describes the impedance of CAVs' speed reduction on traffic flow and considers the impact of potential additional lane change induced by the speed reduction. A VISSIM based microscopic simulation evaluation is performed. The results confirm that the accuracy of the proposed model is over 80%. Sensitivity analysis was conducted in terms of CAV penetration rate and v/c ratio. The proposed model demonstrated a consistent performance across all CAV penetration rate as long as v/c ratio is above 0.14. The proposed model could serve as the foundation of CAV based traffic management applications, such as variable speed limit and speed harmonization.

Furthermore, the vehicles speed plays a critical role in the level of congestion. Traffic speed estimation then helps transport authorities as well as network users to handle congestion over road infrastructures or at least provides a global picture of daily passenger flow. In this work, we propose the first methodology to forecast the future traffic speed over the road segments (i.e. links) exclusively based on traffic flow data using floating car data. For this study, we preprocess over one million vehicles flow for several network links spread all over the Greater Paris. A attention-based recurrent neural network is used to capture the correlation between the temporal sequences of traffic flow and that of speed. The attention layer learns patterns from weights of near-term traffic flow, thus extracts the inherent interdependency of traffic speed to many factors (e.g. incidents, rush hour, land use, etc.) in non-free-flow conditions. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model in traffic speed forecasting excluding additional data such as historic traffic speed and network graph contrary to cutting-edge work in the field. This is a substantial property since it allows avoiding the cumbersomeness in data mixing and facilitating resource availability.

Telemetry, navigation and electronic horizon systems are the key elements for increasing safety, enabling congestion-free highways, reducing fuel consumption and pollutant emissions under real driving conditions. In this work a novel approach for lane change driver assistance is presented to advise the driver economically to change or keep in lane by using model predictive Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). The system calculates lane change costs considering detected and connected traffic participants for an 8 km prediction horizon. The novel approach applies velocity loss minimization (VLM) and advanced nonlinear online energy optimization methods. This modular approach can interact with existing conventional and hybrid energy management systems. A final lane change judgment is based on the cost optimization of speed loss, gear selection and fuel consumption trajectories. This approach converges to global optimum fuel consumption under certain traffic flows. Finally, the system is applied to a 40-ton truck in a German macroscopic highway traffic simulation. In a typical highway traffic flow range between 75,000 and 95,000 vehicles per 24 hours on a three-lane highway, an average fuel consumption saving of 6% can be achieved, while the travel time criteria remains below 1%.

Therefore, it is very possible and promising to control the traffic flow by adjusting the speeds of some connected vehicles in the future. For this reason, in this paper we study the traffic flow evolution in a three-lane road after one vehicle in this road suddenly decelerates to a specific speed, where the following vehicles can independently operate car-following or lane change operations. Considering the availability of lane change operations is associated with the road traffic flows, we divide the model of the platoon length leading by the deceleration vehicle into two modes: 1) the platoon with a stable length; 2) the platoon with an increasing length. The stable platoon length and the growth rate of the increasing platoon are modeled, respectively, where their coefficients are identified based on the simulated data in SUMO simulator.

We propose herein a strategy to merge into roundabouts, which is based on characterizing the set of merging trajectories that are safe w.r.t. the traffic on the circulatory lane and reachable by the ego vehicle. Our solution leverages the belief that some vehicles in the roundabout will exit the intersection following a non-conflicting path, and generates efficient merging trajectories without compromising safety. Moreover, our decision-making policy is formulated at a high level and does not involve explicitly generating any trajectory, whereby the required computational time remains sufficiently low. In simulation, our strategy brings benefits not only to the smoothness of the merging trajectories themselves but also to the overall traffic performance, which improves 25% w.r.t. a simpler reactive merging approach.

It combines Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications and motion control technology to improve the traffic efficiency of intersection. Existing intersection control schemes mainly aim at managing single intersection efficiency, yet ignore the multiple intersections optimization. In this paper, we propose an intersection Platoon Control Scheme (iPCS) for non-traffic light community to optimize the throughput and ensure fairness in multi-intersections scale. The passing sequences are scheduled taking into account the traffic flow of adjacent road segments and vehicle's state in previous intersections. Traffic performance on mobility and message processing delay is evaluated by LTE-V2X based simulators. The results show that the iPCS shortens the average waiting time by as much as 39% compared with other existing intersection management scheme.

The applications of Intelligent Transportation Systems makes it possible for a signal control system to collect real-time data of an intersection, helping to improve the traffic signal control strategy and traffic efficiency. This paper proposes an algorithm based on coordination game and Pareto efficiency, by using vehicles position, speed and acceleration information, to control traffic signal for an isolated intersection in real time. The proposed algorithm is simulated on the SUMO microscopic traffic simulation platform and compared to a Webster's fixed-time plan and an actuated control algorithm to evaluate the performance in different traffic flow. The simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm based on coordination game and Pareto efficiency is more efficient than the Webster's fixed-time plan and actuated control algorithm in average queue length, average total delay and average travel time.

It has been widely used in navigation, data-driven traffic flow analysis and location based services. According to the characteristic that the GPS positioning errors of adjacent areas are similar, this paper presents a map matching model that combines k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to correct the positioning errors. In this model, a dynamic k value is learned first by using multi-layer perceptron, and then kNN algorithm use it to extract the similar characteristic of errors of k nearest neighbor points according to Euclidean distance. By doing so, the problem arising from applying a global constant k value to the non-uniform distribution of GPS data can be overcome. The proposed model is verified by using real taxi trajectory data of Xi'an City. And the results show that the error correction performance of the model is better than kNN, Support Vector Regression (SVR) and MLP.

These systems are typically designed for safety and rider comfort. However, these systems are often not designed with the quality of the overall traffic flow in mind. For such a system to be beneficial to the traffic flow, it must be string stable and minimize the inter-vehicle spacing to maximize throughput, while still being safe. We propose a methodology to select autonomous driving system parameters that are both safe and string stable using the existing control framework already implemented on commercially available ACC vehicles. Optimal parameter values are selected via model-based optimization for an example highway assistant controller with path planning.

This technology advance grants many innovative applications for improving traffic efficiency of current transportation systems. However, we still lack the understanding of the information dissemination dynamics factoring traffic flow dynamics over a road traffic network. Motivated by this lack, this research first develops an information network flow model (IFNM) to track information front spreading dynamics at intersections. Next, by integrating IFNM with IT-CTM model developed in [1] for capturing the information front propagation dynamics on a road segment, we develop a discrete mathematical simulation model (i.e., IFNM-CTM) to track the information front spreading dynamics over a road network. The numerical experiments based on simulation data illustrate that our simulation model is able to track information front spreading, including location and coverage, accurately with the MAE less than 6% and 5% respectively. Thus, this integrative model captures more realities in both transportation and communication, which provides better systematic knowledge for information spreading dynamics in roadway networks and potentially sustains real time applications of V2V communication in various ITS systems.

In this paper, we apply deep neural networks to the nonlinear spatiotemporal physics problem of vehicle traffic dynamics. We consider problems of estimating macroscopic quantities (e.g., the queue at an intersection) at a lane level. First-principles modeling at the lane scale has been a challenge due to complexities in modeling social behaviors like lane changes, and those behaviors' resultant macro-scale effects. Following domain knowledge that upstream/downstream lanes and neighboring lanes affect each others' traffic flows in distinct ways, we apply a form of neural attention that allows the neural network layers to aggregate information from different lanes in different manners. Using a microscopic traffic simulator as a testbed, we obtain results showing that an attentional neural network model can use information from nearby lanes to improve predictions, and, that explicitly encoding the lane-to-lane relationship types significantly improves performance. We also demonstrate the transfer of our learned neural network to a more complex road network, discuss how its performance degradation may be attributable to new traffic behaviors induced by increased topological complexity, and motivate learning dynamics models from many road network topologies.

In his paper, we propose four OD prediction models based on the data obtained by Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras. The principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce the dimension of the original OD matrices and to separate the main structure patterns from the noisier components. A state-space model is established for the main structure patterns and the structure deviations, and is incorporated in the Kalman filter framework to make prediction. We further develop three K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) based pattern recognition approaches. The proposed four approaches are validated with three days' field ANPR data from Changsha city, P.R. China. The results show that on one hand our proposed approaches are able to make accurate prediction of OD flows under different demand conditions. On the other hand, the prediction accuracy is highly dependent on the quality of the available OD data: the Kalman filter model performs better for regular and periodic OD patterns; while for irregular OD matrices K-NN models could make more accurate prediction.

In this study, we propose a methodology for estimating the queue length at signalized intersections using only travel time data and signal timing information. We use analytical equations to trace the trajectory of the vehicle and estimate the location of the vehicle in queue. We compare the performance of our Queue Location Estimation Using Travel Time data (QLE- UTT) with another methodology which used travel time data from multiple detectors and kinematic equations for vehicle location estimation. The performances of both methodologies were found to be comparable; however, the limited data requirement and simplicity of QLE-UTT makes the methodology attractive for practical implementation. The vehicle locations estimated from QLE-UTT was used to estimate the maximum queue length in a signal cycle using a probabilistic approach. This methodology for queue length estimation was tested both on a simulated dataset, for undersaturated, saturated, and oversaturated traffic conditions, and the real-world NGSIM dataset. The methodology combining QLE-UTT and the probabilistic approach was found to estimate the vehicle trajectories and queue lengths with good accuracy.

How to manage traffic smartly by intelligent signal control is a big challenge in urban traffic management. With recent advances in machine learning, especially reinforcement learning (RL), traffic signal control using advanced machine learning techniques represents a promising solution to tackle this problem. In this paper, we propose a RL approach for traffic signal control at urban intersections. Specifically, we use neural networks as Q-function approximator (a.k.a. Q-network) to deal with the complex traffic signal control problem where the state space can be huge and the action space can be discrete. The state space is defined based on real-time traffic information, i.e. vehicle position, direction and speed. The action space includes various traffic signal phases which are critical in generating a reasonable and realistic control mechanism, given the prominent spatial-temporal characteristics of urban traffic. We use SUMO, an open source traffic simulator, to construct realistic urban intersections. Moreover, we use different traffic patterns, such as major/minor road traffic, through/left-turn lane traffic, tidal traffic, and varying demand traffic, to train a generalized traffic signal control model that can be adapted to various traffic conditions. The simulation results demonstrate the convergence and generalization performance of our RL approach as well as its significant benefits in terms of queue length and wait time over several benchmarking methods in traffic signal control.

GPS Based Adaptive Traffic Light Timings and Lane Scheduling	2019 IEEE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (ITSC)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (IEEE-ITSC)	OCT 27-30, 2019	Auckland, NEW ZEALAND	IEEE, Intel, Griffith Univ, Auckland Tourism Events & Econ Dev				In today's era, it has become easier to collect traffic data using GPS enabled devices. In cities, a good proportion of people use Map Services like Google Maps in their daily commute. Google's Geocoding and Direction APIs can easily track users' geolocation and the route they are going to take in their commute. The scope of this work is to develop and create a mobile application which aids in the collection of GPS data from the users and use it to allocate fair green light timings, schedule proper lane departures and suggest lanes accordingly to the users approaching an intersection. Assuming that the drivers will follow the suggestion of the mobile application, this will reduce congestion and delays on roads with high traffic flow by prioritizing and assigning them the maximum green light time. The lanes with little traffic are assigned less green light time while the ones with no traffic are skipped for the next cycle. In order to validate our work, we used AnyLogic [9] to simulate different traffic scenarios. We found that our method allocates fair green light timings and lane scheduling, thus significantly reducing the traffic congestion on the roads with higher traffic flow. The main motivation behind the work is to develop a system which is cheap to implement and can be easily scaled without requiring expensive equipment and minimizing unnecessary congestion on the roads.

Kalman Filter-based Vehicle Count Estimation Approach Using Probe Data: A Multi-lane Road Case Study	2019 IEEE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (ITSC)	IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems-ITSC		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Conference (IEEE-ITSC)	OCT 27-30, 2019	Auckland, NEW ZEALAND	IEEE, Intel, Griffith Univ, Auckland Tourism Events & Econ Dev		Probe Vehicles; Traffic State Estimation; Traffic Signals; Connected Vehicles	TRAFFIC STATE ESTIMATION	The paper presents a novel approach for estimating the number of vehicles on multi-lane signalized approaches using only probe vehicle data. A model-based estimation technique is developed using the Kalman Filtering technique. The model-based state equation employs the traffic flow continuity equation, while the measurement equation uses the hydrodynamic equation. This study also proposes a novel variable estimation interval, leading to estimation improvements. The paper evaluates the proposed estimation method on multi-lane traffic signal approaches using simulated data. Results show that vehicle-count estimates are robust. The estimation model is evaluated considering two traffic signal control methods: a fixed-time plan and an adaptive phase split optimizer. The results demonstrate a higher estimation accuracy for fixed traffic signal timings at low traffic demand levels, while the estimation accuracy is better when the adaptive phase split optimizer is activated for high traffic demand levels. Finally, the paper investigates the sensitivity of the estimation model to vehicle length, demonstrating that the presence of longer vehicles (e.g. trucks) in the traffic stream reduces the estimation accuracy.

Verification or testing is required for C-ITS applications, in order to assess their impact on traffic operation. Microsimulation appears to be a robust tool that allows to gain insights into the implementation and performance of such systems. In this work, a microscopic traffic simulation approach is used, to evaluate the impact of Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) technologies in the context of a road traffic accident. Specifically, the methodology is implemented to study a Road Hazard Warning (RHW) system, using the open source microscopic traffic simulator SUMO. The approach explicitly models vehicles collisions, RHW, Emergency Electronic Brake Light (EEBL) warnings and the resulting driver behavior. Moreover, a new gap control mechanism is adopted, to improve safety by advising vehicles in hazard lane to increase their headways with respect to their preceding vehicle, so that they can avoid a collision.

In order to produce meaningful results, driver behaviour models need to be carefully calibrated to represent real world conditions. If this type of simulations are to be used to evaluate safety features of traffic, on top of macroscopic relationships such as the speed-density diagram, they should also adequately represent the average risk of accidents occurring on the road. In this paper, we present a two-stage computationally feasible multi-objective calibration process. The first stage performs a parameter sensitivity analysis to select only parameters with considerable effect on the respective objective functions. The second stage employs a multi-objective genetic algorithm utilizing only few influential parameters that produces a front of Pareto optimal solutions with respect to the conflicting objective functions. Compared to traditional methods which focus on only one objective while sacrificing the accuracy of the other, our method achieves a high degree of realism for both traffic flow and average risk.

V2X applications requirements raise outstanding challenges for 5G systems. Network slicing is a prominent solution to support 5G V2X challenges, by providing the ability to create isolated virtual networks over which different traffic flows can travel isolated from each others. One of the most challenging issues in V2X network slicing environment is the mobility management. To this end, this paper provides a mobility management algorithm based on a V2X slicing architecture by implementing a network slice selection function.

Most of the existing researches are oriented to urban road network, the development of urban traffic flow forecasting technology provides a good reference for traffic flow forecasting in the port. However, the complexity and uncertainty of port traffic determine that it is necessary to study the forecasting methods of port traffic flow pertinently. Based on the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm, this paper forecasted short-term traffic flow, and defined the factors affecting short-term traffic flow in the port, such as port working status and operation instruction characteristics, as state vector, and used K-Dimension Tree (KD tree) to reduce the time complexity of neighbor searching. One-month traffic flow data of an inland port in Chongqing was selected to verify the prediction algorithm. Firstly, the number of neighbors was identified, and 8 was the best, then the prediction accuracy was verified to meet the usage requirements, which could provide reference for scientific planning and management of port traffic.

A design simulation of traffic light intersection using SimEvents MATLAB	ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	Annual Conference of Science and Technology (Ancoset)	AUG 30, 2018	Univ Kanjuruhan Malang, Malang, INDONESIA		Univ Kanjuruhan Malang			The smoothness of traffic flow is one indicators of the excellent management by road managers, especially in the settings of traffic lights on road intersection. The time duration the red and green light must be set precisely according to the traffic density, so that the optimal and fairness queue length and waiting time are obtained for road users in each lane. Some problems at the intersection of the highway are the occurrence of very long queues in one lane, but quite short on the other lane. This happens because the setting is not appropriate on the traffic light time duration. In this article, we propose a model and simulation for intersection with traffic light using MATLAB SimEvents tools. The proposed model is to place an inhibitor module on each path at the intersection, where the entity does not flow for a certain duration of time. Through this simulation, it can be predicted the exact duration time of traffic lights based on the traffic density on each lane.

The VN allows for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications using wireless local area network technologies. The distinctive features of their candidate applications (e.g., collision warning and local traffic information for drivers), resources (e.g., computational sources), and their ability to collect various data from their environment (e.g., vehicular traffic flow patterns) make VNs a rich resource for information and resources. However, due to the transient nature of the network topology, data dissemination/content delivery is a challenging task in the VNs. Accordingly, in this article, we investigate the data dissemination/content delivery problem in VNs, and provide a novel traffic volume-aware data routing (TVDR) protocol for VNs. More precisely, by exploring the advantages of the various densities of coexistence vehicular traffic flows, the presented TVDR protocol can derive the data forwarding path with maximum link connection probability for the on-road vehicle. We evaluate the performance of the proposed TVDR protocol by conducting intensive simulations.

However, the high mobility of the vehicles makes the topology of VANET unstable, and real-time road information is generally limited. Considering these shortcomings, it is helpful to use the accurate traffic prediction to assist the topology control in the VANET. For offering a better traffic flow prediction, this paper proposes an innovative hybrid prediction method, Delay-based Spatial-Temporal Autoregressive Moving Average model (DSTARMA) to enhance prediction effect. This model mainly focuses on dealing with the travel delay problem in short-term traffic flow prediction. In other words, vehicles always need some time to move from one place to another in a real traffic situation, and this period is called travel delay. In previous spatial-temporal models, no one takes this factor into account. In our model, the travel delay is handled in the form of spatial-temporal weighted matrices and treated as a key role. We evaluated our approach based on data in England highway traffic system. The result proves our approach is reliable and has the ability to offer more accurate road information in advance to support VANET.

We do not know how people and things will be moving within cities in 30 years, but for sure we know that road network planning and traffic management will remain critical issues. The goal of our research is the implementation of a data-driven micro-simulation traffic model for computing everyday simulations of road traffic in a medium-sized city. A dynamic traffic model is needed in every urban area, we introduce an easy-to-set-up solution for cities that already have traffic sensors installed. Daily traffic flows are created from real data measured by induction loop detectors along the urban roads in Modena. The result of the simulation provides a set of "snapshots" of the traffic flow within the Modena road network every minute. The main contribution of the implemented model is the ability, starting from traffic punctual information on 400 locations, to provide an overview of traffic intensity on more than 800 km of roads.

This model ultimately will help highway designers, road planners and even common commuters, since it can give short term predictions of the road's behaviour which is influenced for example by its traffic flow, number of lanes, as well as off and on ramps. This research attempts to count vehicles from existing video cameras, which gives low-resolution 3 seconds video of 1 frame per second. For low-resolution, conventional methods, such as Back-subtraction, and Viola Jones are unable to give high counting accuracy. However, with the aid of another custom-made software tool, various parameters of Deep Learning method, such as pixel-frame distance thresholds, and two different counting models can be run repetitively, to obtain better accuracy. Early results have shown that by varying pixel distance threshold, the percentage of error can go down from 40.8% to as low as 0.8%.

THE DESCRIPTION OF THE TRANSPORT OBJECTS MOVEMENT VIA "INTELLECTUAL LIQUID" MODEL	MARINE INTELLECTUAL TECHNOLOGIES			Russian	Article						Intellectual liquid; transport process; transport traffic; transport objects movement; gateway system of shipping; planning and control	SYSTEM	The article explores the movement of human flows in order to solve various applied problems. It is known that such flows resemble the flow of a special fluid called "intellectual" and obey certain laws, the speed of which depends on its density. Comparative models of "intellectual fluid" are given in relation to the movement of human flows and to the movement of vehicles. Their general features and differences are analyzed. The movement of automobile flows, unlike the flows of people, at intersections and other sections of the road occurs through traffic lights, traffic signs or police officers, and is also regulated by the rules of the road. The possibility of solving specific problems is shown and it is noted that the accuracy of modeling traffic flows can be increased through the use of approaches developed in the theory of the movement of human flows. The use of the organization parameter of the traffic flow is proposed. It is proposed to expand the mathematical apparatus of the theory of movement of traffic flows using developments from the theory of motion of human flows and vice versa. In the interests of the development of both theories, the possibilities of using other mathematical apparatuses, such as: queuing theory, fuzzy set theory and others, are considered.

Through the creative dynamic traffic zone programming, a constrained optimization model is set up to assess the impact of potential public parking locations on road traffic emissions. In each scenario, Thiessen Polygon based zoning method is applied to investigate the distributions of road traffics. The main contribution of this study is as follows. Firstly, this proposed model takes the CO2 emission of the whole traffic network of sustainable city development as the optimization goal, instead of the traditionally discussed travel distance or cost efficiency. Secondly, a Thiessen polygon based public parking zoning method is developed and implemented realistically. This zoning method provides a precise approach to traffic distribution and parking demand estimation. Rather than the quadrilateral or radial zoning, this method pays more attention to the parking supply demand and its impact on parking congestion. Thirdly, the genetic algorithm (GA) is used to find the optimal public parking location (PPL) sets. GA has a great application value in speeding up stochastic search for global optimization. It is especially suitable to simulate complex and large capacity problems concerning the realistic solutions. By implementing the dynamic zoning and modelling method into intelligent transportation system (ITS), the efficiency of parking induction and dynamic optimization of traffic distribution could be ensured for the future smart mobility. Therefore, this model not only serves as a novel method for public parking allocations, but hold potential to support intelligent parking guidance, as a part of the intelligent traffic system for smart city development.

Vehicle platooning is a vital component of automated highways which contributes directly to these four benefits with its sequence of closely spaced leader-follower vehicle configuration by taking advantage of the 'slip-stream' effect to minimize the aerodynamic drag. Exploratory studies into platooning parameters, vehicle spacing, speeds and number of vehicles, have proven to be prohibitive expensive both computationally and experimentally due to the complexity of tests and the large number of test cases. In recent years, OpenFOAM (R) an independently developed, supported and documented open-source toolbox has gained popularity by offering a lower cost alternative to leading commercial CFD products. This paper summarizes the results from a computational study of autonomous vehicle platoons and the capability of OpenFOAM (R) to substitute leading commercial CFD solutions currently used to support vehicle aerodynamic development. This study investigates the aerodynamic characteristics of a 4-SUV platoon at inter-vehicle distances ranging from 0.25 to 1 SUV length at a constant speed of 23 m/s. Trends of the predicted aerodynamic drag coefficients (Cd) are then compared against experimental data from published literature as well as the results obtained from a leading commercial CFD package.

In this paper, a new linear data-model based adaptive iterative learning control (LDM-AILC) is proposed to address ramp metering in a macroscopic level freeway environment. A linear data-model is developed for the nonlinear macroscopic traffic flow model by introducing an equivalent dynamical linearization approach in the time domain. Then the LDM-AILC is designed with a feedback control law and a parameter updating law. The proposed scheme is data-driven intrinsically, where only the input and output data are required for the controller design and analysis. The convergence is shown by rigorous analysis without any identical conditions exposed on both the initial state and the reference trajectory. Extensive simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed LDM-AILC.

J	Liu, WW; Tang, Y; Yang, F; Dou, Y; Wang, J				Liu, Weiwei; Tang, Yang; Yang, Fei; Dou, Yi; Wang, Jin			A Multi-Objective Decision-Making Approach for the Optimal Location of Electric Vehicle Charging Facilities	CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA			English	Article						Electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS); multi-objective decision making; location optimization; genetic algorithm	MODEL	Electric vehicles (EVs) are recognized as one of the most promising technologies worldwide to address the fossil fuel energy resource crisis and environmental pollution. As the initial work of EV charging station (EVCS) construction, site selection plays a vital role in its whole life cycle. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization model for the location layout of EVCSs is established when considering various factors such as user demand, investment cost, soil locations, the emergency charging mileage limit, the actual road condition and service network reliability. The model takes the minimum investment cost and the minimum user charging cost as the dual objectives. On the basis of satisfying the user's charging demand and the capacity constraints of EVCSs, the redundant design of the charging pile and station is considered to ensure the reliability of the service network. In the allocation of user charging demand, in this paper, two factors of time and distance are considered, and the equal time load distance method is adopted to distribute traffic flow under the limitation of emergency charging mileage. When calculating the average travel speed of a road section, an accounting method based on the land price level is proposed considering the congestion. Then, the linear weighting method is applied to normalizing the multi-objective function, and the genetic algorithm is employed to solve the problem. Finally, a computational experiment is presented to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach is a useful, practical, and effective way to find the optimal location of EVCSs.

However, modeling driver's lane-changing decision and implementation process is challenging due to the complexity and uncertainty of driving behaviors. To address this issue, this article presents a personalized Lane-Changing Model (LCM) for Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) based on deep learning method. The LCM contains three major computational components. Firstly, with abundant inputs of Root Residual Network (Root-ResNet), LCM is able to exploit more local information from the front view video data. Secondly, the LCM has an ability of learning the global spatial-temporal information via Temporal Modeling Blocks (TMBs). Finally, a two-layer Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is used to learn video contextual features combined with lane boundary based distance features in lane change events. The experimental results on a -world driving dataset show that the LCM is capable of learning the latent features of lane-changing behaviors and achieving significantly better performance than other prevalent models.

J	Zhang, JL; Chen, F; Shen, Q				Zhang, Jinlei; Chen, Feng; Shen, Qing			Cluster-Based LSTM Network for Short-Term Passenger Flow Forecasting in Urban Rail Transit	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						LSTM; short-term passenger flow forecasting; urban rail transit; K-means clustering; deep learning	TRAFFIC FLOW; NEURAL-NETWORK; PREDICTION; RIDERSHIP; MODELS; VOLUME	Short-term passenger flow forecasting is an essential component for the operation of urban rail transit (URT). Therefore, it is necessary to obtain a higher prediction precision with the development of URT. As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly prevalent, many prediction methods including the long short-term memory network (LSTM) in the deep learning field have been applied in road transportation systems, which can give critical insights for URT. First, we propose a novel two-step K-Means clustering model to capture not only the passenger flow variation trends but also the ridership volume characteristics. Then, a predictability assessment model is developed to recommend a reasonable time granularity interval to aggregate passenger flows. Based on the clustering results and the recommended time granularity interval, the LSTM model, which is called CB-LSTM model, is proposed to conduct short-term passenger flow forecasting. Results show that the prediction based on subway station clusters can not only avoid the complication of developing numerous models for each of the hundreds of stations, but also improve the prediction performance, which make it possible to predict short-term passenger flow on a network scale using limited dataset. The results provide critical insights for subway operators and transportation policymakers.

The accurate traffic flow model of the urban road network is replaced by equivalent data model. Based on the idea of predictive control, the current control action is obtained by solving online, at each sampling coordinate, a finite horizon closed-loop optimal control problem.

The feasibility and effectiveness of the principle prototype FANG for traffic flow monitoring are proved and investigated by the field experiment. One of the 31.8 km-long redundant optical fiber of the buried optical-fiber cable for data transmission is utilized as the sensing fiber. Then, the phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometer (phi-OTDR) based DVS is realized and regarded as the FANG. The vibration events at 9 observation points with different ground conditions along the sensing fiber are detected by a threshold algorithm during 6.5 hours from 8:00 am. Then, the vibration events are analyzed in combination with the ground conditions to recognize the machine working in the factory, rammer working and the vehicles passed through near different areas and roads. The traffic flow is estimated by the vibration-counting with a counting error that is believed to be in an acceptable range. The distribution and the fluctuation trends of the estimated traffic flow are useful and enlightening for the traffic monitoring and pre-warning of special events, such as an accident. The accuracy can be improved by artificial intelligence methods in the future. It seems that our proposed FANG can be a potential and effective tool for the internet of things, smart ground and smart traffic in the suburb where the video and other information collection methods are not available.

IoT consists of billions of intelligent and communicating "things'', which further extend borders of the world with physical and virtual entities. Such ubiquitous smart things produce massive data every day, posing urgent demands on quick data analysis on various smart mobile devices. Fortunately, the recent breakthroughs in deep learning have enabled us to address the problem in an elegant way. Deep models can be exported to process massive sensor data and learn underlying features quickly and efficiently for various IoT applications on smart devices. In this article, we survey the literature on leveraging deep learning to various IoT applications. We aim to give insights on how deep learning tools can be applied from diverse perspectives to empower IoT applications in four representative domains, including smart healthcare, smart home, smart transportation, and smart industry. A main thrust is to seamlessly merge the two disciplines of deep learning and IoT, resulting in a wide-range of new designs in IoT applications, such as health monitoring, disease analysis, indoor localization, intelligent control, home robotics, traffic prediction, traffic monitoring, autonomous driving, and manufacture inspection. We also discuss a set of issues, challenges, and future research directions that leverage deep learning to empower IoT applications, which may motivate and inspire further developments in this promising field.

This is typically achieved by using a prediction model to estimate their future behavior and by evaluating how it affects the planned actions of the ego vehicle. The inverse problem of how the ego's behavior may affect the traffic situation, is rarely looked at. This paper presents a novel planning approach which treats the whole traffic situation as the system to control. By means of an interaction-aware prediction, the consequences of the ego's actions for other vehicles are estimated. Via a cost function, an optimal outcome for the whole traffic situation is defined. The optimum is approached in an iterative way instead of using sampling-based methods. The planning combines lane change behavior and longitudinal acceleration. To narrow down the continuous solution space, the available actions are expressed by only four variables. The approach was designed for use on controlled-access highways, but the basic concept is transferable to other scenarios. Its usefulness is demonstrated in three interesting scenarios within a third-party traffic simulator.

This has been demonstrated by large-scale numerical simulations and small-scale real experiments, whereas a comprehensive theoretical analysis is still lacking. In this paper, we focus on mixed traffic systems with one single CAV and heterogeneous human driven vehicles, and present rigorous controllability analysis and optimal controller synthesis. Using the PBH controllability criterion, we reveal controllability properties of a linearized mixed traffic system in a ring road. It is proved that the mixed traffic flow can be stabilized by one single CAV under a very mild condition. We formulate the problem of designing CAV control strategies under a pre-specified communication topology as structured optimal controller synthesis. This formulation considers a system-level performance index that allows the CAV to actively dampen undesired perturbations in traffic flow. Numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of our results.

Evaluation of lane-merging approaches for connected vehicles	2019 30TH IEEE INTELLIGENT VEHICLES SYMPOSIUM (IV19)	IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	30th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)	JUN 09-12, 2019	Paris, FRANCE	IEEE, Intel, Intempora, Denso, Codeplay, Positics, Easy Mile, Natl Instruments, IAU, Toyota Res Inst				Interaction among vehicles based on wireless communication technologies is an efficient way to improve traffic conditions and safety. In this context, The Grand Cooperative Driving Challenge (GCDC) is an event that aims at developing cooperative systems for intelligent vehicles. Although the two editions of the event (2011 and 2016) have provided conditions for a series of experiments such as platoon stability and lane-merging, the traffic flow in lane-merging scenarios didn't receive so much attention. This paper presents a preliminary study on traffic flow using GCDC 2016 interaction protocol for lane-merging by varying the driver imperfection model and the number of vehicles. We also propose an extension of the standard protocol. We evaluated three lane-merging interaction protocols using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO). The first protocol is very similar to the GCDC 2016, the second is the default lane change model commonly used in SUMO and the third is a variation of the GCDC interaction protocol. The experiments were conducted using similar conditions and number of vehicles of the event. We analyzed the lane-merging total time for all vehicles to complete the maneuver, the maximum string platoon length and the average platoon speed. Therefore, we could observe that the interaction protocol extension proposed decreased the duration time to complete the lane-merging maneuver of all vehicles without drastically compromising maximum string length and average platoon speed. The flexibility of this extension is closer to real traffic scenario, in which vehicles can perform the merge without having a pre-defined order.

In the first place, the stability condition is acquired through applying liner stability analysis method and it reveals that both the empirical lane changing rate and self-stabilization effect can enhance the stability of traffic flow to some extent. Next, in order to analyze the transmission mechanism of traffic congestion, the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation is deduced by using nonlinear theory near the critical point. At the same time, the kink-antikink solitary wave solution is obtained to describe the propagation behavior of traffic density wave by solving the mKdV equation. Subsequently, the numerical simulations are carried out and the results coincide well with the theoretical analysis, which indicate the empirical lane changing rate and the self-stabilization effect can improve the traffic stability.

J	Fattahi, S; Sojoudi, S				Fattahi, Salar; Sojoudi, Somayeh			Graphical Lasso and Thresholding: Equivalence and Closed-form Solutions	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						Graphical Lasso; Graphical Model; Sparse Graphs; Optimization	INVERSE COVARIANCE ESTIMATION; SELECTION; SPARSITY; MODEL	Graphical Lasso (GL) is a popular method for learning the structure of an undirected graphical model, which is based on an l(1) regularization technique. The objective of this paper is to compare the computationally-heavy GL technique with a numerically-cheap heuristic method that is based on simply thresholding the sample covariance matrix. To this end, two notions of sign-consistent and inverse-consistent matrices are developed, and then it is shown that the thresholding and GL methods are equivalent if: (i) the thresholded sample covariance matrix is both sign-consistent and inverse-consistent, and (ii) the gap between the largest thresholded and the smallest un-thresholded entries of the sample covariance matrix is not too small. By building upon this result, it is proved that the GL method-as a conic optimization problem-has an explicit closed-form solution if the thresholded sample covariance matrix has an acyclic structure. This result is then generalized to arbitrary sparse support graphs, where a formula is found to obtain an approximate solution of GL. Furthermore, it is shown that the approximation error of the derived explicit formula decreases exponentially fast with respect to the length of the minimum-length cycle of the sparsity graph. The developed results are demonstrated on synthetic data, functional MRI data, traffic flows for transportation networks, and massive randomly generated data sets. We show that the proposed method can obtain an accurate approximation of the GL for instances with the sizes as large as 80, 000 x 80, 000 (more than 3.2 billion variables) in less than 30 minutes on a standard laptop computer running MATLAB, while other state-of-the-art methods do not converge within 4 hours.

National road authorities collect data describing pavement condition every several years and use specific life-cycle analysis methods to draw up priority plans for maintenance activities. The pavement performance models (PPMs) create a basis for the life-cycle and cost-benefit analysis as they help to evaluate pavement condition as well as to predict pavement deterioration. The objective of this research is analysing different PPMs of rut depth propagation and to compare predicted rut depth with measured during service of the road. Four PPMs were analysed during this research based on a traffic flow or construction age. The pavement performance prediction models were applied to predict the increment of rutting for eleven road sections based on their bearing capacity properties.

It depends on various attributes related to road, traffic and pedestrians. In this paper, an attempt has been made to explore the variation, examine the influencing factors and formulate a model for the pedestrian crossing speed at signalised intersection crosswalks. The data have been collected using video graphic technique at 16 signalised crosswalks of the Chandigarh city. The findings reveal that a 15th percentile crossing speed (1.11-1.31 m/s) exceeds the design crossing speed of 0.95 m/s. It is also higher than the crossing speed of 1.2 m/s, usually being prescribed and adopted in the developed countries. The statistical analysis indicates no significant difference in the percentile crossing speeds between males and females. However, the variation exists among different age groups, group sizes, and crossing patterns. The correlation analysis depicts that the pedestrian crossing speed has significant negative correlation with the crosswalk width, the crosswalk length, the width of the pedestrian island, the classification of road, average traffic flow and average pedestrian delay, whereas the availability of separate bicycle paths at intersections is positively correlated. Furthermore, the stepwise regression model with 70.1 percent accuracy reveals that the crosswalk width, the width of the pedestrian island and the average pedestrian delay play a predominant role in determining the pedestrian crossing speed. The authors propose the usage of the developed model for setting out the standards for the appropriate design crossing speed for different crosswalks having similar geometric and traffic conditions as that of the study area.

This work focuses on forecasting traffic flow in major freeways in southern California using large amounts of data collected from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System. Both statistical models and machine learning models are considered. The statistical models include seasonal ARIMA, seasonal VARMA, exponential smoothing and various regression models. The machine learning models include Support Vector Regression, feed forward Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks. Forecasting is performed in both a univariate manner by relying on the historical temporal data of a particular sensor as well as in a multivariate manner by considering a neighborhood of three closely located sensors. Multivariate forecasters generally improve upon their univariate counterparts.

The methodology used in the analysis is that of the level of service determination for road transport network as exemplified by T-shape intersection and partial cloverleaf (parclo AB3) interchange in the city of Kryvyi Rih. The Department of Road Safety of the National Patrol Police of Ukraine set the task to determine the vehicles queuing length on the bridge if traffic lights at the T-shape intersection are installed. To conduct the project, the VISSIM simulation model of the intersection was developed according to site data collection on workdays and at weekends. LOS criteria were determined by using both traffic management assessment methods. The scenario of traffic lights installation at the intersection was elaborated. It was determined that with traffic signalization adjustment the average travel speed would be about 40% of the free flow speed for a street class. The two assessment methods vary significantly regarding traffic flow density criterion (35.1%). The conclusion is that flow density criterion is not reliable for the node LOS definition. By way of application value of the research findings the recommendations have been prepared for T-shape intersection traffic management that dismissing the project of traffic lights installation at the intersection needs to be considered.

The aim of this approach is to minimize passing transit flows through the streets of district importance, to ensure the safety of pedestrians and cyclists, as well as to impact the behavior of drivers in urban conditions. City streets should be designed taking into account the restriction of "extra" speed, in accordance with the category and purpose. It is necessary to have regard to the functionality of the street, the uniformity of the traffic flow, the appropriateness of the imposed limitations, and the predictability of the technical means used to organize traffic. The main criteria for the use of traffic calming measures can be: accident rate, speed through traffic, and specific traffic conditions. The article presents practical results of studies on traffic conditions in the pedestrian crossings areas equipped with humps. It discusses alternative measures of physical and psychological effects on the traffic participants in the context of the traffic calming approach.

The relevance of this system is conditioned changing social and economic conditions in the large cities, as well as modern features of scientific and technical progress. This paper presents a study aimed at improving the quality and efficiency of passenger transport in the "loaded" urban transport environment. It describes a mathematical model of computer control unmanned transport system. As a result of the study an algorithm for organization passenger transportations using unmanned vehicles has been proposed. The proposed model is adaptive to changes of road conditions and is intended to enhance the mobility and flexibility of passenger transport in the context of high traffic flows. The value of the study is that it brings economic and environmental benefits, since the method of transporting passengers by unmanned vehicles provides a high throughput of urban transport systems with a high level of passenger comfort.

SIMULATION OF TRAFFIC FLOWS ON ROAD SEGMENTS USING CELLULAR AUTOMATA THEORY AND QUASIGASDYNAMIC APPROACH	MATHEMATICA MONTISNIGRI			English	Article						Mathematical modeling; Traffic flows; Cellular automata; Parallel computing	LATTICE HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL; CURVED ROAD	The research deals with the creation of mathematical tools for the simulation of vehicular traffic flows on complex urban transport networks using modern supercomputers. The goal of the present paper is further development of micro- and macroscopic models created by the authors earlier. The proposed 2D microscopic model is based on the cellular automata theory. In this work algorithms taking into account various driving strategies have been incorporated into the model. The model is implemented as a program package that includes User interface and Visualization module. The macroscopic model uses the continuous medium approximation: it is constructed by analogy with the quasigasdynamic system of equations. The one dimensional version is proposed in the paper, nevertheless, it allows reproducing changes in the number of lanes as well as possible road entrances and exits. Parallel algorithms adapted to high-performance computing systems have been created for both models, ensuring rapid computations on city road networks.	[Churbanova, N.

The main focus is on the integration of a within-day traffic flow modelling coupled with a traffic control method in particular: (1) a microscopic traffic flow representation was considered, (2) an enhanced on-line optimisation model able to design the traffic signal decision variables was adopted. Regarding the on-line traffic control a hybrid approach combining the interacting junctions optimisation (e.g. the decision variables are the green timings, the offsets and the stage sequences) and the link metering control was considered. The proposed framework was tested on a simulated case study using a calibrated network consisting of a highly congested sub-network in the city centre of Naples (Italy). The network layout is represented by one diversion node and two alternative paths connecting the same origin-destination pair; two scenarios were analysed: i) the single junction modelling; ii) the on-line scheduled synchronisation with the activation of link metering at upstream pedestrian crossings. The framework effectiveness is evaluated in terms of within-day dynamics with respect to the travel times performance index.

A moving shockwave, consisting of light traffic upstream of the shockwave and heavy traffic downstream, is usually caused by changes of local road situations. The density discontinuity travels upstream and drivers caught in the shockwave experience transitions from free to congested traffic. Boundary control design in this paper brings the moving shockwave front to a static setpoint position, hindering the upstream propagation of traffic congestion. The traffic dynamics are described with Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model, leading to a system of two first-order hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Each represents the traffic density of a spatial domain segregated by the moving interface. By Rankine-Hugoniot condition, the interface position is driven by flux discontinuity and thus governed by a PDE state dependent ordinary differential equation (ODE). For the PDE-ODE coupled system. the control objective is to stabilize both the PDE states of traffic density and the ODE state of moving shock position to setpoint values. Using delay representation and backstepping method, we design predictor feedback controllers to cooperatively compensate state-dependent input delays to the ODE. From Lyapunov stability analysis, we show local stability of the closed-loop system in H-1 norm. The performance of controllers is demonstrated by numerical simulation.

These tasks usually require wide sensor deployments, but, due to economical, practical and environmental constraints, they must be accomplished with a limited number of sensors. Thus motivated, this work addresses the sensors selection problem for urban street monitoring, by employing vector maps as the basic information and considering the placement of at most one sensor along each road, but with a fixed number of available devices. To solve the problem, the concept of system observability is exploited as the criterion for optimal sensor placement, specifically related to the capability of estimating the traffic flow in each road using the available output measurements. In this framework, different integer non-linear programming problems are proposed, whose solutions are studied and analyzed by means of numerical simulations on a real case scenario.

These changes impact multiple stakeholders of this market (e.g., drivers, passengers, government, competing services) and present them with new opportunities and challenges. This paper develops an evolutionary game model to analyse the Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS) between the Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) and drivers. The new model is explored and analysed with simulation experiments to observe the dynamic route of multiple stakeholders. The theoretical research and simulation results indicate that under the authorities' control over the TNCs, when the net income under strict management is higher than that of the loose management for the TNCs, the final ESS is "Legal Operation, Strict Management". When the net income under strict management is less than that of the loose management for the THCs, the strategy of "Illegal Operation, Loose Management" may gain popularity and continue to grow; in this case, the ESS may also not exist. The model indicates the strength of the government's control plays a significant role in leading the achievement of "Legal Operation, Strict Management". As a consequence, to achieve the perfect evolution of "Legal Operation, Strict Management", it is necessary for the government to impose a greater penalty on illegal drivers and ensure appropriate compensation measures. The results of the study provide a useful reference for the sustainable development of the ridesourcing services market.

Increasing numbers of vehicles are associated with growing noise levels from road transport in urban areas and rising public health problems. Motor transport is considered to be a main source of noise pollution, so it is important to investigate the level of traffic noise and assess the relationship with traffic flows. The paper describes the main methods for determination of noise characteristics of traffic flows. The dependences for the prediction of the equivalent noise level and the results of field measurements of sound levels are presented. The results of field experiments and the calculated values of sound levels obtained by the analytical method are tested for homogeneity, using the Wilcoxon test. Experimental studies have established that the external sound level depends largely on the speed of vehicles, road conditions, and basic operating characteristics of highways. The analytical method associated with the use of deterministic and probabilistic models makes it possible to predict the traffic noise. But when dealing with the foregoing methods, there arise specific problems, many of which have not been resolved: there is no uniform terminology, nor is there any consensus on the use of noise characteristics of traffic flows in calculations at different stages of construction and reconstruction of highways of a certain traffic flow model under conditions of human settlements. Standardized measurement methods have been established and revised throughout the years by many renowned researchers. These methodologies have been revised in order to minimize problems that may occur and may not be foreseen by a less experienced researcher when adopting the measurement methods. Standardizing the measurement method is also useful for researchers because it becomes possible for researchers from around the world to compare their data. The joint effect of road conditions and the operational status of the roadway on the acoustic pollution of the roadside area is not fully taken into account. Therefore, applying the internationally recognized acoustical measurement standards is a good way to start any noise measurement experiment. The purpose of experimental research is to investigate the joint effect of road conditions and the operational status of the roadway on the acoustic pollution of the roadside area of settlements: identify the main characteristics of noise produced by traffic flows, consider the comparability of results of the field experiment and analytical computations. Slopes of 20...40 parts per thousand have little impact on the noise caused by the movement of passenger cars and trucks. In this case, the average acoustic emissions are identical to those used in the prediction of noise mode.

FIRE-NRD: A fully-distributed and Vanet-based Traffic Management System for Next Road Decision	2019 15TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING IN SENSOR SYSTEMS (DCOSS)	IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	15th Annual International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems (DCOSS)	MAY 29-31, 2019	GREECE	IEEE Comp Soc		Traffic Management System; vehicular ad-hoc networks; re-routing; communication protocol		Traffic congestion in large cities became more intense considering the last years. Basically, this growth is attributed to the wide use of a single mode of transport due to the lack of alternatives capable of efficiently supplying urban traffic demand. In this sense, in economic terms, it is estimated that billions of dollars are wasted every year due to the extra expenses with fuels and maintenance caused by traffic. In order to minimize the economic and environmental damages caused by congestion, this work presents FIRE-NRD: A fully-distributed Traffic Management System for Next Road Decision. In the proposed solution, vehicles, while moving, are able to analyze and share a study of the traffic flow and thus provide sufficient knowledge in order to resolve "the next road decision", i.e., the next road choice to decrease its travel time. FIRE-NRD is based only on local data about traffic information and totally collaborative, where neighbor vehicles share their knowledge. FIRE-NRD is compared to literature solutions and present better results considering network and traffic metrics, such as number of messages and average travel time.

With the changing of traffic flow in the road, it can adjust the important parameters such as the offset, green ratio and public cycle of signal lights in real time, which can effectively reduce traffic congestion and improve the vehicle capacity of the urban traffic network. In this paper, a three level multi-agent control framework is used. The objective functions are the optimization model of green ratio delay, public cycle and offset delay. Fireworks algorithm is used to solve the modeling optimization problem. The simulation results show that the adaptive traffic network signal control can significantly reduce the total delay time of the traffic network and improve the road utilization rate with the continuous change of traffic flow. Compared with the traditional traffic signal timing control, the adaptive traffic network signal control has great advantages and overcomes the disadvantages of traditional traffic signal control.

Few studies have paid attention to the efficiency of vehicle surveillance system, which is actually at a relatively low level. In this paper, we focus on optimizing the surveillance efficiency through a non-visual strategy, which leads to a much lower computational burden compared to other video-based methods. Our strategy can be considered as a multi-parameter dynamic decision system which includes the road intersection geometry characteristics, traffic lights and traffic flow. A prototype simulation platform is built for massive data study. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively boost the vehicle surveillance efficiency in large scale traffic network. Thus reveals the prosperous application value in real metropolitan traffic network.

The analysis of the countdown timers mounted at traffic lights and their positive influence on traffic flow was also presented. The study was based on a simulation system based on cellular automaton (CA) model and multi-agent technology. The developed CA model is based on cells of smaller size than the size of the CA cell in the Nagel-Schreckenberg traffic model. The model also reflects the real behaviour of drivers described in the literature and observed in the reality.

To assess driver's state the galvanic skin response (GSR) method and the electrocardiogram method (ECG), based on heart rate variability assessment, are used. Obtained results show that the degree of danger in a real driving situation can be estimated through changing driver's functional state as responding reaction on variations of limits characteristics of driver's state. GSR response occurs instantly when the driver is exposed to the following factors (events): driving in congested traffic; inhibition of the car moving ahead; change of lane of the leading moving car; lane change and the choice of the movement direction by the driver; car parking along the road; density of traffic flow, pedestrian appearance while driving; maneuvering at crossroads, etc. The cardiac rhythm also shows a change from the above-listed factors which is manifested in a heart rate shift from the initial values before starting the trip by the driver. The proposed method can be used to compile safe traffic routing in urban freight transportation conditions including human factors. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

As traffic flow data is mostly time series data, selecting a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) model in a recurrent neural network (RNN) that is good at processing time series data for speed prediction, comparing with long short term memory (LSTM) model and gated recurrent unit (GRU) model. The results show that BRNN has better prediction performance than the other two models.

We demonstrate a novel tracking pipeline which enables accurate flow estimates in a range of environments under low resolution and frame-rate constraints. We demonstrate that our system is able to track vehicles in New York City's traffic camera video feeds at 1 Hz or lower frame-rate, and produces higher traffic flow accuracy than popular open source tracking frameworks.

Conventional traffic management measures, currently applied, are valuable, but face limitations. During the last decades, a variety of vehicle automation and communication systems (VACS) have been developed and deployed, and many more are expected to appear in the near future. These systems provide a novel basis for a new generation of traffic management, which exploits emerging vehicle automation functions and connectivity channels to enable sensible traffic flow improvements in terms of efficiency and safety. A number of innovative concepts, tools and results that open up new horizons for traffic management research and practice in presence of VACS have been produced recently in the frame of TRAMAN21, an ERC Advanced Grant. This paper presents a collection of novel problems as well as of related traffic flow modelling, estimation and control developments for motorway traffic that can be used in the evolving traffic environment with VACS.

However 100% CAV penetration may never be achieved, raising the question of how to ensure a productive co-existence of CAVs with conventional vehicles. In this paper, we address the problem of optimally controlling CAVs under mixed traffic conditions where both CAV5 and human-driven vehicles (non-CAVs) travel on the roads. We specifically consider problems with such mixed traffic crossing an intersection without using explicit traffic signaling, the objective being to minimize energy consumption subject to a throughput maximization requirement while guaranteeing safety constraints. The impact of CAVs on overall energy consumption is investigated under different traffic scenarios as a function of the CAV penetration rate (i.e., the fraction of CAVs relative to all vehicles). Performance under traffic light control is used as a baseline for this study. Results are validated through simulation using MATLAB and VISSIM. The results indicate that the energy efficiency improvement becomes more significant as the CAV penetration rate increases, while the significance diminishes as traffic becomes heavier.

J	Wang, WK; Chen, JC; Wu, YJ				Wang, Wenke; Chen, Jeng-Chung; Wu, Yenchun Jim			The Prediction of Freeway Traffic Conditions for Logistics Systems	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Discrete-time Markov chain; freeway traffic congestion; logistics management; short-term traffic prediction	SUPPLY CHAIN; COLLABORATION; MANAGEMENT; MODEL	With a steady increase in the number of vehicles predicted, traffic congestion has become a significant logistical challenge. The increase in traffic not only results in pollution and traffic congestion, but also leads to increased travel time and productivity loss. Thus, traffic prediction has become an important research topic in the academia. In fact, logistics managers are more concerned about predicting short-term traffic conditions than the accuracy of prediction. Therefore, this study used a discrete-time Markov chain and online traffic monitoring data to predict the probability of traffic congestion and identify the freeway bottlenecks. The findings of the study revealed the high probability of National Freeway 3's northern section being non-congested during the morning and afternoon rush hours. However, several bottlenecks were found in the links to nearby urban areas. The results of this study can not only facilitate logistics managers to optimize vehicle routes but can also support transportation control centers with regulating traffic flow in freeways during peak periods.

IMPROVEMENT OF THE CITY TRANSPORT SYSTEM BY MEANS OF SIMULATION	REVISTA GENERO & DIREITO			English	Article						transport system; traffic light regulation; intelligent transport systems; simulation		The transport system plays an important role in human activities and is an integral part of the successful functioning of the urbanized area. The increasing degree of provision of urban residents with transport services should at the same time keep the environment environmentally friendly and sustainable over time. The article is devoted to the issues of ensuring the rational functioning of the city transport system based on the development and implementation of an intelligent road infrastructure management system, the intellectual core of which are simulation models of problem areas of the road network. The objective of the study is the development of tools for organizing traffic in the conditions of the rapid growth of the fleet of vehicles. Research tasks were to analyze the research in the field of traffic management, to consider methods to reduce and prevent traffic jams on roads in general and in individual sections in particular. The following research methods were used: methods of system analysis, methods of modeling traffic flows, simulation, computer experiment. Achievements: the developed simulation model can be used to conduct a computer experiment in order to select the optimal parameters for the functioning of traffic lights on a specific section of the road network of the city of Naberezhnye Chelny.

The demanding air transportation service is causing complicated air traffic networks which will affect the effectiveness and efficiency of airport operations. In order to reduce the adverse effect of getting air traffic delay or airport congestion, an alternative path modelling is proposed to resolve the traffic flow network problem by path coordination and aeronautical holding methods. This research considers the air traffic flow problem near the terminal control area to resolve the delay problem and conflict detection by using computational intelligence.	[Ng, K. K. H.; Lee, C. K.

J	Zhang, M				Zhang, Min			Structural optimisation algorithm of weight correlation analysis for DBN	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERNET PROTOCOL TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						deep learning; deep belief network; DBN; structural optimisation; correlation analysis; linear discriminant analysis; LDA	DEEP; NETWORKS	The deep belief network (DBN) algorithm has slow convergence rate and low learning efficiency, and it is sensitive to model hyper-parameters. In view of the fact that DBN is a learning network model with a large number of network nodes and multiple hidden layers, this paper proposes a weight correlation analysis algorithm for DBN (WCA-DBN) to determine the approximately optimal network structure of DBN. This algorithm establishes a PS orthogonal projection space based on the 'arbitrary node set' using the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method, projects the 'balanced node set' onto the PS plane, and solves the weights of the network nodes between sets through the correlation principle, to adjust the network structure of the hidden layer adaptively. The real-time traffic flow of six different types of roads in Jinan City, Shandong Province was selected as experimental materials to verify that the WCA-DBN algorithm has more obvious advantages over traditional algorithms in terms of accuracy and time complexity.

Based upon the traffic conditions, a simulation model is proposed and further tested for performance metrics, which is relative to three main aspects, namely, the waiting time of the vehicles at the junctions/intersections/signals, the type of pollutant emitted by a vehicle, and the traveling time. The experimental analysis and validation are carried out for different case studies in Malaysia, such as Petaling Jaya, Shah Alam, Mont Kiara, and Jalan Tun Razak. Three different scenarios (morning, afternoon, and evening) are analyzed and tested to explore the traffic usage parameter. The results showed that when traffic is modeled and governed based upon traffic flow, vehicle emission, and air quality index (AQI), nearly 75% of traffic congestion is mitigated, hence making the atmosphere pollution free as well as avoiding Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect due to the heat generated from vehicles. The experimental results are tested, validated, and compared with existing solutions for performance analysis. The proposed model is aimed toward overcoming the major drawbacks of existing approaches, such as single-path suggestions, traffic delay during peak hours/emergencies, non-recurring congestion consideration, congestion avoidance instead of recovering from it, improper reporting of road accidents, and notifications about traffic jam ahead to the users and high vehicle usage rate.

J	Liu, CL; Wang, JQ; Cai, WJ; Zhang, YZ				Liu, Chenglin; Wang, Jianqiang; Cai, Wenjuan; Zhang, Yuzhao			An Energy-Efficient Dynamic Route Optimization Algorithm for Connected and Automated Vehicles Using Velocity-Space-Time Networks	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Traffic engineering; energy-efficient route; state-space-time networks; dynamic route planning; connected and automated vehicles; traffic networks	FUEL CONSUMPTION; ELECTRIC VEHICLE; GUIDANCE STRATEGY; MODEL; EMISSIONS	This paper introduces three types of status information based on the current environmental perception and the information computing power of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and proposes an energy-efficient dynamic route planning algorithm without starting and stopping for the CAVs. The information types include real-time road traffic flow, traffic light and vehicle driving status (driving velocity and direction). The algorithm aims to minimize both time and energy consumption for the route. For this study, the feasibility of this energy-efficient route planning algorithm was first theoretically deduced. After introducing traffic light and driving energy consumption elements, a velocity-space-time three-dimensional network (VSTN) model was mathematically formulated to describe a dynamic route in addition to the design of the shortest route searching algorithm in VSTN. Two experimental road networks were then constructed to test and compare the energy efficiency. The first test scenario is a line road with two road conditions and various signal cycles and initial phases. The experiment shows that the cumulative energy consumption of the energy-efficient route under various scenarios is no greater than the normal route, ranging from 5.18% to 16.4%. The second test scenario involves a network located in the Jing'an district of Shanghai and is intended to verify the route searching function and energy efficiency. Compared to the traditional driving method, the new route reduces energy consumption by 10.36%. This study demonstrates that the energy efficiency does not correlate with the signal cycle or initial phase, and it appears to be random. The new algorithm proposed in this paper can be applied to dynamic route planning by CAVs and the goal of saving energy can be achieved in various road networks.

J	Khabbaz, M				Khabbaz, Maurice			Modelling and Analysis of a Novel Vehicular Mobility Management Scheme to Enhance Connectivity in Vehicular Environments	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Modelling; performance; connectivity; delay; vehicular networks; multihop; path	NETWORKS; VEHICLES	Robust end-to-end connectivity in vehicular environments has been a daunting problem standing in the way of the development and provisioning of novel in-transit data communication services envisioned to incur remarkable enhancements on all of the: a) road safety, b) environment and c) welfare of travelling passengers. The establishment of continuous multi-hop data communication paths among arbitrary pairs of vehicular nodes is severely affected by the natural vehicular traffic flow's inherent limitations and obstacles that have been widely investigated in the literature. This present work proposes a novel Vehicular Mobility Management (VMM) scheme that has the objective of regulating the vehicles' navigational parameters in such a way to steadily line these vehicles up in proximity of each other with space headways that do not exceed the coverage range of their respective OnBoard Units. This will allow for establishing robust and long-lived communication links connecting the vehicles together; hence, increasing the probability of existence of multi-hop paths between arbitrary pairs of vehicular nodes. A Mathematical model is formulated herein in order to evaluate the performance of VMM in terms of multiple Quality-of-Service (QoS) metrics (e.g. average end-to-end data delivery delay, average throughput, probability of existence of an end-to-end path, etc). A simulation framework is then established for the purpose of verifying the correctness and validity of the proposed model and gauge the merit and advantages of the proposed VMM scheme. The reported results constitute a tangible proof of the validity of the proposed model as well as of the benefits emanating from vehicular flow control in the context of a highly promising step towards the realization of the embraced Internet of Vehicles (IoV).

Through the query data, many models for traffic flow prediction have neglected the temporal and spatial correlation of traffic flow, so that the prediction accuracy is limited by the accuracy of traffic data. This paper proposed a short-term traffic flow prediction model that combined the spatio-temporal analysis with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). In the proposed prediction model, firstly, time correlation analysis and spatial correlation analysis were performed on the collected traffic flow data, and then the spatiotemporal feature selection algorithm was employed to define the optimal input time interval and spatial data volume. At the same time, the selected traffic flow data were extracted from the actual traffic flow data and converted into a two-dimensional matrix with spatio-temporal traffic flow information. The GRU was used to process the spatio-temporal feature information of the internal traffic flow of the matrix to achieve the purpose of prediction. Finally, the prediction results obtained by the proposed model were compared with the actual traffic flow data to verify the effectiveness of the model. The model proposed in this paper was compared with the convolutional neural network (CNN) model and the GRU model, and the results show that the proposed method outperforms both in accuracy and stability.

Urban Traffic Routing Using Weighted Multi-Map Strategies	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Routing; Planning; Microscopy; Urban areas; Proposals; Vehicle dynamics; Cost function; Dynamic traffic assignment; traffic control; traffic simulation; vehicle routing; traffic big data; decision making; multi-agent systems; multi-map routing; TWM	MODEL	Urban traffic routing has to deal with individual mobility and collective wellness considering citizens, multi-modal transport, and fleet traffic with conflicting interests such as electric vehicles, local distribution, public transport, and private vehicles. Different interests, goals, and regulations, suggest the development of new multi-objective routing mechanisms which may improve traffic flow. In this work, <italic>Traffic Weighted Multi-Maps</italic> (TWM) is presented as a novel traffic routing mechanism based on the strategical generation and distribution of complementary cost maps for traffic fleets, oriented towards the application of differentiated traffic planning and control policies. TWM is built upon a centralized control architecture, where a Traffic Management Center generates and distributes customized cost maps of the road network. These maps are used individually to calculate routes. In this research, we present the TWM theoretical model and experimental results based on microscopic simulations over a real city traffic network under multiple scenarios, including traffic incidents management. Experimental evaluation takes into account drivers adherence to the system and considers a multi-objective analysis both for the global network parameters (congestion, travel time, and route length) and for the subjective driving experience. Experimental results deliver performance improvements from 20 to 50. TWM is fully compatible with existing traffic routing systems and has promising future evolution applying new algorithms, policies and network profiles.

J	Own, CM; Sha, FY; Tao, WY				Own, Chung-Ming; Sha, Feiyu; Tao, Wenyuan			Triplet Decoders Neural Network Ensemble System and T-Conversion for Traffic Speed Sequence Prediction	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Predictive models; Logic gates; Time series analysis; Recurrent neural networks; Decoding; Data models; Recurrent neural network (RNN); long short term memory (LSTM); gated recurrent unit (GRU); sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq); ensemble models		Traffic flow prediction is essential in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Due to the complexity of the traffic environment, predicting future traffic speed is difficult. A lot of methods have been proposed to forecast traffic flow, such as support vector regression (SVR), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and so on. However, there are few ensemble models methods for predicting traffic flow, especially for predicting multi-step traffic speed. Meanwhile, these ensemble methods often use many base models for regression. Thus, the performances of these existing methods are worth exploring for multi-step traffic forecasts with few base models. Besides, this paper proposes a model based on ensemble models, called Triplet Decoders Neural Network (TDNN), to compare with these methods. By analyzing the characteristic of traffic speed data, this paper also proposes a data preprocessing model called T-Conversion to help RNN capturing long-term dependencies. Our experiments are implemented based on real traffic speed data from Baidu in Beijing, China because the prediction for complex traffic is more valuable.

Estimating Summer Emissions from Land Transportation Vehicles Moving Along the Urban Roads	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION			English	Article						. Highways; heavy metals; exhausts; emission limit value	AIR-QUALITY; INDUSTRIAL; SYSTEM; PINE	The industrial and transport effect on the environment is distinguished most significantly by the formation of technogeneous geochemical anomalies in the urban landscape. This study was conducted within the boundaries of urban agglomeration (Penza city) for two years (2014 and 2015) during the summer (June to August). To determine the effect that the distance from road and the amount of heavy metal emissions have, samples were extracted at a distance of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 metres from the roadway. There were three sampling points at each sampling line, with a 3 to 4-metre space between them. The year-long measurements make up a number over 20.000. In Penza, the flow of traffic typically varies between 3 and 3943 cars per hour. When produced in significant amounts, heavy metal emissions from vehicles-exhaust emissions (Pb, Cu, Ni), particulate matter emissions (Cu, Ni, Zn), emissions from plastics and paint (Zn, Cd), and tirewear emissions (Zn)-accumulate in the roadside area, transform and further migrate along the food chains. All road categories show a significant elevation in the background and emission limit values for all heavy metals studied. The most dramatic rise was recorded for Cu and it was 5.09- to 19.11-fold. The concentration of Ni, Zn and Pb exceeds the acceptable rate 1.17-8.79-fold. The concentration of carbon monoxide decreases with distance from the road. Street ranking by car hazard shows that all main urban streets with regulated traffic are category 1 hazard sources of emission, mainly due to lead compounds (%). Between spring and summer, the traffic flow increases 1.3- to 2-fold and the hazard category of roads rises (under 1.5-fold). Significant changes in the traffic infrastructure and vehicle replacement compensate for the negative impact of vehicles on air quality in Penza, which was initially caused by the increase in the number of vehicles on the road and by the subsequent overload of the transport network. The increase in the queue length and time did not entail the emission growth. On the contrary, since 2014, Penza has been showing a decreasing trend and since 2015, the total amount of emissions from motor vehicles has been remaining at a stabilized point.

J	Lee, J; Lee, J				Lee, Junhyung; Lee, Jaekang			Preventing Capacity Drop at Isolated Merging Bottleneck through Variable Speed Limit Control	SENSORS AND MATERIALS			English	Article						variable speed limit; merging bottleneck; density control; throughput	KINEMATIC WAVES; FREEWAY	The traffic flow control strategy is crucial to properly discharge a queue at a bottleneck. In particular, breakdown prevention is a key objective to maintain high-throughput traffic. Many researchers have studied variable speed limit (VSL) algorithms for their own purposes. However, previous VSL studies have mainly focused on traffic safety aspects, and fluctuation mechanisms depending on VSL algorithms have not been fully investigated. In this study, we designed a VSL algorithm to adjust the density (or occupancy) to the optimal range to increase the throughput of the bottleneck. Demand-capacity analysis and simulation results indicate that flow reduction is achieved through VSL. VSL temporarily mitigates input flows by delaying the downstream arrival time. In addition, the results confirm that VSL can effectively control the traffic density to properly handle the congestion of a given merging bottleneck. According to previous research studies and empirical data analysis, there is a relationship between critical density (occupancy) and breakdown. The VSL algorithm clearly shows that throughput at a merging bottleneck can increase through density control. This mechanism sheds some light on traffic control using VSL, which could be adopted in the foreseeable future.

Aiming at solving the problem of loop traffic congestion, this paper, is devoted to a loop traffic coordinated control system based on the vehicle-road cooperative environment. The design of the system mainly includes two main steps: the calculation of the guided speed and the adjustment of the dynamic signal timing parameters. Besides, on the Visual Studio 2010 platform, a simulation test is performed by virtue of the Visual Basic 2010 language and the VISSIM 4.3 COM interface. The result of the simulation shows that the coordinated control system of loop traffic based on the vehicle-road cooperative environment is better than the point control and the traditional green wave control in average delay, the average queue length and the average number of parking times and other indicators.

Fuzzy inference approach in traffic congestion detection	ANNALS OF GIS			English	Article						Traffic flow theory; traffic; congestion; fuzzy logic; fuzzy inference model	SYSTEMS; LOGIC	One of the major tasks within the concept of an intelligent transportation system is the immediate indication of traffic breakdowns. A conventional approach evaluates a traffic condition by classifying (1) traffic volume and (2) vehicles average speed. This mathematical approach is acceptable and leads to good results as long as the analyzed data correctly represents the observed situation. However, both traffic situations and behaviour of individual drivers cannot be foreseen. In such circumstances, 'crisp' computational models cannot deal effectively with accompanied ambiguities and uncertainties. An alternative approach is to apply fuzzy logic systems, which enable knowledge-based analysis for effective and efficient traffic congestion detection. In this paper, traffic flow and density are inputs for the proposed fuzzy inference model and the output comes in form of detected levels of congestion (ranging from 'congestion free' to 'extreme congestions' conditions). The results show that fuzzy logic inference model for congestion detection might be highly suitable for transportation planning, management and security assessment.

Here, we report and discuss methods used to handle large volumes of such activity data, namely 124 million GPS recordings from the web page Maplink.com.br, extract high spatial resolution vehicular flow information for a vast area in South-east Brazil, and correct for bias using traffic counts observations for the same area. The method consists in filter speed and accelerations, assign buffers to the road network, aggregate speed by street, fill missing number of lanes, generate traffic flow. Methods presented here were used to inform traffic-related air quality modelling and used as part of local air pollution management activities but are also amenable to any work that would be enhanced by more locally representative or time*resolved inputs for traffic flow, e.g. traffic network management, and demand modelling. 124 million GPS observations from electronic devices were used to generate traffic flow. Spatial bias was investigated and accounted for using independent local traffic count data. Traffic count rescaled GPS traffic flow provide a robust description of spatial and quantitative traffic patterns. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In the model the bulk flow is represented by a scalar conservation law, while each autonomous vehicle is described by a car following model. The autonomous vehicles act as tracer vehicles in the flow and collect measurements along their trajectories to estimate the bulk flow. The main result is to both prove theoretically and show numerically how to reconstruct the correct traffic density using only the measurements from the autonomous vehicles.

Motivated by real applications, we allow us for the the presence of space discontinuities both in the speed law and in the number of lanes. This allows us to describe a number of realistic situations. Existence of solutions follows from compactness results on a sequence of Godunov's approximations, while L-1-stability is obtained by the doubling of variables technique. Some numerical simulations illustrate the behavior of solutions in sample cases.

The model assumes that the tendency of drivers to change to a neighboring lane is proportional to the difference in velocity between the lanes. The model allows for an arbitrary number of lanes, each with its distinct velocity function. The resulting model is a well-posed weakly coupled system of hyperbolic conservation laws with a Lipschitz continuous source. We show several relevant bounds for solutions of this model that are not valid for general weakly coupled systems. Furthermore, by taking an appropriately scaled limit as the number of lanes increases, we derive a model describing a continuum of lanes, and show that the N-lane model converges to a weak solution of the continuum model.

They will improve the traffic safety and bring about a revolution on the driving experience. However, these benefits are counterbalanced by possible attacks that threaten not only the vehicle's security, but also passengers' lives. One of the most common attacks is the Sybil attack, which is even more dangerous than others because it could be the starting point of many other attacks in C-ITS. This paper proposes a distributed approach allowing the detection of Sybil attacks by using the traffic flow theory. The key idea here is that each vehicle will monitor its neighbourhood in order to detect an eventual Sybil attack. This is achieved by a comparison between the real accurate speed of the vehicle and the one estimated using the V2V communications with vehicles in the vicinity. The estimated speed is derived by using the traffic flow fundamental diagram of the road's portion where the vehicles are moving. This detection algorithm is validated through some extensive simulations conducted using the well-known NS3 network simulator with SUMO traffic simulator.

However, it is expected to take a considerable period of time for their spread, and during the transition period, autonomous and manually-driven vehicles will share the same roads. Under such situations, the driving behavior of autonomous vehicles will influence manual drivers, for example, manually-driven vehicles may be stuck behind the autonomous vehicles and overtake them frequently if autonomous vehicles drive slowly for safety. In this paper, we investigate how the traffic flow and driving stress vary with autonomous vehicles by microscopic traffic simulation. We develop a microscopic traffic simulator that can reproduce traffic flow with autonomous vehicles and manually-driven vehicles. The behavior of these vehicles can be modeled by the combination of Intelligent-Driver Model (IDM) and Lane change Model with Relaxation and Synchronization (LMRS). These models can express various driver characteristics through simulation parameters such as driving speed and distance between vehicles (net distance), and we are able to create realistic scenarios like overtaking autonomous vehicles by manually-driven vehicles with faster speed than the legal speed. From the simulation results, we found that there is a desirable combination of speed and time headway that achieves both smooth traffic and less stress of drivers with a given percentage of autonomous vehicles.

The higher the degree of chaos in a system, the higher its entropy. The concept of entropy has also been applied to the evaluation of transportation systems. Because of the limitation of the existing traffic information collection technology, an entropy-based evaluation method has not been widely applied. With the development of on-board sensors and the Internet of vehicles, vehicle spacing information will be easier to acquire and transmit in real time; furthermore, traffic flow entropy will be calculated in real time. Based on the vehicle spacing on the road, the proportion of the distance between the vehicles was taken as the input data of the entropy calculation, and the summation result was normalised and corrected to obtain the calculation corresponding to the entropy and the degree of disorder. On this basis, the entropy values at different moments were repeatedly calculated, and the dynamic traffic flow entropy on the road segment was summarised. We constructed a one-lane road segment model in the simulation software, recorded the vehicle information, and calculated the dynamic traffic flow entropy. A comparison of the difference in the traffic flow entropy between different proportions of heavy goods vehicles revealed that a large proportion of the heavy goods vehicles corresponded to a large traffic flow entropy, indicating a large degree of disorder. The simulation results showed that the proposed method has good scientific value and is practical.

The primary objective of our designed strategy is to determine traffic signal offset and active (green) time for each route in order to reduce the risk of congestion and the number of stops. The dynamics of each road segment is described in discrete time using cell transmission model (CTM). By applying some results in consensus and economic dispatch (ED) problem, traffic flows are computed to solve the constrained optimization problem. They are used as parameters in the algorithm regulating traffic signals at each intersection.

The current traffic light models are not suited to tackle problems such as traffic jams, ease of access for emergency vehicles and prevention of accidents. In order to counteract these issues, we propose the 'Smart traffic light control system'. The adopted Traffic Light Controllers (TLC) in Gaza, are based on microcontroller and microprocessor. These TLCs have limitations because they use the pre-defined hardware, which is functioning according to the program that does not have the flexibility of modification on real time basis. Due to the fixed time intervals of green, orange and red signals the waiting time is more and car uses more fuel. The intended project will focus on two aspects of implementation. First and foremost, to make traffic light controlling more efficient, image processing alongside with embedded system, will be used. This system will intelligently decide when to alternate signals based on the total traffic on each road detected by cameras on each lane which will increase road capacity and traffic flow. Secondly, the minor component consists of the ability to control the traffic signals by an android application throughout the Bluetooth and wireless connection. This will be controlled by the traffic warden or police officer. The prototype of the system has been built and tested. The model is better than the current system which is limited to the Fixed Mode Traffic Light Controller. It is observed that the proposed smart Traffic Light Controller is more efficient than the conventional controller in respect of less waiting time, more distance travelled by average vehicles and efficient operation during emergency mode.

Automation of driver assistance systems, autonomous driving, increasing vehicle connectivity and emerging inter-vehicular communication (V2V) are among the most disruptive innovations, the latter of which also raises numerous unprecedented security concerns. This paper is focused on the security of V2V communication in vehicle ad-hoc networks (VANET) with the main goal of identifying realistic attack scenarios and evaluating their impact, as well as possible security countermeasures to thwart the attacks. The evaluation has been done in OMNeT++ simulation environment and the results indicate that common attacks, such as replay attack or message falsification, can be eliminated by utilizing digital signatures and message validation. However, detection and mitigation of advanced attacks such as Sybil attack requires more complex approach. The paper also presents a simple detection method of Sybil nodes based on measuring the signal strength of received messages and maintaining reputation of sending nodes. The evaluation results suggest that the presented method is able to detect Sybil nodes in VANET and contributes to the improvement of traffic flow.

The Cnossos-EU model were used for this purpose. The traffic flow was measured over the period between January and December 2013. The measurements were documented at one hour intervals throughout the entire 24 hours of the day (1:00-24:00). The results of noise simulations were compared with the equivalent sound level calculated by permanent automatic sound and traffic volume monitoring station. The frequency noise analysis was calculated according to the Cnossos-EU model. The results was described using parameters such as the median C-50, average peak level C-90, average background noise level C-10, percentiles C-25 and C-75. It was found that in most cases, the distribution of the tested variable was not normal. Analyzes carried out for the tested section of the road showed that the traffic of light motor - and medium heavy vehicles is the main source of road noise. It has been shown that maximum values of the equivalent sound level occur for the frequency of 1000 Hz. The minimum values are in the octave band f(0) = 125 Hz.

In this method, the concepts of bicycle lane capacity and the mental space of cyclists are highlighted; evaluation indicators are output through simulation under different traffic flow densities through construction of a space model for user perception and a multi-valued cellular automata model for hybrid bicycle flow, and the evaluation criteria of the level of service is determined through the clustering analysis method; thereafter, based on traffic density of the section under evaluation, the level of service of the lane can be determined. This method is adopted to evaluate the level of service of a bicycle lane in Hangzhou, China. The results show that this method can accurately describe the actual traffic flow state, user perception, and utilization of a road section.

Joint route guidance and demand management for multi-region traffic networks	2019 18TH EUROPEAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ECC)			English	Proceedings Paper	18th European Control Conference (ECC)	JUN 25-28, 2019	Naples, ITALY	Unvi Naples Federico II, Univ Sannio Benevento			MODEL; ASSIGNMENT	Traffic congestion occurs as demand surpasses the available capacity of a road network, resulting to lower speeds and longer journey times; with route guidance constituting the primary control strategy to alleviate the problem. However, the effectiveness of route guidance is limited in high-demand conditions. In this work, we proposed a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that combines multi-regional route guidance with a novel demand management method. Route guidance is used to minimize the network's density imbalance while demand management is utilized to reduce the conditions that cause congestion. This can be achieved by manipulating vehicle routes (i.e., using route guidance) and/or by instructing a portion of the vehicles to wait at their origin before commencing their journey (demand management). Simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed MPC optimization indicating the substantial improvements that can be achieved in traffic flow performance.

In this paper, we study how different perturbations affect the free flow equilibria, i.e., equilibria where no congestion effects are present, in transportation networks. More specifically, if and when the equilibrium of the perturbed dynamics is still in free flow. A generalized cell transmission model models the dynamics of the transportation network, and the perturbations considered are perturbations in the exogenous inflows, flow capacity drops, and perturbations in the routing, i.e., when drivers deviate from their normal route preferences. The paper also shows that social optimum assignments in traffic networks, may not be the most robust ones.

In particular, we assume that a percentage of vehicles can receive and implement specific control tasks (e.g., lane-changing commands). A novel approach is designed to robustly maximise the throughput at motorway bottlenecks employing a Linear Quadratic Integral (LQI) regulator in combination with an anti-windup scheme, based on a simple Linear Time Invariant (LTI) model. The method is evaluated via simulation experiments, performed on a first-order, multi-lane, macroscopic traffic flow model, also featuring the capacity drop phenomenon, which allows to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed methodology and to highlight the improvement in terms of traffic efficiency.

B	Komarovsky, S; Haddad, J			IEEE	Komarovsky, Shimon; Haddad, Jack			Robust Interpolating Traffic Signal Control for Uncertain Road Networks	2019 18TH EUROPEAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ECC)			English	Proceedings Paper	18th European Control Conference (ECC)	JUN 25-28, 2019	Naples, ITALY	Unvi Naples Federico II, Univ Sannio Benevento				Many traffic control strategies in the literature are designed based on various traffic flow models, which do not include parameter uncertainties in their intersection flow dynamics. Hence, these control strategies are unable to handle conditions when the assumed values for the parameters vary significantly from their real values. Moreover, many utilized state feedback control approaches to develop the traffic signal controllers lack the treatment of control and state constraints directly in the design phase. This paper considers robust traffic signal control for uncertain urban road networks. First, parameter uncertainties are integrated into the store-and-forward (SF) model, which is utilized in this paper to describe the flow dynamics for traffic signalized intersections. Then, the uncertain SF model is utilized to design a robust feedback controller by an interpolation-based approach. This approach (i) guarantees robustness against all parameter uncertainties, (ii) handle control and state constraints, and (iii) present a computationally cheap solution. Finally, numerical results for an isolated signalized intersection show a comparison between the developed interpolating controllers and other controllers in the literature. The results demonstrate the performance advantages from applying the robust interpolating controllers.

In this control case, the direction of one or more contraflow buffer lanes is reversed according to the needs of each direction. This paper introduces a basic dynamical model for tidal traffic flow and considers the minimum travel-time, minimum-time, and maximum throughput optimal control problems for efficient motorway tidal flow lane control. Lane management is effectuated by a control variable, indicating the number of lanes opened or closed in each direction of traffic. To derive the analytical form of optimal control, the Pontryagin's maximum principle is employed. The obtained optimal control is intuitively natural of bang-bang type, as also shown in a previous work by the authors [1]. It takes only the values +/- 1 and switches between these values at most once. In other words, the optimal control strategy consists of switching between opening and closing in each direction of traffic one contraflow buffer lane. Of course it is an open-loop control, and thus the switch time (if applicable) depends on the initial conditions. In the case of the maximum throughput optimal control problem, semi-state feedback control is obtained and singular arcs might exist. Finally, cumulative arrival rate and output curves for both directions of traffic are used to provide a graphical interpretation of the minimum travel-time optimal control problem and obtained bang-bang control.

The automatic lane change decision model is designed bases on the minimum safety distance, which also takes the safety of lane change and its impacts on the overall traffic flow in consideration. The reason for selecting the fifth-order polynomial as an ideal lane change trajectory is that it is flexible and adaptable. Considering that there are many external disturbances during the driving process of the vehicle, the trajectory of the lane change is tracked by the sliding mode control system, and the simulation is carried out by using MATLAB/SIMULINK. The results show that it has good tracking effects.

They are potentially beneficial to traffic flow, fuel consumption, and safety, but human behaviour whilst driving with ADS is poorly understood. Human behaviour is currently expected to lead to dangerous circumstances as ADS could place human drivers 'out-of-the-loop' or cause other types of adverse behavioural adaptation. This article introduces the concept of 'meaningful human control'T to better address the challenges raised by ADS, and presents a new framework of human control over ADS by means of literature-based categorisation. Using standards set by European authorities for driver skills and road rules, this framework offers a unique, quantified perspective into the effects of ADS on human behaviour. One main result is a rapid and inconsistent decrease in required skill- and rule-based behaviour mismatching with the increasing amount of required knowledge-based behaviour. Furthermore, the development of higher levels of automation currently requires different human behaviour than feasible, as a mismatch between supply and demand in terms of behaviour arises. Implications, discrepancies and emerging mismatches this framework elicits are discussed, and recommendations towards future design strategies and research opportunities are made to provide a meaningful transition of human control over ADS.

At the same time, the routes of cargo traffic volumes significantly depend on the conditions of transportation by railways of individual states. The mathematical model for the distribution of transit freight traffic volumes on the railway network, based on the methods of graph theory and game theory, was proposed in this article. The developed model enables the evaluation of the possibilities of attracting transit freight traffic volumes by individual railway administrations by changing the tariff value and transportation conditions.

J	Tian, Y; Dong, YL; Ye, BJ; Wan, LL				Tian, Yong; Dong, Yunlong; Ye, Bojia; Wan, Lili			A Framework for the Assessment of Distributed Self-Separation Procedures for Air Traffic in Flow Corridors	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Airspace design; air transportation; flow corridors; self-separation operations; simulation modeling		The flow corridor is a tube-shape class of airspace designed for the future air transportation system, which aims to reduce complexity, restructuring the airspace to provide more system capacity. In order to support operational procedures design towards increased operational efficiency in the flow corridor, an accurate assessment of alternative procedures is a pre-requisite. This paper proposes a dynamic stochastic simulation framework including various microscopic behaviors for the assessment of distributed self-separation procedures for the air traffic in flowcorridors. We first specify three prominent self-separation modes which distinguish flow corridors from today's airways system, and present detailed self-separation procedures and algorithms in a parallel-lane flow corridor incorporating self-separating, lane-passing and lane-switch behaviors based on the aircraft dynamic model and the proportional derivative control theory. Then, incorporating these self-separation algorithms, a dynamic stochastic simulation modeling framework is constructed to assess and compare the alternative distributed self-separation procedures. The framework is applied to a parallel-lane flow corridor deployed from Beijing nearby airports (ZBAA, ZBTJ and ZBNY) to Guangzhou nearby airports (ZGGG, ZGSZ and ZGSD) in China, and the self-separation procedures were thoroughly assessed with both realistic and simulated data for benefits assessment and sensitivity analysis. Results show that the speed-based operational procedure is more suitable for high-density operations while the other two procedures have more flexibility which can be used for air traffic flow contingency management and/or trajectory management.

J	Huang, CM; Lin, TH; Tseng, KC				Huang, Chung-Ming; Lin, Tzu-Hua; Tseng, Kuan-Cheng			Data Dissemination of Application Service by Using Member-Centric Routing Protocol in a Platoon of Internet of Vehicle (IOV)	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						VANET; routing protocol; on-demand; Internet of Vehicle (IoV); data dissemination	MOBILITY; STRATEGY	In this paper, we proposed routing protocols for transmission over VANET in a platoon of vehicles that are driving together on the highway from the same starting point with the same route, and going to the same destination. The purpose of the routing protocols is to have cooperative video streaming service for a specific platoon member, i.e., it belongs to multiple-source to single-destination transmission. We considered two strategies that route data from multiple-source to single-destination. The first one is the severalty strategy in which each data source forwards packets through a route that contains common nodes of other paths as few as possible. The severalty strategy tries to increase the reliability of the route from source to destination and to achieve load balance by Helper-disjoint algorithm. The another strategy is the merged strategy which merges multiple traffic flows passing some specific nodes together. The main purpose of merged strategy tries to reduce the probability of collision while wireless resource are competing to forward data simultaneously and to increase the utilization of DSRC. In this paper, we proposed On-Demand Member-Centric Routing (OMR) protocol using the severalty strategy and Reactive Member-Centric Routing (RMCM) protocol using the merged strategy. Based on the simulation results, our proposed member-centric routing protocols effectively improve the packet delivery ratio and throughput compared with using others in the aforementioned platoon scenario over VANET.

But the complex spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics make this problem challenging. In this paper, a hybrid deep neural network prediction model based on convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) is proposed. For improving the prediction accuracy, the implicit correlation between travel time and OD flow is explored and they are combined as inputs of the prediction model. Moreover, in order to realize OD flows prediction at the road network level, and solve the problem that grid-based representation method cannot distinguish traffic flow at different heights, such as in multi-layer overpass areas, this paper presents a grid and road nested method to represent ODs. With the time of day partitioned into time slots, OD flows are extracted and predicted in both spatial and temporal domain In the experiment, real taxi data are used to verify the proposed model and prediction method fully. And the experimental results show that the proposed model can effectively predict city-wide taxi OD flow, and outperforms the typical time sequence models and existing deep neural network models.

J	Jin, YL; Gao, YW; Wang, P; Wang, J; Wang, L				Jin, Yinli; Gao, Yiwen; Wang, Ping; Wang, Jun; Wang, Lei			Improved Manpower Planning Based on Traffic Flow Forecast Using a Historical Queuing Model	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Manpower planning; toll gate; forecast; traffic flow; queuing model	PREDICTION; NETWORKS; FREEWAY	In order to promote travel safety and efficiency, many management staff are engaged to provide service to avoid long queues. Those manpower demands unavoidably introduce overstaffing, which is a great waste during off-peak period. However, it is not easy to precisely forecast the traffic flow to better arrange road management manpower and eliminate queuing phenomenon. In this paper, vehicle flow is first predicted with high accuracy based on the historical multi-source traffic data. The traffic data are collected for one month to establish a forecasting model. The forecasted traffic flow is tested on the following week and shows that the hourly traffic flow can be predicted in high accuracy. Improved manpower planning strategy is proposed based on the predicted results for arranging working schedule correspondingly. The proposed method is tested on a randomly selected toll gate in a real scenario as an example. A manpower planning strategy is verified with scheduled number of operating toll lanes. The improved manpower planning shows that the proposed method effectively reduces manpower by 40% at the toll gate and saves 67.5 working hours in one week compared with the current schedule. The successful application of the manpower planning method can be extended to other toll gates and service plazas to save manpower for more efficient and intelligent operation manner.

The dynamics are represented by a sequence of factor graphs, which enable learning of traffic dynamics from limited Lagrangian measurements using an efficient message passing technique. The approach ensures that estimated speeds and traffic densities are non-negative with probability one. The estimation technique is tested using vehicle trajectory datasets generated using an independent microscopic traffic simulator and is shown to efficiently reproduce traffic conditions with probe vehicle penetration levels as little as 10%. The proposed algorithm is also compared with state-of-the-art traffic state estimation techniques developed for the same purpose and it is shown that the proposed approach can outperform the state-of-the-art techniques in terms reconstruction accuracy.

However, control strategies adopted by commercially available ACC systems are the closely-guarded intellectual property of their industrial developers, so these are not publicly available and there is no uniform standard for ACC dynamic response. However, the impact of ACC dynamics on transport networks needs to be studied. In the open literature, there are many ACC systems published and embedded in simulation studies, nevertheless, inappropriate model design can easily point to misleading conclusions. Only a few projects dealing with automated systems are founded on real experimental data, which is important for developing precise ACC models and furthermore, evaluating their realistic effects on highway capacity and traffic flow dynamics This review firstly summarizes the available literature on control strategies for ACC systems implemented on experimental vehicles, then propose a five-layer framework for the development and evaluation of ACC or CACC control strategies based on future trends.

These factors are normally addressed when devising general and detailed urban plans. Such factors are normally used to assess the adverse effects resulting from motor vehicles dominating roads and highways, including environmental hazards, such as air and noise pollution. Moreover, they identify environmental impacts of road and traffic planning. The study focuses on environmental issues that can be considered and modeled in order to be included in all generalized plans. In this study, concentrations of CO, NO, TVOCs and SO were monitored periodically at various sampling sites. The study revealed that the concentration of air pollutants showed a high correlation with traffic flow and prevailing road gradients. The concentrations of SO2, NO2, CO and TVOCs were highly correlated to key traffic flow parameters, such as road gradient, vehicular speed and traffic volume.

Safety is a major factor discouraging people from cycling and it needs to be addressed in order to achieve any significant mode shifts away from private cars. One suggestion that has been put forward to improve the safety of cyclists is to provide a separate area for bikes at junctions. This study reviewed junction design and traffic flow conditions at an upgraded junction in Adelaide, Australia that contained bicycle signals and a storage zone. It was found that the bicycle lane could be designed in such way that would separate left and right turning bikes into two sections. Also, the provision of blue bicycle crossing lanes has a potential to improve cyclist safety by warning pedestrians and motorists of possible cyclist presence. The study also recommends smarter data collection and better traffic modelling to help test improved infrastructure and enable the development of better policies regarding the safety of cyclists.

The traffic flow in a city generally changes over time periods but always exhibits certain periodicity. Previous works focused on modeling spatial and temporal correlations using convolutional and recurrent neural networks respectively. Typically, a method that can effectively absorb more time-interval inputs and integrate more periodic information will achieve better performance. In this paper, we propose a Frequency-aware Spatio-temporal Network (FASTNet) for traffic flow prediction. In addition to modeling the spatio-temporal correlations, we dynamically filter the inputs to explicitly incorporate frequency information for traffic prediction. By applying Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) on traffic flow, we obtain the spectrum of traffic flow sequence which reflects certain travel patterns of passengers. We then adopt a frequency-based filtering mechanism to filter the traffic flow series based on the explored spectrum information. To utilize the filtered tensor, a 3D convolutional network is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features automatically. Inspired by the frequency spectrum of traffic flows, this spatio-temporal convolutional network has various kernels with different sizes on temporal dimension, which models the temporal correlations with multi-scale frequencies. The final prediction layer summarizes the spatio-temporal features extracted by the spatio-temporal convolutional network. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods through extensive experiments on three real datasets for citywide traffic flow prediction.

Management of Urban Traffic Flow Based on Traffic Lights Scheduling Optimization	IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS			Portuguese	Article						Metaheuristics; Optimization; Simulation; Traffic lights scheduling	DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION; ALGORITHM; SCHEME	The automobile has become an essential element in the daily life of people. In the urban traffic network, an intersection is the "bottleneck point" of road network capacity. Most cities in Latin America have a traditional single control system or none. In this context, adequate programming of the traffic light cycles helps to reduce vehicles' waiting time and improve traffic flow. In this paper, we compare five metaheuristics to minimize vehicles' waiting time and maximize the velocity of vehicles in two real scenarios of Argentina and Uruguay. Analysis of experimental results shows that the proposed model optimizes the vehicular flow in a multiple-junction urban traffic network with different topologies and traffic flow.

The control input is the value of the time-gap setting of ACC-equipped and connected vehicles, which gives rise to a problem of control of a 2 x 2 nonlinear system of first-order hyperbolic PDEs with in-domain actuation. The feedback law is designed in order to stabilize the linearized system, around a uniform, congested equilibrium profile. Stability of the closed-loop system under the developed control law is shown constructing a Lyapunov functional. The performance improvement of the closed-loop system under the proposed strategy is illustrated in simulation, also employing four different metrics, which quantify the performance in terms of fuel consumption, total travel time, and comfort.

The objective of the optimization problem is to guarantee the maximum traffic flow, which contains both autonomous and human-driven vehicles. A control-oriented modeling of the mixed traffic flow dynamics is presented, which is based on the law of conservation and the fundamental relationship. As a novelty, the formulation of the fundamental relationship includes the ratio of the autonomous vehicles. Then the constrained optimal task of the coordination strategy is developed based on the minimax principle. In the strategy the inflows of the controlled ramps, traffic density and the ratio of the autonomous vehicles are taken into consideration. The efficiency of the coordination strategy is examined through a simulation example using the VisSim traffic simulator. It is illustrated that the proposed coordination strategy is able to guarantee the maximum outflow performance of the freeway at mixed traffic.

However, it is very challenging since the traffic flows usually show high nonlinearities and complex patterns. Most existing traffic flow prediction methods, lacking abilities of modeling the dynamic spatial-temporal correlations of traffic data, thus cannot yield satisfactory prediction results. In this paper, we propose a novel attention based spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ASTGCN) model to solve traffic flow forecasting problem. ASTGCN mainly consists of three independent components to respectively model three temporal properties of traffic flows, i.e., recent, daily-periodic and weekly-periodic dependencies. More specifically, each component contains two major parts: 1) the spatial-temporal attention mechanism to effectively capture the dynamic spatial temporal correlations in traffic data; 2) the spatial-temporal convolution which simultaneously employs graph convolutions to capture the spatial patterns and common standard convolutions to describe the temporal features. The output of the three components are weighted fused to generate the final prediction results. Experiments on two real-world datasets from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) demonstrate that the proposed ASTGCN model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

Besides being as an important problem that affects people's daily life in commuting, traffic signal control poses its unique challenges for reinforcement learning in terms of adapting to dynamic traffic environment and coordinating thousands of agents including vehicles and pedestrians. A key factor in the success of modern reinforcement learning relies on a good simulator to generate a large number of data samples for learning. The most commonly used open-source traffic simulator SUMO is, however, not scalable to large road network and large traffic flow, which hinders the study of reinforcement learning on traffic scenarios. This motivates us to create a new traffic simulator CityFlow with fundamentally optimized data structures and efficient algorithms. CityFlow can support flexible definitions for road network and traffic flow based on synthetic and real-world data. It also provides user-friendly interface for reinforcement learning. Most importantly, CityFlow is more than twenty times faster than SUMO and is capable of supporting city-wide traffic simulation with an interactive render for monitoring. Besides traffic signal control, CityFlow could serve as the base for other transportation studies and can create new possibilities to test machine learning methods in the intelligent transportation domain.

The purpose of the control strategy is to consider differences in the longitudinal driving characteristics of autonomous and human-driven vehicles. In the paper the modeling of the heterogeneous traffic flow based on the results of the VISSIM traffic simulator is presented. The traffic model yielded is in a Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) form. The control design is based on the Takagi-Sugeno methodology, in which the performances, the constraints of the ramp-controlled interventions and the uncertainties are incorporated. The design task leads to an optimization with Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) constraints. The result of the method is the optimal intervention of the freeway ramps with which traffic inflow can be controlled.

Current solutions are based on the utilization of static priorities (i.e. yield signs), on variable signaling like traffic lights, or even on the physical modification of the road structures by transforming intersections in roundabouts. The emergence, evolution, and consolidation of technologies that enable the paradigm of connected and autonomous vehicles have allowed the development of new solutions where the vehicles' coordination follow a preset path without stopping when entering the intersections. In this work, we propose using a genetic algorithm with variable-length chromosomes to solve the vehicle coordination multipath problem in intersections. The proposed algorithm is focused on optimizing the vehicles' arrival sequencing according to preset flow rates. While other solutions assume the same flow rates in every branch of the intersection, in our proposal the traffic flows can be asymmetric. We extend one of the existent intersection models, based on fixed paths, to allow multiple paths. This means that each vehicle can go from any input point to any output branch in the intersection. Moreover, we have designed specific selection, crossover and mutation operators, and a new methodology to carry out the crossover function between different sized individuals, which are adapted to the specific peculiarities of the problem. Our proposal has been validated by carrying out tests using input data with known solutions and with random data. The results have been compared with systems based on other optimizers, obtaining improved results in the fitness outcome up to 9.1%, and up to 126% in computation time.

However, predicting short-term traffic conditions on a large-scale road network is challenging due to the complex spatio-temporal dependencies found in traffic data. Previous studies used Euclidean proximity or topological adjacency to explore the spatial correlation of traffic flows, but did not consider the higher-order connectivity patterns exhibited in a road network, which have a significant influence on traffic propagation. Meanwhile, traffic sequences display distinct multiple time-frequency properties, yet few researchers have made full use of this resource. To fill this gap, we propose a novel hybrid framework - Wavelet-based Higher-order Spatial-Temporal method (Wavelet-HST) to accurately predict network-scale traffic speeds. Wavelet-HST first uses discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to decompose raw traffic data into several components with different frequency sub-bands. Then a motif-based graph convolutional recurrent neural network (Motif-GCRNN) is proposed to learn the higher-order spatio-temporal dependencies of traffic speeds from low-frequency components, and auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) models are employed to simulate random fluctuations from the high-frequency components. We evaluate the framework on a traffic dataset collected in Chengdu, China, and experimental results demonstrate that Wavelet-HST outperforms six state-of-art prediction methods by an improvement of 7.8% -10.5% in the root mean square error.

The most promising area of research in the subject area is the development and use of intelligent transport systems. Such systems enable intelligent interaction with single vehicles or with the traffic flow as a whole through information and telecommunication technologies in order to increase the efficiency of land transport and improve road safety. The process of creation and application of automatic information and telecommunication systems for monitoring the movement of vehicles is usually associated with the problem of assessing their effectiveness. The article presents a model for evaluating the effectiveness of automatic information and telecommunication systems for monitoring the movement of vehicles, which allows to quantify the effectiveness of their application. A feature of these systems is their service nature. The technique of optimal application of technical means of control in the field of road safety in the operation of the system "driver-car-road" is presented. The results of the study of the various factors influencing determining the number of road accidents in the Russian Federation region are presented. The criteria of functioning efficiency of automatic systems of vehicle movement control taking into account the probabilistic nature of system-forming factors are offered. The perspective directions of the control function at operation of vehicles on the basis of use of the systems of automatic control are proved. The scheme of development of multipurpose systems of automatic control of vehicle movement is presented.

Using this technology as a means for assessing traffic is very cost-effective and has a low impact on the infrastructure. Nevertheless, unlike other techniques, it does not provide direct sensing of vehicles only. Statistical analysis methods need to be applied to the collected data. In this paper, we first propose a machine learning method for traffic flow estimation using Bluetooth sensors. We also propose a method for estimating the mean travel speed between two sensors. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated through eight weeks of experimentation. Finally, we envision a potential solution for building real-time Origin-Destination matrices.

ITS networks are comprised of the Internet-connected vehicles (mobile nodes), roadside units (RSU), cellular base stations and conventional core network routers to create a complete data transmission platform that provides real-time traffic information and enable prediction of future traffic conditions. However, the heterogeneity and complexity of the underlying ITS networks raise new challenges in intrusion prevention of mobile network nodes and detection of security attacks due to such highly vulnerable mobile nodes. In this paper, we consider a new type of security attack referred to as crossfire attack, which involves a large number of compromised nodes that generate low-intensity traffic in a temporally coordinated fashion such that target links or hosts (victims) are disconnected from the rest of the network. Detection of such attacks is challenging since the attacking traffic flows are indistinguishable from the legitimate flows. With the support of software-defined networking that enables dynamic network monitoring and traffic characteristic extraction, we develop a machine learning model that can learn the temporal correlation among traffic flows traversing in the ITS network, thus differentiating legitimate flows from coordinated attacking flows. We use different deep learning algorithms to train the model and study the performance using Mininet-WiFi emulation platform.

To explore the characteristics of energy demand, we first analyze the daily trajectory of taxis in different regions and find different fluctuating features of daily energy demand. Then, we establish the WCL power supply model to obtain the wireless charging supply situation in line with the real urban traffic condition, which is the first work considering the influence of traffic lights on charging situation. To ensure minimum deployment cost and to coordinate the contradiction between regional energy supply-demand balance and overall supply-demand matching, we formulate optimization problems ensuring the charge-energy consumption ratio of vehicles. In addition, we rank the priority of WCL efficiency to reduce the complexity of solution and solve the Mixed Integer NonLinear Programming (MINLP) problem to determine deployment plan. Compared with the baseline, the proposed method has significantly improved the effect.

As an important part of intelligent transportation system, traffic guidance system and traffic control system play a great role in improving road congestion, Therefore, the short-time traffic flow prediction is of great significance to urban traffic system. Based on the investigation of traffic flow characteristics, we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of available short-time traffic flow forecasting methods. In view of the nonlinear, time-varying and uncertain characteristics of traffic flow, wavelet neural network is selected as the traffic flow forecasting model combining the self-learning and self-adaptive characteristics of neural network. To solve the problem of short-time prediction and accuracy of traffic conditions, wavelet basis is used as the characteristic function of pattern recognition to optimize the parameter and error space of traditional BP neural network, the short-time prediction of traffic state is realized. In this paper, the wavelet neural network model is established, the traffic flow sample set is constructed, the sample data is trained to convergence, and a certain number of sample data are selected for testing. The test results show that the wavelet neural network not only has high prediction accuracy but also has fast convergence speed, good real-time performance, and has certain application value.

The communication between the infrastructures and the vehicles (I2V), between vehicles (V2V) and from the vehicles to the infrastructures (V2I) is performed through Visible Light Communication (VLC) using the street lamps and the traffic signaling LEDs to broadcast the information. Vehicle headlamps are used to transmit data to other vehicles or infrastructures (traffic lights) allowing digital safety and data privacy. As receivers and decoders, pin/pin SiC Wavelength Division Multiplex (WDM) photodetectors, with light filtering properties, are being used. We propose the use of white polychromatic-LEDs to implement the WDM. This allows modulating separate data streams on four colors which together multiplex to white light. When a probe vehicle enters the infrastructure's capture range, the receivers respond to light signal and the infrastructure ID and traffic message are assigned. They perform simultaneously the V2V distance measurement and data transmission functions and, using the headlamps, resend the data to the other vehicles or to the traffic signals (V2I). A I2V2V2I traffic scenario is stablished. A vulnerable road user case that covers pedestrians, cyclists and wheelchairs is also considered. A phasing traffic flow is developed as a Proof of Concept (PoC). The experimental results confirm that the cooperative vehicular VLC architecture is a promising approach concerning communications between road infrastructures and cars, fulfilling data privacy.

It studies the characteristics of traffic flow in Shenzhen and the overall distribution of congestion duration. The results demonstrate that there is a strong correlation between flow and speed, which have obvious characteristics of morning and evening peak within a day, and the flow and speed show significant differences between work days and non-work days. As for the congestion duration of each road, they are generally under 16 minutes. Specifically, when the congestion duration is less than 8 minutes, there is a high probability that the congestion state ends; while the congestion lasts more than 10 minutes, the congestion status is less likely to end in a short time. In view of the above analysis, it is recommended that relevant departments strengthen monitoring and control of real-time road traffic so that the traffic environment in Shenzhen can be improved.

This paper proposes a hybrid method combing clustering methods and spatiotemporal correlation to predict future traffic trends based on artificial neural network. First, for the traffic flow collected from different loop detectors, a spatio-temporal correlation of data samples is evaluated by considering time correlation and spatial equivalent distance. Second, in order to improve classifying performance and reliability to anomalous data samples, a type-2 fuzzy c-means (FCM) is adopted to make fuzzification of the membership function. Then, a hybrid prediction model combined classification algorithm and neural network is designed to predict various patterns or trends in traffic flowdata. Furthermore, the results from the prediction model are modified according to quantized spatio-temporal correlation. Finally, traffic volume data collected from the highway is used to optimize the parameter in the prediction model combination. Several traditional models are used as candidates in comparison, and the higher prediction accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness and feasibility of the hybrid prediction model.

The increasing number of motor vehicles, lack of space availability on roads, and road side activities can cause congestion. The purpose of this research was to analyze the road network performance and vehicle exhaust emissions on the road networks of Beringin Janggut area of Palembang through traffic simulation using Vissim software and vehicle exhaust emission calculation using EnViver software, and the results were compared with ambient air measurement results at the research location, as well as providing alternative solutions to existing traffic condition. The outputs of Vissim software on the existing condition showed a long queue on traffic flow from Kolonel Atmo 2 street to the Masjid Lama 2 street with a value of 130.51 m, and there was a long delay on traffic flow from Kolonel Atmo 1 street to Rustam TP Effendi street (Southward) total of 105.37 seconds / vehicle. The EnViver software output showed the highest concentration for carbon dioxide (CO2) pollutant of 181,000 mu g / Nm(3), the highest concentration for nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollutant of 534 mu g / m(3), and the highest concentration for Particulate Matter (PM10) pollutant of 36 mu g / Nm(3). From the EnViver software outputs, the results showed the highest concentration of Particulate Matter air pollutants (PM10) from direct ambient air measurement at the research location had a difference of 79 mu g / Nm(3). The existing concentrations of air pollutants resulting from EnViver software output and ambient air measurements on the road network of Beringin Janggut area were still below the ambient air quality standard limits set in Government Regulation No. 41/1999 on Air Pollution Control. Alternative 1 with parking rearrangement was better than alternative 2 with the lanes separation between public and private vehicles in improving road network performance and reducing total emission values due to vehicle exhaust emission from existing conditions.

J	Mou, LT; Zhao, PF; Xie, HT; Chen, YY				Mou, Luntian; Zhao, Pengfei; Xie, Haitao; Chen, Yanyan			T-LSTM: A Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network Enhanced by Temporal Information for Traffic Flow Prediction	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Traffic flow prediction; missing data repair; temporal features; deep learning; LSTM	DEEP BELIEF NETWORKS; MODELS; SYSTEMS	Short-term traffic flow prediction is one of the most important issues in the field of intelligent transportation systems. It plays an important role in traffic information service and traffic guidance. However, complex traffic systems are highly nonlinear and stochastic, making short-term traffic flow prediction a challenging issue. Although long short-term memory (LSTM) has a good performance in traffic flow prediction, the impact of temporal features on prediction has not been exploited by existing studies. In this paper, a temporal information enhancing LSTM (T-LSTM) is proposed to predict traffic flow of a single road section. In view of the similar characteristics of traffic flow at the same time each day, the model can improve prediction accuracy by capturing the intrinsic correlation between traffic flow and temporal information. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively improve the prediction performance and obtain higher accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we propose a novel missing data processing technique based on T-LSTM. According to the experimental results, this technique can well restore the characteristics of original data and improve the accuracy of traffic flow prediction.

J	Das, S; Maurya, AK; Budhkar, AK				Das, Sanhita; Maurya, Akhilesh Kumar; Budhkar, Anuj Kishor			Determinants of time headway in staggered car-following conditions	TRANSPORTATION LETTERS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH			English	Article						Time headway; centerline separation; mixed traffic; heterogeneous; car-following		Precise understanding of the factors affecting the choice of following time headway in staggered car-following conditions is essential on the part of traffic modelers to provide a detailed representation of traffic flow, which has a predominant role in microsimulation model development, safety evaluation, capacity estimation and evaluation of traffic management strategies. Using trajectory data from video recordings, an evaluation of the impact of a number of factors (i.e. road width, centerline separation, lead vehicle type) on the following headway of a driver is undertaken in this study. A seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model for time headways is also developed to examine the correlation of headways with different determinants and speeds of following vehicles. Results of the study suggest that though there is a direct relationship between speed and headway, the extent of off-centeredness between the interacting pair and vehicle type-specific interactions need to be considered to develop mixed-traffic microsimulation models.

PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN TRAFFIC FLOW SYSTEMS FOR ODM VEHICLES	2019 INTEGRATED COMMUNICATIONS, NAVIGATION AND SURVEILLANCE CONFERENCE (ICNS)	Integrated Communications Navigation and Surveillance Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS)	APR 09-11, 2019	Herndon, VA					The continuously increasing interest toward using personal cars in cities with high population is causing more traffic congestion and gridlocks each day. Urban Air Mobility is a rapidly growing concept with the promise of alleviating the traffic on the ground by moving parts of urban transportation to the air. One of the challenges of the urban air mobility is addressing of the On-Demand Mobility vehicles. This paper analyzes this challenge and also suggests practical solutions. The analysis is based on a Monte-Carlo stochastic model that was developed specifically to assess ODM-vehicles traffic patterns and predict possible high-demand periods. Moreover, multiple scenarios of possible policies and flexibilities along with their traffic-flow patterns will be presented. Their impact on the allowed flight time will be discussed. The associated simulation results are provided to enable exploring the most appropriate number of addresses needed to accommodate the maximum number of cars for different cases.

The estimation of the truck flow of various types could be better to identify the irregular flow variation introduced by various trucks and quantitatively assessed the corresponding road risks. In this paper, the dynamics of truck flow are estimated first. The stochastic and uncertain trucks flow data are obtained in terms of small, medium, heavy, and the oversize truck type and regulated corresponding flow in the time series within five minutes. In order to dig the spatial-temporal correlations behind those data, the deep learning-based method is improved on the basis of the gated recurrent unit (GRU) to estimate the truck flow for various types. To quantitatively assess the truck-related effect for road risk, a multiple logistic regression method is further proposed to classify into safe, risky, and dangerous road risks levels. Different risk level could guide the traffic control and management and traffic information that broadcast drivers to help them to choose travel route. The proposed prediction of the road risk is tested in the randomly selected road segment and shows superior compared to other methods. This could promote road safety in the development of intelligent transport system (ITS).

J	Zhao, M; Wang, SH; Sun, DH; Wang, XJ				Zhao, Min; Wang, Shi-Hui; Sun, Dihua; Wang, Xuan-Jin			A Car-Following Model Considering Preceding Vehicle's Lane-Changing Process	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Car-following model; lane-changing behavior; multi-lane traffic; lateral separations; NGSIM	TRAFFIC FLOW; BEHAVIOR	Car following and lane changing are two common driving behaviors in the traffic flow. Preceding vehicle's lane changing is affected by the surroundings and will have a greater influence on the followers' driving decision. The existing car-following theory does not fully take it into consideration that the followers' driving behavior may change during a lane-changing process. In order to reflect the driving decision in a complex traffic flow more precisely, the influence on the following vehicle during the preceding vehicle's lane-changing process is studied. First, the different types of stimulus during the preceding vehicle's lane-merging (LM) process and the space gain effect produced by the preceding vehicle's lane-passing (LP) behavior are analyzed. Then, the LM-FVDM and LP-FVDM are proposed based on the classical car-following model-FVD model. Finally, the linear stability theory, numerical simulation, and NGSIM data sets are used to analyze and validate the performance of the LM-FVDM and LP-FVDM. The numerical simulation results show that the model can reasonably reflect the driving decision of the following vehicle in various scenarios, and verification based on NGSIM shows that the R-squared of vehicles' speed and distance is significantly better than the FVD model, which can more effectively reflect the speed adjustment process of the following vehicle during the preceding vehicle's lane-changing process in the real traffic flow.

Some PD indexes are defined considering the influence of traffic efficiency, but it is unpractical to calculate them out due to their complex processes. We quantify the impact of the cohesive whole of PD points on the traffic flow and also define the corresponding PD index which is easy to compute. Firstly, the lane cell based on the idea of road discretization is introduced. Secondly, the PD degree for the lane cell is defined by the reduction of the average vehicle speed given the same flow condition. The cell whose PD degree is larger than 0 is defined as the PD cell. Then, considering (1) the ratio of PD cells, (2) PD cell distribution, and (3) the influence of the vehicle lane changing, we define the holistic road-damage degree (HRDD) as the PD index. At last, the relationship among HRDD, flow speed, and flow volume is analyzed through the simulated experiments. The results show that (1) the average speed is inversely proportional to HRDD, and the reduction of vehicle speed is more significant with the increase of the traffic flow input; (2) the inverse relation between road capacity and HRDD can be seen on the whole HRDD range. In another word, the proposed HRDD describes the change of traffic efficiency indeed.

To ensure the safety of such systems, we are working on technology for detecting and responding to cyber attacks via malicious information transmission against CITS. In this demonstration, the following two scenarios are visualized based on the assumption that a service providing the optimum route using sensor-probe information will be implemented in the near future. In the first scenario, using simulations of the Tokyo Metropolitan Expressway traffic flow, we show the potential threats of false-data-injection attacks on transmitted sensor information. In the second scenario, we show that our new detect-and-respond technology can mitigate these threats.

Media and car-manufacturing companies predict that connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) would be available in the near future. However, society and transportation systems might not be completely ready for their implementation in various aspects, e.g., public acceptance, technology, infrastructure, and/or policy. Since the empirical field data for CAVs are not available at present, many researchers develop micro or macro simulation models to evaluate the CAV impacts. This study classifies the most commonly used intelligent-vehicle types into four categories (i.e., adaptive cruise control, ACC; cooperative adaptive cruise control, CACC; automated vehicle, AV; CAV) and summarizes the intelligent-vehicle car-following models (i.e., Intelligent Driver Model, IDM; MICroscopic Model for Simulation of Intelligent Cruise Control, MIXIC). The review results offer new insights for future intelligent-vehicle analyses: (i) the increase in the market-penetration rate of intelligent vehicles has a significant impact on traffic flow conditions; (ii) without vehicle connections, such as the ACC vehicles, the roadway-capacity increase would be marginal; (iii) none of the parameters in the AV or CAV models is calibrated by the actual field data; (iv) both longitudinal and lateral movements of intelligent vehicles can reduce energy consumption and environmental costs compared to human-driven vehicles; (v) research gap exists in studying the car-following models for newly developed intelligent vehicles; and (vi) the estimated impacts are not converted into a unified metric (i.e., welfare economic impact on users or society) which is essential to evaluate intelligent vehicles from an overall societal perspective.

A composite rank measure based on principal component analysis for hotspot identification on highways	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION SAFETY & SECURITY			English	Article						hotspot identification (HSID) measures; principal component analysis; crash data; injury severity; crash frequency; empirical Bayes; blackspots; accident prone locations; high accident locations; hotspots		Identification of hotspots or high-crash locations on highways is important to ensure public safety and minimize loss of life, risk of injury and/or trauma; reduce crash cost to society; and any interruption to traffic flow. Many performance measures are available for use in identification of hotspots. Current performance measures, however, suffer from lack of accounting for traffic volume, crash injury severity, justification of weights used for ranking of sites, and issues with statistical distribution of crash data. This article proposes a composite rank measure based on principal component analysis to overcome limitations of existing measures for network screening. The results of a proposed measure called Composite Principal Rank Measure (CPRM) is demonstrated with interstate, U.S. and state highway data and compared against the commonly used sum-of-rank (SOR) measure. CPRM and SOR are evaluated based on several empirical and simulated data tests. CPRM was found to be robust and outperformed the SOR measure and is recommended for identification of hotspots. To ensure extensive evaluation of the measures, the entire highway routes are examined in this article.	[Bham, Ghulam H.] Univ Alaska, Fairbanks, AK 99775 USA; [Manepalli, Uday R.

Stability of a Complex Traffic Flow Problem: A Delay-Dependent Perturbation Filter Design	PROCEEDINGS OF 2019 8TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT (ICITM 2019)			English	Proceedings Paper	8th International Conference on Industrial Technology and Management (ICITM)	MAR 02-04, 2019	Cambridge, ENGLAND	IEEE		Augmented Lyapunov-Krasoviskii function (ALKF); complex networks estimation filter design moving-block train perturbation traffic flow traffic modeling	ELECTROMECHANICAL OSCILLATIONS; SYSTEMS	Complex traffic flow is a huge concern towards achieving an efficient transportation system. It involves handling all the operational issues and effects while regulating the traffic system. These operational issues also have situation of uncertainties and vagueness. In this paper, the uncertainties in the form of perturbation have been the focus of study in the theory of traffic. To achieve that, the moving-block train model has been utilized for the perturbation analysis. Firstly, a delay-dependent moving-block model is represented. This model considered the dynamics of position and velocity in the perturbation modeling of system. These dynamics have been extracted from a measurement sensor. Secondly, an augmented Lyapunov-Krasoviskii function (ALKF) is built on this model for the realization of feasible region of stability. Numerical evaluations were made on a moving block model. Results showed an effective implementation of the proposed scheme.	[Khalid, Haris M.; Al Blushi, Ishaq G.

Because of the large differences between the average noise values and the maximum ones, scaling factors enabling one to convert annual average values into the highest annual averages have been developed. The time range favourable for conducting sampling measurements ensuring the reliable estimation of annual average and highest annual average of the road traffic noise level has been determined. Moreover, factors for scaling the annual average daily traffic (for all vehicles and heavy vehicles, respectively), with a division into two daily periods, have been developed. The scaling factors make it possible to determine the noise level when no direct measurement of traffic intensity can be carried out. The analyses were made using data from 25 automatic traffic recorders (ATRs), equipped with state-of-the-art SICK and Golden river vehicle counters, located on national interurban expressways (class A and S roads).

In order to solve these problems, a lot of attempts have been carried out in many areas including new type of traffic signal system employing fuzzy control or neural network system. In addition to that system, a visualized miniature traffic simulation system based on real road system has been developed to examine the performance of the new traffic signal system and its effectiveness has been proved in several problems, which cannot sufficiently model that is able to reproduce the real traffic behaviors. In this study, a traffic flow measurement system has been developed to extract traffic flow data by analyzing images from the fixed point cameras set up near intersections. The measurement system has been developed by optical flow and R-CNN, and its performance was evaluated based on the recognition rate of the number of cars passing the intersection and the recognition rate of matching for same vehicle and the accuracy of the means speed estimated by the difference of passage time at two intersections. The result showed that the new system has higher rate of matching for same vehicle than previous study.

Research into the dynamics of railway track capacities in a model for organizing cargo transportation between two node stations	BIZNES INFORMATIKA-BUSINESS INFORMATICS			English	Article						station; railway track; organization of cargo transportation; mathematical model; differential equations; dynamics; numerical realization	TRAFFIC FLOW	The article deals with a model for organizing railway transportation on a long stretch of road between two node stations connected by a large number of intermediate stations. Between two arbitrary neighboring stations, there is a railway track for temporary storage of cargo. The movement of cargo is carried out in one direction. To ensure the smooth movement of cargo, two technologies are used which are common for all stations. The first technology is based on the procedure of interaction of a station with both neighboring stations and adjacent railway tracks. The second technology uses the technical capabilities of the station itself and is based on the interaction of the station with neighboring railway tracks. For cargo transportation, a simple control system is used which provides for measuring the volume of transported goods at neighboring stations with a single time lag. This work is devoted to describing and studying the dynamics of the number of roads involved in the railway tracks. For this purpose, a system of differential equations is formed, the right parts of which are functions of variables describing the dynamics of the number of roads involved in the stations. The starting point for this study is previously obtained results from studying the dynamics of the number of tracks involved in the stations (a brief description of these results is given in the Introduction). What follows is the description of the dynamics of the number of roads involved in the railway tracks. Possible variants of the dynamics (growth of the number of the roads involved on one railway tracks and falling on others) and their dependence on parameters of the model are investigated. We also study the dependence of the rate of change in the number of involved roads on the railway tracks on the model parameters. We then find the parameter of control by which it is possible to provide arbitrarily small speed of growth (fall) of the number of the roads involved on all railway tracks.

J	Li, B; Cheng, W; Bie, YM; Sun, B				Li, Bing; Cheng, Wei; Bie, Yiming; Sun, Bin			Capacity of Advance Right-Turn Motorized Vehicles at Signalized Intersections for Mixed Traffic Conditions	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							RELIABILITY	Right-turn motorized vehicles turn right using channelized islands, which are used to improve the capacity of intersections. For ease of description, these kinds of right-turn motorized vehicles are called advance right-turn motorized vehicles (ARTMVs) in this paper. The authors analyzed four aspects of traffic conflict involving ARTMVs with other forms of traffic flow. A capacity model of ARTMVs is presented here using shockwave theory and gap acceptance theory. The proposed capacity model was validated by comparison to the results of the observations based on data collected at a single intersection with channelized islands in Kunming, the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) model and the VISSIM simulation model. To facilitate engineering applications, the relationship describing the capacity of the ARTMVs with reference to the distance between the conflict zone and the stop line and the relationship describing the capacity of the ARTMVs with reference to the effective red time of the nonmotorized vehicles moving in the same direction were analyzed. The authors compared these results to the capacity of no advance right-turn motorized vehicles (NARTMVs). The results show that the capacity of the ARTMVs is more sensitive to the changes in the arrival rate of nonmotorized vehicles when the arrival rate of the nonmotorized vehicles is 500(veh/h)similar to 2000(veh/h) than when the arrival rate is some other value. In addition, the capacity of NARTMVs is greater than the capacity of ARTMVs when the nonmotorized vehicles have a higher arrival rate.

The current impedance calculation is mostly based on BPR function, and the BPR function is derived from macroscopic statistical laws, in which the microscopic characteristics of traffic flow are insufficiently described. In order to more accurately express the change laws of traffic impedance at the microscopic level, a stochastic dynamic traffic assignment algorithm based on road impedance function is designed to analyze the time impedance of congested roads under random dynamic traffic assignment under different conditions of road network saturation. Compared with the current model, the comprehensiveness and portability are greatly improved. The results show that the impedance calculation error of this method is less than 10% when the load degree of the road is lower than 0.85, which proves that the method has good precision under unsaturated flow conditions.

In this study, we overcome the restriction of both time and space by introducing an online version of the principal component analysis (PCA), called the projection approximation subspace tracking with deflation (PASTd) algorithm. The algorithm is implemented to derive core traffic patterns of traffic flow data of Baltimore, Maryland, US. The k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) method is applied to predict the values of these core traffic patterns in the near future. Thus, the traffic information of Baltimore County can be forecasted with linear complexity and traffic congestion can be traced with little latency. Unlike traditional traffic prediction methods, our method aims at network-level prediction, regardless of urban or freeway road segments. The results show that our forecasting method is efficient, flexible, and robust.

The critical points of the transport system are connections of individual transport networks, eg road and rail. Most of the places where road and rail routes intersect are implemented in the form of road and rail crossings. This type of connection is a collision solution that often contributes to the disruption of traffic flow in road transport. The article analyzes a specific combination of road and rail infrastructure within the city of Poznan. The assessment was aimed at checking whether, for example the knowledge about a closed road-rail level crossing and changing the route of journey by road transport means can contribute to shortening the travel time.

Microscopic feedback control strategies are designed at the level of vehicle-to-vehicle interactions and then upscaled to the global flow via a kinetic approach based on a Boltzmann-type equation. Then first and second order hydrodynamic traffic models, which naturally embed the microscopic control strategies, are consistently derived from the kinetic-controlled framework via suitable closure methods. Several numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of such a hierarchical approach at the various scales.

The problem of weak is integration and generalization. An improved Hidden Markov Model for traffic flow prediction is proposed to more effectively fit the actual urban road intersection traffic flow. In the calculation of the negative log-likelihood function, an Akaike information criterion (AIC) or a Bayesian information criterion (BIC) penalty term is added, and the Baum-Welch algorithm is combined to optimize the optimal state number of the model. Experiments are carried out based on the collected real traffic flow and GPS feature data. The results show that the optimized hidden Markov model is superior to the original model in the accuracy and generalization ability of traffic flow prediction.

Most of the existing studies are based on measurements from passive samplers collected for 24 h, which may not be representative of conditions where pollutant concentrations (particles or gases) fluctuate or are not homogeneous, such as transport-related pollution. The goal of this paper is to explore the transport-generated pollution by examining short-time correlations between traffic flows, pollutant concentrations and meteorological parameters. To do that, statistical relationships among all variables were analyzed, which revealed that PM10, NO2 and SO2 concentration levels are influenced by vehicular traffic, mainly with low-speed winds blowing perpendicular to the street axis. Furthermore, southeast and northeast winds force drag pollution from sources other than traffic. These conclusions depend on the specific conditions of the summer season at the measurement area. A more complete analysis could be conducted when more data becomes available for each season.

The dynamic growth of maritime time series has the predominantly complex, and nonlinear and non-stationary properties. To guarantee high-quality prediction performance, we propose to first adopt the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and ensemble EMD (EEMD) methods to decompose the original time series into high- and low-frequency components. The low-frequency components can be easily predicted directly through traditional neural network (NN) methods. It is more difficult to predict high-frequency components due to their properties of weak mathematical regularity. To take advantage of the inherent self-similarities within high-frequency components, these components will be divided into several continuous small (overlapping) segments. The grouped segments with high similarities are then selected to form more proper training datasets for traditional NN methods. This regrouping strategy can assist in enhancing the prediction accuracy of high-frequency components. The final prediction result is obtained by integrating the predicted high- and low-frequency components. Our proposed three-step prediction frameworks benefit from the time series decomposition and similar segments grouping. The experiments on both port cargo throughput and vessel traffic flow have illustrated its superior performance in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness.

Bi-level Hybrid Algorithm for Greener Environment via Vehicular Networks in a Single Intersection	JOURNAL OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Vehicular communication; Improved hybrid algorithm; Bi-level optimization; Greener environment	PROGRAMMING APPROACH; EMISSIONS	In this paper, we propose a bi-level optimization model (BLOM) with improved hybrid metaheuristics. The hybrid GA and PSO algorithm is applied in both upper-level and lower-level model. This improved hybrid algorithm differs from the general hybrid algorithm which GA or PSO is applied in the single upper-level or lower-level model. BLOM is intended to schedule the phases of each isolated traffic signal and eco-driving environmentally. The upper-level optimization model (ULOM) considers the real-time traffic characteristics of the traffic flows near the signalized road intersection. At the same time, vehicles in the lower-level optimization model (LLOM) retrieve the real-time traffic signals using vehicular networks. Then, the traffic signals update the schedule and the vehicles are optimized motion states for greener environment factor respectively. We evaluate the performance of BLOM in a single road intersection using OMNET++ and SUMO. From the simulation results, we conclude that the BLOM with improved hybrid algorithm reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions compared with Maximize Throughput Model (MaxTM). Moreover, compared with the ordinary single algorithm, the proposed improved hybrid algorithm decreases the average operation cycle.

Relatively, limited research has been done on the lane utilization and lane choice behavior of different vehicle types on Indian expressways. This study thus focuses on building a structural equation model to study the influence of different vehicle categories and stream speed on lane utilization of Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway and further develop three lane choice models using lane utilization factor, class of vehicles, and stream speed as independent variables.The three lane choice models are validated with observed lane wise traffic composition and lane discipline. From the sensitivity analysis of parameters affecting lane choice, it is observed that stream speed and class of vehicle significantly affect the drivers' lane choice behavior. The results of this study in the form of lane utilization and lane discipline behavior by different vehicle types are used to differentiate the expressway traffic characteristics from other road types in India. The findings are also helpful in developing and calibrating the microscopic simulation models for Indian expressways.

In this paper, a prediction model based on deep cyclic network (RNN) is proposed. The feature data are extracted from the data of the relevant time as the reference standard to predict the traffic at the future time.

J	Duan, HM; Xiao, XP				Duan, Huiming; Xiao, Xinping			A Multimode Dynamic Short-Term Traffic Flow Grey Prediction Model of High-Dimension Tensors	COMPLEXITY			English	Article								Short-term traffic flow prediction is an important theoretical basis for intelligent transportation systems, and traffic flow data contain abundant multimode features and exhibit characteristic spatiotemporal correlations and dynamics. To predict the traffic flow state, it is necessary to design a model that can adapt to changing traffic flow characteristics. Thus, a dynamic tensor rolling nonhomogeneous discrete grey model (DTRNDGM) is proposed. This model achieves rolling prediction by introducing a cycle truncation accumulated generating operation; furthermore, the proposed model is unbiased, and it can perfectly fit nonhomogeneous exponential sequences. In addition, based on the multimode characteristics of traffic flow data tensors and the relationship between the cycle truncation accumulated generating operation and matrix perturbation to determine the cycle of dynamic prediction, the proposed model compensates for the periodic verification of the RSDGM and SGM grey prediction models. Finally, traffic flow data from the main route of Shaoshan Road, Changsha, Hunan, China, are used as an example. The experimental results show that the simulation and prediction results of DTRNDGM are good.

However, existing methods mainly concentrate on short-term prediction. The challenging task of long-term flow prediction for the next day, as the important reference of traffic management, is still not well solved. In this paper, we present a residual deconvolution based deep generative network (RDBDGN) to handle the problem of long-term traffic flow prediction. The proposed method consists of a generator and a discriminator. The generator is composed of multi-channel residual deconvolutional neural networks, and the discriminator contains a convolutional neural network which aims to optimize the adversarial training process. The experiments are evaluated based on the traffic flow data of elevated highways, presented results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art works.

A comparative study on fatigue assessment of orthotropic steel decks based on long-term WIM data	LIFE-CYCLE ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT IN CIVIL ENGINEERING: TOWARDS AN INTEGRATED VISION			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Symposium on Life-Cycle Civil Engineering (IALCCE)	OCT 28-31, 2018	Ghent, BELGIUM	Int Assoc Life Cycle Civil Engn, Ghent Univ, BESIX, Jan Nul Grp, TUC RAIL, INFRABEL, FRANKI, DENYS, ArcelorMittal, SBE, FWO Res Fdn				Fatigue is the problem that constantly bothers the durability and serviceability of orthotropic steel decks. As fatigue cracks always emerge at the welded joints of orthotropic steel decks, the accuracy and feasibility of fatigue assessment of welded details on this type of structure should be further evaluated. The regular way based on S-N curves should be specifically discussed, since it is proven to be inconsistent with experiments and sometimes results in premature fatigue damage on actual bridges. On the other hand, a fatigue assessment method based on the fracture mechanics provides an alternative option, according to reports concerning welded joints in other industries. This study compared the results from both methods, and showed the advantages and disadvantages for each. Firstly, a long-term weigh-in-motion data of the traffic flow on the Runyang Yangtze River Bridge in China was obtained, indicating that the slow lane to the north is the most fatigue-prone one among all lanes. Afterwards, the finite element model of the orthotropic steel deck was built, providing the influence surface of stresses at key positions. Consequently, the stress range histories induced by the traffic flow can be obtained. Hot-spot stress method was employed to evaluate the fatigue damage. Meanwhile, a fracture mechanics method with reasonable assumptions was conducted as well. By comparing the two sets of results, it can be concluded that the hot-spot stress method will not necessarily obtain conservative results, while the fracture mechanic method will be more proper as it considered the initial crack size as a key factor. Additionally, by taking the crack growth process into account, it enables a combination with inspection and maintenance works with respect to the life-cycle cost and performance of this structure.

Development and validation of a full probabilistic model for traffic load of bridges based on Weigh-In-Motion (WIM) data	LIFE-CYCLE ANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENT IN CIVIL ENGINEERING: TOWARDS AN INTEGRATED VISION			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Symposium on Life-Cycle Civil Engineering (IALCCE)	OCT 28-31, 2018	Ghent, BELGIUM	Int Assoc Life Cycle Civil Engn, Ghent Univ, BESIX, Jan Nul Grp, TUC RAIL, INFRABEL, FRANKI, DENYS, ArcelorMittal, SBE, FWO Res Fdn			SIMULATION	It is important to accurately estimate the traffic load effects on bridges for the purpose of design or performance evaluation. Traffic load effects on a bridge forma stochastic process, which requires the development of a site-specific model representing random properties from traffic conditions. However, most design codes and many studies still do not fully consider the site-specific conditions of bridges and rely on conservative assumptions. Therefore, in this study, a full probabilistic traffic load model based on Weigh-In-Motion (WIM) data is developed to consider the site-specific characteristics of vehicles and traffic flow. The statistical model characterizing characteristics of vehicles and traffic floware separately developed. These models describeweight and length of vehicles headway, velocity, and correlation between multiple lanes. Using these statistical models, WIM data are generated by Monte Carlo simulations, and traffic load effects are evaluated by the influence line analysis of the bridges under the generated WIM data. These results are compared with those by actual WIM data to validate the full probabilistic model developed in this study.

Conservation of vehicles equation is one of the basic equations used in any macroscopic model-based analysis. However, to apply the conservation equation, accurate flow/count data should be available, which can be achieved only if suitable traffic sensors are available. In reality, automated traffic sensors are prone to measurement errors, especially under heterogeneous, less lane-disciplined and congested traffic conditions. Use of this erroneous data can lead to wrong estimation of traffic variables. This study proposes a lumped parameter macroscopic model-based scheme for the estimation of flow at error-prone locations. The estimation scheme was designed based on the extended Kalman filter. The performance of the proposed scheme was evaluated for density estimation by comparing the results using accurate flow data collected manually, using automated sensor data and flow estimated using the proposed methodology. The results showed that with the proposed scheme, average error in estimated density for the sections under consideration was around 20.8%, whereas it was found to be 30% with direct use of automated sensor data. This shows that at error prone locations, the proposed model is a viable alternative to the direct use of erroneous automated data.

S	Rapant, L		Montemanni, R		Rapant, Lukas			Traffic speed prediction using ensemble kalman filter and differential evolution	2018 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TRAFFIC AND LOGISTIC ENGINEERING (ICTLE 2018)	MATEC Web of Conferences		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Traffic and Logistic Engineering (ICTLE)	AUG 03-05, 2018	Bangkok, THAILAND					Importance of traffic state prediction steadily increases with growing volume of traffic. Ability to predict traffic speed in short to medium horizon (i.e. up to one hour) is one of the main tasks of every newly developed Intelligent Transportation System. There are two possible approaches to this prediction. The first is to utilize physical properties of the traffic flow to construct an exact or approximate numerical model. This approach is, however, almost impossible to implement on a larger scale given the difficulty to obtain enough traffic data to describe the starting and boundary conditions of the model. The other option is to use historical traffic data and relate information and patterns they contain to the current traffic state by application of some form of statistical or machine learning approach. We propose to use combination of Ensemble Kalman filter and Cell Transmission Model for this task. These models combine properties of physical model with ability to incorporate uncertainty of the traffic data.

An intelligent information system is used to collect information about current state of the automobile road, weather and climatic conditions, characteristics of traffic flows. It is shown that regulatory TOC's maintenance is based on two management processes. The first process of current management is fast and low-inertia and is based on the current state of the management object. The second process of long-term management, due to the influence of the climate change, is much slower and has a high inertia; to ensure required management quality, it is necessary to carry out this process on the basis of the object's state forecasting and to produce management actions (stabilization of the soil temperature regime) in advance, before the appearance of visible automobile road's TOC deterioration. Predicting the condition is based on simulation modelling, which results in determining the expected settlement of thawing soil at the formation, which causes roadway's numerous defects. The results of numerical simulation of the predicted state of the automobile road in the climatic conditions of Yakutsk and Urengoy are shown, including the case with applying measures to stabilize the soil temperature regime (use of seasonal cooling devices -SCD). It is shown that the dynamics of changes in the state of the object occurring under the influence of the climate change is described by only two path functions in the state space -without the use of SCD and in their presence. Perspective management of the object's state resides in choosing the path function (corresponding to a certain structural characteristics of SCD) and determining the most rational time of transition to this path function. At a low intensity of climatic changes in the territory of the automobile road location, the simulation results' sensitivity to the accuracy of the climatic parameters' forecast increases.

The traffic prediction model uses local traffic data from the motorway and is based on time series analysis. The prediction is structured into three levels: trend prediction for all calendar days in the year, long-term prediction for the current day and short-term prediction for the next hour. The error of long-term prediction was less than 15% per hour over the whole day. An optimization algorithm for better lane allocation was developed by using a camera based traffic state detection system at the toll plaza. Based on the measured queue lengths per toll gate lane, the algorithm shifts vehicles to lower queued areas in front of the toll plaza. Therefore, the algorithm was able to reduce travel times up to 6% in daily average and queue lengths with more than 100m up to 30% per lane. The prediction model and optimization algorithm are not site-specific and can also be applied on different toll plazas or bottlenecks on motorways (e.g. road works, border crossing, motorway junction etc.).

Truck platooning is one of the main solutions. However, the impact of truck platooning on traffic flow and safety on highways is still unclear. This research focuses on impacts of large-scale truck platooning on Dutch highway. It applied a microscopic modeling to simulate the impact of truck platooning within critical traffic locations such as merging and diverging areas. The results showed that large-scale truck platooning has an impact on the traffic safety and efficiency within these traffic locations compared to the current situation. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Drivers may change their driving behavior by receiving information on the status of upcoming traffic signals. The behavior of a driver who reacts to such information with the purpose of smoothly passing through an upcoming signalized intersection is described as reinforcement learning in this study. The influence of reactive drivers on traffic flows is analyzed by a multi-agent traffic flow simulation on an arterial road composed of four signalized intersections. Furthermore, the relationship between the ratio of reactive drivers and traffic flows is clarified, under the assumption that there is a mixture of reactive and nonreactive drivers on the road. The results of the multi-agent traffic flow simulation showed that the average stop time decreased as the ratio of reactive drivers increased. Moreover, the threshold of the ratio of reactive drivers to begin to influence largely vehicle stop situations was around 50%. The average travel time was almost constant regardless of the ratio of reactive drivers. It was also demonstrated that reacting to the traffic signal information and decelerating accordingly did not cause time delays. This suggests that the provision of the traffic signal information and appropriate reaction to the provided information may help reduce the amount of CO2 emissions from a vehicle approaching a signalized intersection and probably contribute to alleviating progress of global warming.

Traffic flow in such conditions is very complex in nature and safety issues arise. Traffic simulation models have been formulated for lane-based conditions. The existing models do not consider the wider range of situations that drivers in mixed traffic may face compared to drivers in homogeneous lane-based traffic, such as multiple-leader following, and passing and lateral shifts. In this research, we define the concept of virtual lanes for modeling mixed traffic conditions. A methodology based on temporary virtual lanes and data-driven approaches is developed to simulate driving behavior in developing countries. The role of vehicle type in model efficiency is also explored. The proposed methodology is validated on mixed traffic trajectory data from India. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Intelligent transportation system based on information technology is the most fundamental and effective measure to solve traffic congestion. The difficulty in the study of intelligent transportation technology lies in real-time and accurate short-term traffic flow prediction. In this paper, a short time traffic flow prediction software based on BP neural network is developed, which can be applied to the prediction of urban short-term traffic flow. Using this software can accurately and quickly predict the road traffic flow information at the next moment, which can provide powerful technical support for traffic control, traffic information service and traffic guidance of urban road traffic system, and alleviate the traffic pressure caused by the rapid development of urbanization. The software has important practical significance and application value in solving urban road traffic congestion and reducing environmental pollution.

An Automobile Users' Satisfaction index (AUSi) is established using data sets of questionnaire survey collected from 34 urban street segments of three midsized Indian cities. About 977 respondents with a suitable cross-section of gender, age, driving experience etc. were participated in travellers' intercept survey. Rasch Model (RM) was applied to identify a set of quantitative measures to analyse the complex process of measuring perceived service quality and degree of drivers' satisfaction together. The present study comprehends the multidimensional nature of users' perception to evaluate AUSi with the help of six-dimensional variables such as roadway geometry, traffic facilities, traffic management, pavement condition, safety and aesthetics. RM offers a particular score to each user and each dimensional attribute along with a shared continuum. This way, the attributes those are more demanding to produce satisfaction as well as the variation in response of different modes of transport are evidently identified. The key findings indicate that the participants reported lower satisfaction level mainly due to the absence of separate bike/bus pull-out lanes, improper parking facilities and interruption by non-motorised vehicles/public transit or roadside commercial activities. Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering was applied to classify AUSi scores into six auto Levels Of Service (LOS) categories (A-F) for each street segment. The model was well validated with a significant matching of predicted Automobile users' LOS (ALOS) service categories with the users' perceived Overall Satisfaction (OS) scores for fourteen randomly selected segments. This prediction model is new to mixed traffic flow condition, which uses linguistic information and real-life issues of drivers for the current state of services. Hence, the proposed method would be more credible than conventional models to support the decision makers for long term planning and designing road networks on a priority basis.

In dynamic traffic assignment, because of the cumulative volumes of successive time intervals, a route-based traffic assignment algorithm is used for dynamic traffic assignment in this paper. Besides, a novel shortest path algorithm based actual and artificial link is proposed for the time-expanded network that consists of two kinds of arcs: the actual arc and the artificial one. Then, a simple example is used to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. The computational results show that the novel shortest path algorithm based actual and artificial link could be applied in the time-expanded networks with two types of arcs, and the route-based assignment method could achieve optimal balance solutions under different demand modes.

However, the cost and capacity functions used in the literature are inadequate to describe the traffic dynamics in heterogeneous conditions. This paper proposes a systematic framework with new cost and capacity functions, to identify critical links in a network and to determine the minimum cost truck routes in the network by restricting trucks on identified critical links. A hierarchical mathematical programming framework with integer programming formulations are presented. The capacity and cost functions are derived based on a multiclass model and shockwave analysis to represent realistic traffic flow interactions between the trucks and cars. The model results are validated using VISSIM simulation, which shows that the total delay reduced and the network capacity utilization improved with truck restriction.

In parallel, traffic congestion has an effect on travel routing strategy. The fundamental observation is about the prediction of real-time traffic flow, which is focus on the results based on short-term traffic volume. This paper presents a new approach which provides a dynamic route planning model based on the spatio-temporal interactions in a road network. In addition, it is necessary to consider the factors of security threats (weather, construction, etc.) and the road conditions of real-time while maintaining the accuracy of the model. Firstly, it predicts the traffic congestion status upon the existing historical trajectory data, which defines congestion coefficient for dynamic planning.

Traffic networks can be affected by external factors, such as weather, events, accidents, and road construction works. The impact of these factors can affect traffic flow parameters by influencing travel time, density, occupancy, and operating speed. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently shown promising signs in traffic prediction using big data, there still exists the issue of maximizing the use of the model capabilities by using big data sources. This paper proposes an improved urban traffic speed prediction approach involving input-level data fusion and deep learning. Motivated by deep learning prediction methods, we propose a Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM-NN) for traffic speed prediction that combines traffic and weather datasets on an urban road network in Greater Manchester, United Kingdom. The experimental results substantiate the value of the approach when compared to the use of traffic-only data sources for traffic speed prediction.

Therefore, in this paper, we aim to effective model and analyze the road network based on VISSIM. Particularly, VISSIM is used to describe the operation of urban transportation, traffic flow characteristics and driver behaviors respectively. VISSIM can not only simulate individual traffic, but also simulate open and rail traffic. However, the quality of VISSIM parameters greatly influences system performance. Therefore, we proposed a novel VISSIM parameters correction method based on the genetic algorithm. Finally, experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

This paper proposes an effective algorithm for traffic flow prediction. Firstly, the algorithm analyzes the characteristics of daily traffic flow. According to the difference, the daily traffic flows are divided into workday type, and holiday type, and each type of data is integrated to predict the corresponding day type traffic flow. Then based on phase space reconstruction, a chaotic local prediction algorithm is proposed. The algorithm uses Euclidean distance to select phase space reference neighborhood successively, and support vector machine is used to establish the mapping relationship between neighboring points. This algorithm is used to predict the data of an intersection in Guangzhou, and satisfactory prediction accuracy has been achieved.

In order to alleviate traffic pressure, traffic flow prediction during the holidays has become a problem of great concern. This paper proposes a hybrid prediction methodology combining discrete Fourier transform (DFT) with support vector regression (SVR). The common trend in the traffic flow data is extracted using DFT by setting an appropriate threshold, which is predicted by extreme extrapolation of the historical trend. The SVR method is applied to predict the residual series. The experimental results with measured data collected from the toll stations in Jiangsu province of China show that the proposed algorithm has higher accuracy compared with the traditional method, and it is an efficient method for traffic flow prediction during the holidays.

We generally obtain the best possible solution using these methods. In this work, the traffic scheduling problem has been formulated as a waiting time minimisation problem, and appropriate cost functions have been developed, in pursuit of finding the optimal solution. A first-in, first-out queuing model is used, with the vehicles arriving in a Poisson process, and the service time being exponentially distributed. The key feature of this model is that it adapts to varying service and arrival rates of the lanes. These rates are forecast using a neural network model, and appear in the objective function. It was observed that the use of the neural network greatly improved the robustness of the model. Although the model has been developed for a four lane, two way architecture, it can be generalised to any architecture. Results have been analysed by comparing the proposed method to a proportional time distribution. It is shown that the proposed model performs relatively well, when there is rapid variation in the arrival and service rates.	[Rahul, M.

A modified multilevel k-way partitioning algorithm for trip-based road networks	2018 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS AND CHEMICAL ENGINEERING (ICFMCE 2018)	MATEC Web of Conferences		English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Functional Materials and Chemical Engineering (ICFMCE)	NOV 20-22, 2018	Khalifa Univ, Abu Dhabi, U ARAB EMIRATES	IASED	Khalifa Univ		SCHEME	In today's world, the traffic volume on urban road networks is multiplying rapidly due to the heavy usage of vehicles and mobility on demand services. Migration of people towards urban areas result in increasing size and complexity of urban road networks. When handling such complex traffic systems, partitioning the road network into multiple sub-regions and managing the identified sub regions is a popular approach. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to identify sub-regions of a road network that exhibit homogeneous traffic flow patterns. In a stage wise manner, we model the road network graph by using taxi-trip data obtained on the selected region. Then, we apply the proposed modified multilevel k-way partitioning algorithm to obtain optimal number of partitions from the developed road graph. An interesting feature of this algorithm is, resulting partitions are geographically connected and consists minimal inter partition trip flow. Our results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art multilevel partitioning algorithms for trip based road networks. By this research, we demonstrate the ability of road network partitioning using trip data while preserving the partition homogeneity and connectivity.

This study aims to describe and analyze the factors that affect motorcycle accidents through modelling by the method of Generalized Linear Models with Genstat and SPSS programm. Based on the results of the police report data summary, accidents most often occur on Sunday (15.95%); the time span at 18:00 to 23:59 pm (45.94%); type of hit the front (35.68%); victims died (12.19%), male sex (80.71%), age range 18-25 years (37.20%); with the level of education at the level of Higher Education (42.38%); worked in the private sector (37.75%); do not have a driver's license (75.43%). The results of the analysis of survey data obtained equation modelling accident MCA = 0,0006713* Flow 0.000275*exp [0.2144 LaneWidth - ShoulderWidth_Sidewalk 1.952 - 2.026 MedianRoad + 0.2139 Speed + 0.0513 Access]. Modelling results showed that the addition of total lane width decrease the number of motorcycle accidents by 10% per year, pavement by 6% per year, median by 13% per year, traffic flow by 3% per year, speed by 14% per year, access road by 2% per year. It is therefore recommended a program of action in the form of additional elements of the road medians and pavement on a road segment that the accident rate can be reduced.

The traffic signal system setting in Indonesia has been using the Indonesia Road Capacity Manual model 1997, for example it is installed at the intersection in large cities in Indonesia. The development of the Fuzzy Logic model is focused on improving the performance of the signaled intersection, using a combination of numerical variable analysis used by IRCM 1997, and the linguistic or traffic behavior variable as the basis of the Fuzzy Logic model study. The combination of the two variables in the Fuzzy Logic model analysis is expected to improve the intersection performance. The Fuzzy Logic model process involves the Membership Function theory as the basis for the confidence level of the traffic variable to be surveyed, and the Fuzzy Inference Engine to measure the choice of combinations of variables that will be selected to make the best performance of the intersection. The geometric of intersection must be control as it involves the input of research data, especially on the condition of the intersection legs and markers of motor cycle-special stopping places, which is a potential of a traffic violation by traveller. The model is verified with fuzzified data from 2017 traffic research survey in Bandung. As an illustration of the majority of intersection setting with an isolated pre-time operating system, there are 60 intersection points or 85% of the total 71 intersections available. This would be a potentially major problem when performance improvements is not carried out. The final analysis shows that the number of vehicles queues decreases while the traffic flows passing through the intersection increases, therefore fuzzy logic model is expected to contribute and to give alternative handling for intersection performance with pre-time operational.

The assumption of the necessity of simultaneous analysis of vehicles types (by number of wheels, e.g. two-wheelers, four wheelers, etc.) participating in traffic, was made. This type of analysis involves not only the measurement of vehicle weight but also qualitative detection. Such data are mainly collected and analysed in urban traffic, in which information on traffic volume, lane occupancy or the number of vehicles waiting to enter an intersection are important to ensure continuous, smooth traffic flow. This article presents a design of a WIM system in which the detector is a beam with Bragg grating optical fibre sensors glued on it. Four cases of beam load were determined, due to its strength and the ability to register deformations. The strength analysis of the beam was carried out with the help of MES and its shape was optimised.<bold> </bold>	[Nieoczym, Aleksander; Drozd, Kazimierz; Wojcik, Andrzej] Lublin Univ Technol, Fac Mech Engn, Nadbystrzycka 36 St, PL-20618 Lublin, Poland	Nieoczym, A (corresponding author), Lublin Univ Technol, Fac Mech Engn, Nadbystrzycka 36 St, PL-20618 Lublin, Poland.	a.nieoczym@pollub.pl	Wojcik, Andrzej/AAE-7176-2019	Wojcik, Andrzej/0000-0001-6329-5764			Burnos P, 2007, METROL MEAS SYST, V14, P507; Cebon D., 1991, TRANSPORT RES REC, V1311, P70; COLE DJ, 1992, IEE CONF PUBL, V355, P123; Gajda J., 2005, P 15 S MOD SIM MEAS, P199; Gajda J, 2007, METROL MEAS SYST, V14, P517; Hoose N., 1998, P 2 EUR C WEIGH MOT, P461; Huhtala M., 1999, P 1 M EUR EQ GAM GRO, P55; Jacob B., 1999, 323 COST; Mangeas M., 2000, P EUR, V9, P7943; Stanczyk D., 1999, P FIN S PROJ WAVE PA, P307	10	0	0	0	1	E D P SCIENCES	CEDEX A	17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE	2261-236X			MATEC WEB CONF			2019	252								01009	10.1051/matecconf/201925201009			4	Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Multidisciplinary	Computer Science; Engineering	BM7JS	WOS:000467983800009		DOAJ Gold, Green Published			2021-01-11

Traffic congestion in the city of Denpasar is increasing from year to year, especially at the point of the intersection node, such as at the signalised intersection of Udayana University Sudirman Campus. The high trip attraction to Udayana University Campus has exacerbated the congestion of the intersection. The purpose of this study was to examine an alternative to managing the traffic flow using the Vissim software. The required data included the intersection geometric data, traffic volume and signal timing. The calculation of the intersection's performance was conducted based on the Indonesian Highway Capacity Manual (IHCM). The simulation of the traffic flow management was conducted with the help of the Vissim software. The results of the performance analysis of the intersection conduced using Vissim Software indicated that the application of Vissim software was valid. The traffic management proposed has reduced both queue length and delay time.

The statutory segment (Cawang-Tomang) of this toll road system seems to have better performance, but not for the advisory segment (Cawang Ancol). Basically, heavy vehicles (HV) shift their routes to the advisory segment to avoid the statutory segment at which they are prohibited to access from 05.00 a.m. to 10.00 p.m.. This study aims to investigate the impact of the HV composition on the traffic performance of the advisory segment of HUT. Data were obtained from 48 hours of traffic recording at a part of Cawang-Ancol segment. It was found that the Underwood Model (exponential model) can represent the relationship between the three main parameters of traffic flow on the advisory segment, i.e. volume, speed, and density. Based on the developed traffic flow models which are classified on the HV composition, it is shown that the free flow speed (u(f)) for HV composition <= 6% (i.e. 144.91 km/h) is higher 35.41% than the one of HV > 6% (i.e. 107.02 km/h). The actual road capacity (q(m)) in HV composition <= 6% (i.e. 4442 pcu/hour) also higher 12.83% than the one of HV > 6% (i.e. 3937 pcu/hour). The results will benefit to the transport authority to justify the truck access restriction implementation.

A stochastic-flow freeway network (SFFN) is constructed to model the freeway system with stochastic speed. System reliability is defined as the probability of a certain number of vehicles in a freeway system completing their journey smoothly within a restricted time. Two SFFN models were built to describe the relationships among traffic flow, system time and stochastic speed. After obtaining the probability distribution of speed by collecting historical data, two algorithms with respect to different models were proposed to generate all minimal speed vectors (MSVs). The system reliability can be subsequently computed in terms of MSVs. The Taiwan freeway system was considered as a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models and algorithms.

MODELLING SMART ROAD TRAFFIC CONGESTION CONTROL SYSTEM USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES	NEURAL NETWORK WORLD			English	Article						neural networks; prediction; backpropagation; MSR2C-ABPNN	PREDICTION	By the dramatic growth of the population in cities requires the traffic systems to be designed efficiently and sustainably by taking full advantage of modern-day technology. Dynamic traffic flow is a significant issue which brings about a block of traffic movement. Thus, for tackling this issue, this paper aims to provide a mechanism to predict the traffic congestion with the help of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) which shall control or minimize the blockage and result in the smoothening of road traffic. Proposed Modeling Smart Road Traffic Congestion Control using Artificial Back Propagation Neural Networks (MSR2C-ABPNN) for road traffic increase transparency, availability and efficiency in services offered to the citizens. In this paper, the prediction of congestion is operationalized by using the algorithm of backpropagation to train the neural network. The proposed system aims to provide a solution that will increase the comfort level of travellers to make intelligent and better transportation decision, and the neural network is a plausible approach to find traffic situations. Proposed MSR2C-ABPNN with Time series gives attractive results concerning MSE as compared to the fitting approach.	[Ata, A.; Khan, M.

MODELLING FAILURES OF ASPHALT CONCRETE SURFACINGS CAUSED BY A DYNAMIC IMPACT OF WATER	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURE			English	Article						wear and tear of roadway surfacings; asphalt concrete surfacing; dynamic impact of water		Statement of the problem. The central factor contributing to road failures is a dynamic impact of traffic. An asphalt surfacing is mainly dry, but when it gets wet, there is frequently an increase in the number of defects. The methods and ways of determining the defect growth rate in dry roads provide insight into the mechanisms of development of defects and ways to enhance the longevity and defect resistance of asphalt concrete. Results. We present modeling of a dynamic impact of water on asphalt concrete surfacing and provide the methods of measuring it under a traffic load. Calculations of changes in the pressure inside pores of the upper layer of a surfacing and water speed in spots where defects emerge are shown. A connection was found between the parameters of a traffic flow and defects occurring in a surfacing. Conclusions. We found that besides the known and described defects a roadway surfacing might fail due to an impact of wheels provided there is some water on the surface (water wear and tear). A dynamic impact of water moving under a rolling wheel of a vehicle on an asphalt concrete surfacing is complex and modeling it involves analysis of the structure of asphalt concrete.	[Kozlov, V.

This paper constructs a prediction model based on the analysis of explanatory variables using wavelet neural network (WNN) and genetic algorithm (GA). Eight variables, such as major road traffic flow and the distances to neighboring service areas, are selected as input parameters. The pause rates of a freight truck and passenger car are the prediction output. The data from 23 pairs of service areas in Henan province are used to train the model. The GA is used to optimize the initial weights, thresholds, and translation coefficients of the WNN. The experimental results show that the GA-WNN model has a higher prediction precision and a better fitting ability compared with the GA-BP and the WNN prediction models, which can overcome the shortcomings of slow convergence and local optimum of traditional WNN, and combine the advantages of GA and WNN to improve prediction accuracy effectively. The research of this paper can provide new ideas and methods to pause rate prediction of the expressway service area.

It is foreseeable that the applications of IoT will be prevalent in the public transportation system and bring changes to the system in the near future. In this paper, we analyze the impact of IoT environment on the public transportation system, propose a new framework of the intelligent public transportation system based on IoT, and present the deployment of the elements, the communication network, and the three-tier architecture of the system in detail.

These deformations limit driving properties and increase vehicle operation and maintenance costs. Additionally, they cause many problems such as accidents, slower movement speeds, capacity loss and severe discomfort states. There are many factors having an effect on road capacities and they vary according to different road and traffic flow conditions. In this study, it is aimed to investigate and develop models to estimate shockwave and bottleneck forming, capacity loss and speed reduction, which occurred on examined road links caused by pavement deformations. For the prediction of road capacity, flow-density (q-k) relationship, bottleneck and shockwave analysis methods were used. In the scope this study, deformed road links were divided into three sections; Section A - before deformation zone, Section B - deformation zone, and Section C - after deformation zone. All three sections were investigated and empirical results were obtained. According to analysis results, it was found that pavement surface deformations have a negative effect on the level of road service capability. Obtained results also showed that there are significant reductions in capacity relatively by up to 44 and 26% would result from surface deformations on deformed lanes and non-deformed adjacent lanes.

CYCLING AT INTERSECTIONS: A MULTI-OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT FOR TRAFFIC, EMISSIONS AND SAFETY	TRANSPORT			English	Article						bicycle; microscale modelling; multi-objective optimization; traffic; emissions; safety	GENETIC ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; IMPACTS; SIGNALS	This paper evaluated in an integrated manner the traffic performance, pollutant emissions and road conflicts between bicycles and motor vehicles at a signalized intersection. Two alternative scenarios were examined: (1) bicycles increment and motor vehicles replacement within the cycle-fixed traffic signal; (2) replacing the existing traffic control by a conventional two-lane roundabout and evaluating the impacts of bicycles increment. For each scenario, bicycle demand was varied from 9 to 270 bicycles per hour (bph). Traffic flow and vehicle dynamic data were collected from a three-leg signalized intersection in Aveiro (Portugal). The microscopic traffic model (VISSIM) paired with an emission (Vehicle Specific Power - VSP) methodology and safety (Surrogate Safety Assessment Methodology - SSAM) model were used to assess intersection-specific operations. The fast Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) was used to find the optimal bicycle demands. The results showed that two-lane roundabout outperformed the existing traffic control, namely in highest bicycle demand scenario (number of stops and travel time reduced in 78 and 14%, respectively; CO2, NOx, and HC decreased 9, 7, and 12%, respectively). It was also found that the number of conflicts was significantly reduced (-49%) with this latter layout even in maximum bicycle demand scenario (270 bph). However, roundabout layout lead to more severe conflicts and potential crashes. The analysis showed that bicycle demands of 75, 95 and 110 bph delivered good environmental and safety outcomes for the intersection.

This study aims to explore and review the data mining and machine learning technologies adopted in research and industry to attempt to overcome the direct and indirect traffic issues on humanity and societies. The study's methodology is to comprehensively review around 165 studies, criticize, and categorize all these studies into a chronological and understandable category. The study is focusing on the traffic management approaches that were depended on data mining and machine learning technologies to detect and predict the traffic only. This study has found that there is no standard traffic management approach that the community of traffic management has agreed on. This study is important to the traffic research communities, traffic software companies, and traffic government officials. It has a direct impact on drawing a clear path for new traffic management propositions. This study is one of the largest studies with respect to the size of its reviewed articles that were focused on data mining and machine learning. Additionally, this study will draw general attention to a new traffic management proposition approach.

J	Ma, K; Wang, H				Ma, Ke; Wang, Hao			Influence of Exclusive Lanes for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles on Freeway Traffic Flow	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Connected and autonomous vehicles; exclusive lanes; cellular automaton; freeway	ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; MODEL; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS	The intelligence of connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) is insufficient to deal with the complex road conditions. However, the application of exclusive lanes bypasses the long wait for the technology to mature. Prior to the maturity of intelligent transport systems (ITSs), it's a feasible solution in terms of technology and cost to set up exclusive lanes. In this way, CAVs will form an efficient and energy-saving autonomous fleet. An improved cellular automata model is used to study the effect of setting up exclusive lanes for CAVs on traffic flow throughput and stability on the freeway. A multi-lane freeway, equipped with intelligent sensors and road signs, is set up and three stages are designed according to the development degree of CAVs. This paper introduces two kinds of significant data by simulation: heterogeneous traffic flow and the degradation rate of CAV. They verify that setting up exclusive lanes for CAV will greatly improve the traffic condition of the freeway on the different penetration rates of CAV.

The sources, the receivers and the place of transition, where the sound wave propagates, are the three vital parameters for the field of noise acoustics. For this research, the aim of this study is to assess traffic noise levels between different types of residential areas in Nibong Tebal, Penang. The study is carried out in order to achieve the following three main objectives, which are to assess the level of traffic noise at selected residential areas, to characterize the traffic flow composition nearby study areas, and to compare noise levels between low density and terraced house residential areas. The noise levels measurements were carried out periodically in the morning (from 0700 to 1100), evening (from 1600 to 1900), and at night (from 2200 to 2300) for 15 minutes using a sound level meter. The traffic characteristics were measured simultaneously during noise levels measurements. The highest equivalent continuous noise levels for the low density residential areas was at Kampung Batu 2 in the evening with 65.9 dB(A), while for the medium density residential areas, Taman Sri Acheh contributed 68.60 dB(A) during the morning. The lowest equivalent continuous noise levels were obtained at Kampung Simpang Tiga in the morning that contributed 54.9 dB(A) for low density residential areas. However, the minimum equivalent continuous noise levels obtained for the medium density residential areas was at Taman limn Indah in the morning with 63.10 dB(A). The results obtained, clearly show that the equivalent continuous noise level for all study sites exceeded the maximum permissible sound level for medium density areas during daytime (from 7.00 am to 10.00 pin), which is 55 dB(A), while at night time (from 10.00 pin to 7.00 am) is 45 dB(A), and for low density residential areas during daytime (from 7.00 am to 10.00 pm) is 55 dB(A), while at night time (from 10.00 pin to 7.00 am) is 45 dB(A), respectively. These values are based on the guidelines for environmental noise limits and control by the Department of Environment, Malaysia.

In this paper, a procedure was proposed to help determine the deployment location of VSL signs to reduce collision risks at freeway recurrent bottlenecks. The procedure is started from determining the hazardous recurrent bottleneck section by constructing the profile of the collision risks. The length of the hazardous section was determined according to the pre-selected threshold of crash risks. Various scenarios were considered for different lengths of VSL controlled sections with various densities of VSL signs. A modified cell transmission model (CTM) was used for modeling the traffic flow at the freeway bottlenecks under the VSL control. The VSL control factors were optimized by using the genetic algorithm. The safety effects of VSL were greatly affected by the placement of VSL signs. In general, the scenario with a longer VSL controlled section and more speed limit signs was more effective in reducing rear-end collision risks. The cost-benefit analyses showed that the placement of VSL signs in scenario C2 with the controlled section length of 11.7 mi and average VSL density of 1.0 mi had the best benefit/cost effect. Using 12 VSL signs, the collision risks were reduced by 69.16% and the total travel time was increased slightly by 7.73%. The procedure can help determine the optimal deployment of VSL signs on freeways, considering both the safety benefits and the cost.

The loss of productivity, car accidents, high emissions, and environmental pollution caused by traffic congestion has become a huge and increasingly heavy burden on all countries in the world. Therefore, the prediction of urban road network traffic flow and the rapid and accurate evaluation of traffic congestion are of great significance to the study of urban traffic solutions. This paper focuses on how to apply data science technologies on vehicular networks data to present a prediction method for traffic congestion based on both real-time and predicted traffic data. Two evaluation frameworks are established, and existing methods are used to compare and evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of the presented method.

J	Zong, F; Zeng, M; Zhong, W; Lu, FR				Zong, Fang; Zeng, Meng; Zhong, Wei; Lu, Fengrui			Hybrid Path Selection Modeling by Considering Habits and Traffic Conditions	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Intelligent transportation systems; link; habits; real-time traffic conditions; hybrid prediction	ROUTE CHOICE MODEL; NETWORK EQUILIBRIUM; PREDICTION	Efficient path guidance is one of the effective ways to improve the utilization of road resources and relieve traffic congestion. Therefore, it is important to identify ways to enable drivers to select path more efficiently. In this paper, we seek to build a pre + during-trip path prediction model based on the impacts of external and internal information on path selection behaviors to enhance path selection efficiency. The prediction process is composed of three parts, namely, pre-trip path prediction, during-trip link prediction, and path adjustment calculation. In the pre-trip path prediction, through RP survey data collected in Changchun, China, we determine the impacts of subjective factor (habits) on path selection using the Markov model. While the Binary Logit model is utilized by the during-trip link prediction to consider the impacts of both subjective factor (travel habits) and objective factor (real-time traffic conditions). The influences of habits and traffic conditions are compared and analyzed. The results indicate that subjective factor has more important influence than objective one. In addition, the verification results also suggest that pre + during-trip path prediction model provides higher forecasting accuracy than the single pre-trip prediction model. These findings are beneficial to uncover the underlying mechanisms of path selection and facilitate the development of strategies to enhance path selection efficiency. Based on the study results, the subjective and objective information that was found to affect path selection can be considered into the path guide system. Moreover, the hybrid prediction model can be applied in the vehicle or mobile navigation App to facilitate the recommendation of the path to travelers as well as to forecast the short-term traffic flow and determine the potential congestion area. Based on the pre-trip path prediction model, the path and the traffic flow distribution in road network can be obtained only from historical travel data.

J	Dai, Z; Ma, XL; Chen, X				Dai, Zhuang; Ma, Xiaolei; Chen, Xi			Bus travel time modelling using GPS probe and smart card data: A probabilistic approach considering link travel time and station dwell time	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						GPS probe data; link travel time; smart card data; station dwell time; travel time reliability	RELIABILITY; VARIABILITY	Path travel time estimation for buses is critical to public transit operation and passenger information system. State-of-the-art methods for estimating path travel time are usually focused on single vehicle with a limited number of road segments, thereby neglecting the interaction among multiple buses, boarding behavior, and traffic flow. This study models path travel time for buses considering link travel time and station dwell time. First, we fit link travel time to shifted lognormal distributions as in previous studies. Then, we propose a probabilistic model to capture interactions among buses in the bus bay as a first-in-first-out queue, with every bus sharing the same set of behaviors: queuing to enter the bus bay, loading/unloading passengers, and merging into traffic flow on the main road. Finally, path travel time distribution is estimated by statistically summarizing link travel time distributions and station dwell time distributions. The path travel time of a bus line in Hangzhou is analyzed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Results show that the model-based estimated path travel time distribution resembles the observed distribution well. Based on the calculation of path travel time, link travel time reliability is identified as the main factor affecting path travel time reliability.

In developing any micro-scale fuel consumption model, the Vehicle Specific Power (VSP) binning method has been widely adopted in recent years as a fundamental approach. Existing studies have shown that the high distribution frequency when VSP=0 contributes to high fuel consumptions, so a question quickly emerged about whether VSP=0 should be designed as an independent VSP bin in the VSP binning method. This paper strives to compare different VSP binning methods for Light-Duty Vehicles (LDVs) on urban roads in Beijing in terms of their effects on the estimation of fuel consumptions. After collecting and processing field vehicle activity data and fuel consumption data, three VSP binning methods are proposed for the study. Then, total fuel consumptions and fuel consumption factors are calculated by using the proposed VSP binning methods as well as the second-by-second and average travel speed data. Finally, the estimation accuracy of total fuel consumptions and fuel consumption factors based on the three different VSP binning methods are compared for LDVs on urban roads. The study proves that an independent VSP bin at VSP=0 is indeed necessary, which can improve the estimation accuracy on both total fuel consumptions and fuel consumption factors.

In this paper, we explore the use of game engines in hybrid traffic-network simulators. We describe and validate a novel framework based on this approach: Veneris. Our framework is made of a traffic simulator, implemented on the top of the Unity game engine, which includes a realistic vehicle model and a set of driving and lane change behaviors adapted to a 3D environment that reproduces real-world traffic dynamics; a ray-launching propagation simulator on graphics-processing-unit (GPU), called Opal, and a set of modules, which enable bidirectional coupling with the OMNET++ network simulator. The more relevant and novel mechanisms of Veneris are introduced, but further implementation details can be checked on the source code provided in our repository. We discuss the validation tests we have performed and show how it provides accurate results in three key areas: 1) the fidelity of the vehicle dynamics; 2) the recreation of realistic traffic flows, and; 3) the accuracy of the propagation simulation. In addition, the general results of the expected performance are provided.

It estimates the extent of the existing vehicular concentration using ultrasonic sensors, providing different time slots to each road based on traffic density. The proposed system attempts to reduce the probability of traffic jams caused by the unmanaged traffic lights. Another aim is to provide a hassle-free, pre-eminent clearance for the emergency vehicles. In order to do so, we designed a portable remote that uses Bluetooth modules to communicate with the signal controller. The controller responds to the arrival of any such vehicle and acts accordingly. The objective is to reduce the delay of emergency vehicles for reaching the scenes of disaster with minimum possible interruption to regular traffic flow. Moreover, this article aims to incorporate the design of the intelligent street lighting system to endorse the idea of "energy on demand". Conventional street lights in areas with a low frequency of passers-by remain active most of the night without purpose, which is wasting power, consequently. To curb this problem, we advocate the use of Ultrasonic sensors to detect the motion of the automobiles or pedestrians, hence, activating lights when required with optimal energy consumption.

A study of the environmental impacts of intelligent automated vehicle control at intersections via V2V and V2I communications	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Intelligent traffic management; vehicle fuel consumption; vehicle greenhouse gas emissions; vehicle simulation	TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS; CO2 EMISSION; MANAGEMENT; MOBILITY; SAFETY	This article presents a novel intersection traffic management system for automated vehicles and quantifies its impact on fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of CO2 relative to traditional traffic signal and roundabout intersection control. The developed intelligent traffic management (ITM) techniques, which are based on a spatiotemporal reservation scheme, ensure that vehicles proceed through the intersection without colliding with other vehicles while at the same time reducing the intersection delay and environmental impacts. Specifically, the spatiotemporal reservation scheme provides each vehicle a collision-free path that is decomposed into a speed profile along with navigational instructions. The integration of the developed microscopic traffic simulator with instantaneous emission model, provides improved assessments of the environmental impact of traffic control strategies at intersections. The simulator architecture integrates several ITM algorithms, vehicle sensors, V2V/V2I communications, and emission and fuel consumption models. Each vehicle is modeled by an agent and each agent provides information depending on the specific vehicle sensors. The ITM system is supported by V2V and V2I communications, allowing the exchange of information among vehicles and infrastructure. The data include the estimated vehicle position and speed. Compared with traditional traffic management techniques, the simulation results prove that the proposed ITM system reduces CO2 emissions significantly. The research also shows that these reductions are more significant when the traffic flow increases.

J	Kashi, SOM; Akbarzadeh, M				Kashi, Seyed Omid Mousavizadeh; Akbarzadeh, Meisam			A framework for short-term traffic flow forecasting using the combination of wavelet transformation and artificial neural networks	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Artificial neural network; forecasting; traffic flow; wavelet transformation	TIME-SERIES; MODEL; PREDICTION; SYSTEM	The main objective of this paper is to develop a framework for short-term traffic flow forecasting models with high accuracy. Due to flow oscillations, the real-time information presented to the drivers through variable message signs, etc., may not be valid by the time the driver reaches the location. On the other hand, not all compartments of the flow signal are of same importance in determining its future state. A model is developed to predict the value of traffic flow in near future (next 5-35minutes) based on the combination of wavelet transformation and artificial neural networks. This model is called the hybrid WT-ANN. Wavelet transformation is set to denoise the flow signal, i.e., filtering the unimportant fluctuations of the flow signal. Unimportant fluctuations are those that have little or no effect on the future condition of the signal. The neural network is set and trained to use previous data for predicting future flow. To implement the system, traffic data of US-101 were used from Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM). Results show that removing the noises has improved the accuracy of the prediction to a great extent. The model was used to predict the flow in three different locations on the same highway and a different highway in a different country. The model rendered highly reliable predictions. The proposed model predicts the flow of next 5min on the same location with 2.5% Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and of next 35min with less than 12% MAPE. It predicts the flow on downstream locations for next 5min with less than 8% MAPE and for the different highway with 2.3% MAPE.

J	Pun, LL; Zhao, PX; Liu, XT				Pun, Lilian; Zhao, Pengxiang; Liu, Xintao			A Multiple Regression Approach for Traffic Flow Estimation	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Traffic flow estimation; topological and geometrical Properties; correlation analysis; multiple linear regression; random forest	URBAN; NETWORK; PREDICTION; ALGORITHM; SYSTEM; MODEL	Traffic flow information is of great importance for transport planning and related research. The conventional methods of automated data collection, such as annual average daily traffic (AADT) data, are often restricted by limited installation, while the state-of-the-art sensing technologies (e.g., GPS) only reflect some types of traffic flow (e.g., taxi and bus). Complete coverage of traffic flow is still lacking, thus demanding a rigorous estimation model. Most studies dedicated to estimating the traffic flow of the entire road network rely on single to only a few properties of the road network and the results may not be promising. This paper presents an idea of integrating five topological measures and road length to estimate traffic flow based on a multiple regression approach. An empirical study in Hong Kong has been conducted with three types of traffic datasets, namely floating car, public transport route, and AADT. Six measures, namely degree, betweenness, closeness, page rank, clustering coefficient, and road length, are used for traffic flow estimation. It is found that each measure correlates differently for the three types of traffic data. Multiple regression approach is then conducted, including multiple linear regression and random forest. The results show that a combination of various topological and geometrical measures has proved to have a better performance in estimating traffic flow than that of a single measure. This paper is especially helpful for transport planners to estimate traffic flow based on correlation available but limited flow data with road network characteristics.

In this paper, a novel regression framework for short-term traffic flow prediction with automatic parameter tuning is proposed, with the SVR being the primary regression model for traffic flow prediction and the Bayesian Optimization being the major method for parameters selection. First, the preprocessing of raw traffic flow is carried out by seasonal difference to eliminate the non-stationary of the data. Then, Support Vector Regression model is trained by the pre-processed data. In order to optimize the model parameters, the generalization performance of SVR is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). Bayesian optimization determines the parameters configuration of the regression model by optimizing the acquisition function over the GP. Finally, the optimal short-term traffic flow regression model is constructed through repeated GP update and iteratively multiple training of the model. Experiment results show that the accuracy of proposed method is superior to methods of classical SARIMA, MLP-NN, ERT and Adaboost.

Cross-Comparison and Calibration of Two Microscopic Traffic Simulation Models for Complex Freeway Corridors with Dedicated Lanes	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article								Realistic microscopic traffic simulation is essential for prospective evaluation of the potential impacts of new traffic control strategies. Freeway corridors with interacting bottlenecks and dedicated lanes generate complex traffic flow phenomena and congestion patterns, which are difficult to reproduce with existing microscopic simulation models. This paper discusses two alternative driving behavior models that are capable of modeling freeways with multiple bottlenecks and dedicated lanes over an extended period with varying demand levels. The models have been calibrated using archived data from a complicated 13-mile long section of the northbound SR99 freeway near Sacramento, California, for an 8-hour time period in which the traffic fluctuated from free-flow to congested conditions. The corridor includes multiple bottlenecks, multiple entry and exit ramps, and an HOV lane. Calibration results show extremely good agreement between field data and model predictions. The models have been cross-validated and produced similar macroscopic traffic performance. The main behavior that should be captured for successful modeling of such a complex corridor includes the anticipative and cooperative driver behavior near merges, lane preference in presence of dedicated lanes, and variations in desired headway along the corridor.

Fog computing is one of the most efficient paradigms for traffic system control as it enables connecting and analyzing big traffic data to help the control of traffic signals in the appropriate time. There are different optimization methods, which can be used to control traffic signal; one of these is Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, and there is correlation between PSO parameters (particle velocity, position) and traffic parameters (vehicle speed and location). Roundabouts with traffic signals is one of the modern roads infrastructures used to reduce traffic jam. Our objective is to minimize the average delay time in order to decrease the traffic congestion. This paper presents a control strategy called COTSD-PSO for optimizing traffic signaling based on PSO combined with three sub-controllers; this strategy depends on traffic control rules. These sub-controllers are PSO-Jump, PSO-Turn and PSO-Mix depend on two parameters; extension time and urgency degree for the different phases in the traffic cycle. PSO algorithm is applied to optimize the control of the traffic signal network for roundabouts model on fog computing environments using real data from Taif streets in KSA country. The PSO simulation results show that the PSO-Mix has the fastest convergence rate for the optimal solution and the best performance in minimizing the average delay time compared with the other combinations.

In this paper, first, we use a high-dimensional tensor to represent the multi-mode characteristics of traffic flow data, and we make use of the basic operations properties of tensors, such as Tucker decomposition, to study the methods for filling in data, such as ITRM. Additionally, we preprocess the lost traffic flow and abnormal data. At the same time, we study the short-term traffic flow based on the "week-day-time" multi-mode of the traffic flow data. Using the grey model (GM (1, 1)) to predict the same period of the weekly mode, the scrolling grey model (SGM) of the same time period is predicted. For the time mode, a neural network time series of wavelet analysis is used to predict the traffic flow forecast during the same period. Then, the prediction results of the three different models are weighted by the grey correlation analysis method, and then, the coupling prediction model of the three models is obtained. In the end, according to the traffic flow data of the main road of Shaoshan road in Changsha, Hunan, China, we first preprocess the lost data by using the filling algorithm for the tensor data, and then, we make the traffic flow data complete, use the three tensor data modes of traffic flow, and analyze the results. The experimental results show that the coupling prediction model with the tensor model is much better than the single GM (1, 1) model, the SGM and the neural network prediction model.

J	Liu, DQ; Sun, SR; Qian, ZW				Liu, De-Qiang; Sun, Shao-Rong; Qian, Zhi-Wang			Discussion on Critical Factors in Passenger Evacuation based on the Environment Management of Metro Stations - A Case of Shanghai	EKOLOJI			English	Article						environment perspective; evacuation; critical factor	MODEL	The convenient, rapid, and economical metro has become the transportation for people fast moving in the city, releasing the long-term traffic problem, improving the urban traffic flow and function, and enhancing the boom of downtown and the satellite towns. Metro stations therefore become the important nodes for crowds' gathering, dispersion, and transit. The past experience revealed that a lot of passengers could not find reference for evacuation when disasters occurred, but searched routes for evacuation by themselves, to result in delayed evacuation. Moreover, the lack of effective integration of disaster prevention functions of fire disaster rescue, police directing, medical care, and material delivery could easily cause the waste of rescue resources and seriously affect rescue time. Aiming at metro passengers in Shanghai, total 500 copies of questionnaire are distributed, and 378 valid copies are retrieved, with the retrieval rate 76%. The research results are summarized as followings. 1." Public awareness" is mostly emphasized among the evaluation dimensions in hierarchy 2, followed by "environment design" and "policy actions". 2. The overall weight of the evaluation indicators reveals top 5 indicators, among 13 ones, as risk perception, sign system, confidence in government, disaster experience, and smooth traffic flow. According to the results, suggestions are proposed, expecting to enhance the quality of environment safety in metro, guarantee the life safety of metro passengers, and better complete the mass transit safety system.

J	Ji, X; Shao, CF				Ji, Xun; Shao, Chunfu			Modeling and Analyzing Free-Flow Speed of Environment Traffic Flow in Rainstorm Based on Geomagnetic Detector Data	EKOLOJI			English	Article						free-flow speed; rainfall intensity; geomagnetic detector; rainstorm weather; urban traffic	WEATHER CONDITIONS; OPERATIONS; RAIN	Inclement weather, especially rainstorm weather occurs frequently in the world. Rainstorm weather has high-impact on the normal operation of urban road traffic. In order to analyzing the influence of rainstorms on traffic conditions, especially free-flow speed of traffic flow, this paper analyzed the difference of free-flow speed between normal and rainstorm weather using geomagnetic detector data and weather data. Based on matched data, using fitting models, a free-flow speed evolution model with rainfall intensity in rainstorm weather was modelled. This evolution model was appropriate for rainstorm weather, which few research focused on. Then this paper studied the decrease rate of free-flow speed. The results show that in rainstorm weather the free-flow speed decreased while the rainfall intensity increased. The free-flow speed decreased by more than 40% as the rain intensity reached 2.2 mm/min. Furthermore, an inflection point was found in the relationship between the free-flow speed and the storm intensity. The findings of this paper lay the foundation for studying the influence of urban traffic jams caused by rainstorms.

J	Jing, XP; Zhang, X; Xun, SQ				Jing, Xiaopeng; Zhang, Xu; Xun, Siqi			Application of Multi-path Assignment Model of Bicycle Traffic Flow from GIS for Street Space Quality in Ecological Planning Management Information System	EKOLOJI			English	Article						street space quality; the bike; GIS; multipath allocation		The urban ecological planning management information system is a computer integrated application technology system that uses modern theory and methods such as "3S" technology and systems engineering to collect, store, process, retrieve, analyse, display and output urban information. Geographic Information System (GIS) provides fast and effective information acquisition and management methods, thus continuously improving the efficiency and level of planning management. In the past urban construction process, bicycle traffic was attached to the construction of motorized traffic, which caused problems such as poor travel experience and uneven distribution of riding traffic. Based on the rider's preference for the street space environment, this paper analyzes the characteristics of user's travel route selection and explores the influence of street space quality and bicycle travel. Based on the traditional four-stage transportation method, the GIS is used to analyze the bicycle travel data, obtain the bicycle traffic generation volume and bicycle traffic distribution matrix of each traffic community, and then introduce the street space quality elements to improve the traffic distribution stage. According to the principle of distance priority, first construct the shortest path right between any points on the whole network, then define an effective route and assign a multipath probability to the effective route according to the street space quality value. Finally, the traffic volume allocated by each effective road segment is calculated, and the multi-path distribution model of bicycle traffic flow under the guidance of street space quality is established.

NUMERICAL STUDY OF A DIRECT VARIATIONAL DATA ASSIMILATION ALGORITHM IN ALMATY CITY CONDITIONS	EURASIAN JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS			English	Article						variational approach; data assimilation; air pollution transport; numerical modeling; Almaty		Traffic is the primary source of pollution in the city of Almaty. Due to the changing dynamics of traffic flows and a variety of technical conditions of the road vehicles, an accurate accounting of this emission source is a difficult task in the present time. Data assimilation algorithms can be applied to estimate the air quality in this case. The effectiveness of the direct variational data assimilation algorithm with quasi-independent data assimilation at individual steps of the splitting scheme was studied in a realistic scenario of assessing the air quality for the city of Almaty using the synthetic measurement data from the city monitoring network. The data assimilation is carried out by reconstructing the uncertainty (control) function. The cost functional with a stabilizer, including the spatial derivative of the uncertainty function, is minimized. The use of this stabilizer allowed us to obtain the smooth recovered uncertainty functions. This positively affected the quality of pollutant concentration field reconstruction in the scenario with routine pollutants.	[Penenko, A., V; Penenko, V. V.; Pyanova, E.

However, in the face of many external uncertainties, making accurate predictions about traffic volumes is a challenging issue. Many previous types of researche only explore the utility of a single factor in their prediction and rarely conduct the multi-factor research. As for the traffic flow prediction, many past types of researche focus primarily on the temporal distribution of the traffic flow on a single point on the road, ignoring the spatial correlation. In terms of global forecasting, it was logically far-fetched to mechanically view traffic as images. In this paper, considering the effects of many exogenous variables and the interaction between monitor sites, we propose a hybrid model to simultaneously predict the traffic flow in multiple positions by combining the layerwise structure and the Markov transition matrix (MTM). More specifically, we employ the layerwise structure to capture the periodicity, trend, and nonlinearity characteristics of traffic flow and, then, generate the MTM that captures the dynamics embodied in the data and produces the corresponding distributions. Considering the spatial correlation of traffic data, the real road network distance was thus introduced in our model. We apply the methodology on the real-world traffic data from Xiamen, and the experimental results show that the satisfactory predictions can be achieved using our model, which demonstrates the value of the transition matrix in traffic forecasts. In addition, we also introduce the point of interest and analyze its impact on the prediction results.

J	Lee, S; Younis, M; Murali, A; Lee, M				Lee, Sookyoung; Younis, Mohamed; Murali, Aiswarya; Lee, Meejeong			Dynamic Local Vehicular Flow Optimization Using Real-Time Traffic Conditions at Multiple Road Intersections	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Adaptive traffic light control; k-commodity flow problem; traffic flow maximization; dynamic traffic management		Dynamic management of vehicular traffic congestion to maximize throughput in urban areas has been drawing increased attention in recent years. For that purpose, a number of adaptive control algorithms have been proposed for individual traffic lights based on the in-flow rate. However, little attention has been given to the traffic throughput maximization problem considering real-time road conditions from multiple intersections. In this paper, we formulate such a problem as maximum integer multi-commodity flow by considering incoming vehicles that have different outgoing directions. Then, we propose a novel adaptive traffic light signal control algorithm which opts to maximize traffic flow through and reduce the waiting time of vehicles at an intersection. The proposed algorithm adjusts traffic light signal phases and durations depending on real-time road condition of local and neighboring intersections. Via SUMO simulation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of traffic throughput and average travel time.

J	Luo, XL; Li, DY; Yang, Y; Zhang, SR				Luo, Xianglong; Li, Danyang; Yang, Yu; Zhang, Shengrui			Spatiotemporal Traffic Flow Prediction with KNN and LSTM	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK	The traffic flow prediction is becoming increasingly crucial in Intelligent Transportation Systems. Accurate prediction result is the precondition of traffic guidance, management, and control. To improve the prediction accuracy, a spatiotemporal traffic flow prediction method is proposed combined with k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM), which is called KNN-LSTM model in this paper. KNN is used to select mostly related neighboring stations with the test station and capture spatial features of traffic flow. LSTM is utilized to mine temporal variability of traffic flow, and a two-layer LSTM network is applied to predict traffic flow respectively in selected stations. The final prediction results are obtained by result-level fusion with rank-exponent weighting method. The prediction performance is evaluated with real-time traffic flow data provided by the Transportation Research Data Lab (TDRL) at the University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD) Data Center. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model can achieve a better performance compared with well-known prediction models including autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), support vector regression (SVR), wavelet neural network (WNN), deep belief networks combined with support vector regression (DBN-SVR), and LSTM models, and the proposed model can achieve on average 12.59% accuracy improvement.

Societal risk assessment of transportation networks under uncertainties due to climate change and population growth	STRUCTURAL SAFETY			English	Article						Climate change; Population growth; Transportation network; Robust traffic assignment; Risk assessment	BRIDGES; DEMAND; DETERIORATION; MANAGEMENT; IMPACTS	Climate change and population growth can affect the supply and the demand sides of transportation networks, respectively. Rational assessment of societal risk of transportation networks should consider these effects, both of which are uncertain in nature. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to assess societal risk of transportation networks subjected to uncertainties due to climate change and future population growth. The method is posited on a robust traffic assignment model using the expected residual minimization approach. A novel algorithm, combining smoothing method, quasi-Newton technique, and Latin hypercube sampling, is developed for the efficient implementation of the proposed method. The proposed method can produce a deterministic traffic flow pattern that deviates as little as possible from the traffic flow patterns associated with all future scenarios. The obtained traffic flow pattern can then be used to estimate societal risk of transportation networks. A number of examples, including a real-world highway bridge network in Camden County, New Jersey, are provided in this paper to demonstrate the efficiency, effectiveness, and application of the proposed method. It is found from the examples that (a) the proposed method is more efficient and robust than existing algorithms for robust traffic assignment under uncertainties, and (b) climate change and population growth can significantly alter the traffic pattern in a transportation network and thus increase the societal risk posed upon traffic users.

Crash-related data were obtained from the I-880 freeway in California, USA. Combined with the speed contour map, the SCs were identified by the real shock wave speed index and the SC identification index. The random effect logit regression was applied to analyze the significantly contributing factors and their mechanism on the SCs. The results showed that the significantly contributing factors are different between the initial SC model and SC models (Threshold D 20mile/h, 15mile/h, 10mile/h, 5mile/h), except for the variable of the standard deviation of 30s vehicle speed during 5-10 min. In the SC models, the number of significant contributing factors increases with the increase in the threshold value. The results of the elasticity analysis showed that the elasticity values of the hit object crash, wet surface road, the average 30-s vehicle speed during 5-10 min, and the average 30-s vehicle count during 5-10 min are greater than 10%.

We address the issue of feedback stabilization by means of PI boundary controllers. By constructing a new weighted Lyapunov function, the sufficient conditions in terms of matrix inequalities are developed for the exponential stability of closed-loop systems. These results are illustrated by the linearized Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) traffic flow model. We design a PI boundary controller to stabilize the oscillations of the traffic parameters of a freeway segment and evaluate the performance with numerical simulations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the identification of key nodes in existing urban transportation networks has mainly focused on nonweighted networks and the network information of the nodes themselves, which do not accurately reflect their global status. Thus, the present study proposes a key node identification algorithm that combines traffic flow features and is based on weighted betweenness centrality. This study also uses weighted roads to construct an L-space weighted transportation network and an approximate algorithm for betweenness centrality in order to reduce the complexity of the calculations. The results of the simulation indicate that the proposed algorithm is not only capable of identifying the key nodes in a relatively short amount of time, but it does so with high accuracy. The findings of this study can be used to provide decision-making support for road network management, planning, and urban traffic construction optimization.

The architecture consists of three main modules: a pretraining module, which generates initialized weights and provides a rough learning of the features firstly with the training set in an unsupervised manner; a classification module, which performs the data classification operation through adding the logistic regression on top of the pretrained architecture to distinguish the traffic state; and a fine-tuning module, which predicts the traffic flow with supervised training based on the initialized weights in the first module. The classification module provides the fine-tuning modules with two classified datasets for more accurate forecasting. Furthermore, both upstream and downstream data are utilized to improve the prediction performance. The effectiveness of the proposed model was verified by the traffic prediction of the road segments of Nanming District of Guiyang. And with the comparison analysis over the existing approaches, the proposed model shows superiority in short-term traffic prediction, especially under incident conditions.

In recent years, there has been a rapid evolution in the technologies applied to the field of autonomous vehicles. There are currently commercial solutions for assisted driving and semi-autonomous driving systems, with very favorable forecasts for reaching a completely autonomous vehicle scenario in the coming decades. This new environment generates opportunities and challenges to reduce congestion in scenarios with autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles. This paper focuses on the automatic optimization of the passage of vehicles through intersections. The intersections are one of the most conflict-generating elements in a traffic network. This type of conflicts arises because the intersections must manage multiple traffic flows with different priorities and preferences, often leading to traffic jams. The problem has been addressed by proposing three mechanisms to model any type of intersection, to calculate the roads with fewer points of conflict between their inputs and outputs, and to optimize the arrival rate of vehicles using a Genetic Algorithm to achieve the maximum performance of the intersection. To validate this solution, a cellular automata simulator has been developed, which can be adapted to both autonomous and conventional vehicle scenarios and can provide realistic results when certain conditions are met. The results obtained have been compared with other traditional solutions (priority and traffic lights) using microscopic traffic simulations, and with those obtained in other studies showing the advantages of the proposed system. The proposed systems achieve a throughput improvement between 9.21% and 36.98% compared with the traditional solutions.

Also, modeling of crossroad capacity can influence on balancing (symmetry) of traffic flow. Loss of priority in a left turn and optimal dimensioning of shared-short line is one of the permanent problems at intersections. A shared-short lane for taking a left turn from a priority direction at unsignalized intersections with a homogenous traffic flow and heterogeneous demands is a two-phase queueing system requiring a first in-first out (FIFO) service discipline and single-server service facility. The first phase (short lane) of the system is the queueing system M(p lambda)/M(mu)/1/infinity, whereas the second phase (shared lane) is a system with a binomial distribution service. In this research, we explicitly derive the probability of the state of a queueing system with a short lane of a finite capacity for taking a left turn and shared lane of infinite capacity. The presented formulas are under the presumption that the system is Markovian, i.e., the vehicle arrivals in both the minor and major streams are distributed according to the Poisson law, and that the service of the vehicles is exponentially distributed. Complex recursive operations in the two-phase queueing system are explained and solved in manuscript.

In the connected vehicle environment, the information interaction among people, cars, roads, and the environment is significantly enhanced, and driver behavior will change accordingly due to increased external stimulation. This paper designed a Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) on-board unit (OBU) based on driving demand. In addition, a simulation platform for the interconnection and communication between the OBU and simulator was built. Thirty-one test drivers were investigated to drive an instrumented vehicle in four scenarios, with and without the OBU under two different traffic states. Collected trajectory data of the subject vehicle and the vehicle in front, as well as sociodemographic characteristics of the test drivers were used to evaluate the potential impact of such OBUs on driving behavior and traffic safety. Car-following behavior is an essential component of microsimulation models. This paper also investigated the impacts of the V2V OBU on car-following behaviors. Considering the car-following related indicators, the k-Means algorithm was used to categorize different car-following modes. The results show that the OBU has a positive impact on drivers in terms of speed, front distance, and the time to stable regime. Furthermore, drivers' opinions show that the system is acceptable and useful in general.

J	Chung, YS				Chung, Yi-Shih			Multilevel modeling of gap-selection behaviors: Effects of vehicle arrival time and personal walking time projection abilities in mixed traffic conditions	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						Pedestrian safety; Gap selection; Mixed traffic conditions; Vehicle arrival time; Walking time; Multilevel analysis	STREET-CROSSING DECISIONS; AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES; ACCEPTANCE; SAFETY; SPEED; DISTANCE; YOUNG	Previous studies have attributed the relatively high risk of elderly pedestrians to their declining abilities, particularly the ability to estimate their own walking time and time to -arrival of oncoming vehicles. However, how these two abilities affect street-crossing safety in mixed traffic conditions remains unclear. This study conducted a simulation study using filmed real-life traffic to investigate this issue. Repeated measures of gap-selection decision and safety outcomes among 82 adults (42 elderly participants aged 60 years or older and 40 aged between 20 and 45 years) were collected. Two sets of scenarios were developed: one car-one lane simple-flow tasks and multiple vehicle-one lane complex flow tasks. The analysis results demonstrated that in simple-and complex-flow tasks these two abilities are both critical to gap-selection safety; however, pedestrians' reliance on walking-time projection is more consistent than is their reliance on TTA projection when making gap-selection decisions. Although young pedestrians are safer on average than elderly pedestrians, how they respond to oncoming vehicles is similar; in particular, both young and elderly pedestrians tend to select longer gaps even when oncoming vehicles are moving quickly. The responses of the elderly pedestrians were relatively varied and skewed toward being unsafe, and thus their on-average gap-selection performance was inferior to that of the young pedestrians. The benefit of offering countdowns to oncoming vehicle arrivals, as a means of enhancing gap-selection safety, is appropriate when traffic flow is simple but relatively less so in complex-flow scenarios, indicating the importance of considering information overload in countermeasure design.

The resulting longer operation lifetime increase discloses fields of application that require long monitoring periods. This paper presents a structural monitoring system that uses specialized sentinel nodes for detecting possibly heavy road vehicles and for alarming monitoring nodes, which are specialized on strain sensing. Heavy vehicles are identified by estimating nearly in real time height and length of vehicles of a traffic flow by processing data recorded from low-cost ultrasonic and magnetic displacement sensors. Field tests demonstrated that while height detection is very reliable, length detection is too imprecise to discriminate with high success rates between trucks and delivery vans.

Development of Model for Traffic Flows on Urban Street and Road Network	SCIENCE & TECHNIQUE			Russian	Article						road traffic; traffic management; management algorithms; automated traffic management system; intelligent transport system; efficiency; quality; coordinated regulation	FUZZY; CONTROLLER	The paper considers issues pertaining to creation of a model for controlling road traffic with the purpose to minimize delays on street and road network, which is proposed as an innovative one while developing an intelligent transport system of the large city that is Minsk. The developed model has a complex structure of algorithmic support. The first-level model has been implemented on the basis of fuzzy logic, for which a program has been developed and conditions have been determined, and operation of traffic light at a real local intersection of Minsk, which is included in the automated traffic management system, has been simulated. Innovation in the first-level model is an approach in determining conditions while detecting a fuzzy set without using a standard algorithm that is an algorithm of local flexible regulation. The paper proposes and investigates a model that works on the basis of operationally obtained parameters of traffic flow intensity at characteristic points (sections) of street and road network. Efficiency of the first-level model has been equal to 8 % due to optimization of a traffic light cycle (reduction of transport delays during passage of stop lines). Results of the simulation using the proposed computer program have made it possible to improve efficiency of traffic management on the studied highway (Logoysky trakt) in Minsk city of Minsk by 15 % due to decrease of delay level in case of unilateral coordination. The algorithm has been already implemented as part of the current automated traffic management system in the city of Minsk and it has shown its efficiency. However this efficiency can be increased if it is used together with an algorithm for searching maximum volume of motion in a cycle with a distributed intensity pulse. It has been planned to take into account this specific feature when increasing possibilities for algorithmization of traffic management.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely used to optimize traditional data-driven approaches in different areas of the scientific research. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) system together with AI can acquire the information from diverse sources, can expand the driver's perception, and can predict to avoid potential accidents, thus enhancing the comfort, safety, and efficiency of the driving. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the research works that have utilized AI to address various research challenges in V2X systems. We have summarized the contribution of these research works and categorized them according to the application domains. Finally, we present open problems and research challenges that need to be addressed for realizing the full potential of AI to advance V2X systems.

The latter two models have been developed using the most influential input parameters of CALINE4 namely traffic flow and wind-speed observed by both sensitivity analysis and regression analysis studies. The model performance have been estimated and compared statistically with the traffic emitted airborne carbon monoxide (CO), the prevalent meteorology and the temporal distribution of the monitored hourly average CO concentrations in summer time. The study has displayed that the UDM model would generate better predictions as compared to other models for different meteorological and traffic conditions. The complete study reveals that the similarity between the monitored and the modelled CO concentrations have been reasonably satisfactory for UDM and CALINE4 models. Further detailed assessment confirms that the UDM model performed superior in comparison to the CALINE4.

J	Cheng, J; Li, G; Chen, XH				Cheng, Juan; Li, Gen; Chen, Xianhua			Research on Travel Time Prediction Model of Freeway Based on Gradient Boosting Decision Tree	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Different prediction horizons; freeway; gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT); machine learning; traffic flow; travel time prediction	TRANSIT SIGNAL PRIORITY; REAL-TIME	To improve the prediction accuracy of traffic flow, a travel time prediction model based on gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) is proposed. In order to test the applicability of GBDT, models with different prediction horizons (5 min ahead, 10 min ahead, and 15 min ahead) are established. The 11 variables are viewed as candidates in this paper. Different from other machine learning algorithms as black boxes, GBDT can provide interpretable results through variable importance. In the proposed model, the variable importance shows that for different prediction horizons, the most important influence variable is uniform, which is travel time in the current period. Traffic conditions in the current period have the greatest influence on the predicted travel time. Compared with the back propagation neural network model and the support vector machine model, the proposed GBDT model can produce more accurate prediction results, especially in multi-step prediction, indicating that GBDT is a promising method in travel time prediction.

Moreover, this signal control approach has resulted in many safety issues, such as traffic conflicts (a) between the right-turning motorized vehicles and the straight-through bicycles and (b) at the change of phases due to bicycles' clearance failure. Hence, the objective of this paper is to propose a group-based signal optimization model that considers both safety and delay for the intersections with mixed traffic flows. In the proposed model, safety was evaluated based on the traffic conflicts during the inter-green period and was incorporated into the signal timing procedure. A probabilistic approach was developed to estimate the probability of occurrence of conflicts, with a novel safety indicator combining postencroachment time and kinetic energy for measuring conflict severity. The average delay per person, according to the Highway Capacity Manual 2010 method, was adopted in this paper. Then, the multiobjective optimization issue was formulated as a nonlinear program and solved by a Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm. A numerical study was performed to demonstrate the applicability and performance of the proposed model. Results indicated that the proposed model can provide an effective tool for researchers and practitioners to simultaneously optimize traffic safety and efficiency in signal planning. It may also overcome the disadvantages of most of the conventional models, which are incapable of quantifying safety in the optimization process.

A key feature of our approach is considering vehicle arrivals and departures, which results in the total number of vehicles in the system varying over time. This makes our proposed transport system dynamic and more realistic. By theoretically and numerically analyzing a simplified model with two speed states, we show our dynamic model obtains accurate fitted values for predicting traffic flow. Analytic solutions for both speed states and the expected values of traffic flow are obtained. By using traffic flow data from the I-80 Freeway Dataset from the NGSIM program, we make predictions on traffic flow and compare our predictions with those of existing approaches. The results show that our proposed approach provides more accurate predictions of traffic flow; thus, dynamic terms are of great significance in constructing traffic flow models.

J	Lin, F; Xu, YD; Yang, Y; Ma, H				Lin, Fei; Xu, Yudi; Yang, Yang; Ma, Hong			A Spatial-Temporal Hybrid Model for Short-Term Traffic Prediction	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							NETWORK; SPEED	Accurate and timely short-term traffic prediction is important for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) to solve the traffic problem. This paper presents a hybrid model called SpAE-LSTM. This model considers the temporal and spatial features of traffic flow and it consists of sparse autoencoder and long short-term memory (LSTM) network based on memory units. Sparse autoencoder extracts the spatial features within the spatial-temporal matrix via full connected layers. It cooperates with the LSTM network to capture the spatial-temporal features of traffic flow evolution and make prediction. To validate the performance of the SpAE-LSTM, we implement it on the real-world traffic data from Qingyang District of Chengdu city, China, and compare it with advanced traffic prediction models, such as models only based on LSTM or SAE. The results demonstrate that the proposed model reduces the mean absolute percent error by more than 15%. The robustness of the proposed model is also validated and the mean absolute percent error on more than 86% road segments is below 20%. This research provides strong evidence suggesting that the proposed SpAE-LSTM effectively captures the spatial-temporal features of the traffic flow and achieves promising results.

Using georeferenced data on the installation of 1187 calming devices in Portland (OR), I test whether the interventions locally affect housing prices during succeeding years. I provide reduced-form evidence that city dwellers pay significant premiums to limit their exposure to motor vehicles, but obtain mixed results regarding the overall price impacts of calming devices. My estimates suggest that only the most effective traffic calming measures have a detectable impact on housing prices. The implied traffic flow elasticity is -0.07: projects decreasing traffic by 16% raise home values on treated streets by 1%.

Traffic load patterning on long span bridges: A rational approach	STRUCTURAL SAFETY			English	Article						Long span bridges; Traffic loading; Microsimulation; IDM; Congestion; Extreme value theory; Turkstra's rule	MODEL; CALIBRATION; AMERICAN	For highway bridges, current live load models from design standards typically replicate the effects of real traffic streams at a certain return period. Most standards stipulate that the worst load effect should be considered, obtained by patterning the live load on the adverse portion of the influence line only. Certainly, this is a worst-case scenario, but the probability of this occurring is surely very low and daily traffic does not pattern in this manner. This paper examines design standards' approach to load patterning and proposes a relatively simple approach to better reflect the reality of traffic load patterning. As an illustrative example, traffic microsimulation is adopted to simulate the traffic flows on a hypothetical 1200 m bridge. We consider the possible road topologies that might give rise to design standard loading patterns, showing that it is not possible to achieve the code-implied traffic pattern in reality. The load effects results are extrapolated to 5, 75 and 1000 year return periods, representing typical assessment and design return periods respectively. From these results, a rational and practical load patterning method is proposed, based on traffic topologies obtained from an adverse combination of congested and free flow traffic. It is applied to two case study bridges and the results indicate that our proposal can reduce the traffic loading demand by up to 45%. Such reductions can be invaluable in the design of super-long span bridges, or the assessment of existing bridges.

A serious unbalance of traffic flow in the network can speed up pavement deterioration of highways with heavy traffic, which influences the sustainability of pavement performance and increases maintenance expenditures. The purpose of this research is to obtain a more optimized traffic assignment for pavement damage reduction by establishing a multi-objective DTA model with the objectives of not only minimum travel time but minimum decline of Present Serviceability Index (PSI) for pavements. Then, teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is utilized to solve the proposed model. Results of a case study indicate that a more balanced traffic flow assignment can be realized by the model, which can effectively reduce average PSI loss, save maintenance expenditures, extend pavement service life span, save fuel consumption and reduce pollutant emissions in spite of a little increase of average travel time. Additionally, sensitivity of weight factor for the two objective functions is analyzed. This research provides some insights on methods on sustainable pavement performance.

J	Xie, P; Deng, L				Xie, Pei; Deng, Lei			Simulated Analysis of Modeling of Driving Behavior Characteristics Based on Satellite Positioning Data	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND INTELLIGENT INFORMATICS			English	Article						satellite positioning data; driving behavior; modeling of driving behavior characteristics		To promote the road transportation security, it's necessary to study the modeling method of driving behavior characteristics. The traffic flow model realized by current modeling methods of driving behavior characteristics has a low accuracy in warning results. Therefore, based on satellite positioning data, a modeling method of driving behavior characteristics is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the dynamic model and kinetic model of traffic flow are built through the flow, speed and density parameters; then the response time, minimum safe distance and stability parameters of driving behavior are taken as the identification index of driving behavior to identify the driving behavior of drivers; according to the identification results, the psychological field theory and satellite positioning data are combined to build the model of driving behavior characteristics, and finally, warning the drivers according to their psychology and the actual situation of road. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately measure the traffic flow and speed, and the score of drivers' behavior obtained has high accuracy, which verified again the high accuracy of traffic flow model and warning results of the proposed method.

As there is big forecast error when modeling toward traffic flow data with discrete grey model DGM (1, 1), this paper amends the equal interval time sequence. According to the characteristic of time coefficient and backpropagation (BP) neural network, we propose an improved grey model by combining DGM (1, 1) model with BP neural network model. The experimental result indicates that the improved grey model is scientific and effective for the forecasting of traffic flow.

However, the expensive measurement equipment and interference with the traffic flow during the tests are reported as the challenges of the assessment of RSL of pavement. This paper presents a novel prediction model for RSL of road pavement using support vector regression (SVR) optimized by particle filter to overcome the challenges. In the proposed model, temperature of the asphalt surface and the pavement thickness (including asphalt, base and sub-base layers) are considered as inputs. For validation of the model, results of heavy falling weight deflectometer (HWD) and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) tests in a 42-km section of the Semnan-Firuzkuh road including 147 data points were used.

Neural networks related approaches have been applied to develop traffic forecasting models for more than two decades. Since neural networks are sensitivity in parameters selection, selecting appropriate modeling configuration is essential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of traffic flow prediction. However, this is usually conducted by the trial-and-error method, which is very time consuming while involving too many design factors. Therefore, this paper utilizes a robust and systematic optimization approach, the Taguchi method, for obtaining the optimized configuration of the proposed exponential smoothing and extreme learning machine forecasting model. The developed model is applied to real-world data collected from freeways and highways in the United Kingdom and is compared with three existing forecasting models. The results indicate that the Taguchi method is efficient and capable for the forecasting model design and the proposed model with the optimized configuration has superior performance in traffic flow forecasting with approximate 91% and 88% accuracy rate in freeway and highway in both peak and nonpeak traffic periods.

J	Cheng, J; Li, G; Chen, XH				Cheng, Juan; Li, Gen; Chen, Xianhua			Developing a Travel Time Estimation Method of Freeway Based on Floating Car Using Random Forests	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article							URBAN ROAD NETWORKS; PREDICTION; SYSTEM; MODEL	Travel time of traffic flow is the basis of traffic guidance. To improve the estimation accuracy, a travel time estimation model based on Random Forests is proposed. 7 influence variables are viewed as candidates in this paper. Data obtained from VISSIM simulation are used to verify the model. Different from other machine learning algorithm as black boxes, Random Forests can provide interpretable results through variable importance. The result of variable importance shows that mean travel time of floating car t<, traffic state parameter X, density of vehicle Kall, and median travel time of floating car tmenf are important variables affecting travel time of traffic flow; meanwhile other variables also have a certain influence on travel time. Compared with the BP (Back Propagation) neural network model and the quadratic polynomial regression model, the proposed Random Forests model is more accurate, and the variables contained in the model are more abundant.

J	Wang, ZL; Liu, X; Feng, JS; Yang, J; Xi, HS				Wang, Zilei; Liu, Xu; Feng, Jiashi; Yang, Jian; Xi, Hongsheng			Compressed-Domain Highway Vehicle Counting by Spatial and Temporal Regression	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Vehicle counting; hierarchical classification; regression; compressed domain	LOCALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION; OBJECT; TRACKING; NETWORK	Counting on-road vehicles in the highway is fundamental for intelligent transportation management. This paper presents the first highway vehicle counting method in compressed domain, aiming at achieving comparable estimation performance with the pixel-domain methods. Counting in compressed domain is rather challenging due to limited information about vehicles and large variance in vehicle numbers. To address this problem, we develop new low-level features to mitigate the challenge from insufficient information in compressed videos. The new proposed features can be easily extracted from the coding-related metadata. Then, we propose a hierarchical classification-based regression (HCR) model to estimate the number of vehicles from the compressed-domain low-level features for individual frame. HCR hierarchically divides the traffic scenes into different cases according to the density of vehicles such that the large variance of traffic scenes can be effectively captured. Beside the spatial regression in each frame, we propose a locally temporal regression model to further refine the counting results, which exploits the continuous variation characteristics of the traffic flow. We extensively evaluate the proposed method on real highway surveillance videos. The experimental results consistently show that the proposed method is very competitive compared with the pixel-domain methods, which can reach similar performance with much lower computational cost.

J	Zhang, S; Huang, ZX				Zhang, Sheng; Huang, Zhong-xiang			Fractal Analysis of the Relation between the Observation Scale and the Prediction Cycle in Short-Term Traffic Flow Prediction	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						Short-term traffic flow prediction; Observation scale; Fractal theory; G-P algorithm		Based on the analysis of the field traffic flow time series, we found that there is self-similarity and periodic similarity in the traffic flow of different observation scales, which makes the short-term traffic flow prediction a meaningful work. For the purpose of finding the smallest prediction cycle, fractal analysis was conducted in the relation between the observation scale and the prediction cycle by using both the field data and the simulated data. We calculate the fractal dimension and the scaling region of traffic flow time series by using the G-P algorithm. If the scaling region can be found in the traffic flow time series at some observation scale, it means that there is self-similarity in the time series at that observation scale. The minimum observation scale at which there is self-similarity in the traffic flow is the smallest prediction cycle. This observation scale is a prerequisite for judging whether the traffic flow can be predicted or not. This research provides a reference for the short-term traffic flow prediction on expressway and urban road.

The emission factors during green and red are calibrated based on vehicle-specific power (VSP), then three optimisation models are formulated by minimising vehicle delay or traffic emissions and by considering left-turn bays and coordinated signals. The field data from Dalian city of China are used to validate these models. Vehicle compositions include car, medium-size vehicle (MSV) and bus. Carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions are estimated. Three coordinated signal control scenarios are proposed and four simulation experiments are carried out. The results indicate that the emission factor during green is greater than that during red for CO, HC or NOx produced by car, MSV or bus in each lane group on an arterial street; the emissions estimated by the motor vehicle emission simulator model are greater than those calculated by the VSP-based model; and the signal control scenario obtained by minimising total emissions performs better than that obtained by minimising total delay or both of them.

J	Wang, X; Shahidehpour, M; Jiang, CW; Li, ZY				Wang, Xu; Shahidehpour, Mohammad; Jiang, Chuanwen; Li, Zhiyi			Coordinated Planning Strategy for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations and Coupled Traffic-Electric Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS			English	Article						Coordinated planning; charging stations; power distribution network; transportation network; equilibrium	POWER DISTRIBUTION; TRANSPORTATION; GENERATION; MODEL; DEPLOYMENT	The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) calls for an effective planning of charging stations by coupling the transportation network (TN) with the power distribution network (PDN). This paper conducts an interdisciplinary study on the coordinated planning strategy of EV charging stations in a coupled traffic-electric network. A comprehensive planning model is proposed, which determines the optimal expansion strategies for both TN and PDN, including sites and sizes of new charging stations, charging spots, TN lanes, and PDN lines. In TN, we use an unconstrained traffic assignment model (UTAM) to explicitly capture the steady-state distribution of traffic flows. In PDN, operating conditions are described by a linearized DistFlow. Moreover, EV charging demands and interdependency of TN and PDN are characterized by EV charging station location model. To retrieve a global optimal solution, an equivalent mixed-integer linear programming model with UTAM constraints is formulated for the coordinated planning model. Numerical experiments on coupled traffic-electric networks are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the solution method.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the short-term traffic speed forecasting, which takes into account the influence of different traffic attributes, such as traffic flow, traffic speed, road occupancy and traffic density, of adjacent roads on the traffic speed. In addition, in order to obtain the more accurate relation between traffic speed and traffic attributes, we employ the idea of piecewise correlation function and adopt the Jenks clustering method with dynamic programming to determine the segment intervals of relation. We validate our approach based on the real data collected from Wenzhou and Hangzhou, two large cities located in eastern China. The extensive experimental results show that, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, our approach has the higher stability and accuracy, especially for 5-minute and 10-minute speed prediction.

Rail freight's product and service offers have proved to be inappropriate and irrelevant for freight and logistics markets underpinned by wholly different imperatives, requirements and demands compared to bulk low-value commodities. Rail has to re-calibrate its offer to the market in operational, commercial, technical and managerial terms. The paper sets out details of a UK-based study which is examining ways in which a rail/inter-modal offer could be developed and implemented to allow rail to participate in growing inter-urban freight and logistics traffic flows. The study described in the paper is a collaboration between industry, academia and specialist experts. The output if successful could potentially be delivered into other national rail/inter-modal domains.

Research has shown that congestion can be reduced by the application of ramp metering and variable speed limits. Model predictive control is a promising strategy for the optimization of the ramp metering rates and variable speed limits to improve the freeway throughput. However, several challenges have to be addressed before it can be applied for the control of freeway traffic. This paper fiwuses on the challenge of reducing the computation time of MPC strategies for the integration of variable speed limits and ramp metering. This is realized via a parameterized control strategy that optimizes the upstream and downstream boundaries of a speed-limited area and the parameters of the ALINEA ramp metering strategy. Due to the parameterization, the solution space reduces substantially, leading to an improved computation time. More specifically, the number of optimization variables for the variable speed limit strategy becomes independent of the number of variable message signs, and the number of optimization variables for the ramp metering strategy becomes independent of the prediction horizon. The control strategy is evaluated with a macroscopic model of a two-lane freeway with two ON-ramps and OFF-ramps. It is shown that parameterization realizes improved throughput when compared with a non-parameterized strategy when using the same amount of computation time.

In such a trend, detecting vehicles and extracting traffic parameters from UAV video in a fast and accurate manner is becoming crucial in many prospective applications. However, from the methodological perspective, several limitations have to be addressed before the actual implementation of UAV. This paper proposes a new and complete analysis framework for traffic flow parameter estimation from UAV video. This framework addresses the well-concerned issues on UAV's irregular ego-motion, low estimation accuracy in dense traffic situation, and high computational complexity by designing and integrating four stages. In the first two stages an ensemble classifier (Haar cascade + convolutional neural network) is developed for vehicle detection, and in the last two stages a robust traffic flow parameter estimation method is developed based on optical flow and traffic flow theory. The proposed ensemble classifier is demonstrated to outperform the state-of-the-art vehicle detectors that designed for UAV-based vehicle detection. Traffic flow parameter estimations in both free flow and congested traffic conditions are evaluated, and the results turn out to be very encouraging. The dataset with 20,000 image samples used in this study is publicly accessible for benchmarking at http://www.uwstarlab.org/research.html.

In this study, diplomatic information will be produced by using Gipps car-following-model (GCFM). Many researchers have explored the traffic system for the car drivers by avoiding any struggle into the road. For this reason, GCFM is proven to be a very effective car-following model. For analysis of the GCFM, the authors have collected the car-following data from Shanghai-Nanjing Expressway road, China. By using high resolution car-following video, MATLAB software has been used to extract the data in excel. The extracted data are compared with simulation data that has been generated from GCFM car following factor, such as position, speed, gap and headway by using MATLAB software. Here, the simulation data results show that Gipps model can validate with real trajectory data by using Goodness of Fit (Got) model as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

J	Cheng, HM; Huang, H; Zhang, K				Cheng, Huimei; Huang, Huan; Zhang, Kai			Study on the influence of bus front-end intrusion-free distance to the bus moving characteristics	MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTERS IN SIMULATION			English	Article						Public buses; Intrusion-free distance; Two-lane cellular automaton model; Traffic flow simulation	PRIORITY; LANES	Buses are usually loaded with many passengers and cannot start and turn around flexibly while cars are light and maneuverable. Sometimes, cars may cut in front of a bus as long as the gap is available, and buses have to reduce their speed, which affects the traveling speed and smoothness of buses. In order to improve the bus riding quality, this paper proposes a model of setting front-end intrusion-free distance, in which social vehicles are not allowed to cut in. If buses accelerate, the distance from front vehicles can be smaller than the intrusion-free distance. With open boundary conditions, social vehicles and bus departure mechanism were reenacted, and a two-lane mixed traffic cellular automaton model based on different lane changing conditions and whistle effect was established respectively. Simulation results demonstrated that the model reproduced the operation rules of mixed flow on driveways, with good performance in describing lane changing rules. According to numerical simulation, the suggested vehicle changing lane regulation not only accelerated buses, but also increased the average speed of overall passengers, with improved smoothness of road vehicles, and reduced lane changing times and vehicle acceleration and deceleration frequency. It was demonstrated that the front-end intrusion-free distance for public buses can optimize bus operation efficiency.

In this paper, the fundamental diagram of single-file movement is studied by ant experiments and modeling. For ant, single-file traffic is a very important activity. From single-file movement experiments, ant follows the one in front can be observed. It is also observed that the critical density, i.e. the density corresponding to the maximum flow, is larger than 0.5. The flow-density curve present as an asymmetrical arch, which is different to those of traffic flow and pedestrian flow. In order to get insight of the phenomenon, we introduce a multi-grid NaSch (MG-NS) model, based on multi-grid cellular automata model and traditional NaSch (NS) model, to understand the single-file ant trails. The multi-grid method is convenient to refine the time and space, therefore one agent (ant) can occupy multiple grid sites and its movement can be calculated in detail. Based on the model, we get the theoretical relationship between flow and density with varying delay time t(j). It is different from that of traditional NS model and agrees well with the simulation results. In addition, MG-NS model can match the result of ants experiment well with t(j) = 0.25 (n = 4). The smaller the delay time t(j) (larger n) is, the larger the flow, speed and the critical density are. Through stability analysis, the smaller delay time t(j) means agents react faster and can keep the flow in steady state easier. It is also indicated that in the traditional NS model, because the size of grid equals to agent size, the delay time is always equal to or greater than one time step. But for the agent with sensitive response, the traditional NS model will be no more applicable. The MG-NS model proposed overcomes the disadvantages and thus is an improvement to the traditional one, thus can be used to reveal detailed mechanisms of traffic. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Six route guidance strategies were applied in three different two-route scenarios based on the Nagel-Schreckenberg cellular automaton model. The real data of traffic emissions under different vehicle operational modes were used. The simulations of the traffic emissions, the emissions per vehicle, the emissions per unit flux, average travel time per vehicle and the relationship between the emissions per unit flux and the ratio of dynamic vehicles by using six route guidance strategies were obtained. Results showed that mean velocity route guidance strategy (MVS) and congestion coefficient route guidance strategy (CCS) were the best ones. They can effectively reduce the traffic emissions and improve the efficiency of traffic network. In terms of the total emissions, the value of emissions on the symmetrical two-route scenario with two exits was much lower than that on the one with one exit. Finally, we drew two conclusions based on the simulation results: (i) The route guidance strategy based on traffic data of the whole road is beneficial to reduce traffic emissions. (ii) The simpler and smoother road can lead to more reduction of traffic emissions and higher efficiency of traffic network. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

An extended lattice hydrodynamic model is derived on a single-lane road which includes more comprehensive information. The control method is used to obtain the stability of the new model and the critical condition for the linear steady traffic flow is deduced. Moreover the numerical simulations are carried out to verify the advantage of the proposed model with and without the delayed feedback control on a curved road and a straight road. The results are consistent with the theoretical analysis correspondingly. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The main objective of this research is to ensure safe driving while minimizing delay in an intersection without traffic lights. Firstly, an intersection management system, used as an info-collecting-organizing center, assigns reasonable priorities for all present vehicles and hence plans their trajectories. Secondly, a window searching algorithm is performed to find an entering window, which can produce a collision-free trajectory with minimal delay, besides backup windows. Finally, vehicles can arrange their trajectory individually, by applying dynamic programming to compute velocity profile, in order to pass through intersection. MATLAB/Simulink and SUMO based simulations are established among three types of traffic mechanisms with different traffic flows. The results show that the proposed TP-AIM mechanism significantly reduces the average evacuation time and increases throughput by over 20%. Moreover, the paper investigates intersection delay, which can be reduced to less than 10% compared to classical light management systems. Both safety and efficiency can be guaranteed in our proposed mechanism.

Advances in computational power and availability of a large amount of data have paved the way to employ advanced neural network (NN) models for ITS, including deep architectures. There have been various NN-based approaches proposed for short-term traffic state prediction that are surveyed in this article, where the existing NN models are classified and their application to this area is reviewed. An in-depth discussion is provided to demonstrate how different types of NNs have been used for different aspects of short-term traffic state prediction. Finally, possible further research directions are suggested for additional applications of NN models, especially using deep architectures, to address the dynamic nature in complex transportation networks.

For the study we use a combination of open-path remote sensing and in situ measurement techniques that allows us to separate temporal changes and spatial patterns and analyse them separately. Two measurement campaigns have been conducted, one in December 2010 and one in March 2017. Each campaign lasted for a week which allowed us to examine diurnal cycles, weekly patterns as well as spatially resolved long-term changes. We combined a long-path differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) instrument with a cavity-enhanced DOAS and applied several normalizations to the data sets in order to make the different measurement routes comparable. For the analysis of long-term changes we used the entire unfiltered data set and for the comparison of spatial patterns we filtered out the accumulation of NO2 when stopping at traffic lights for focusing on the changes of NO2 spatial distribution instead of comparing traffic flow patterns. For the generation of composite maps the diurnal cycle has been normalized by scaling the mobile data with coinciding citywide path-averaged measurement results. An overall descending trend from 2010 to 2017 could be observed, consistent with the observations of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Environment Protection Department (EPD) air quality monitoring network data. However, long-term difference maps show pronounced spatial structures with some areas, e.g. around subway stations, revealing an increasing trend. We could also show that the weekend effect, which for the most part of Hong Kong shows reduced NO2 concentrations on Sundays and to a lesser degree on Saturdays, is reversed around shopping malls. Our study shows that spatial differences have to be considered when discussing citywide trends and can be used to put local point measurements into perspective. The resulting data set provides a better insight into on-road NO2 characteristics in Hong Kong, which helps to identify heavily polluted areas and represents a useful database for urban planning and the design of pollution control measures.

In this new kind of model, time delay is incorporated into dynamic equation of vehicles. The traffic system is analyzed based on Gerschgorin disk theorem and general Nyquist stability criterion. The sufficient condition for the existence of coupled map car-following model with time delays is given. Considering time delays, the proposed control scheme can be competent to alleviate traffic congestion. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method.

J	Ye, LH; Yamamoto, T				Ye, Lanhang; Yamamoto, Toshiyuki			Impact of dedicated lanes for connected and autonomous vehicle on traffic flow throughput	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Connected and autonomous vehicles; Dedicated lanes; Heterogeneous flow; Cellular automaton	ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; AUTOMATED VEHICLES; CAPACITY; MODEL; DESIGN	This paper presents an application of a recently proposed methodology for modeling connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in heterogeneous traffic flow, to investigate the impact of setting dedicated lanes for CAVs on traffic flow throughput. A fundamental diagram approach was introduced which reveals the pros and cons of setting dedicated lanes for CAVs under various CAV penetration rates and demand levels. The performance of traffic flow under different number of CAV dedicated lanes is compared with mixed flow situation. Simulation results indicate that at a low CAV penetration rate, setting CAV dedicated lanes deteriorates the performance of the overall traffic flow throughput, particularly under a low density level. When CAVs reach a dominant role in the mixed flow, the merits of setting dedicated lanes also decrease. The benefit of setting CAV dedicated lane can only be obtained within a medium density range. CAV penetration rate and individual CAV performance are significant factors that decide the performance of CAV dedicated lane. The higher level of performance the CAV could achieve, the greater benefit it will attain through the deployment of CAV dedicated lane. Besides, the performance of CAV dedicated lane can be improved through setting a higher speed limit for CAVs on the dedicated lane than vehicles on other normal lanes. This work provides some insights into the impact of the CAV dedicated lane on traffic systems, and helpful in deciding the optimal number of dedicated lanes for CAVs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Short term traffic forecasting is very useful to develop a more advanced transportation system to control traffic signals and avoid congestions. Several studies have made efforts for short term traffic flow forecasting for divided and undivided highways across the world. However, all these studies relied on the dataset which are greatly varied between countries due to the technology used for transportation data collection. India is a developing country in which efforts are being done to improve the transportation system to avoid congestion and travel time. Two-lane undivided highways with mixed traffic constitute a large portion of Indian road network. This study is an attempt to develop a short term traffic forecasting model using back propagation artificial neural network for two lane undivided highway with mixed traffic conditions in India. The results were compared with random forest, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor classifier, regression tree and multiple regression models. It was found that back-propagation neural network performs better than other approaches and achieved an R-2 value 0.9962, which is a good score.

Bus Capacity Estimation using Stochastic Queuing Models for Isolated Bus Stops in China	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							DWELL TIME	When serving passengers at a bus stop, a dwelling bus may cause a bottleneck that constrains traffic flow near the bus stop. A major element in bus system capacity is bus stop capacity (veh/h). Therefore, this study proposes a method estimating the capacity of bus stops isolated from the influences of traffic signals and other bus stops. Data collected for the seven most common bus stop configurations in China were used to validate the proposed model. The results indicated that the arrival process obeys a Poisson distribution and the service times fit a lognormal distribution. Stochastic queuing models for both single-berth and multi-berth stops were developed to estimate bus stop capacity and bus delay time. To enable comparison, the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) model for bus stop capacity estimation was also used. The results showed that the proposed method was more accurate and reliable, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 8.44% compared with a MAPE of 17.42% from the HCM method. In addition, the proposed method reduced root mean squared error (RMSE) by 58.8%, mean absolute error (MAE) by 57.9%, and variance of absolute percentage error (VAPE) by 52.6% compared with the values from the HCM model. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted to investigate the effects of bus arrival rate, bus service time, and the number of bus berths on the capacity of bus stops.

The environmental impact of everyday activities is more apparent in developing cities which take longer to adapt to advanced methods of running public transport modes. This study aims to investigate the reduction of bus energy consumption and carbon emissions through bus priority measures in a bus route in the city of Santiago, Chile. Two bus priority schemes are tested in this study: Bus Only Lanes and Bus Signal Priority. The microscopic traffic simulator TSIS-CORSIM is used to quantify the environmental impact of these schemes. The results have shown that both schemes lead to lower fuel consumption and emissions, especially for the bus service. The environmental improvements are mostly apparent at traffic flows below 1000 veh/h, with clear benefits for both the bus service and passenger cars when dedicated bus lanes are included in the road infrastructure.

J	Liang, X; Correia, GHD; van Arem, B				Liang, Xiao; Correia, Goncalo Homem de Almeida; van Arem, Bart			Applying a Model for Trip Assignment and Dynamic Routing of Automated Taxis with Congestion: System Performance in the City of Delft, The Netherlands	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							TRAFFIC-FLOW	This paper proposes a method of assigning trips to automated taxis (ATs) and designing the routes of those vehicles in an urban road network, and also considering the traffic congestion caused by this dynamic responsive service. The system is envisioned to provide a seamless door-to-door service within a city area for all passenger origins and destinations. An integer programming model is proposed to define the routing of the vehicles according to a profit maximization function, depending on the dynamic travel times, which varies with the ATs' flow. This will be especially important when the number of automated vehicles (AVs) circulating on the roads is high enough that their routing will cause delays. This system should be able to serve not only the reserved travel requests, but also some real-time requests. A rolling horizon scheme is used to divide one day into several periods in which both the real-time and the booked demand will be considered together. The model was applied to the real size case study city of Delft, the Netherlands. The results allow assessing of the impact of the ATs movements on traffic congestion and the profitability of the system. From this case-study, it is possible to conclude that taking into account the effect of the vehicle flows on travel time leads to changes in the system profit, the satisfied percentage and the driving distance of the vehicles, which highlights the importance of this type of model in the assessment of the operational effects of ATs in the future.

The potential benefits obtained by applying the proposed control concept are demonstrated for different ACC penetration rates by use of validated microscopic simulation applied to a real motorway stretch where recurrent traffic congestion is created under the current manual driving conditions because of an on-ramp bottleneck. The simulation results demonstrate that, even for low penetration rates of ACC vehicles, the proposed control concept improves the average vehicle delay and fuel consumption by reducing the space-time extent of congestion compared with the case of only manually driven or regular ACC vehicles.

J	Salehi, N; Somers, J; Seibold, B				Salehi, Najmeh; Somers, Julia; Seibold, Benjamin			Off-Ramp Coupling Conditions Devoid of Spurious Blocking and Re-Routing	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW; NETWORK; WAVES	When modeling vehicular traffic flow on highway networks via macroscopic models, suitable coupling conditions at the network nodes are crucial. Frequently, the evolution of traffic flow on each network edge is described in a lane-averaged fashion using a single-class Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model. At off-ramps, split ratios (i.e., what percentage of traffic exits the highway) are prescribed that can be drawn from historical data. In this situation, classic FIFO coupling conditions yield unrealistic results, in that a clogged off-ramp yields zero flux through the node. As a remedy, non-FIFO conditions have been proposed. However, as we demonstrate here, those lead to spurious re-routing of vehicles. A new coupling model, FIFO with queue (FIFOQ), is presented which preserves the desirable properties of non-FIFO models while not leading to any spurious re-routing.

J	Battista, A; Ni, DH				Battista, Anthony; Ni, Daiheng			A Comparison of Traffic Organization Methods for Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							DRONE	Small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS), better known as "drones," have been drastically increasing in ownership and popularity during recent times. While this technology was once restricted to military and hobbyist use, numerous public and private-sector groups have proposed new uses, such as package delivery and firefighting. As the number of sUAS in operation increases, the methods currently utilized to manage sUAS traffic flow are expected to become inadequate; thus, it is necessary to develop an alternate system of sUAS traffic management. This paper proposes a computerized simulation methodology to quantitatively evaluate air traffic management methods based on safety, efficiency, and computational intensity. This methodology is then used to test the current organization method against free competition for available airspace and a freeway-style method of traffic organization known as an "air highway." It was ultimately found that these alternate methods of organization are less foolproof than the current method with regards to safety, but are significantly more practical to implement due to reduced computational intensity; additionally, these methods are sometimes capable of reducing travel time.

J	Chen, RS; Hourdos, J				Chen, Rongsheng; Hourdos, John			Evaluation of the Roundabout Capacity Model in HCM6 Edition and HCM 2010 on a Multilane Roundabout	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								This study evaluated the performance of the new Highway Capacity Manual 6th Edition (HCM6) roundabout capacity model at a multilane roundabout in Richfield, Minnesota. Traffic flow rates and gap acceptance data were collected during 20hours of afternoon peak period traffic over four days. The observed critical headways for the left and right lanes was equal to 4.43 and 3.99s while the observed follow-up headways were 3.05 and 2.96s, respectively. Roundabout capacity curves for both lanes were built through the collected flow information, as well as through the observed headways and the HCM formula. As compared with the field observed results, the default model in HCM6 overestimated the capacity of the study roundabout. The default model in HCM 2010 closely estimated the capacity for the right lane, but overestimated the capacity of the left lane when the circulating flow rate was high. The HCM6 model was calibrated with the observed critical and follow-up headways, as well as by calibrating the intercept of the model using only the follow-up headway. The fully calibrated model overestimated the capacity of the right lane by 7-10% as the circulating flow decreases and overestimated the capacity of the left lane by 7% and 31%. The partially calibrated model overestimated the capacity of the left lane by 6% and overestimated the capacity of the right lane by at most 10% under low circulating flow rate, but it underestimated the capacity by at most 21% under high circulating flow rate.

The 2010 HCM PCE values were estimated by the equal-density method using a FRESIM simulation. It was determined that the truck PCE for level freeway segments was 1.5 for all conditions. In the 2016 HCM, the PCE values were based on VISSIM simulation output at 1 min intervals along a three-lane, 13 mile (8 mile level and 5 mile graded) section of a roadway. It was determined that the truck PCE for level freeway segments was 2.0. It is hypothesized in this paper that the HCM PCE values are not appropriate for the western United States, which consistently experiences truck percentages higher than 25%, the maximum truck percentage published in the HCM PCE table. The HCM PCE procedure assumes that truck and passenger cars travel at the same average free-flow speed on level terrain. However, many heavy trucks in the western United States have speed limiters to improve fuel economy, and therefore travel slower than the speed limit. The interaction of high truck percentages and large speed differences may result in moving bottlenecks when trucks pass other trucks at low speed differentials. This may lead to an increased delay for the following passenger car vehicles. The 2016 HCM PCEs are based on three-lane simulations where the PCE is calculated based on near-capacity flows. This approach might not be appropriate for western states where these conditions rarely exist. This paper examines these effects using data from 1-80 in western Nebraska. The paper develops new PCE values based on the 2010 HCM equal-density approach using calibrated CORSIM and VISSIM simulation models. It was found that the PCE values in the HCM 2010 and HCM 2016 underestimate the effect of heavy trucks on level terrain freeways that experience high truck percentages, and where different vehicle types have large differences in average free-flow speeds.

J	Xu, J; Lin, YZ				Xu, Jing; Lin, Yingzi			Impact of Distracted Drivers on Individual and Group Behavior of Following Vehicles: A Networked Multi-Driver Simulator Study	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							MOBILE PHONE USE; DRIVING PERFORMANCE	As traffic density increases, drivers experience more interaction situations, with a greater need to react and adapt to other road users. Driver distraction as an impairment on road safety and traffic efficiency has been widely discussed. How distracted drivers affect the performance of other drivers and vehicle platoons in traffic flow, however, remains underexplored. This study examines the impact of a low-taskload distraction (cellphone-texting task) not only on the specific distracted driver's behavior, but also how this behavior influences other drivers, individually and collectively as a group, through a networked driving simulation platform. The concept of interactive driving and implications of virtual environments using a networked multi-driver simulation platform were the two major facilitating factors for carrying out this study. The performance indicators from 12 driver groups (three drivers per group) in a car-following situation with a distracted driver involved are analyzed and compared with a no-distraction trial. The results presented show that the impacts of a phone-texting distraction in traffic flow differ when observing drivers individually or as a four-driver platoon. This implementation has the potential to lay a foundation for continued interactive driving experiment design and can serve as an experimental tool for new vehicle technology applications that consider collective vehicle behavior.

J	Gauthier, P; Furno, A; El Faouzi, NE				Gauthier, Pauline; Furno, Angelo; El Faouzi, Nour-Eddin			Road Network Resilience: How to Identify Critical Links Subject to Day-to-Day Disruptions	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS; ROBUSTNESS; VULNERABILITY; METHODOLOGY; CENTRALITY; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEMS	Disruptive events occur on road networks on a daily basis and affect traffic flow. Resilience analysis aims to assess the consequences of such disruptions by quantifying the ability of a network to absorb and react to adverse events. In this paper, we advance a methodological approach based on resilience stress testing and a dynamic mesoscopic simulator. We aim to identify and rank the links most critical to the overall performance of the road network, taking into account the dynamic properties of road traffic and focusing on day-to-day disruptions. As a metric to quantify road network performance in the presence of such disruptions, we use the increase in overall travel cost. We then compare our approach with purely topological approaches. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the different analyzed metrics. We prove that link ranking varies greatly depending on the metric. Specifically, the proposed stress testing methodology can produce very accurate results by taking into account demand and congestion, but requires computationally intensive simulations, being therefore prohibitive even on medium-sized networks. Conversely, purely static topological metrics can be inaccurate if they do not take into account traffic demand and network dynamics. Our study highlights the need for joining traditional traffic-agnostic topological resilience analysis with demand-aware dynamic stress testing techniques.

Micro-Simulation of Truck Platooning with Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control: Model Development and a Case Study	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							IMPACT	Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) systems have the potential to improve traffic flow and fuel efficiency, but these effects are challenging to estimate. This paper reports the development of a micro-simulation model to represent these impacts for heavy trucks using CACC when they share a freeway with manually driven passenger cars. The simulation incorporates automated truck-following models that have been derived from experimental data recorded on heavy trucks driven under CACC, adaptive cruise control (ACC), and conventional cruise control (CC). The simulation includes other behavioral models for lane changing, lane change cooperation and lane use restrictions for trucks to better capture real-world traffic dynamics. The paper explains the calibration of the simulation method for a 15-mile urban freeway corridor with heavy truck traffic and significant congestion. Simulation results for different market penetration rates show that truck CACC improved traffic operations for trucks in terms of vehicle miles traveled, average speed, and flow rate. In addition, truck CACC did not adversely affect passenger car operations and in some locations it even produced considerable improvements in the general traffic conditions.

Traffic flow characteristics deteriorate significantly in reduced visibility conditions resulting in high crash risks. This study applied CV technologies on a segment of Interstate I-4 in Florida to improve traffic safety under fog conditions. Two types of CV approaches (i.e., connected vehicles without platooning (CVWPL) and connected vehicles with platooning (CVPL) were applied to reduce the crash risk in terms of three surrogate measures of safety: the standard deviation of speed, the standard deviation of headway, and rear-end crash risk index (RCRI). This study implemented vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technologies of CVs to acquire real-time traffic data using the microsimulation software VISSIM. A car-following model for both CV approaches was used with an assumption that the CVs would follow this car-following behavior in fog conditions. The model performances were evaluated under different CV market penetration rates (MPRs). The results showed that both CV approaches improved safety significantly in fog conditions as MPRs increase. To be more specific, the minimum MPR should be 30% to provide significant safety benefits in terms of surrogate measures of safety for both CV approaches over the base scenario (non-CV scenario). In terms of surrogate safety measures, CVPL significantly outperformed CVWPL when MPRs were equal to or higher than 50%. The results also indicated a significant improvement in the traffic operation characteristics in terms of average speed.

Multimodal Transportation Network Modeling Based on the Generic Second Order Modeling Approach	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							TRAFFIC FLOW MODELS; VARIATIONAL FORMULATION; TIME	The generic second order modeling (GSOM) approach to vehicular traffic flow combines the traditional kinematic description of traffic with dynamic equations for vehicle attributes. The GSOM model provides a unifying framework for many models in the literature. This framework includes tools such as local supply and demand, discretization, variational formulation, and generic intersection models.The object of the paper is to extend this approach to multimodal modeling of transportation networks. I n multimodal networks two connected but distinct flows co-exist: vehicular and passenger flow. The main idea of the paper is to express the passenger flow as the flow of a specific attribute: the passenger load of vehicles, the unit of which is expressed in passengers per vehicle. Supplementary attributes pertaining to passengers can be added: destinations, activity plans, information availability, passenger category, and so forth. Intermodal poles, stations (bus, taxi, train), and intersections are modeled as nodes. It is shown that the stock variables associated to vehicles and passengers satisfy a system of conservation equations (on links) coupled with a system of ordinary differential equations (in nodes). Boundary conditions and numerical methods are proposed for the resolution of the model. Some examples are given, notably a method for managing a major incident on an automatic train line. The method uses most elements of the model in order to define the control strategy: passenger and train dynamics, station models, and local traffic supply and demand analysis.

Real-Time Magnetic Length-Based Vehicle Classification: Case Study for Inductive Loops and Wireless Magnetometer Sensors in Oklahoma State	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Providing reliable, real-time vehicle volume and classification information is vital for 21st century intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Large vehicles have a major impact on traffic flow, as well as road maintenance. Information about passenger car versus truck volume is crucial for all transportation agencies. The work presented here provides a comprehensive method to develop length-based vehicle classification (LBVC) techniques that could be implemented using inductive loops (IDL) or magnetometer sensors (MAG). Distinctive LBVC schemes were developed to bin vehicles into groups based on structural similarity and statistical characteristics. Data collection, including vehicle magnetic length (VML) estimates using IDL and MAG, was performed at different sites located on Oklahoma highways and rural roadways to capture various traffic characteristics. Video images were utilized as ground-truth for accurate data labeling. Extensive data analyses, including machine learning methods and probabilistic modeling, were conducted to define decision boundaries for developed LBVC schemes. Three scenarios were developed for determining optimal thresholding methods: total classification accuracy maximization, per-group classification error minimization, and equal classification error optimization. Evaluation revealed consistent and accurate performance for all developed schemes. Classification accuracies of 97.70% and 99.00% were reported using MAG and IDL, respectively. The developed classification models are computationally efficient and can provide real-time LBVC data. The models are intended to supplement or replace axle-based data collection methods used throughout Oklahoma.

Despite the general acceptance of the stochastic notion of capacity, limited research has been conducted on how to select a single representative design value from a capacity distribution function. This paper reports the results of an empirical comparison between conventional capacity estimates and those obtained by maximizing the sustained flow index (SFI) for 19 U.S. freeway sections. The SFI is defined as the product of the traffic volume and the probability of survival at this volume. The capacity of each cross-section was estimated by analyzing the speed-flow relationship and applying methods for stochastic capacity analysis. The results show that the optimum volumes obtained by maximizing the SFI estimated in 5-minute intervals correspond well to the 15% probability of breakdown proposed in the Highway Capacity Manual 6th Edition to estimate the capacity from field data. From these results, it was concluded that maximizing the SFI can be considered a preferred approach to estimate a single, representative value of freeway capacity.

Extensive data collection was carried out through field investigations, videography techniques, and perception surveys to inspect which parameters primarily affect the quality of bicycling in the mentioned facilities. As many as 74 road links and 70 intersection approaches of nine different Indian cities were included in the study locations. In addition, the perceived satisfaction ratings of 22,320 on-site bicyclists (i.e., 155 bicyclists from each site) were included in the database. These ratings ranged from 1 to 6 (excellent-worst bicycling conditions), and were used as the array of dependent variable in the model development process. Separate BLOS models were developed for road links and bicycle through movement at signalized intersections through the application of a novel evolutionary artificial intelligence technique, namely multi-gene genetic programming. The link model included eight significant variables in total whereas the intersection model included a total of seven. With compacted structures, both models represented excellent reliabilities in the present context and produced high coefficient of determination (R-2) values of above 0.86 with averaged observations. These models will help traffic planners and engineers to evaluate the service levels of urban bicycle facilities of developing countries. Statistical analysis of modeled parameters has reported that the traffic volume and crossing pedestrians have the highest influences on the quality of bicycle traffic management at urban road links and intersection approaches, respectively.

There is a growing consensus that virtual testing, where simulated AVs are deployed in simulated traffic, will be key for cost-effective testing and optimization. The least mature model components in such simulations are those generating the behavior of human agents in or around the AVs. In this paper, human models and virtual testing applications are presented for two example scenarios: (i) a human pedestrian deciding whether to cross a street in front of an approaching automated vehicle, with or without external human-machine interface elements, and (ii) an AV handing over control to a human driver in a critical rear-end situation. These scenarios have received much recent research attention, yet simulation-ready human behavior models are lacking. They are discussed here in the context of existing models of perceptual decision-making, situational awareness, and traffic interactions. It is argued that the human behavior in question might be usefully conceptualized as a number of interrelated decision processes, not all of which are necessarily directly associated with externally observable behavior. The results show that models based on this type of framework can reproduce qualitative patterns of behavior reported in the literature for the two addressed scenarios, and it is demonstrated how computer simulations based on the models, once these have been properly validated, could allow prediction and optimization of AV impacts on traffic flow and traffic safety.

The extended model equations stem from a recently proposed multi-lane gas-kinetic traffic flow (GKT) model that can simulate lane changes due to vehicle interactions as well as spontaneous ones. The proposed extension that models the effects of ACC/CACC satisfies the time-gap principle of such systems on each lane and allows for consideration of mixed traffic comprising both manual and ACC/CACC vehicles. Numerical simulations are performed for a particular three-lane motorway stretch in the United Kingdom, where recurrent traffic congestion is observed during the morning peak hours, so as to compare the effects of ACC/CACC in the traffic flow conditions with those resulting from manual driving.

Modeling and Evaluating Traffic Flow at Sag Curves When Imposing Variable Speed Limits on Connected Vehicles	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Sag curves, road segments where the gradient changes from downwards to upwards, generally reduce the roadway capacity and cause congestion. This results from a change in longitudinal driving behavior when entering a sag curve as drivers tend to reduce speeds or increase headways as vehicles reach the uphill section. In this research, a control strategy is investigated through manipulating the speed of connected vehicles (CVs) in the upstream of the sag curve to avoid the formation of bottlenecks caused by the change in driver behavior. Traffic flow along a sag curve is simulated using the intelligent driver model (IDM), a time-continuous car-following model. A feedback control algorithm is developed for adjusting the approach speeds of CVs so that the throughput of the sag curve is maximized. Depending on the traffic density at the sag curve, adjustments are made for the speeds of the CVs. A simulation-based optimization method using a meta-heuristic algorithm is employed to determine the critical control parameters. Various market penetration rates for CVs are also considered in the simulations.

The proposed system employs an off-line transit-based progression system to produce the base signal plan, in which is embedded a feature to minimize the negative effects of local TSP implementation on non-priority movements at critical intersections. With its specially designed evaluation function, the proposed system is capable of minimizing the ineffective activation of local TSP which often results in undesirable patterns of traffic arriving at the next intersection downstream and excessive delays for all vehicles. Extensive evaluation with simulation experiments confirms that the proposed system, integrating a local TSP with the transit-based signal progression system, can indeed circumvent the deficiencies of conventional TSP controls and produce the expected benefits to both passenger cars and transit vehicles over the entire arterial road.

A Spatial-Temporal Multitask Collaborative Learning Model for Multistep Traffic Flow Prediction	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Traffic flow prediction is a fundamental capability for successful deployment of intelligent transportation systems. Traditionally, multiple related prediction tasks are undertaken individually, without considering the relationships among the tasks. This paper presents a spatial-temporal multitask collaborative learning model for multistep traffic flow prediction. The novel approach learns multiple related prediction tasks collaboratively by extracting and utilizing appropriate shared information across tasks. First, each traffic flow prediction problem is formulated as a supervised machine-learning task. Next, the sparse features shared across multiple tasks are learned by solving a regularized optimization problem. To deal with the non-convex and non-smooth challenges, the optimization problem is then transformed into an equivalent convex problem. Finally, the global optimal solution of the convex problem is found by solving a variation of this problem using an alternating minimization algorithm. The proposed model incorporates both the spatial correlation between different observed stations and the intrinsic relationship between different traffic flow parameters, as well as the coarse-grain temporal correlation between different days in a week and the fine-grain temporal correlation between different prediction steps. Application of the proposed model to a real case study for SR180-E freeway in Fresno, California showed its effectiveness, robustness and advantages for multistep traffic flow prediction.

This question has still not been answered satisfactorily in practice. Without knowing the true effect a work activity has on traffic, practitioners are forced to make assumptions while scheduling work. This paper attempts to answer this question by studying the traffic flow characteristics, that is, traffic speed versus flow curves, capacity reduction factors, and free-flow speed reduction factors, for various activities related to construction and maintenance. The importance of the speed-flow curves and reduction factors for work zone planning is also stressed in the latest edition of the Transportation Research Board's Highway Capacity Manual. This manual recommends capacity and speed reduction factors for work zones, yet does not include specific guidance for including the impact of work activities. Thre e traffic stream models, Gipps, Newell-Franklin, and Van Aerde, were calibrated using field data from St. Louis, Missouri. The Van Aerde model fitted the field data the best as compared to the other two models. Using the Van Aerde model-generated speed-flow curves, it was found that the capacity for bridge-related activities varied from 1,416 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) to 1,656 vphpl and for pavement-related activities from 1,120 vphpl to 1,728 vphpl. The capacity reduction factor for different work activities was found to be in the range 0.68 to 0.95, whereas the free-flow speed reduction factor was found to be in the range 0.78 to 1.0. The methodology proposed in this paper contributes toward the development of practitioner guidance and incorporation of work activity effects into traffic impact assessment tools.

J	Roy, A; Hossain, M; Muromachi, Y				Roy, Ananya; Hossain, Moinul; Muromachi, Yasunori			Enhancing the Prediction Performance of Real-Time Crash Prediction Models: A Cell Transmission-Dynamic Bayesian Network Approach	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							TRAFFIC SENSOR-LOCATION	Predicting crash probability in real time is a concept that has inspired studies into complex modeling methods, exploring more sophisticated data collection methods, reducing specification errors by introducing new traffic variables, etc. Most existing real-time crash prediction models (RTCPMs) are based on loop detector data and the model architecture, and their prediction performances are sensitive to the location and layout of detectors with respect to crashes, that is, the spacing of detectors on the road section. Different expressways/freeways have different detector layouts and these vary substantially even within the same expressway/freeway. This limitation is a major obstacle in developing a universal RTCPM. To address this, this paper takes one-minute aggregated loop detector data along with detector layouts as input and employs a cell transmission model (CTM) to interpolate states of traffic flow variables for a pre-defined hypothetical detector layout. Next, several RTCPMs are constructed using Bayesian networks (BNs) and dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) for existing and CTM-based detector layouts. It is observed that the CTM can generate traffic flow parameters with a mean percentage error of 12.96%. The results further suggest that the model constructed with the CTM-based uniformly spaced simulated detector data coupled with the DBN method performed better than the model based on the BN and existing non-uniform detector layout.

As travel demand approaches the capacity of an existing facility, implementation of an appropriate TTC strategy is increasingly important not only because lane closures on these facilities exacerbate existing delay, but also because speeds associated with congestion contribute disproportionately and non-linearly to roadway emissions produced throughout the lifetime of the roadway. To enable stakeholders to make informed and transparent decisions on selecting a TTC strategy so as to balance the trade-offs among construction cost, traffic delay, and energy consumption, this paper discusses the development of an integrated model that identifies the Pareto-optimal front when construction start time, construction duration, lateral clearance, and width of shoulder borrowed as a through lane are considered as decision variables. A test implementation of the model suggests that when construction budgets are low, strategies for decreasing traffic delay differ significantly from those for decreasing energy consumption; however, as construction budgets increase, the objectives on traffic delay and energy consumption align much better.

J	Dabiri, S; Kompany, K; Abbas, M				Dabiri, Sina; Kompany, Kianoush; Abbas, Montasir			Introducing a Cost-Effective Approach for Improving the Arterial Traffic Performance Operating Under the Semi-Actuated Coordinated Signal Control	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEM	The semi-actuated coordinated operation mode is a type of signal control where minor approaches are placed with detectors to develop actuated phasing while major movements are coordinated without using detection systems. The objective of this study is to propose a cost-effective approach for reducing delay in the semi-actuated coordinated signal operation without incurring any extra costs in terms of installing new detectors or developing adaptive controller systems. We propose a simple approach for further enhancing a pre-optimized timing plan. In this method, the green splits of non-coordinated phases are multiplied by a factor greater than one. In the meantime, the amount of green time added to the non-coordinated phases is subtracted from the coordinated phases to keep the cycle length constant. Thus, if the traffic demand on the side streets exceeds the expected traffic flow, the added time in the non-coordinated phase enables the non-coordinated phases to accommodate the additional traffic demand. A regression analysis is implemented so as to identify the optimal value of the mentioned factor, called actuated factor (ActF). The response variable is the average delay reduction (seconds/vehicle) of the simulation runs under the proposed signal timing plan compared with the simulation runs under the pre-optimized timing plan, obtained through the macroscopic signal optimization tools. External traffic movements, left-turn percentage, and ActF are the explanatory variables in the model. Results reveal that the ActF is the only significant variable with the optimal value of 1.15 that is applicable for a wide range of traffic volumes.

J	Hou, Y; Edara, P				Hou, Yi; Edara, Praveen			Network Scale Travel Time Prediction using Deep Learning	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							TRAFFIC FLOW PREDICTION	In recent years, deep learning models have been receiving increased attention within the artificial intelligence (AI) community because of their high prediction accuracy. In this paper, two deep learning models, long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN), are proposed to predict travel time in a road network. One major advantage of using deep learning for travel time prediction is that it can make accurate predictions for all the segments in the transportation network with a single model structure, instead of building customized models for each segment separately. The proposed models were evaluated on a transportation network in the City of Saint Louis, Missouri. The prediction results show that deep learning can provide accurate prediction for both congested and uncongested traffic conditions, and can successfully capture the traffic dynamics of unexpected incidents or special events. The study findings show that deep learning offers a promising approach to real-time prediction of travel times on a network scale.

With the involvement of multiple vehicle classes, high-resolution trajectory data is necessary for exploring vehicle-ollowing, lateral movement, and seeping behavior under varying traffic flow states. An access-controlled, mid-block road section was selected for video data collection under varying traffic flow conditions. Using a semi-automated image processing tool, vehicular trajectory data was developed for three different traffic states. Micro-level behavior such as lateral placement of vehicles as a function of speed, instant responses, vehicle-following behavior, and hysteresis phenomenon were evaluated under different traffic flow states. It was found that lane-wise behavior degraded with increase in traffic volume and vehicles showed a propensity to move towards the median at low flow and towards the curb-side at moderate and heavy flows. Further, vehicle-following behavior was also investigated and it was found that with increase in flow level, vehicles are more inclined to mimic the leader vehicle's behavior. In addition to following time, perceiving time of subject vehicle for different leading vehicles was also evaluated for different vehicle classes. From the analysis, it was inferred that smaller vehicles are switching their leader vehicles more often to escape from delay, resulting in less following and perceiving time and aggressive gap acceptance. The present research work reveals the need for high-quality, micro-level data for calibrating driving behavior models under mixed traffic conditions.

J	Park, HC; Kim, DK; Kho, SY				Park, Ho-Chul; Kim, Dong-Kyu; Kho, Seung-Young			Bayesian Network for Freeway Traffic State Prediction	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							FLOW PREDICTION	Traffic state prediction is an important issue in traffic operations. One of the main purposes of traffic operations is to prevent a flow breakdown. Therefore, it is necessary to predict the traffic state in such a way as to reflect the stochastic process of traffic flow. To predict accurately the traffic state, machine learning-based models have been widely adopted, but they have difficulty in obtaining insights for traffic state prediction due to black-box procedures of the models. A Bayesian network (BN) is a methodology that is suitable for dealing with problems that involve uncertainty, and it can also improve the understanding of such problems. In this study, we develop a traffic state prediction model using a BN to reflect the dynamic and stochastic characteristics of traffic flow. To improve the BN, which has been used with a simple structure in transportation problems, we propose a modeling procedure using a mixture of Gaussians (MoGs). In the performance evaluation, the BN has better performance than a logistic regression, and it has the same level of performance as an artificial neural network based on machine learning. Also, by performing sensitivity analyses, we provide the understanding of traffic state prediction and the guidelines for improving the model. The BN developed in this study can be considered as a traffic state prediction model with good prediction accuracy and interpretability.

J	Hartmann, M; Vortisch, P				Hartmann, Martin; Vortisch, Peter			A German Passenger Car and Heavy Vehicle Stock Model: Towards an Autonomous Vehicle Fleet	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							ELECTRIC VEHICLES; MARKET	Automated vehicles are becoming a reality. Many pilot projects have already begun demonstrating the technological capabilities, as public authorities now allow the testing of automated vehicles in real traffic. To smooth the transition from a conventional to an automated fleet, effective fiscal and regulatory policies must be developed by governmental agencies. But at what rate will automated vehicles actually be adopted, and what automation technology will be available for use in new cars joining the national fleet? A national vehicle stock model can be used to answer these questions and to observe the aggregate impact of governmental policies on individual vehicle purchase decisions. In this paper, we present a passenger car and heavy vehicle stock cohort model that forecasts the diffusion of automation technology in Germany. The model uses national data on vehicle stock and vehicle utilization patterns on German freeways and predicts market shares of generic automation levels in predefined instances of a trend scenario. Results point toward market saturation of automated vehicles beyond 2050, with almost 90% of the passenger car fleet being classified as at least partially automatized by this date. The results also suggest that technology diffusion will be faster in the heavy vehicle fleet than in the passenger car fleet. This implies a positive correlation between emission-linked road user charges for heavy vehicles on the freeway network and the renewal rate of the heavy vehicle fleet. The forecast shares of automated vehicles can be used as an input for traffic flow simulations or as a basis for those infrastructure measures and traffic policies that are sensitive to the share of automated vehicles.

J	Marshall, NL				Marshall, Norman L.			Forecasting the impossible: The status quo of estimating traffic flows with static traffic assignment and the future of dynamic traffic assignment	RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Roadway expansion proposals are evaluated primarily with travel time metrics including vehicle hours traveled (VHT) and vehicle hours of delay (VHD). Travel time metrics have been criticized for ignoring other travel modes, over-emphasizing mobility over accessibility, and failing to account for economic externalities. However, there is an even more fundamental problem. The travel time metrics are inaccurate because they rely on Static Traffic Assignment (STA), a 40-year old approach that routinely forecasts unfeasible future traffic flows that exceed capacity. Basing metrics on these impossible volumes produces invalid results. The common practice of exporting link volumes or subarea trip tables to microsimulation fails to address the STA problem because the unrealistically high STA traffic forecasts are forced onto a capacity-constrained network. Inaccurate travel time modeling helps to explain why so many roadway projects fail to deliver promised travel time savings. Replacing STA with Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) produces more realistic metrics. A case study from the Portland Maine region is presented where STA and DTA are compared with the same inputs. The DTA model fits base year count traffic count much better. The DTA model produces more much lower and more realistic estimates of congestion relief from freeway widening.

J	Khansari, ER; Tabibi, M; Nejad, FM				Khansari, Ehsan Ramezani; Tabibi, Masoud; Nejad, Fereidoon Moghadas			Studying Non-coaxiality in Non-lane-based Car-following Behavior	CIVIL ENGINEERING JOURNAL-TEHRAN			English	Article						Non-Lane-Based Behavior; Car-Following; Traffic Engineering; Overtaking Behavior	GAP MAINTAINING BEHAVIOR; VEHICLES; MODELS	In this paper, in order to study non-lane-based car-following, the non-coaxiality concept is defined, where there is a significant lateral difference between the leader and follower vehicle. Two main reasons for non-coaxiality were addressed by drivers in the interview: providing more visible distances beyond leader vehicle and increasing the possibility of escaping in sudden brakes to avoid rear-end collision. Results showed that non-lane-based behavior was due to the effect of the existence of other cars in the traffic flow. By reducing speed or increasing density, vehicles more affect each other. But this trend will continue up until vehicles fill the free spaces. In other words, vehicles make others stick to the leader's path in high-density flow. Studying the relationship between lateral distance and time headway demonstrated that time headway threshold for initiation of car-following behavior in Iranian drivers can be approximately 2 seconds. In this study, Overtaking was defined as a part or continuation of the non-lane-based driving behavior. For overtaking on the left, steering angle, the final lateral distance and the lateral speed difference between the follower and leader were 33%, 28% and 15% less than overtaking on the right.

The resource composition of urban road traffic system is analysed, and the road network is proved as a scarce resource in the system resource combination. According to the role of scarce resources, the decisive role of road capacity in urban traffic is inferred. Then the new academic viewpoint of wasteful transport was proposed. Through in-depth research, the paper defines the definition of wasteful transport and expounds its connotation. Through the flow-density relationship analysis of urban road traffic survey data, it is found that there is a clear boundary between normal and wasteful transport in urban traffic flow. On the basis of constructing the flow-density relationship model of road traffic, combined with investigation and analysis, the quantitative estimation method of wasteful transport is established. An empirical study on the traffic conditions of the Guoding section of Shanghai shows that there is wasteful transport and confirms the correctness of the wasteful transport theory and method. The research of urban wasteful transport also reveals that: (1) urban road traffic is not always effective; (2) traffic flow exceeding road capacity is wasteful transport, and traffic demand beyond the capacity of road capacity is an unreasonable demand for customers; (3) the explanation that the traffic congestion should apply the comprehensive theory of traffic engineering and resource economics; and (4) the wasteful transport theory and method may be one of the methods that can be applied to alleviate traffic congestion.

Exploring Traffic Congestion on Urban Expressways Considering Drivers' Unreasonable Behavior at Merge/Diverge Sections in China	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						urban expressway; cell transmission model; mandatory merge; merge section; diverge section	MODEL; RAMPS	The mechanisms of traffic congestion generation are more than complicated, due to complex geometric road designs and complicated driving behavior at urban expressways in China. We employ a cell transmission model (CTM) to simulate the traffic flow spatiotemporal evolution process along the expressway, and reveal the characteristics of traffic congestion occurrence and propagation. Here, we apply the variable-length-cell CTM to adapt the complicated road geometry and configuration, and propose the merge section CTM considering drivers' mandatory lane-changing and other unreasonable behavior at the on-ramp merge section, and propose the diverge section CTM considering queue length end extending the expressway mainline to generate a dynamic bottleneck at the diverge section. In the new improved CTM model, we introduce merge ratio and diverge ratio to describe the effect of driver behavior at the merge and diverge section. We conduct simulations on the real urban expressway in China, with results showing that the merge section and diverge section are the original location of expressway traffic congestion generation, and on/off-ramp traffic flow has a great effect on the expressway mainline operation. When on-ramp traffic volume increases by 40%, the merge section delay increases by 35%, and when off-ramp capacity increases by 100 veh/hr, the diverge section delay decreases about by 10%, which proves the strong interaction between expressway and adjacent road networks. Our results provide the underlying insights of traffic congestion mechanism in urban expressway in China, which can be used to better understand and manage this issue.

J	Wang, X; Zhao, P; Tao, YY				Wang, Xiang; Zhao, Po; Tao, Yanyun			Evaluating Impacts of Overloaded Heavy Vehicles on Freeway Traffic Condition by a Novel Multi-Class Traffic Flow Model	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						freeway traffic operation and management; multi-class traffic flow model; analytical method; overloaded HVs	FUNDAMENTAL DIAGRAM; CAPACITY	Overloaded heavy vehicles (HVs) have significant negative impacts on traffic conditions due to their inferior driving performance. Highway authorities need to understand the impact of overloaded HVs to assess traffic conditions and set management strategies. We propose a multi-class traffic flow model based on Smulders fundamental diagram to analyze the influence of overloaded HVs on traffic conditions. The relationship between the overloading ratio and maximum speed is established by freeway toll collection data for different types of HVs. Dynamic passenger car equivalent factors are introduced to represent the various impacts of overloaded HVs in different traffic flow patterns. The model is solved analytically and discussed in detail in the appendices. The model validation results show that the proposed model can represent traffic conditions more accurately with consideration for overloaded HVs. The scenario tests indicate that the increase of overloaded HVs leads to both a higher congestion level and longer duration.

As an important basis for path planning optimization, the travel time prediction method has attracted much attention. However, traffic flow has features of high nonlinearity, time-varying, and uncertainty, which makes it hard for prediction method with single feature to meet the accuracy demand of intelligent transportation system in big data environment. In this paper, the historical vehicle Global Positioning System (GPS) information data is used to establish the traffic prediction model. Firstly, the Clustering in QUEst (CLIQUE)-based clustering algorithm V-CLIQUE is proposed to analyze the historical vehicle GPS data. Secondly, an artificial neural network (ANN)-based prediction model is proposed. Finally, the ANN-based weighted shortest path algorithm, A-Dijkstra, is proposed. We used mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to evaluate the predictive model and compare it with the predicted results of Average and support regression vector (SRV). Experiments show that the improved ANN path planning model we proposed can accurately predict real-time traffic status at the given location. It has less relative error and saves time for users' travel while saving social resources.

The formation and growth of oscillations have been analyzed and compared with that in low speed situations. It was found that there is considerable heterogeneity for the same driver over different runs of the experiment. This infra-driver heterogeneity was quantitatively depicted by a new index and incorporated in an enhanced two-dimensional intelligent driver model. Using both the new high-speed and the previous low-speed experimental data, the new and three existing models were calibrated. Simulation results show that the enhanced model outperforms the three existing car-following models that do not take into account this intra-driver heterogeneity in reproducing the essential features of the traffic in the experiments.

Thus, it is vital for transit agencies to deploy adaptive strategies to respond to changes in demand or supply in a timely manner, and prevent unwanted deterioration in service quality. In this paper, a real time prediction methodology, based on univariate and multivariate state-space models, is developed to predict the short-term passenger arrivals at transit stations. A univariate state-space model is developed at the station level. Through a hierarchical clustering algorithm with correlation distance, stations with similar demand patterns are identified. A dynamic factor model is proposed for each cluster, capturing station interdependencies through a set of common factors. Both approaches can model the effect of exogenous events (such as football games). Ensemble predictions are then obtained by combining the outputs from the two models, based on their respective accuracy. We evaluate these models using data from the 32 stations on the Central line of the London Underground (LU), operated by Transport for London (TfL). The results indicate that the proposed methodology performs well in predicting short-term station arrivals for the set of test days. For most stations, ensemble prediction has the lowest mean error, as well as the smallest range of error, and exhibits more robust performance across the test days.

This paper presents a data analytics framework for high-fidelity characterization of air traffic flows from large-scale flight tracking data. Machine learning methods are used to exploit spatiotemporal patterns in aircraft movement towards the identification of trajectory patterns and traffic flow patterns. The outcomes and potential impacts of this framework are demonstrated with a comparative analysis of terminal area operations in three representative multi-airport (metroplex) systems of the global air transportation system: New York, Hong Kong and Sao Paulo. As a descriptive tool for systematic analysis of the flow behavior, the framework allows for cross-metroplex comparisons of terminal airspace design, utilization and traffic performance. Novel quantitative metrics are created to summarize metroplex efficiency, capacity and predictability. The results reveal several structural, operational and performance differences between the multi-airport systems analyzed. Our findings show that New York presents the most complex airspace design, with considerably higher number of routes and interactions between them, as well as more dynamic changes in the terminal area flow structure during the day, in part driven by the presence of flow dependencies. Interestingly, it exhibits the best levels of traffic flow efficiency on average, both spatially and temporally, yet the highest variability in metroplex configuration performance, with more pronounced performance degradation during inclement weather.

This theoretical approach focuses on the situational and temporal characteristics of criminal opportunity rather than on the offender's behavior for crime prevention. In the scope of road safety and traffic crashes, few studies have adopted this approach. This study used risk terrain modeling (RTM), developed by the Rutgers Center on Public Security, to determine the relative importance of varying environmental risk factors on alcohol-related crashes and traffic accidents. The independent variables consisted of a set of potential environmental risk factors, while the dependent variable comprised all DWI crashes and traffic accidents in the province of Cadiz in 2012. According to the results of the current study, restaurant locations are spatially associated with the occurrence of drunk driving crashes, while proximity restaurants and recreational lodging centers correlate with the sites of traffic accidents.

Stability analysis and variable speed limit control of a traffic flow model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Cell transmission model; Variable speed limit; Stability	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; LANE CHANGE CONTROL; COMMUNICATION-SYSTEMS; VEHICLE AUTOMATION; OPTIMIZATION	The cell transmission traffic flow model (CTM) has attracted considerable interest in the field of transportation due to its simplicity as well as the ability to capture most of the macroscopic traffic flow characteristics. The stability properties of the CTM under different demand and capacity constraints are not always obvious. In addition, the impact of microscopic phenomena such as forced lane changes at bottlenecks leading to capacity drop is not captured by the CTM. In this paper, we start with a single section and modify the CTM to account for capacity drop. We analyze the stability properties of the CTM under all possible demand and capacity constraints as well as all possible initial density conditions. The analysis is used to motivate the design of variable speed limit (VSL) control to overcome capacity drop and achieve the maximum possible flow under all feasible traffic situations. The results are extended to multiple sections, where the stability properties of the open-loop system are analyzed and a VSL control scheme is designed and shown to achieve the objective of maximizing the traffic flow under different demand and capacity constraints. Unlike the open loop system where an infinite number of equilibrium points exist under certain demand levels, the proposed nonlinear VSL scheme guarantees exponential convergence to a unique equilibrium point that corresponds to maximum possible flow and speed under all possible demand levels and capacity constraints.

J	Yildirimoglu, M; Sirmatel, II; Geroliminis, N				Yildirimoglu, Mehmet; Sirmatel, Isik Ilber; Geroliminis, Nikolas			Hierarchical control of heterogeneous large-scale urban road networks via path assignment and regional route guidance	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Hierarchical control; Route guidance; Model predictive control; Macroscopic fundamental diagram; Large-scale urban networks	PERIMETER CONTROL; FUNDAMENTAL DIAGRAM; CONGESTION; FLOWS	High level of detail renders microscopic traffic models impractical for control purposes and local control schemes cannot coordinate actions over large scale heterogeneously congested urban networks. Developing efficient models and control methods for large-scale urban road networks is, therefore, an important research challenge. Alleviating congestion via manipulation of traffic flows or assignment of vehicles to specific paths has a great potential in achieving efficient network usage. Motivated by this fact, this paper proposes a hierarchical traffic management system. The upper-level route guidance scheme builds a model predictive control (MPC) scheme and optimizes network performance based on actuation via regional split ratios, whereas the lower-level path assignment mechanism develops an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation and recommends subregional paths for vehicles to follow, satisfying the regional split ratios in order to achieve said performance. Simulation results from a 49-subregion or 7-region network shows a great potential of the proposed scheme in achieving coordination and efficient use of network capacity, leading to increased mobility.

J	Ma, T; Zhou, Z; Antoniou, C				Ma, Tao; Zhou, Zhou; Antoniou, Constantinos			Dynamic factor model for network traffic state forecast	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Dynamic factor model; Latent factor; Dimension reduction; Sparse vector autoregressive; EM algorithm; Kalman filter; Network traffic state forecast; Spatial correlation; Forecast for groups of locations	TRAVEL-TIME PREDICTION; CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; SPACE NEURAL-NETWORKS; FLOW PREDICTION; KINEMATIC WAVES; ONLINE CALIBRATION; ERROR-CORRECTION; URBAN NETWORK; UNIT-ROOT; SERIES	We propose a dynamic factor model to forecast traffic state for groups of locations. The model decomposes the grouped traffic time series into the latent common factor component and idiosyncratic component. It uses a few latent factor series to represent the co-movement of the underlying dynamics of grouped traffic flows, and idiosyncratic component to represent location-specific traffic characteristics. The dynamic factor model is estimated by the maximum likelihood method via an iterative EM (expectation maximization) algorithm. The traffic state forecast for each location is a combination of the respective forecast from the common factor component and idiosyncratic component. The dynamic factor model exhibits four advantages. It provides an excellent way to (1) seamlessly incorporate spatial correlations among grouped traffic flows into forecast; (2) produce forecast simultaneously for group locations; (3) perform dimension reduction such that high dimension grouped traffic time series can be modeled at a low-dimension space; (4) consider not only location-specific information but also global common dynamics in the forecast Meanwhile, it also has capacity to accommodate typical characteristics of traffic flows including temporal correlation, seasonality, structural change in mean and/or covariance function, and cointegration. Forecast accuracy is significantly improved across highway network as well as urban road network in comparison with the Sparse VAR and ARIMA models. The proposed method is suitable for large-scale network traffic forecast in the context of big data environment This research provides sufficient evidence that justified the importance and efficacy of spatial correlation for predictive accuracy and attempts to fill the gaps in literature of traffic forecast for groups of locations.

Analysis of Automotive Cyber-Attacks on Highways Using Partial Differential Equation Models	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL OF NETWORK SYSTEMS			English	Article						Control of distributed parameter systems; cyber-attack modeling; macroscopic traffic analysis; shock waves	TRAFFIC FLOW; SECURITY; SYSTEMS	This paper considers scenarios wherein a group of malicious vehicles on a highway perform a cooperative attack with the motive of creating undesirable wave effects among other vehicles on the highway. The two species of vehicles-malicious vehicles and normal vehicles, and their associated interaction effects-are modeled using partial differential equations. The malicious vehicles, which may be arbitrarily distributed on the highway, perform a sequence of velocity changes with the objective of making the density/velocity profile on the highway, track a reference profile. This reference profile (chosen by the malicious vehicles) has the property that once generated, it spontaneously evolves into a shock wave that propagates along the highway. Analytical expressions governing the velocity inputs of the malicious vehicles with which they can generate such waves are determined, for perfect as well as imperfect information scenarios. Simulation results are presented to validate the theory.

J	Levin, MW; Khani, A				Levin, Michael W.; Khani, Alireza			Dynamic transit lanes for connected and autonomous vehicles	PUBLIC TRANSPORT			English	Article						Dynamic transit lanes; Autonomous vehicles; Cell transmission model; Dynamic traffic assignment	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; SIGNAL CONTROL; TRAFFIC FLOW; PRIORITY; MANAGEMENT; WAVES	Transit lanes provide dedicated right-of-way to transitvehicles, but reduce the number of lanes available to othervehicles. Several studies have implemented intermittent bus lanes, which are sometimes reserved for transitbut otherwise are available for general traffic. However, their efficiency suffers from the difficulties of communicating accessibility to drivers. We extend this concept by proposing dynamic transit lanes for connected autonomous vehicles, in which infrastructure continuously updates vehicles on lane accessibility. We present a cell transmission model of dynamic transit lanes in which the number of lanes available to general traffic changes in space and time in response to the presence or absence of transitvehicles. In order to extend the concept of transit signal priority in the context of connectedautonomous vehicles and integrate it with dynamic transit lanes, we also modify the reservation-based intersection control system for autonomous vehicles to prioritize transit. Numerical results from small test cases show that the dynamic transit lanes and transit intersection priority allow transit to move nearly at free flow on the corridor despite congestion. Results from the downtown Austin city network using dynamic traffic assignment show that bothtransit and general trafficwould experience significant benefits in realistic settings.

J	Zeng, JW; Qian, YS; Wei, XT; Feng, X				Zeng, Jun-Wei; Qian, Yong-Sheng; Wei, Xu-Ting; Feng, Xiao			Traffic flow velocity disturbance characteristics and control strategy at the bottleneck of expressway	CHINESE PHYSICS B			English	Article						three-phase traffic flow theory; lane change; velocity disturbance; traffic control strategy	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; DYNAMICS	In the three-phase traffic flow studies, the traffic flow characteristic at the bottleneck section is a hot spot in the academic field. The controversy about the characteristics of the synchronized flow at bottleneck is also the main contradiction between the three-phase traffic flow theory and the traditional traffic flow theory. Under the framework of three-phase traffic flow theory, this paper takes the on-ramp as an example to discuss the traffic flow characteristics at the bottleneck section. In particular, this paper mainly conducts the micro-analysis to the effect of lane change under the two lane conditions, as well as the effect of the on-ramp on the main line traffic flow. It is found that when the main road flow is low, the greater the on-ramp inflow rate, the higher the average speed of the whole road section. As the probability of vehicles entering from the on-ramp increases, the flow and the average speed of the main road are gradually stabilized, and then the on-ramp inflow vehicles no longer have a significant impact on the traffic flow. In addition, this paper focuses on the velocity disturbance generated at the on-ramp, and proposes the corresponding on-ramp control strategy based on it, and the simulation verified that the control strategy can reasonably control the traffic flow by the on-ramp, which can meet the control strategy requirements to some extent.

J	Heydari, S				Heydari, Shahram			A flexible discrete density random parameters model for count data: Embracing unobserved heterogeneity in highway safety analysis	ANALYTIC METHODS IN ACCIDENT RESEARCH			English	Article							CRASH MODIFICATION FACTORS; INJURY-SEVERITIES; VEHICLE CRASHES; STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; POISSON-GAMMA; FREQUENCY; INTERSECTIONS; REGRESSION; BEHAVIOR	In traffic safety studies, there are almost inevitable concerns about unobserved heterogeneity. As a feasible alternative to current methods, this article proposes a novel crash count model that can address asymmetry and multimodality in the data. Specifically, a Bayesian random parameters model with flexible discrete densities for the regression coefficients is developed, employing a Dirichlet process prior. The approach is illustrated on the Ontario Highway 401, which is one of the busiest North American highways. The results indicate that the proposed model better captures the underlying structure of the data compared to conventional models, improving predictive power examined based on pseudo Bayes factors. Interestingly, the model can identify sites (highway segments, intersections, etc.) with similar risk factor profiles, those that manifest similarity in the heterogeneous effects of their site characteristics (e. g., traffic flow) on traffic safety, providing useful insight towards designing effective countermeasures.

Travel time prediction with viscoelastic traffic model	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND MECHANICS-ENGLISH EDITION			English	Article						travel time; viscoelastic modeling; distinguishing period for time averaging; spatial-temporal pattern; traffic jam; O368; 35Q80	VARIATIONAL FORMULATION; MACROSCOPIC MODEL; FLOW MODELS; DERIVATION; NETWORKS; PHYSICS; PHASE; WAVES	Travel time through a ring road with a total length of 80 km has been predicted by a viscoelastic traffic model (VEM), which is developed in analogous to the non-Newtonian fluid flow. The VEM expresses a traffic pressure for the unfree flow case by space headway, ensuring that the pressure can be determined by the assumption that the relevant second critical sound speed is exactly equal to the disturbance propagation speed determined by the free flow speed and the braking distance measured by the average vehicular length. The VEM assumes that the sound speed for the free flow case depends on the traffic density in some specific aspects, which ensures that it is exactly identical to the free flow speed on an empty road. To make a comparison, the open Navier-Stokes type model developed by Zhang (ZHANG, H. M. Driver memory, traffic viscosity and a viscous vehicular traffic flow model. Transp. Res. Part B, 37, 27-41 (2003)) is adopted to predict the travel time through the ring road for providing the counterpart results. When the traffic free flow speed is 80 km/h, the braking distance is supposed to be 45 m, with the jam density uniquely determined by the average length of vehicles l approximate to 5.8 m. To avoid possible singular points in travel time prediction, a distinguishing period for time averaging is pre-assigned to be 7.5 minutes. It is found that the travel time increases monotonically with the initial traffic density on the ring road. Without ramp effects, for the ring road with the initial density less than the second critical density, the travel time can be simply predicted by using the equilibrium speed. However, this simpler approach is unavailable for scenarios over the second critical.

Although deep learning (DL) methods with outstanding performance recently have become popular, most existing DL models for traffic flow prediction are fully deterministic and shed no light on data uncertainty. In this study, a novel fuzzy deep-learning approach called FDCN is proposed for predicting citywide traffic flow. This approach is built on the fuzzy theory and the deep residual network model. Our key idea is to introduce the fuzzy representation into the DL model to lessen the impact of data uncertainty. A model of fuzzy deep convolutional network is established to improve traffic flow prediction while investigating the spatial and temporal correlation of traffic flow. We further propose pre-training and fine-tuning strategies that efficiently learn parameters of the FDCN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a fuzzy DL approach has been applied to represent traffic features for traffic flow prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach to traffic flow prediction has superior performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Accurate traffic flow prediction provides a foundation for other tasks, such as signal coordination and travel time forecasting. There are many known methods in literature for the short-term traffic flow prediction problem, but their efficacy depends heavily on the traffic characteristics. It is difficult, if not impossible, to pick a single method that works well over time. In this paper, we present an automated framework to address this practical issue. Instead of selecting a single method, we combine predictions from multiple methods to generate a consensus traffic flow prediction. We propose an ensemble learning model that exploits the temporal characteristics of the data, and balances the accuracy of individual models and their mutual dependence through a covariance-regularizer. We additionally use a pruning scheme to remove anomalous individual predictions. We apply our proposed model to multistep-ahead arterial roadway flow prediction. In tests, our method consistently outperforms recently published ensemble prediction methods based on ridge regression and lasso. Our method also produces steady results even when the standalone models and other ensemble methods make wildly exaggerated predictions.

In the heavily populated and developed Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, vehicle emissions are major pollution contributors. This paper aims to establish 2014 vehicle emission inventories for five major air pollutants in the BTH region: CO, HC, NOx, PM10 and PM2.5 and carry out an emission control policy scenario analysis based on the newly developed inventories. Results showed that total emissions of CO, HC, NOx, PM10 and PM2.5 from vehicles in the BTH region were 1622.4 kt, 187.5 kt, 544.7 kt, 23.5 kt, and 26.1 kt, respectively. Based on the emission inventory, high-resolution emission distribution maps of the study area were created at a scale of 1 km x 1 km by incorporating local traffic flow data. The CO, HC and NOx emission levels were higher in the southeast, while the PM10 and PM2.5 levels were relatively evenly distributed throughout the BTH region. Based on the emission inventories, four policy scenarios were set to simulate the emission changes, and results showed that eliminating old vehicles and upgrading oil quality could reduce emission efficiently. A policy of eliminating old vehicles was selected to calculate the economic cost. Results showed that the emission reduction efficiencies of unit cost decreased from Hebei, Tianjin to Beijing. The results of this study could help policy makers identify pollution sources and design appropriate control measures. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The objective of this study is to develop a methodology for selecting the optimal pavement marking design that will improve traffic safety and reduce emission levels in the freeway off-ramp. Six pavement marking pattern scenarios on a freeway off-ramp were examined through the following sub-tasks. The first step focused on the testing of six selected scenarios for pavement marking design using a VR driving simulator to obtain driving behavior patterns. Next, the driving behavior pattern for each scenario was implemented in VISSIM, a microscopic traffic flow simulation, to extract the speed reduction for each scenario considering vehicle interactions. Then, the vehicle emission level of each scenario was evaluated by a Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES). Through a multiple-criteria decision making model, the best pavement marking design scenario that was both eco-friendly and effective in reducing vehicle speed was selected. Study results showed that transverse line type is the optimal design of pavement marking that improves traffic safety while decreasing emission at a freeway off-ramp. The proposed methodology in this study would quantitatively support the selection of optimal pavement marking design that will promote both traffic safety and traffic environment.

The mean speed, flow volume and lane-changing frequency under different lane-changing and deceleration rules were simulated. In the process of computational simulation, the fundamental diagrams of traffic flow under different rules were obtained by changing traffic flow density. Simulation results show that the proposed new rules can improve traffic flow volume and suppress traffic jam to a certain degree. Finally, the critical points were discussed to show the impact of lane-changing on traffic flow.

Mobility models are crucial parts of vehicular network, especially for routing policy evaluation as well as traffic flow management. The big data aided vehicle mobility analysis and design attract researchers a lot with the acceleration of big data technology. Besides, complex network theory reveals the intrinsic temporal and spatial characteristics, considering the dynamic feature of vehicular network. In the following content, a big GPS dataset in Beijing, and its complex features verification are introduced. Some novel vehicle and location collaborative mobility schemes are proposed relying on the GPS dataset.

J	Rong, Y; Wen, HY				Rong, Ying; Wen, Huiying			An extended delayed feedback control method for the two-lane traffic flow	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS			English	Article						Delayed feedback; Delayed time; Control method; Car-following model; Stability analysis	CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; DRIVERS CHARACTERISTICS; VELOCITY DIFFERENCE; STABILITY ANALYSIS; SYSTEMS; TIME; JAMS	This study extended a delayed feedback control method for the two-lane car-following model. In order to suppress the traffic jams more actually in the two-lane vehicle groups with lane-changing behavior, we introduced the delayed time of receiving the longitudinal and lateral interaction information in the controller into the feedback signals for the control scheme. The stability conditions for different cases were derived, respectively, according to the delayed time by the theory analysis. And the delayed time in the controller was found to instigate the traffic oscillations when the feedback gains were designed improper, which showed that the longer delayed time induces worse traffic jams. The numerical simulation results were found consistent with the theoretical findings as well. Finally, we further presented a comparative study of the proposed control method by a comparison with one existing controller which did not consider the delayed time. And it showed that the delayed time in the controller also affects the traffic flow and performance of control method.

This paper presents a two-lane lattice hydrodynamic model with consideration of heterogeneous lane changing rates over space. We further derive its linear stability condition for this extended lattice model with heterogeneous lane changing rates. Numerical experiments are carried out to investigate the effect of different values and percentages of lane changing rates on the system stability.

J	Arshi, AN; Alhajyaseen, WKM; Nakamura, H; Zhang, X				Arshi, Abubeker N.; Alhajyaseen, Wael K. M.; Nakamura, Hideki; Zhang, Xin			A comparative study on the operational performance of four-leg intersections by control type	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Two-way stop control; Roundabout; Signalized intersection; Intersection vehicle delay; Turning traffic; Pedestrians		The selection of proper control types at intersections at the planning stage is an important concern considering the difficulty in comparing the performance of different control types. Therefore, several manuals proposed selection charts to guide traffic engineers in identifying the control strategy that yields to the lowest delay and the highest level of service. However, most of these methodologies consider only total major and minor street traffic flows. They do not necessarily suggest to investigate the impact of turning traffic and pedestrian flows, which limits the applicability of their recommendations. Thus, this study aims to propose a procedure to assess the selection of the optimum control strategies among two-way stop, roundabout and signalization using average intersection vehicle delay as the evaluation criterion. The impact of turning traffic on the major and minor streets as well as the impact of pedestrians are integrated into the developed analytical methodology for the estimation of average intersection vehicle delay. A typical layout of isolated four-leg two-way intersection is assumed for the model development. It is concluded that turning traffic and pedestrians play essential roles in the performance of intersections. As pedestrian flow increases, signal control becomes prevailing over the other control types.

J	Adnan, N; Nordin, SM; bin Bahruddin, MA; Ali, M				Adnan, Nadia; Nordin, Shahrina Md; bin Bahruddin, Mohamad Ariff; Ali, Murad			How trust can drive forward the user acceptance to the technology? In-vehicle technology for autonomous vehicle	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Autonomous vehicle; Artificial intelligence; Ethical implications; UTAUT; User acceptance; Systematic analysis	ADOPTION; UTAUT; TRANSPORT; DECISION	The autonomous vehicle innovation has a potential effect on traffic and it's a widespread issue in the academic municipal. Based on its feature, autonomous vehicle is expected to improve traffic flow, reduce accidents, reduce social exclusion and improve the utility of time on travel. It is increasingly accepted that the next step to the evolution of human transportation is the replacement of human as the driver by the Artificial-intelligence-capable machine. Regardless, the challenges remain especially in convincing the consumers to switch to autonomous cars despite the apparent benefits. In the past, papers highlighted individual trust toward machine as the key point to encourage acceptance of autonomous cars. This paper seeks to highlight the ethical implications of the autonomous technology and how it is related to the user acceptance of the technology. This paper reviewed recent studies on the ethical implications of the autonomous vehicle and the user acceptance of the technology. A systematic review of papers from the literature was done using Scopus, ISI and Web of Science. The results of the review have shown that the level of trust, which may vary on the sociodemographic profile of the users, has been studied as one of the factors for user acceptance. Many researchers also highlight ethical implication as an important aspect of autonomous technology that needs to be tended to. The researcher proposes that ethical implication can be an important element of user trust toward autonomous technology. Hence, there is a need to embed ethical implication as a construct for user trust leading to user acceptance model in future studies. In the line of this research review researcher was addressed the following comprehensive groups: examination of autonomous vehicle topographies and flexibility prototypes, consequences for street traffic and connectivity to substructure (specifically in the urban areas with the medium and low density), communal attitudes and apprehensions, transportable behaviour and plea, possible business models, and strategy implications. Lastly, the main objective of this research article is to recognise critical problems for the growth of an effort cluster investigation to comprehend attitudes of possible manipulators of AVs and to highpoint autonomous vehicle growth issues for Malaysian lawful agencies.

The objective of the model is to promote information propagation on two parallel roadways in vehicular ad hoc networks. The information propagation is achieved through multi-hop vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. The relationship between the information travel time from one RSU to another and the distance between the two RSUs are derived. The RSU location problem is formulated as a shortest path problem and then as an integer linear programming. The proposed model is applicable for traffic flow with a general vehicle headway distribution. A detailed comparison between the proposed model and an existing RSU location model is conducted through Monto Carlo simulation experiments under different vehicle headway distributions, traffic densities, budget sizes, and road separation distances. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms the existing model in all cases. Moreover, it is shown that it is necessary to consider the general vehicle headway distribution and road separation in RSU locations that are focused on information propagation promotion.

To deal with this problem, a model based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition and random vector functional link network is proposed in this paper. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition is firstly employed to decompose the complex travel time data series into several simple functions, which are then represented by the same number of random vector functional link networks. Finally, the outputs of all networks are combined by linear addition as the prediction results. A historical travel time data series ( from 1 August 2016 to 1 November 2016) of two highways in China is investigated by the proposed models. For comparison, five individual prediction models and their respective ensemble variants are implemented for the same task. The results show that the proposed model outperforms all the other models in terms of symmetric mean absolute percentage error and normalized root mean square error. As for computational speed, the proposed model ranks the first among all the ensemble models. Moreover, the ensemble empirical mode decomposition is better than the empirical mode decomposition. The Friedman statistical test also confirms the results of the comparison. Experimental results reveal that the proposed model reaches the best overall performance and is a very promising model for complex travel time prediction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Mastio, M; Zargayouna, M; Scemama, G; Rana, O				Mastio, Matthieu; Zargayouna, Mandi; Scemama, Gerard; Rana, Omar			Two distribution methods for multiagent traffic simulations	SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY			English	Article						Multiagent systems; Traffic; Simulation; High performance computing	MODEL; IMPLEMENTATION; FRAMEWORK; NETWORK; DEMAND	Modeling and simulation play an important role in transportation networks analysis. With the widespread use of personalized real-lime information sources, the behavior of the simulation depends heavily on individual travelers reactions to the received information. As a consequence, it is relevant for the simulation model to be individual-centered, and multiagent simulation is the most promising paradigm in this context However, representing the movements of realistic numbers of travelers within reasonable execution times requires significant computational resources. It also requires relevant methods, architectures and algorithms that respect the characteristics of transportation networks. In this paper, we define two multiagent simulation models representing the existing sequential multiagent traffic simulations. The first model is fundamental diagram-based model, in which travelers do not interact directly and use a fundamental diagram of traffic flow to continuously compute their speeds. The second model is car-following based, in which travelers interact with their neighbors to adapt their speeds to their surrounding environment Then we define patterns to distribute these simulations in a high-performance environment The first is agent-based and distributes agents equally between available computation units. The second pattern is environment-based and partitions the environment over the different units. The results show that agent-based distribution is more efficient with fundamental diagram-based model simulations while environment-based distribution is more efficient with car following-based simulations.

J	Farda, M; Balijepalli, C				Farda, Muhammad; Balijepalli, Chandra			Exploring the effectiveness of demand management policy in reducing traffic congestion and environmental pollution: Car-free day and odd-even plate measures for Bandung city in Indonesia	CASE STUDIES ON TRANSPORT POLICY			English	Article						Traffic congestion; Demand management policy; Car-free day; Odd-even plate; Pollutant emissions	DELHI	Traffic congestion has been a major problem in big cities around the world, not to mention several large cities in Indonesia. Bandung is the second largest metropolitan area after Jakarta in Indonesia which suffers from extreme levels of congestion. With a high number of motorcycles and large private car population, congestion in this city is ever growing worsening the environment. While the local authorities struggle to find resources to fund capital intensive capacity expansion projects, this research explores the use of cost effective demand management policy measures to reduce the congestion and pollution. This study aims at assessing two relatively under-researched demand management policy measures that restrict vehicle flows viz., car-free day and odd-even plate schemes to investigate the effect on traffic congestion and the environment. SATURN traffic network modelling software has been used to predict the route choices of vehicles. Bandung city road network and origin destination matrix have been adapted to simulate the two measures during the peak hour. As well as providing the necessary inputs to a pollutant emission estimation model, traffic network modelling output forms the basis for assessing the congestion levels. Results show that both car-free day and odd-even plate measures have unintended consequences that undermine their effectiveness which if addressed could make them highly beneficial solutions. Car-free day scheme reduces the traffic flow levels in the vicinity of scheme but diverts the vehicle flow elsewhere to other routes which may adversely affect the congestion/pollution. Odd-even plate scheme is very effective at the beginning of its implementation but the performance gradually diminishes as drivers start to adapt by buying a second vehicle or even using fake number plates.

J	Zhao, Y; Kockelman, KM				Zhao, Yong; Kockelman, Kara M.			Anticipating the Regional Impacts of Connected and Automated Vehicle Travel in Austin, Texas	JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						Travel-demand modeling; Connected and autonomous vehicles; Shared autonomous vehicles; Travel behavior	OPERATIONS; FLEET	Automated vehicles are undergoing very rapid development and have potential to revolutionize the existing transportation system. This paper investigates the impacts of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) and shared automated vehicles (SAVs) using a conventional travel-demand model for the Austin, Texas, region. A series of eight test scenarios run in the year 2020 setting suggests that the introduction of CAVs and SAVs will add 20% or greater demand for new vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT) to the six-county region's roadway network. Relatively low values of travel time for passengers of automated vehicles and competitive pricing assumptions of SAV use result in greater demand for longer distance travel and reduced transit system use. Empty-vehicle travel for self-parking vehicles and SAVs will add to the network's VKT, presumably increasing roadway congestion further, unless rides can be shared, traffic flows smoothed, and intervehicle headways tightened. The scenario simulations are sensitive to parking cost and vehicle operating cost assumptions. Policymakers, transportation planners, system operators, and designers may do well to simulate additional scenarios. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Ren, HL; Dong, ZH				Ren, Hualing; Dong, Zhiheng			Modeling traffic flow on a comprehensive network with competition and cooperation between urban logistic alliances	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B			English	Article						Traffic flow; logistic transportation; Cournot-Nash equilibrium; competition; cooperation	ROUTE; METHODOLOGY; CONGESTION; TRANSPORT; MARKET; IMPACT	The traffic during rush hour in metropolises is always in heavy congestion, so the wagon trucks of logistic transportation are mostly forbidden during rush hour. In fact, quite a few logistic transportations are fulfilled by converted passenger vehicles. This paper aims to model the logistic companies' behaviors and see through the effect of their cooperation modes on the companies and on the whole traffic conditions. The logistic companies decide their transportation pricing, warehouse using and route choosing separately or as a group (cooperation) to compete with others. It is also assumed that the heavy freight vehicles, light freight vehicles and the auto vehicles share the same network. Three models based on variational inequalities are proposed to describe the companies' behaviors when there is no cooperation, simple cooperation and deep cooperation, respectively, and the modified diagonalization method is used to solve these models. The total transportation demand is elastic, which depends on the users' choice of logistics company and further depends on all the companies' prices, warehouse and route choices. The goodness of different coalitions to the companies and the whole traffic system is well investigated in the numerical examples.

Based on the linear stability condition, the sufficient conditions of model stability is given. In the nonlinear stability analysis, we derive the KdV-Burger equation to describe the propagation characteristics of traffic density waves near the neutral stability curve.

J	Iqbal, Z; Khan, MI				Iqbal, Zafar; Khan, Majid Iqbal			Automatic incident detection in smart city using multiple traffic flow parameters via V2X communication	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article						Automatic incident detection; incident confidence factor; smart city; traffic flow parameters; roadside unit; smart roads; formal methods	SYSTEMS; SENSOR; MODEL	Recent research trends in intelligent transportation system are focused toward developing automatic incident detection systems to deal with on-road incidents including accidents, traffic congestion, and jamming which cause damage to precious human lives and financial losses. Most of the existing automatic incident detection systems use fixed detectors to detect traffic parameters like occupancy, speed, and lane change information. These systems are prone to delay, inaccuracy, and false alarms during data collection and processing due to line of sight and short-range communication, weather conditions, road repairing, and driver's driving patterns. Moreover, these systems are designed for freeways/highways and are less compatible with city scenario due to its highly variable traffic density factor. To overcome these deficiencies, an effective and robust approach for automatic incident detection for smart city is developed using smart roads in association with roadside units for data collection and data processing, respectively. The incident confidence factor of the algorithm is based not only on speed and lane change parameters but also on acceleration, orientation, and deviation factors that are integrated to cope with peak/non-peak traffic hours. The integration of multiple parameters increases the incident belief factor and hence the accuracy of incident detection. The complete algorithm is mathematically described using the notions of set theory and then formal analysis assures that the algorithm would be less susceptible to runtime and logical errors during simulations.

However, since traffic sensors are typically manually controlled, traffic flow data with varying length, irregular sampling and missing data are difficult to exploit effectively. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel approach that is based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in this paper. In addition, the multiscale temporal smoothing is employed to infer lost data and the prediction residual is learned by our approach. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on both the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) data set and our own traffic flow data set. According to the experimental results, our approach obtains higher accuracy in traffic flow prediction compared with other approaches. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Firstly, the stochastic off-ramp and on-ramp are designed. Then, a two-lane lattice hydrodynamic traffic flow model coupled with a combination bottleneck is proposed to reproduce the empirical phenomena. In the simulation, the asymmetric-lane change rules were adopted, and many congested traffic flow patterns were observed near the combination bottlenecks, such as homogeneous synchronized traffic (HST), moving localized cluster (MLC), triggered stop-and-go traffic (TSG), oscillating congested traffic (OCT), pinned localized cluster (PLC), and homogeneous congested traffic (HCT). The obtained simulation results suggest that the proposed model is good and can produce the observed congestion spatiotemporal traffic patterns well.

J	Raza, A; Zhong, M				Raza, Asif; Zhong, Ming			Hybrid artificial neural network and locally weighted regression models for lane-based short-term urban traffic flow forecasting	TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Traffic flow; short-term forecasting; genetic algorithms; artificial neural network; locally weighted regression; aggregate model; disaggregate model	NONPARAMETRIC MODELS; PREDICTION; VOLUME	In recent years, there has been considerable research interest in short-term traffic flow forecasting. However, forecasting models offering a high accuracy at a fine temporal resolution (e.g. 1 or 5 min) and lane level are still rare. In this study, a combination of genetic algorithm, neural network and locally weighted regression is used to achieve optimal prediction under various input and traffic settings. The genetically optimized artificial neural network (GA-ANN) and locally weighted regression (GA-LWR) models are developed and tested, with the former forecasting traffic flow every 5-min within a 30-min period and the latter for forecasting traffic flow of a particular 5-min period of each for four lanes of an urban arterial road in Beijing, China. In particular, for morning peak and off-peak traffic flow prediction, the GA-ANN 5-min traffic flow model results in average errors of 3-5% and most 95th percentile errors of 7-14% for each of the four lanes; for the peak and off-peak time traffic flow predictions, the GA-LWR 5-min traffic flow model results in average errors of 2-4% and most 95th percentile errors are lower than 10% for each of the four lanes. When compared to previous models that usually offer average errors greater than 6-15%, such empirical findings should be of interest to and instrumental for transportation authorities to incorporate in their city- or state-wide Advanced Traveller Information Systems (ATIS).

In order to check the stability of system under control theory Hurwitz criteria is used and H-infinity norm of transfer functions are obtained. The efficiency of control signal in minimizing the jamming transitions due to passing, is shown through Bode plot. The results show that the control parameter helps in reducing congestion and makes the flow stable even at higher rate of passing.

J	Ishibashi, Y; Fukui, M				Ishibashi, Yoshihiro; Fukui, Minoru			Interplay between the Probability of Delayed Start and the Bottleneck in a One-Dimensional Traffic Flow	JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN			English	Article							HIGH-SPEED; MODEL	The interplay between the probability of a delayed start and the bottleneck in a one-dimensional highway traffic is studied on the basis of a model obeying Wolfram's 184-rule. A formula expressing the constant flow F-C independent of the car density on a one-dimensional road is obtained in terms of the probability f of a delayed start and the probability r of opening a gate at the bottleneck. Computer simulations were performed to test the validity of the obtained formula. It was found that the formula reproduces the simulation results reasonably well for the entire ranges of f and r.

J	Hu, XJ; Liu, MY				Hu, Xiaojian; Liu, Mingyang			Traffic flow in the vicinity of crosswalks on a provincial highway in China	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B			English	Article						Traffic flow; crosswalk; pedestrians crossing behavior; Kerner's three-phase theory; traffic breakdown	PHASE-TRANSITIONS; MODEL; FRAMEWORK; SAFETY	In this paper, motorized traffic flow in the vicinity of an unsignalized crosswalk on a provincial highway in China was studied. Based on the Kerner-Klenov-Schreckenberg-Wolf (KKSW) three-phase cellular automaton (CA) traffic flow model for single-lane roads, the cars' moving rules when there were pedestrians walking on the crosswalk was redefined. A series of simulations were carried out to reveal the cars' travel process and the influence of pedestrians crossing behavior on traffic flow. The simulations results show the redefined model can be used to study not only the characteristics of traffic flow in the vicinity of crosswalks on provincial highways but also some complex traffic problems such as traffic breakdown, synchronized flow, and moving jams. Moreover, some suggestions about signal control for the pedestrians crossing in the future were presented. Thus, this work is helpful for managing traffic flow and improving road safety and capacity in the vicinity of crosswalks on provincial highways in China.

J	Zhai, C; Wu, WT				Zhai, Cong; Wu, Wei-Tiao			An extended continuum model with consideration of the self-anticipative effect	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B			English	Article						Self-anticipative effect; continuum model; linear stability; KdV-Burgers equation; energy consumption	CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; 2-LANE TRAFFIC FLOW; DRIVERS ANTICIPATION; TIME	Drivers would adjust the speeds in response to not only the external environment, but also the anticipated traffic condition. In this paper, we propose a new continuum model considering the driver's self-anticipative effect. Such effect is mainly reflected by the difference between the current speed and optimal speed within the anticipation time step. By applying the linear stability theory, the stability condition of the new model is obtained. Through the nonlinear analysis method, the KdV-Burgers equation of the model is provided. The solution describes the evolution of density waves near the neutral stability region. The simulation example verifies that the self-anticipative effect of the driver contributes to suppressing traffic congestion and reducing exhaust emissions effectively. We thus suggest that the traffic flow stability could be improved in an ad hoc manner.

J	Yang, S; Cooke, P				Yang, Shu; Cooke, Payton			How accurate is your travel time reliability?-Measuring accuracy using bootstrapping and lognormal mixture models	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						bootstrap; lognormal mixture model; resampling; sample size; travel time reliability	ALGORITHM; METHODOLOGY; FREEWAYS	As with travel time collection, the accuracy of observed travel time and the optimal travel time data quantity should be determined before using travel time reliability (TTR) data. The statistical accuracy of TTR measures should be evaluated so that the statistical behavior and belief can be fully understood. More specifically, this issue can be formulated as a question: using a certain amount of travel time data, how accurate is the TTR for a specific freeway corridor, time of day, and day of week? A framework for answering this question has not been proposed previously. Our study proposes a framework based on bootstrapping to evaluate the accuracy of TTR measures and answer the question. Bootstrapping is a computer-based method for assigning measures of accuracy to multiple types of statistical estimators without requiring a specific probability distribution. Three scenarios representing three traffic flow conditions (free-flow, congestion, and transition) were used to evaluate the accuracy of TTR measures under different traffic conditions and quantities of data. The results of the accuracy measurements demonstrated that: (1) the proposed framework supports assessment of TTR accuracy and (2) stabilization of the TTR measures did not necessarily correspond to statistical accuracy. The findings in our study also suggested that moment-based TTR measures may not be statistically sufficient for measuring freeway TTR. Additionally, our study suggested that 4 or 5 weeks of travel time data is sufficient for measuring freeway TTR under free-flow conditions, 40 weeks for congested conditions, and 35 weeks for transition conditions.

Uncertainty Propogation from the Cell Transmission Traffic Flow Model to Emisson Predictions: A Data-Driven Approach	TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						traffic-related air pollutants; modeling chain; calibration and validation; ensemble-based optimisation; error estimation; Monte Carlo	SPEED-LIMIT CONTROL; KINEMATIC WAVES; EMISSIONS; OPTIMIZATION; CALIBRATION; VALIDATION; SIMULATION; ASSIGNMENT; AIR; IMPACTS	Road traffic exhaust emission predictions are used to inform transport policy and investment decisions aimed at reducing emissions and achieving sustainable mobility. Emission predictions are also used as inputs when modeling air quality and human exposure to traffic-related air pollutants. To be effective, such policies and/or integration must be based on robust models that not only provide point-based predictions but also inform these with an interval of confidence that properly accounts for the propagation of uncertainties through the complex chain of models involved. This paper develops a data-driven methodological framework that enables calculating the uncertainty in average speed-based emission predictions induced by uncertainty in its traffic data inputs, which are most often predictions (or outputs) of traffic flow models. An ensemble-based optimisation approach is used to estimate both calibration and validation errors arising from uncertainty in the structure and parameterisation of the cell transmission model, a discretised first-order macroscopic traffic flow model that is often integrated with average speed-based emission models. A Monte Carlo sampling approach is proposed to propagate the uncertainty in traffic flow inputs to emission predictions. To ensure transferability of findings, this methodology has been tested using multiple real data sets on three motorway road networks, one of which operates under variable speed limits.

A polycentric urban city with multiple central business districts (CBDs) is considered, and travelers are classified into different classes according to their destinations (i.e., CBDs). The road network within the modeling city is assumed to be sufficiently dense and can be viewed as a continuum. A predictive dynamic user-optimal (PDUO) model has been previously used to model traffic flow with a given traffic demand distribution, in which travelers choose the routes that minimize the actual travel cost to the CBD. In this work, we combine the departure time choice with the PDUO model to study the simultaneous departure time and route choice problem. The user-optimal departure time principle is satisfied, which states that for each origin-destination pair, the total costs incurred by travelers departing at any time are equal and minimized. We then present an equivalent VI and solve it using the projection method after discretization based on unstructured meshes. A numerical experiment for an urban city with two CBDs is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the numerical algorithm.

Role of road network features in the evaluation of incident impacts on urban traffic mobility	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Traffic mobility; Incident impacts; Network features; Hazard-based model; Bayesian Negative-binomial CAR model; Generalized linear model	WEIGHTED NETWORKS; MODELS; CENTRALITY; FREQUENCY; ACCIDENTS; INTERNET; DURATION; CRASHES; REPRINT; DELAYS	In this paper, we seek to investigate the spatiotemporal impacts of traffic incident on urban road networks. The theoretical lens of a complex network leads us to expect that incident impacts are associated with the functionality that an intersection acts in a network, and also, the location of incident sites. Incident impacts are measured in both temporal and spatial dimension through mining the large-scale traffic flow data in conjunction with the incident record. In the complex network context, the urban road network can be converted into a weighted direct graph with intersections as nodes and road segments as edges with their geographic information. Four network features, i.e., Betweenness Centrality, weighted PageRank, Flub, and K-shell are assigned to each intersection to measure its functionality. Temporally, we find out significant correlations between incident delay and two network features by applying hazard-based models. Spatially, the micro impact and the macro impact are found to be strongly associated with three network features through estimating a Bayesian Negative-binomial Conditional Autoregressive model and a generalized linear model, respectively. Our study provides the basis of leveraging urban road network context to evaluate incident impacts, with some explanations, insights and possible extensions that would assist traffic administrations to guide the post-incident resilience and emergency management.

Modelling decisions of control transitions and target speed regulations in full-range Adaptive Cruise Control based on Risk Allostasis Theory	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Control transitions; Adaptive Cruise Control; On-road experiment; Driver behaviour; Continuous-discrete choice model	ORDERED RESPONSE MODEL; DRIVING BEHAVIOR; SAFETY; CHOICE	Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and automated vehicles can contribute to reduce traffic congestion and accidents. Recently, an on-road study has shown that drivers may prefer to deactivate full-range ACC when closing in on a slower leader and to overrule it by pressing the gas pedal a few seconds after the activation of the system. Notwithstanding the influence of these control transitions on driver behaviour, a theoretical framework explaining driver decisions to transfer control and to regulate the target speed in full-range ACC is currently missing. This research develops a modelling framework describing the underlying decision making process of drivers with full-range ACC at an operational level, grounded on Risk Allostasis Theory (RAT). Based on this theory, a driver will choose to resume manual control or to regulate the ACC target speed if its perceived level of risk feeling and task difficulty falls outside the range considered acceptable to maintain the system active. The feeling of risk and task difficulty evaluation is formulated as a generalized ordered probit model with random thresholds, which vary between drivers and within drivers over time. The ACC system state choices are formulated as logit models and the ACC target speed regulations as regression models, in which correlations between system state choices and target speed regulations are captured explicitly. This continuous-discrete choice model framework is able to address interdependencies across drivers' decisions in terms of causality, unobserved driver characteristics, and state dependency, and to capture inconsistencies in drivers' decision making that might be caused by human factors. The model was estimated using a dataset collected in an on-road experiment with full range ACC. The results reveal that driver decisions to resume manual control and to regulate the target speed in full-range ACC can be interpreted based on the RAT. The model can be used to forecast driver response to a driving assistance system that adapts its settings to prevent control transitions while guaranteeing safety and comfort. The model can also be implemented into a microscopic traffic flow simulation to evaluate the impact of ACC on traffic flow efficiency and safety accounting for control transitions and target speed regulations.

Possible mechanisms include traffic flow instabilities, indifference regions or finite human perception thresholds (action points), and external acceleration noise. However, the relative importance of these factors in a given situation remains unclear. We bring light into this question by adding external noise and action points to the Intelligent Driver Model and other car-following models thereby obtaining a minimal model containing all three oscillation mechanisms. We show analytically that even in the subcritical regime of linearly stable flow (order parameter epsilon <0), external white noise leads to spatiotemporal speed correlations "anticipating" the waves of the linearly unstable regime. Sufficiently far away from the threshold, the amplitude scales with (-epsilon)(-0.5). By means of simulations and comparisons with experimental car platoons and bicycle traffic, we show that external noise and indifference regions with action points have essentially equivalent effects. Furthermore, flow instabilities dominate the oscillations on freeways while external noise or action points prevail at low desired speeds such as vehicular city or bicycle traffic. For bicycle traffic, noise can lead to fully developed waves even for single-file traffic in the subcritical regime. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Effect of information availability on stability of traffic flow: Percolation theory approach	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	22nd International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory (ISTTT)	JUL 24-26, 2017	NW Univ, Evanston Campus, Chicago, IL		NW Univ, Evanston Campus	Connected vehicles; Autonomous vehicles; Percolation theory; String stability	MODELING DRIVER BEHAVIOR; SENSOR NETWORKS; CONNECTIVITY; COVERAGE; IMPACT	Connectivity and automation are expected to enhance safety and efficiency in transportation systems. Connectivity will provide information to drivers/autonomous vehicles to enhance decision-making reliability at the operational and tactical levels. Consequently, drivers are more likely to execute safe and efficient maneuvers and autonomous vehicles will have a more accurate perception of the traffic condition and an "error-free" execution of the driving maneuvers. At the operational level, ensuring string stability is a key consideration since unstable traffic flow results in shockwave propagation and possibly crashes. While several studies have examined the effects of information availability on string stability in a connected environment, most of the approaches are focused on automated driving (e.g., Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control systems) and do not consider a mixed environment with regular, connected, and autonomous vehicles. To ensure connectivity in such a mixed environment, the correlation between communication range and connected vehicles density should be considered. To capture the effects of this correlation, this study uses the Continuum Percolation theory to determine the effects of the vehicular density and communication range on the connectivity level in telecommunications network and consequently, on the string stability of traffic flow. Based on the Continuum Percolation theory, there is a critical density of connected vehicles above which the entire system is connected. This critical density also depends on the communication range. This study presents an analytical derivation of this critical density. Moreover, this study evaluates the string stability under different communication ranges and market penetration rates of connected and autonomous vehicles. Results revealed that as communication range increases, the system becomes more stable and at high communication ranges, the system performs similar to the system with full connectivity. Moreover, results indicated the existence of an optimal communication range to maximize stability and ensure information delivery. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, we attempt to fill the gap by constructing and solving a unifiable multi commodity kinematic wave model. We first construct commodity speed-density relations based on generic generating functions. Then for two commodities we discuss the properties of the unifiable kinematic wave model and analytically solve the Riemann problem with a combination of total and commodity kinematic waves. We propose a unifiable multi-commodity Cell Transmission Model (CTM) with a general junction model for numerical simulations of network traffic flows, which are unifiable but may violate the FIFO principle. We prove that the CTM is well-defined under an extended CFL (Courant et al., 1928) condition. With examples we verify the consistency between the analytical and numerical solutions and demonstrate the convergence of the CTM. We conclude with several follow-up research directions for unifiable multi-commodity kinematic wave models. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The travel preferences towards risk and ambiguity are distinguished by adopting the criterion of ambiguity-aware Constant Absolute Risk Aversion (CARA) travel time. We first examine the dynamic user equilibrium for a single route model with a homogeneous preference towards risk and ambiguity. Compared with risk-neutral commuters, we find that departure time window is shifted earlier for the risk averse commuters and shifted later for the risk-seeking commuters. We also study the single bottleneck with a risk-averse class and a risk-seeking class. We show that with a larger gap between the two classes' preferences, the congestion pattern will change from one peak to two peaks. It implies that preference heterogeneity may stagger the departure time choices and thereby relieve the average congestion. Last, we examine a two-route problem with homogeneous preference. Commuters choose between a fast and risky route (highway) and a slow and safe route (local arterial). We prove the monotonicity of the traffic flow distribution between the two routes with respect to the maximum variation in travel time. Furthermore, we find that reducing the uncertainty on the highway by providing information will reduce the total system cost and the total expected congestion simultaneously for risk-averse commuters. However, it will reduce the total expected congestion but increase the total system cost for risk-seeking commuters. In the numerical section, the price of anarchy is analyzed by varying the risk preference and the ambiguity preference. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Daganzo, CF; Lehe, LJ; Argote-Cabanero, J				Daganzo, Carlos F.; Lehe, Lewis J.; Argote-Cabanero, Juan			Adaptive offsets for signalized streets	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	22nd International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory (ISTTT)	JUL 24-26, 2017	NW Univ, Evanston Campus, Chicago, IL		NW Univ, Evanston Campus	ISTTT22; Traffic signals; Adaptive offsets; MFD; Congestion	MACROSCOPIC FUNDAMENTAL DIAGRAM; TRAFFIC FLOW; KINEMATIC WAVES; OPTIMIZATION; STRATEGIES	This paper shows that severe congestion on streets controlled by traffic signals can be reduced by dynamically adapting the signal offsets to the prevailing density with a simple rule that keeps the signals' green-red ratios invariant. Invariant ratios reduce a control policy's impact on the crossing streets, so a policy can be optimized and evaluated by focusing on the street itself without the confounding factors present in networks. Designed for heavy traffic with spillovers, the proposed policies are adaptive and need little data they only require average traffic density readings and no demand forecasts. A battery of numerical experiments simulating the dynamics of rush hour traffic on a congested, homogeneous circular street reveals that the proposed form of adaptation reduces the duration of the rush and overall congestion compared with pre-timed control strategies. Eighteen different adaptation policies were considered. All inspect the street densities periodically and simultaneously, and retime the signals immediately thereafter. The period is a fixed multiple of the cycle. The street is evenly divided into sections that contain a set number of consecutive blocks and signals. The offset is the same for all blocks in a section. Three inspection intervals and six section sizes were tested. The latter ranged from a single block/signal to the whole street. It was found that adaptation worked best when sections were large and adaptation frequent. The effects were considerable across all scenarios. For a short street with a short rush and high input flows the probabilistic incidence of gridlock was reduced from 10 to 0%, and the average duration of a trip from 216 to 181 s. For a long street with a long rush and high input flows the gridlock probability was reduced from 23 to 0% and the average trip duration from 2037 to 1143s. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Guo, YQ				Guo, Yuqi			Dynamic-model-based switched proportional-integral state observer design and traffic density estimation for urban freeway	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTROL			English	Article						Urban freeway; Proportional integral state observer; Density estimation; Traffic congestion identification; Piecewise affine system	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; OBSERVABILITY; SYSTEMS	In the face of the frequent occurrence of urban traffic congestion, only part traffic sensors can be utilized in the urban freeway, in order to more accurately estimate traffic densities and timely identify the congested road segments, a novel estimated algorithm of proportional integral state observer is proposed. Firstly, by embedding the Cell Transmission Model (CTM) into the Dynamic Graph Hybrid Automata (DGHA) framework, we model traffic flow over the urban freeway network. In modeling procedure, an urban freeway network is partitioned in term of three hierarchical structures which are freeway networks, links and cells, respectively. On the one hand, both the dual digraph of road segment structure and hybrid automata respectively are adopted to describe the freeway topology and the multi-modes of dynamic densities in road segments. On the other hand, a deterministic and reasonable constraint is used to reduce the number of combination modes, and thus the modeling procedure is modularized, rule-based and easily-extensible with the help of a combination algorithm. Therefore, the Piecewise Affine System (PWAS) model of the freeway network can be obtained. Secondly, In order to estimate the traffic densities of the urban freeway network, based on the dynamic model, we design a switched proportional integral state observer, and the observer design problem is transferred into the stability problem of the switching system. So the proportional gains and integral gains can be computed via introducing the Lyapunov function and using LMI technique, and thus the traffic densities can be estimated by the designed observer. Especially, the traffic congestion can be identified by checking whether the estimated densities are greater than the critical ones. Finally, a section of Beijing south third ring freeway as an example to verify the proposed approach, and the effectiveness and the feasibility are shown in the experiment results.

J	Lan, ZQ; Cai, M; Li, F; Yang, WJ				Lan, Ziqin; Cai, Ming; Li, Feng; Yang, Weijun			Study of the Traffic Noise Source Emission Model and the Frequency Spectrum Analysis of Electric Vehicles on Urban Roads in China	ACTA ACUSTICA UNITED WITH ACUSTICA			English	Article							PREDICTION MODEL; TRANSPORTATION NOISE; EXPOSURE	Due to the less pollution emissions while running on the road, electric vehicles are widely promoted in China. The primary objective of this study is to develop a traffic noise source emission model and analyze the noise frequency characteristics of electric vehicles on urban roads in China based on the measured traffic noise data. The noise data of two types of electric vehicles, including light and heavy electric vehicles, are collected from a noise measurement experiment conducted on urban roads. The valid measured data are used to fit the traffic noise source emission models of electric vehicles, which have passed the correlation test, t-test, and error test. Then, the analyses about the noise models and the noise frequency spectrum comparison between the electric vehicles (EVs) and the internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEs) are carried out. Finally, a traffic noise simulation is performed for presenting the noise reduction effect of different proportions of electric vehicles on traffic noise emission in a traffic flow. The results reveal the followings. The sound pressure level of EVs is lower than that of ICEs for each vehicle type and the average differences both are above 5.5 dB(A). In terms of the frequency content, the noise energy of EVs is more concentrated than that of ICEs, and the noise energy of light EVs is concentrated within the range of 500 Hz to 1,600 Hz, while that of heavy EVs is concentrated within the range of 630 Hz to 2,500 Hz; and the equivalent frequency of the traffic flow increases with an increasing proportion of electric vehicles. According to the simulation, the noise of the traffic flow decreases obviously with an increase in the proportion of EVs in the traffic flow, and the reduction effect is above 7 dB(A) with 10% reduction rate. The obvious noise reduction effect indicates that the increase of EVs can greatly improve the acoustic environment of urban areas.

Using synchronous and asynchronous parallel Differential Evolution for calibrating a second-order traffic flow model	ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE			English	Article						Parallel Differential Evolution; Synchronous implementation; Asynchronous implementation; Surrogate models; Artificial Neural Networks; Macroscopic traffic flow modeling	SIMULATION; OPTIMIZATION; VALIDATION	Given the importance of the credibility and validity required by macroscopic traffic flow models in performing real-word simulations, the necessity of including an accurate, computationally fast, and reliable constrained optimization scheme appears to be mandatory to ensure that the traffic flow characteristics are accurately represented by such models. To this end, a parallel, synchronous or asynchronous, metamodel-assisted Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is employed for the calibration of a second-order macroscopic gas-kinetic traffic flow (GKT) model using real traffic data from Attiki Odos freeway in Athens, Greece. Two Artificial Neural Networks, a Mull-layer Perceptron and a Radial Basis Function network, are used as surrogate models to decrease the computation time of the evaluation phase of the DE optimizer. The parallelization of the DE algorithm is performed using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). Numerical simulations are performed, which demonstrate that the DE algorithm can be effectively used for the search of the global optimal model parameters in the GKT model, while appears to be a promising method for the calibration of other similar traffic models.

Considering the settings of variable approach lanes, the presence of left-turn bays, and a variety of vehicle categories on an arterial road, an optimization model that minimizes the total delay is formulated and a control method that coordinates a variable sign and the corresponding signal group is put forward. To design the signal control scenarios with time of day, the procedure for using the proposed methodology is also presented in practice. To verify the given methodology, a case study is implemented using the field data and the four scenarios. The results reveal that the new methodology can better respond to the time-varying traffic flow at intersection approaches, and the provision of variable approach lanes and left-turn bays are helpful to reduce the average delay and enhance the average speed.

J	Liu, QC; Wang, BC; Zhu, YQ				Liu, Qingchao; Wang, Bochen; Zhu, Yuquan			Short-Term Traffic Speed Forecasting Based on Attention Convolutional Neural Network for Arterials	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							DAMAGE DETECTION; FLOW PREDICTION; MODEL; VOLUME	As an important part of the intelligent transportation system (ITS), short-term traffic prediction has become a hot research topic in the field of traffic engineering. In recent years, with the emergence of rich traffic data and the development of deep learning technologies, neural networks have been widely used in short-term traffic forecasting. Among them, the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), especially the Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) shows the excellent ability of time-series tasks. To improve the prediction accuracy of the LSTM, some research uses the spatial-temporal matrix or Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract the spatial features of the data for the LSTM network to use. In this article, we propose an attention CNN to predict traffic speed. The model uses three-dimensional data matrices constructed by traffic flow, speed, and occupancy. The spatial-temporal features extraction and the attention models are all performed by the convolution unit. Experiments on traffic data at 15-minute intervals show that the proposed algorithm has considerable advantages in predicting tasks compared to other commonly used algorithms, and the proposed algorithm has an improvement effect for cases with missing data. At the same time, by visualizing the weights generated by the attention model, we can see the influence of different spatial-temporal data on the forecasting task.

This research puts forward an optimal dynamic credit charge scheme that can redistribute the traffic flows to attain mobility and emission goals. First, cell transmission model is used as dynamic network loading model to capture the flow propagation and dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) is formulated to investigate the flow redistribution in terms of simultaneous path and departure time choices under carbon credit charge scheme. Based on that, a bi-level formulation is proposed to describe the Stackelberg game between road manager and road users. For the higher level, road manager seeks to minimize system travel time and emissions by implementing credit charge schemes. For the lower level, heterogeneous users find dynamic user equilibrium by simultaneous path and departure time choices under given credit charge schemes. Given the non-convex property of the bi-level model, this paper proposes the pattern search algorithm embedded with projection method. Computational results on X-shape, Ziliaskopolous' and Nyguen-Dupuis network are given to show the applicability of the proposed algorithm on reasonable-size networks. Results show that minimum travel time design does not always generate effective path and departure time switches across all user groups, especially for users with high value of travel time, while minimum emissions credit design yields desirable behavioral adjustments. Besides, minimum travel time credit design does not always generate minimum carbon emissions in the network, especially in networks with complex O-D pairs and paths. This research casts light on how to schedule a time-varying credit charge scheme to attain mobility and emission goals. Policy implications of credit charge scheme are provided.

The occurrence of these events is due not only to the high number of vehicles trying to use a shared infrastructure, but also by phenomena that temporarily deteriorate the capacity of the infrastructure itself. Among them, road accidents are considered as one of the primary causes of non-recurrent congestion. At the same time, several studies also identify traffic breakdowns as events leading to vehicle crashes. A specific goal of this research is to develop a global safety index that quantifies the expected number of crashes as a function of the current traffic state in the freeway system. Moreover, on the basis of this new index and the performance indicator generally adopted to evaluate the traffic delay, a coordinated ramp metering scheme is proposed jointly considering the reduction of travel times for the drivers and the improvement of safety in the freeway system. The control strategy is sought by defining a nonlinear optimal control problem with constrained control variables, solved by applying a specific gradient-based algorithm. The simulation analysis investigates the multi-objective nature of the problem assessing whether and to what extent the two components of the cost criterion are conflicting objectives.

J	Wei, W; Wu, L; Wang, JH; Mei, SW				Wei, Wei; Wu, Lei; Wang, Jianhui; Mei, Shengwei			Network Equilibrium of Coupled Transportation and Power Distribution Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID			English	Article						Electric vehicle; interdependency; locational marginal price (LMP); network equilibrium; optimal power flow; power distribution network; static traffic assignment; transportation network; Wardrop user equilibrium	ELECTRIC VEHICLES; FREQUENCY REGULATION; CHARGING STATIONS; BRANCH FLOW; OPTIMIZATION; MANAGEMENT; IMPACTS; CONSTRAINTS; AGGREGATOR; GENERATION	This paper presents a holistic modeling framework for the interdependent transportation network and power distribution network. From a system-level perspective, on-road fast charging stations would simultaneously impact vehicle routing in the transportation system and load flows in the distribution system, therefore tightly couple the two systems. In this paper, a dedicated traffic user equilibrium model is proposed to describe the steady-state distribution of traffic flows comprised of gasoline vehicles and electric vehicles. It encapsulates route selections, charging opportunities, electricity prices, and individual rationalities of minimum travel expense in a convex traffic assignment problem over an extended transportation network. An adaptive path generation oracle is suggested to solve the problem in a tractable manner. Economic operation of the power distribution system is formulated as an alternating current optimal power flow problem. Convex relaxation is performed. The optimal generation dispatch and nodal electricity prices can be computed from a second-order cone program. It is revealed that an equilibrium state will emerge due to the rational behaviors in the coupled systems, which is characterized via a fixed-point problem. A best-response decomposition algorithm is suggested to identify the network equilibrium through iteratively solving the traffic assignment problem and the optimal power flow problem, both of which entail convex optimization. Illustrative examples are presented to validate related concepts and methods.

Similar to many other industries, transportation has entered the generation of big data. With a rich volume of traffic data, it is challenging to build reliable prediction models based on traditional shallow machine learning methods. Deep learning is a new state-of-the-art machine learning approach which has been of great interest in both academic research and industrial applications. This study reviews recent studies of deep learning for popular topics in processing traffic data including transportation network representation, traffic flow forecasting, traffic signal control, automatic vehicle detection, traffic incident processing, travel demand prediction, autonomous driving and driver behaviours. In general, the use of deep learning systems in transportation is still limited and there are potential limitations for utilising this advanced approach to improve prediction models.

These interactions between MVs and automated vehicles (AVs) could lead to a higher potential for unstable traffic flow, which is closely associated with traffic safety issues. The objective of this study was to investigate the lane change characteristics of MVs in AV platooning environments using driving simulator experiments. This research found that MV drivers tend to show more radical driving behaviour, as indicated by greater steering magnitude and steering velocity when they change lanes into the platooning vehicles' lane. Therefore, novel traffic operations strategies to manage MVs and AVs effectively are required to ensure traffic safety, which will be conducted by a future study.

Existing studies have demonstrated that multi- region control can display different layers of traffic state measurement and control, and incorporate heterogeneity effect in the large-scale network dynamics. The optimal perimeter control can manipulate the percentages of flows that transfer between two regions, offering real-time traffic management strategies to improve the network performance. However, the effect of route guidance evacuation integrated with perimeter control strategies in case of heterogeneous traffic networks is still unexplored. The paper advances in this direction by firstly extending route choice behavior aggregation with perimeter control. For an evacuation study, we consider a campus and its surrounding traffic network that can be classiffied into two types of networks: the first includes emergency areas that involve a large number of evacuees, and the second includes roads that lead to different destinations. The second network consists of some regions with different evacuation directions. Based on the configuration, this paper proposes a route evacuation guidance control strategy that addresses traffic flow first assignment between regions by controlling perimeter flow with the help of Macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) representation and to guide evacuates' route choice at intersections by LOGIT model in regions. In addition, comparison results show that the proposed route guidance strategy has considerable potential to improve performances and equilibrium conditions (i.e. system optimum and user equilibrium) on the overall network.

This approach is based on the fatigue reliability of bridge girders under the action of random traffic flows considering the presence of multiple trucks. A simply supported steel girder bridge designed according to the current codes was used as the bridge model to illustrate the presented approach. Based on the collected traffic data from Wisconsin, random traffic flows were generated using the Monte Carlo method and were used as the traffic loading. Numerical simulations were carried out to investigate the effects of three important parameters, including the fraction of traffic in the fast lane (FTFL), violation rate (VR), and truck weight limit (TWL), on the average fatigue damage accumulation (AFDA) induced by each truck in the random traffic flow. Based on the Miner's cumulative damage model and the S-N curve, the effects of these parameters on the fatigue reliability index of bridge girders were also analyzed. The truck weight limit that can ensure the target fatigue reliability of the bridge girders after 75years of service was determined based on the fatigue reliability analysis of the bridge girder.

We utilize the modern control theory to obtain the linear stability conditions with the consideration of feedback control signal, which shows that the stability of traffic flow is closely related to the information of the historic density difference.

We present one proposal to bring together Virtual Traffics Lights (VTLs) and platooning in urban scenarios, leaning on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication protocols that turn intersections into virtual containers of data. Newly-introduced protocols for the combined management of VTLs and platoons are validated by simulation, comparing a range of routing protocols for the vehicular networks with the baseline given by common deployments of traditional traffic lights ruled by state-of-the-art policies. The simulation results show that the combination of VTLs and platoons can achieve significant reductions in travel times and fuel consumption, provided that proper algorithms are used to handle the V2V communications.

Probabilistic Forecasting of Nitrogen Dioxide Concentrations at an Urban Road Intersection	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						urban air pollution; nitrogen dioxide concentration; probabilistic forecasting; traffic flow; wind speed	AIR-POLLUTION; METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS; TRAFFIC FLOW; NO2 CONCENTRATIONS; MODEL; POLLUTANTS; PREDICTION; OZONE	The concentration of nitrogen dioxide in the air along a major route in a large city is affected by very many factors, which are also interdependent. As an alternative to complicated deterministic models based on these complex processes, in this study a probabilistic model for predicting NO2 concentrations is proposed, using a simple accounting cluster-based method for determining probability distributions for tabulated values of ambient factors. Using the example of hourly values of NO2 concentration and data on wind speed and traffic flow for the main intersection in Wrocaw (Poland), a model is constructed to predict the frequency of occurrence of concentrations in the form of a probability distribution, for given values of the input variables. The model was successfully verified on data for the first six months of 2018. A mean continuous rank probability score (CRPS) of 9.15 mu g/m(3) was obtained. In spite of the greater impact of traffic volume on urban NO2 concentrations, as measured by Pearson's correlation coefficient, for instance, the model indicates that wind speed is also a very important factor-wind being the principal mechanism causing the evacuation of pollutants. This underlines the importance of sustainable city planning with regard to ensuring suitable conditions for the passage of air.

J	Nguyen-Phuoc, DQ; Currie, G; De Gruyter, C; Kim, I; Young, W				Nguyen-Phuoc, Duy Q.; Currie, Graham; De Gruyter, Chris; Kim, Inhi; Young, William			Modelling the net traffic congestion impact of bus operations in Melbourne	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Bus; Traffic congestion; Survey; Mode shift; Delay	LANES; STOP; FLOW	Bus services can be seen as a way to reduce traffic congestion where they can encourage a mode shift from car. However, they can also generate negative effects on traffic flow due to stop-start operations at bus stops. This paper aims to assess the net impact of bus operations on traffic congestion in Melbourne. The methodology used to achieve this aim comprised of three main stages. First, a primary survey was conducted to determine the mode shift from bus to car when buses are unavailable. This figure was used to estimate the positive impact of buses on relieving congestion. Second, the negative impact of buses was investigated by considering the effect of bus stop operations on vehicle traffic flow using microsimulation. Finally, the net effect was estimated by contrasting congestion measures determined from a traditional four step model between two scenarios: 'with bus' and 'without bus'. The results indicated that Melbourne's bus network contributes to reduce the number of severely congested road links by approximately 10% and total delay on the road network by around 3%. The highest congestion relief impact was found in inner Melbourne with a 7% decrease in vehicle time travelled and total delay, and 16% decrease in the number of heavily congested road links. In inner areas, the level of congestion is relatively high so the mode shift from car to bus, even if not as high as middle and outer areas, have a significant effect on relieving traffic congestion. Areas for future research are suggested such as investigating the long-term effect of buses on traffic congestion.

J	Tilg, G; Yang, KD; Menendez, M				Tilg, Gabriel; Yang, Kaidi; Menendez, Monica			Evaluating the effects of automated vehicle technology on the capacity of freeway weaving sections	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Automated vehicles; Traffic flow; Weaving sections; Multiclass hybrid model; Simulation-based optimization; Lane change positions	SURROGATE MODEL ALGORITHM; GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; TRAFFIC FLOW; MERGES; DROPS; WAVES	Weaving sections, where a merge and a diverge are in close proximity, are considered as crucial bottlenecks in the highway network. Lane changes happen frequently in such sections, leading to a reduced capacity and the traffic phenomenon known as capacity drop. This paper studies how the emerging automated vehicle technology can improve the operations and increase the capacity of weaving sections. We propose an efficient yet effective multiclass hybrid model that considers two aspects of this technology in scenarios with various penetration rates: (i) the potential to control the desired lane change decisions of automated vehicles, which is represented in a macroscopic manner as the distribution of lane change positions, and (ii) the lower reaction time associated with automated vehicles that can reduce headways and the required gaps for lane changing maneuvers. The proposed model is successfully calibrated and validated with empirical observations from conventional vehicles at a weaving section near the city of Basel, Switzerland. It is able to replicate traffic dynamics in weaving sections including the capacity drop. This model is then applied in a simulation-based optimization framework that searches for the optimal distribution of the desired lane change positions to maximize the capacity of weaving sections. Simulation results show that by optimizing the distribution of the desired lane change positions, the capacity of the studied weaving section can increase up to 15%. The results also indicate that if the reaction time is considered as well, there is an additional combined effect that can further increase the capacity. Overall, the results show the great potential of the automated vehicle technology for increasing the capacity of weaving sections.

Construction of traffic state vector using mutual information for short-term traffic flow prediction	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Traffic flow prediction; Mutual information; Traffic state vector; K-Nearest Neighbor model	PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; KALMAN FILTER; TIME-SERIES; MODEL; REGRESSION; NETWORKS; PATTERNS	Short-term traffic flow prediction is an integral part in most of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) research and applications. Many researchers have already developed various methods that predict the future traffic condition from the historical database. Nevertheless, there has not been sufficient effort made to study how to identify and utilize the different factors that affect the traffic flow. In order to improve the performance of short-term traffic flow prediction, it is necessary to consider sufficient information related to the road section to be predicted. In this paper, we propose a method of constructing traffic state vectors by using mutual information (MI). First, the variables with different time delays are generated from the historical traffic time series, and the spatio-temporal correlations between the road sections in urban road network are evaluated by the MI. Then, the variables with the highest correlation related to the target traffic flow are selected by using a greedy search algorithm to construct the traffic state vector. The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model is adapted for the application of the proposed state vector. Experimental results on real-world traffic data show that the proposed method of constructing traffic state vector provides good prediction accuracy in short-term traffic prediction.

In this paper, a new mechanism relaying on Reference Business Trajectories as a source of data to reduce the amount of Air Traffic Controller interventions at the tactical level while preserving Air Traffic Flow Management planned operations is presented. Artificial Intelligence can enable Constraint Programming as it is a powerful paradigm for solving complex, combinatorial search problems. The proposed methodology takes advantage of Constraint Programming and fosters adherence of Airspace User's trajectory preferences by identifying tight interdependencies between trajectories and introducing a new mechanism to improve the aircraft separation at concurrence events considering time uncertainty. The underlying philosophy is to capitalize present degrees of freedom between layered Air Traffic Management planning tools, when sequencing departures at the airports by considering the benefits of small time stamp changes in the assigned Calculated Take-Off Time departures and to enhance Trajectory-Based Operations concepts.

J	Wu, X; Guo, JF; Xian, K; Zhou, XS				Wu, Xin; Guo, Jifu; Xian, Kai; Zhou, Xuesong			Hierarchical travel demand estimation using multiple data sources: A forward and backward propagation algorithmic framework on a layered computational graph	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Travel demand estimation; Multi-source data; Back propagation; Computational graph	ORIGIN-DESTINATION DEMAND; TRAFFIC FLOW PREDICTION; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; BIG DATA; MODEL; UNCERTAINTY; CALIBRATION; MATRICES	Aiming to develop a theoretically consistent framework to estimate travel demand using multiple data sources, this paper first proposes a multi-layered Hierarchical Flow Network (HFN) representation to structurally model different levels of travel demand variables including trip generation, origin/destination matrices, path/link flows, and individual behavior parameters. Different data channels from household travel surveys, smartphone type devices, global position systems, and sensors can be mapped to different layers of the proposed network structure. We introduce Big data-driven Transportation Computational Graph (BTCG), alternatively Beijing Transportation Computational Graph, as the underlying mathematical modeling tool to perform automatic differentiation on layers of composition functions. A feedforward passing on the HFN sequentially implements 3 steps of the traditional 4-step process: trip generation, spatial distribution estimation, and path flow-based traffic assignment, respectively. BTCG can aggregate different layers of partial first-order gradients and use the back-propagation of "loss errors" to update estimated demand variables. A comparative analysis indicates that the proposed methods can effectively integrate different data sources and offer a consistent representation of demand. The proposed methodology is also evaluated under a demonstration network in a Beijing sub-network.

J	Xiao, L; Wang, M; Schakel, W; van Arem, B				Xiao, Lin; Wang, Meng; Schakel, Wouter; van Arem, Bart			Unravelling effects of cooperative adaptive cruise control deactivation on traffic flow characteristics at merging bottlenecks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control; Authority transitions; Merging; Microscopic simulation; Capacity drop	CAR-FOLLOWING BEHAVIORS; SIMULATION FRAMEWORK; VEHICLE AUTOMATION; CAPACITY ANALYSIS; MODEL; HIGHWAY; FREEWAY; COMMUNICATION; SYSTEMS; DESIGN	Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) systems have the potential to increase roadway capacity and mitigate traffic congestion thanks to the short following distance enabled by inter vehicle communication. However, due to limitations in acceleration and deceleration capabilities of CACC systems, deactivation and switch to ACC or human-driven mode will take place when conditions are outside the operational design domain. Given the lack of elaborate models on this interaction, existing CACC traffic flow models have not yet been able to reproduce realistic CACC vehicle behaviour and pay little attention to the influence of system deactivation on traffic flow at bottlenecks. This study aims to gain insights into the influence of CACC on highway operations at merging bottlenecks by using a realistic CACC model that captures driver-system interactions and string length limits. We conduct systematic traffic simulations for various CACC market penetration rates (MPR) to derive free-flow capacity and queue discharge rate of the merging section and compare these to the capacity of a homogeneous pipeline section. The results show that an increased CACC MPR can indeed increase the roadway capacity. However, the resulting capacity in the merging bottleneck is much lower than the pipeline capacity and capacity drop persists in bottleneck scenarios at all CACC MPR levels. It is also found that CACC increases flow heterogeneity due to the switch among different operation modes. A microscopic investigation of the CACC operational mode and trajectories reveals a close relation between CACC deactivation, traffic congestion and flow heterogeneity.

The social cost of pedestrian-car accidents pushes the development of more effective and expressive computational models and simulation systems, integrating analytical knowledge, data and experience about pedestrian-vehicle interactions. The paper presents the results of a significant data gathering campaign focused on the considered phenomenon and aimed at supporting the extension and calibration of an existing model. A video-recorded naturalistic observation was executed in an area of the City of Milan (Italy) characterized by a significant presence of elderly inhabitants and by a high number of road accidents involving pedestrians in the past years. The achieved results include both macroscopic and microscopic indicators about pedestrian vehicle interactions at the observed non-signalized intersection, with reference to: (i) traffic volumes; (ii) Level of Service; (iii) drivers compliance to pedestrians right of way on zebra crossing; (iv) age-driven pedestrian crossing behaviour, focusing on motor skills (speeds and trajectories) and decision making (accepted time gap to cross). Since elderlies represent one of the most vulnerable pedestrians in terms of road accidents, data analysis is focused on comparing results among two samples composed of adults and aged pedestrians. Results showed that crossing behaviour is characterized by three main phases: approaching, appraising (evaluation of the distance and speed of oncoming vehicles) and crossing. Moreover, results showed a significant difference in the crossing behaviour of adult and elderly pedestrians.

J	Rainer, B; Petscharnig, S				Rainer, Benjamin; Petscharnig, Stefan			Challenges and Opportunities of Named Data Networking in Vehicle-To-Everything Communication: A Review	INFORMATION			English	Article						Information Centric Networking; Named Data Networking; V2X; secure communication	INFORMATION-CENTRIC NETWORKING	Many car manufacturers have recently proposed to release autonomous self-driving cars within the next few years. Information gathered by sensors (e.g., cameras, GPS, lidar, radar, ultrasonic) enable cars to drive autonomously on roads. However, in urban or high-speed traffic scenarios the information gathered by mounted sensors may not be sufficient to guarantee a smooth and safe traffic flow. Thus, information received from infrastructure and other cars or vehicles on the road is vital. Key aspects in Vehicle-To-Everything (V2X) communication are security, authenticity, and integrity which are inherently provided by Information Centric Networking (ICN). In this paper, we identify advantages and drawbacks of ICN for V2X communication. We specifically review forwarding, caching, as well as simulation aspects for V2X communication with a focus on ICN. Furthermore, we investigate existing solutions for V2X and discuss their applicability. Based on these investigations, we suggest directions for further work in context of ICN (in particular Named Data Networking) to enable V2X communication providing a secure and efficient transport platform.

The case of alternative routes for urban traffic	CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS			English	Article						Networks; Matrix functions; Euclidean distances; Urban traffic; Random geometric graphs	FLOW; EFFICIENCY; PHYSICS; GRAPHS; MODELS	We generalize here the communicability metric on graphs/networks to include a tuning parameter that accounts for the level of edge "deterioration". This generalized metric covers a wide range of realistic scenarios in networks, which includes shortest-path metric as a particular case. We study the communicability metric on an urban street network, and show that communicability shortest paths in this city accounts for most of the traffic between series of origin-destination points. Particularly, we show that the traffic flow and congestion in the shortest communicability paths is much bigger than in the corresponding shortest paths. This indicates that under certain conditions drivers in a city avoid long paths but also avoid the most interconnected street intersections, which typically may be the most congested ones. We develop here a diffusion-like model on the network based on a particle-hopping scheme inspired by "tight-binding" quantum mechanical Hamiltonian, which offers a solid explanation on why traffic is diverted through the shortest communicability routes instead of the shortest-paths.

Certain modifications were made in the existing 1D models to describe the overtaking and lane changing manoeuvre of the mixed traffic stream. However, the continuous lateral manoeuvre of the no-lane based mixed traffic cannot be described by these parameters. This paper initially provides a brief review of different 2D behavioural models, which describe the longitudinal and lateral movements simultaneously. Also, the various existing commercially available traffic micro-simulation frameworks developed for representing the real traffic are reviewed. Different microscopic traffic parameters used in the existing simulation models to mimic the real-world traffic are identified, which can be used to understand the 2D traffic stream.

This article aims to address the daily traffic flow forecasting problem given historical data. Because the traffic flow pattern is strongly correlated with contextual factors, we propose a match-then-predict method which integrates contextual matching and time series prediction based on group method of data handling (GMDH) algorithm. From a Seattle-based case study, we show that the contextual matching can significantly improve the prediction accuracy. We also show that the proposed method can in general outperform alternative prediction methods in daily traffic flow forecasting in terms of prediction accuracy.

The introduction of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is expected to advance safety and comfort. But, they can also affect characteristics of road networks, such as capacities, delays and efficiency. To foresee important challenges, reinforce potential benefits and reduce potential disadvantages of this new disruptive technology, its impacts should be well studied and understood before their anticipated introduction. In this paper, a microscopic simulation framework to estimate these impacts is developed. Simulation experiments are conducted for various traffic mixtures of manually driven vehicles, AVs and CAVs, different desired time headways settings and traffic demand levels, to evaluate the sensitivity of the network performance to these factors. The ring road of Antwerp is used for the case study. Thus, the results and conclusions refer to a large real-world network. The consequences of the introduction of AVS and CAVs on traffic flow and pollutant emissions are evaluated. The results show that depending on the demand, AVs introduction can have negative effects on traffic flow, while CAVs may benefit the network performance, depending on their market penetration.

By adopting the macroscopic traffic flow model METANET, this study analyses the state change of traffic flow on the road network and establishes the dynamic traffic diversion model, inducing the redistribution of traffic demand. Considering the changes in the amount of origin-destination (O-D) demand, diversion rate is introduced into the basic theory of dynamic O-D model, and then established a dynamic traffic flow model based on dynamic demand change. The genetic algorithm is used to solve the non-linearity problem of the objective function in the traffic diversion model. This study sets up five cases for numerical analyses, and gets the optimal diversion scheme.

Accordingly, the present study aims to evaluate how crashes in the urban road network are affected by contributing factors. Therefore, in the present paper, a comparison has been done among four artificial neural network (ANN) techniques: extreme learning machine (ELM), probabilistic neural network (PNN), radial basis function (RBF), and multilayer perceptron (MLP). According to the measures used, including Nash-Sutcliffe (NS), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE), ELM was found to be the most successful approach in addressing the objectives defined in the present study. Moreover, not only is ELM the fastest algorithm due to its different structure, but it has also led to the most accurate prediction. In the end, the RReliefF algorithm was utilized to find the importance of variables used, including V/C, speed, vehicle kilometer traveled (VKT), roadway width, existence of median, and allowable/not-allowable parking. It was proved that VKT is the most influential variable in accident occurrence, followed by two traffic flow characteristics: V/C and speed.

J	Stipancic, J; Miranda-Moreno, L; Saunier, N; Labbe, A				Stipancic, Joshua; Miranda-Moreno, Luis; Saunier, Nicolas; Labbe, Aurelie			Surrogate safety and network screening: Modelling crash frequency using GPS travel data and latent Gaussian Spatial Models	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Crash frequency; GPS; Spatial; Full Bayes; Latent Gaussian Model; MLA	DISPERSION PARAMETER; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; SITES; SEVERITY; COUNTS; ROADS; FLOW	Improving road safety requires accurate network screening methods to identify and prioritize sites in order to maximize the effectiveness of implemented countermeasures. In screening, hotspots are commonly identified using statistical models and ranking criteria derived from observed crash data. However, collision databases are subject to errors, omissions, and underreporting. More importantly, crash-based methods are reactive and require years of crash data. With the arrival of new technologies including Global Positioning System (GPS) trajectory data, proactive surrogate safety methods have gained popularity as an alternative approach for screening. GPS-enabled smartphones can collect reliable and spatio-temporally rich driving data from regular drivers using an inexpensive, simple, and user-friendly tool. However, few studies to date have analyzed large volumes of smartphone GPS data and considered surrogate-safety modelling techniques for network screening. The purpose of this paper is to propose a surrogate safety screening approach based on smartphone GPS data and a Full Bayesian modelling framework. After processing crash data and GPS data collected in Quebec City, Canada, several surrogate safety measures (SSMs), including vehicle manoeuvres (hard braking) and measures of traffic flow (congestion, average speed, and speed variation), were extracted. Then, spatial crash frequency models incorporating the extracted SSMs were proposed and validated. A Latent Gaussian Spatial Model was estimated using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) technique. While the INLA Negative Binomial models outperformed alternative models, incorporating spatial correlations provided the greatest improvement in model fit. Relationships between SSMs and crash frequency established in previous studies were generally supported by the modelling results. For example, hard braking, congestion, and speed variation were all positively linked to crash counts at the intersection level. Network screening based on SSMs presents a substantial contribution to the field of road safety and works towards the elimination of crash data in evaluation and monitoring.

J	Yu, M; Fan, W				Yu, Miao; Fan, Wei (David)			Optimal Variable Speed Limit Control at a Lane Drop Bottleneck: Genetic Algorithm Approach	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Variable speed limits; Genetic algorithm; Optimization; Truck percentage	CONTROL STRATEGY; TRAFFIC FLOW; MODEL; FREEWAYS; DESIGN; SAFETY; WAVES	This paper develops a genetic algorithm (GA) approach to solving the variable speed limit (VSL) control problem at a lane drop bottleneck. A multiobjective nonlinear integer model is formulated for the VSL control. The objective function includes the minimization of the sum of three components: the total travel time (TTT) on the studied freeway segments; the total speed variation (TSV) between the speed limits and the detected speeds from the most upstream and most downstream detectors; and the total speed difference (TSD) between the speed limits and the effective speeds on the controlled segments. Solution qualities from the GA and the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm are evaluated and compared. The numerical results show that the VSL control optimized by the GA outperforms the SQP. The VSL control results corresponding to various driver compliance rates are examined. The relationships among the truck percentages; the TTT, TSV, and TSD; and the combined objective function value are given. Finally, the potential effect of the left-lane truck restriction policy on the impact of trucks on the VSL control is examined and presented.

J	Qin, YY; Wang, H; Ran, B				Qin, Yanyan; Wang, Hao; Ran, Bin			Stability Analysis of Connected and Automated Vehicles to Reduce Fuel Consumption and Emissions	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING PART A-SYSTEMS			English	Article						Connected and automated vehicle; Stability analysis; Fuel consumption; Traffic emissions; Transfer function theory; Car-following model	ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; CAR-FOLLOWING THEORY; AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES; TRAFFIC DYNAMICS; MODEL; SYSTEMS; ENVIRONMENT; SPEED; INTERSECTION; VALIDATION	Obtaining an optimal stability condition is very important to benefit traffic flow operations for a mix of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and regular vehicles. In view of multiple spatial anticipations of CAV car-following models, this paper presents a stability analysis method for mixed CAV flow from the perspective of the uniform local platoon. Transfer function theory was used to derive the stability criterion of the uniform local platoon, based on which a stability chart of equilibrium speeds and CAV feedback coefficients was calculated. Numerical simulations were also performed on a segment of highway with an on-ramp using car-following models to evaluate the impacts of the stability analysis on fuel consumption and emissions [carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and nitrogen oxides (NOx)]. The stability chart indicates that by controlling CAV feedback coefficients, the optimal stability condition can be obtained, in which the uniform local platoon remains stable for all driving speeds. Moreover, the stability analysis method can reduce fuel consumption and traffic emissions. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The results show that the flow rate and the average velocity are generally equal in the same density which is different among the lanes. The analysis of lane changing times and the velocity total deviation show some characteristics which are difficult to explain phase transitions under fundamental diagram theory. Therefore, the concept of lane changing probability is introduced, and it is concluded that the speed-limit rule can reduce the motivation of lane changing effectively.

J	Kanagaraj, V; Treiber, M				Kanagaraj, Venkatesan; Treiber, Martin			Self-driven particle model for mixed traffic and other disordered flows	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Social forces; Disordered traffic; Self-driven particles; Two-dimensional traffic flow; Autonomous vehicles; Bike traffic	LANE-CHANGING MODELS; SIMULATION	Vehicles in developing countries have widely varying dimensions and speeds, and drivers tend to not follow lane discipline. In this flow state called "mixed traffic", the interactions between drivers and the resulting maneuvers resemble more that of general disordered self-driven particle systems than that of the orderly lane-based traffic flow of industrialized countries. We propose a general multi particle model for such self-driven "high-speed particles" and show that it reproduces the observed characteristics of mixed traffic. The main idea is to generalize a conventional acceleration-based car-following model to a two-dimensional force field. For in-line following, the model reverts to the underlying car following model, for very slow speeds, it reverts to an anisotropic social-force model for pedestrians. With additional floor fields at the position of lane markings, the model reverts to an integrated car-following and lane-changing model with continuous lateral dynamics including cooperative aspects such as zip merging.

An essential approach consists in using, as an a priori information, previous observations and measurements. The formal tools used in our analysis consists in: (1) associating a digraph to the network where the edges correspond to arteries and the vertices with loops represent the sites. (2) From a distribution of vehicles within the network, we construct a matrix from which we derive a stochastic matrix (SM). This matrix becomes the generator of the evolution of the traffic flow. And (3), we use the Perron-Frobenius theory for a formal analysis. We investigate three models: (a) a closed network with conserved number of vehicles; (b) to this network we add an influx and an outflux of vehicles to picture an open system. And (c), we construct a nonlinear model whose formal structure exhibits the existence of several (L) stationary states for the distribution of vehicles at each site, that alternate cyclically with time. Each state represents the traffic for L different moments. These models are hybridized and compared numerically to the effective vehicular traffic in a sector of the city of Tigre, localized in the province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The empirical data and the traffic modelization are presented in a following paper, referred as Part II. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, based on the lattice hydrodynamic model a new feedback control model is derived in a single-lane system. The memory effect of flux difference is considered in the new model to suppress the traffic jam. The critical condition of the model is analyzed by control method. The simulations are applied to verify the influence of feedback control signal on alleviating traffic jam. Besides, energy consumption simulation is designed in this paper. All the results demonstrate that the memory effect of flux difference model enhances the stability of traffic flow. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the safety conditions of freeways are drawing increasing concerns both from the authorities and the public in the country. The safety design and management for freeways are urgently needed considering the current safety situation and great demands of new freeways. The study presented in this paper thoroughly investigated factors affecting safety using detailed data of crashes, traffic characteristics and freeway geometry. A random effects negative binomial (RENB) model was applied to account for spatial variations within groups together with a negative binomial (NB) model. The results indicated a better goodness of fit of RENB model than the NB model. In addition, a good number of factors significantly contributed to crash, such as truck proportion, presence of climbing lane, median barrier offset, curvature and longitudinal grade, were identified. This study was expected to provide a better understanding of how traffic condition and freeway design affect safety and should be useful to freeway engineers to design safe freeways, or develop effective safety countermeasures.

J	Xiao, JL; Wei, C; Liu, YC				Xiao, Jianli; Wei, Chao; Liu, Yuncai			Speed estimation of traffic flow using multiple kernel support vector regression	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Speed; Estimation; Traffic flow; Multiple kernel learning; Support vector regression	FUZZY NEURAL-NETWORK; PREDICTION	Industrial loop detectors (ILDs) are the most common traffic detectors. In Shanghai, most of the ILDs are installed in a single loop way, which can detect various parameters, such as flow, saturation, and so on. However, they cannot detect the speed directly, which is one of the key inputs of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) for identifying the traffic state. Thus, this paper is dedicated to estimate speed accurately. It proposes a new algorithm that multiple kernel support vector regression (MKL-SVR) to complete this goal, which improves the accuracy and robustness of the speed estimation. Extensive experiments have been performed to evaluate the performances of MKL-SVR, compared with polynomial fitting, BP neural networks and SVR. All results indicate that the performances of MKL-SVR are the best and most robust. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, a novel and model-free iterative learning control (ILC) strategy for balancing traffic flow in urban traffic network is proposed. To tackle the randomly varying trial lengths in the iteration domain of traffic system, an iterative-average operator is introduced in the proposed ILC law for tracking tasks with non-uniform trial lengths, which thus mitigates the requirement on classic ILC that all trial lengths must be identical. The learning convergence condition of the ILC strategy in iteration-average and expectation is derived through rigorous analysis. The performance and the effectiveness of the ILC strategy are analyzed by simulations on a test road network. The results show that the proposed ILC strategy can homogeneously balance the accumulation in the network and improve the network mobility. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the results of estimation of complexity by MMSE method may be inaccurate as the coarse-graining procedure reduces the length of the time series at a large scale. In addition, MMSE has some limitations, mainly its inability to detect abrupt changes in the signal and ignore the difference between distinct patterns. In order to overcome those above limitations of MMSE, this paper introduces the weighted multivariate composite multiscale sample entropy (WMCMSE) as a measure to characterize the complexity of nonlinear time series. And we illustrate the necessity of WMCMSE method by comparing WMCMSE results with multivariate multiscale sample entropy (MMSE), weighted multivariate multiscale sample entropy (WMMSE), multivariate composite multiscale sample entropy (MCMSE) on random series. Then, WMCMSE method is employed to study the complexity of traffic speed and volume time series of Beijing Ring 2, 3, 4 roads, which are from August 11th to October 20th, 2012. The results of WMCMSE show that the WMCMSE method can distinguish the behavior of the flow time series, which means that we can detect the congested traffic system. We found that road condition of ring 2, 3, 4 road is very different. Compared to the ring 4 road, the values of the WMCMSE of the ring 2 and 3 roads are higher, indicating that the traffic flow on Ring 2 and Ring 3 road are more complex compared to Ring 4 road. The higher the complexity, the more traffic jams. Government departments can judge the traffic congestion of that time period and that road according to the complexity differences between different time periods and different roads, and then take different measures.

J	Abbasi, IA; Khan, AS; Ali, S				Abbasi, Irshad Ahmed; Khan, Adnan Shahid; Ali, Shahzad			A Reliable Path Selection and Packet Forwarding Routing Protocol for Vehicular Ad hoc Networks	EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						Multiple intersections; Position-based routing; Optimal route; Forwarding		Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have earned a gigantic consideration in the recent era. Wide deployment of VANETs for enhancing traffic safety, traffic management, and assisting drivers through elegant transportation system is facing several research challenges that need to be addressed. One of the crucial issues consists of the design of scalable routing algorithms that are robust to rapid topology changes and frequent link disconnections caused by the high mobility of vehicles. In this article, first of all, we give a detailed technical analysis, comparison, and drawbacks of the existing state-of-the-art routing protocols. Then, we propose a novel routing scheme called a Reliable Path Selection and Packet Forwarding Routing Protocol (RPSPF). The novelty of our protocol comes from the fact that firstly it establishes an optimal route for vehicles to send packets towards their respective destinations by considering connectivity and the shortest optimal distance based on multiple intersections. Secondly, it uses a novel reliable packet forwarding technique in-between intersections that avoids packet loss while forwarding packet due to the occurrence of sudden link ruptures. The performance of the protocol is assessed through computer simulations. Simulation outcomes specify the gains of the proposed routing scheme as compared to the earlier significant protocols like GSR (Geographic Source Routing), GPSR (Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing), E-GyTAR (Enhanced Greedy Traffic Aware Routing), and TFOR (Traffic Flow-Oriented Routing) in terms of routing metrics such as delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and routing overhead.

J	Yu, L				Yu, Lei			Nonlinear analysis of a continuum traffic flow model with consideration of the viscous effect	MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B			English	Article						Viscous model; traffic flow model; local cluster	CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; SHOCK-WAVES; BEHAVIOR; ROAD; JAMS	In this paper, the nonlinear analysis of a viscous continuum traffic flow model is studied. The stability condition of the viscous continuum model is given by using the linear analysis method. The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation is derived to describe the traffic jams. The effect of the viscous term is investigated by numerical simulations. The results show that the existence of the viscous term induces oscillation of traffic flow and the amplitude of the oscillation increases with increasing the coefficient of the viscous term. It is also found that the local clusters are compressed by increasing the coefficient of the viscous term.

J	Fan, WB; Jiang, XG				Fan, Wenbo; Jiang, Xinguo			Conceptual development and economic evaluation of Multilevel Premium Highways	RESEARCH IN TRANSPORTATION ECONOMICS			English	Article						Traffic congestion; Tolls; Toll revenues; Road pricing; Congestion pricing	MULTILANE TRAFFIC FLOW; BEHAVIORAL-THEORY; TIME; RELIABILITY	A variety of innovative value pricing schemes have been applied in the US to mitigate traffic congestion in a sustainable manner. This paper proposes a new concept, called Multilevel Premium Highways (MPH), to tackle traffic congestion with different options addressing travelers' diverse needs. The new concept is featured by: (i) a fully priced highway with hierarchical speeds designated on different lanes; (ii) a discriminated toll strategy; and (iii) a package of complementary services directly funded by the toll revenues. To examine the effectiveness of MPH, this paper firstly develops a qualitative comparison with the conventional value pricing (VP) schemes, and conducts a spreadsheet-based benefit-cost analysis under two scenarios with the realistic input data, and then performs a sensitivity analysis to examine the impacts of key factors (e.g., traffic demand and travelers' willingness-to-pay). Discrete choice models are also applied to unveil the impacts of heterogeneous travelers on the performance of MPH. Results show that MPH appears to be economically and financially sustainable for large-scale applications, although the initial settings (e.g., the designated speeds and toll values) of highway lanes influence the relative performance between MPH and the conventional VP schemes.

J	Rabbouch, H; Saadaoui, F; Mraihi, R				Rabbouch, Hana; Saadaoui, Foued; Mraihi, Rafaa			A vision-based statistical methodology for automatically modeling continuous urban traffic flows	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Urban traffic flow; Video summarization; Wavelet-based regression; Information retrieval; Long memory models; Simulation	ACTION RECOGNITION; TIME-SERIES; TRACKING; SYSTEM	We introduce an online video-based virtual sensor allowing to automatically estimate and forecast the number of vehicles passing through a road section over a continuous time interval. The strategy consists, in the first place, in defining a Motion Intensity Index (MII) whose role is to quantify the visual activity in a traffic video. A wavelet-based cause-and-effect statistical model is then used to match the actual number of vehicles to their respective motion scores. This leads to an efficient estimator of the urban traffic flow. The implementation is well optimized in such a way that the local sampling rate is directly proportional to the amount of visual activity in localized sub-shot units of the video. The procedure allows designing an autonomous sensor giving every moment a measure of the flow on a road section and an expectation of its future levels. The device can be very useful for optimizing transportation management, facilitating strategic decision-making, and analyzing networks with the purpose of optimizing transportation equipment efficiency.

J	Zhang, H; Wang, XM; Cao, J; Tang, MN; Guo, YR				Zhang, Hong; Wang, Xiaoming; Cao, Jie; Tang, Minan; Guo, Yirong			A multivariate short-term traffic flow forecasting method based on wavelet analysis and seasonal time series	APPLIED INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Hybrid method; Traffic flow; Short-term forecasting; Wavelet analysis; Multivariate	NEURAL-NETWORK	Short-term traffic flow forecasting is a key step to achieve the performance of intelligent transportation system (ITS). Timely and accurate traffic information prediction is also the prerequisite of realizing proactive traffic control and dynamic traffic assignment effectively. Based on the fact that univariate forecasting methods have limited forecasting abilities when the data is missing or erroneous and that single models make no full use of information underline data, a new hybrid method with multivariate for short-term traffic flow forecasting is proposed. This method combines statistical analysis method with computational intelligence techniques to mine the characteristic of traffic flow as well as forecast short-term traffic state. First, the wavelet de-noising is employed to remove the noise information. Then, time series analysis is used to analyze time-varying and periodic characteristic of traffic flow. Furthermore, the seasonal auto-regressive moving average with external input (SARIMAX) is established to fit traffic flow with occupancy as exogenous variables. Finally, wavelet forecast is adopted to forecast the values of occupancy which are used as exogenous input, and a WSARIMAX is constructed to forecast traffic flow. Using the relationship of flow and occupancy at the same road section and taking traffic flow and occupancy data from freeway I-694 EB in the Twin Cities as endogenous variables and exogenous variables respectively, this paper studies the forecasting performance of the proposed method. The study results are encouraging. Compared with SARIMA newly proposed in literature, WSARIMA and SARIMAX improved method with wavelet analysis and multivariate modeling method, the proposed method gets improvements of 12.95%, 12.62% and 10.41% in forecasting accuracy of one-step ahead respectively. For ten-steps ahead forecasting, it gets improvements of 18.87%, 17.05% and 2.57% in forecasting accuracy respectively.

J	Stolfi, DH; Alba, E				Stolfi, Daniel H.; Alba, Enrique			Generating realistic urban traffic flows with evolutionary techniques	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Evolutionary algorithm; Traffic simulation; Smart mobility; SUMO; Road traffic optimization; O-D matrix	ORIGIN-DESTINATION-MATRIX; VEHICULAR COMMUNICATIONS; OPTIMIZATION; SIGNAL; OPENSTREETMAP; ALGORITHMS; SIMULATION; NETWORKS; COUNTS; SYSTEM	In this article we present a novel approach for calculating realistic traffic flows for traffic simulators, called Flow Generator Algorithm (FGA). We start with an original map from OpenStreetMap and traffic data collected at different measurement points, published by the city's authorities, to produce a model consisting of the simulation map and a series of traffic flows (routes + vehicles) which match the real number of vehicles at those streets. Our approach does not need a full dataset to calculate the flows. In fact, just a few measurement points indicating the number of vehicles in the analyzed time interval were used. This and the use of evolutionary algorithms for such a complex task make our proposal different from the studies found in literature. Despite the fact we have chosen the SUMO traffic simulator for our experiments, this idea can be easily adapted to others. We have tested our proposal on two geographical areas of the city of Malaga, comprising different map sizes, number of sensors and vehicles, and have achieved measurement values from the simulation that are closer to the real values, showing an error lower than 10%. Our algorithm, as well as the realistic scenarios generated by using it, can be used as the basis for other research approaches, especially those focused on road traffic optimization.

The key to shared bus implementation lies in accurately predicting travel requirements and planning dynamic routes. However, the sparseness and the high volatility of shared bus data bring a great resistance to accurate prediction of travel requirements. Based on the consideration of user experiences, optimization objectives of shared bus route planning are significantly different from traditional public transportation and shared bus route planning is far more challenging than online car-hailing services due to the relatively high number of passengers. In this paper, we put forward a two-stage approach (SubBus), which is composed of travel requirement prediction and dynamic routes planning, based on various crowdsourced shared bus data to generate dynamic routes for shared buses in the "last mile" scene. First, we analyze the resident travel behaviors to obtain five predictive features, such as flow, time, week, location, and bus, and utilize them to predict travel requirements accurately based on a machine learning model. Second, we design a dynamic programming algorithm to generate dynamic, optimal routes with fixed destinations for multiple operating buses utilizing prediction results based on operating characteristics of shared buses. Extensive experiments are performed on real crowdsourced shared subway shuttle bus data and demonstrate that SubBus outperforms other methods on dynamic route planning for the "last mile" scene.

In this paper, we put forward a feasible solution that enables offloading for real-time traffic management in fog-based IoV systems, aiming to minimize the average response time for events reported by vehicles. First, we construct a distributed city-wide traffic management system, in which vehicles close to road side units can be utilized as fog nodes. Then, we model parked and moving vehicle-based fog nodes according to a queueing theory, and draw the conclusion that moving vehicle-based fog nodes can be modeled as an M/M/1 queue. An approximate approach is developed to solve the offloading optimization problem by decomposing it into two subproblems and scheduling traffic flows among different fog nodes. Performance analyses based on a real-world taxi-trajectory datasets are conducted to illustrate the superiority of our method.

Such strategies aim at network-wide traffic flow efficiency improvement via local actions, thus low design effort and infrastructure investment. This study presents, compares, and evaluates two such innovative approaches: the job scheduling algorithm comprising the local control component of the scalable urban traffic control (SURTRAC) system and the max- or back-pressure algorithm. The approaches are also compared against traffic-responsive urban control (TUC), a well-established strategy with centralised logic. Evaluation is based on the AIMSUN simulation model of the city centre of Chania, Greece. The study results indicate that the TUC and max-pressure retain performance independently of the prevailing traffic conditions, while also being computationally simpler than job scheduling. Both decentralised approaches require frequent (high-resolution) and relatively accurate measurements; on the other hand, TUC, although less demanding in this respect, calls for communication lines between the junction controllers and the central computer. Finally, compared with both decentralised approaches, the TUC provides a signal plan sequence with less excessive differences between each other, thus fewer disturbances to the common network users. Nevertheless, for more comprehensive conclusions, more investigations, including field trials, would be needed.

Automatic incident classification for large-scale traffic data by adaptive boosting SVM	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Automatic incident classification; Outlier; Traffic data; Adaptive boosting; SVM	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; OUTLIER DETECTION; OBJECT DETECTION; NETWORKS; RECOGNITION; CLASSIFIERS; MULTICLASS; MODEL	Modern cities experience heavy traffic flows and congestions regularly across space and time. Monitoring traffic situations becomes an important challenge for the Traffic Control and Surveillance Systems (TCSS). In advanced TCSS, it is helpful to automatically detect and classify different traffic incidents such as severity of congestion, abnormal driving pattern, abrupt or illegal stop on road, etc. Although most TCSS are equipped with basic incident detection algorithms, they are however crude to be really useful as an automated tool for further classification. In literature, there is a lack of research for Automated Incident Classification (AIC). Therefore, a novel AIC method is proposed in this paper to tackle such challenges. In the proposed method, traffic signals are firstly extracted from captured videos and converted as spatial-temporal (ST) signals. Based on the characteristics of the ST signals, a set of realistic simulation data are generated to construct an extended large-scale traffic database to cover a variety of traffic situations. Next, a local mean filter is introduced to suppress the effect of noise and extract significant features from the ST signals. The extracted features are then associated with various types of traffic data: one normal type (inliers) and multiple abnormal types (outliers). For the classification, an adaptive boosting classifier is trained to detect outliers in traffic data automatically. Further, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based method is adopted to train the model for identifying the categories of outliers. In short, this hybrid approach is called an Adaptive Boosting Support Vector Machines (AB-SVM) method. Experimental results show that the proposed AB-SVM method achieves a satisfied result with more than 92% classification accuracy on average. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

J	Priambodo, B; Ahmad, A				Priambodo, Bagus; Ahmad, Azlina			TRAFFIC FLOW PREDICTION MODEL BASED ON NEIGHBOURING ROADS USING NEURAL NETWORK AND MULTIPLE REGRESSION	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY-MALAYSIA			English	Article						Traffic congestion; traffic prediction; neural network; multiple regression method		Monitoring and understanding traffic congestion seems difficult due to its complex nature. This is because the occurrence of traffic congestion is dynamic and interrelated and it depends on many factors. Traffic congestion can also propagate from one road to neighbouring roads. Recent research shows that there is a spatial correlation between neighbouring roads with different traffic flow pattern on weekdays and on weekends. Previously, prediction of traffic flow propagation was based on day and time during weekdays and on weekends. Results obtained from past studies show that further investigation is needed to reduce errors using a more efficient method. We observed from previous research that similarity of traffic condition on weekdays and weekends was not taken into account in predicting traffic flow propagation. Hence, our study is to create and evaluate a new prediction model for traffic flow propagation at neighbouring roads using similarity of traffic flow pattern on weekdays and weekends to achieve more accurate results. We exploit similarity of traffic flow pattern on weekdays and weekends by adding time cluster in our proposed model. Thus, our neural network model proposed high correlation road, time and day clusters as input factors in neural network model prediction. Our initial phase of the methodology involves investigation on correlation between neighbouring roads. This paper discusses the results of experiments we have conducted to determine relationship between roads in a neighbouring area and to determine input factors for our neural network traffic flow prediction model. To choose a particular road as a predicting factor, we calculated the distance between roads in neighbouring area to identify the nearest road. Then, we calculated correlation based on traffic condition (congestion) between roads in neighbouring area. The results were then used as input factors for prediction of traffic flow. We compared the results of the experiment using neural network without cluster parameters and multiple regression methods. We observed that neural network with time cluster parameter produced better results compared to neural network without parameter and multiple regression method in predicting average speed of vehicles on neighbouring roads.

J	Zhang, YN; Zhou, YH				Zhang, Yongnan; Zhou, Yonghua			Distributed coordination control of traffic network flow using adaptive genetic algorithm based on cloud computing	JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic network signal control; Distributed coordination control; Parallel adaptive genetic algorithm; Cloud computing	SECURITY ISSUES; CHALLENGES; OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEMS; MODEL	Adaptive traffic signal control can automatically adjust signal cycles, offsets and green ratios with the fluctuations of traffic flow to reduce the delay of vehicle fleets. At present, cloud computing has provided a technically feasible realization measure for the real-time optimization processing of adaptive traffic signal control with traffic big data. This paper proposes a by-level optimization strategy of signal cycles, offsets and green ratios on the cloud computing platform. The optimization of cycles and offsets among road intersections coordinates traffic flow on road links, called coordination control. The optimization of green ratios at each intersection further controls traffic flow on each road link, called distributed control. The coarse-grained parallel adaptive genetic algorithm (CPAGA) is developed for the optimization of distributed coordination control. On the cloud computing platform, the common data of road network and traffic flow is located in the bottom layer and transparently shared to related computing nodes. The CPAGAs at computing nodes are deployed to perform coordinated distributed optimization of adaptive traffic signal control. A migration strategy is developed for the parallel genetic algorithm where a portion of worse chromosomes at one computing node is replaced by better chromosomes at another node with a replace probability. The distributed coordination control procedures are designed with computing nodes being dynamically deployed at different optimization phases. The simulation experiments with regard to a realistic traffic network are carried out on the cloud computing platform. The numerical results demonstrate that the CPAGA can avoid falling into a local optimum and has fast solution efficiency. The proposed distributed coordination control of traffic signals is superior to the commonly used timing control at reducing traffic delay.

One of the significant ways to reduce traffic congestion in cities is by improving the public transportation system. Therefore, it is essential to use advanced software tools to ensure that the current system can be controlled and evaluated. This study was aimed at assessing and analysing the performance of traffic flow at signalized intersections and roundabouts at peak hours in the city of Nicosia (northern part of the island) using the SIDRA INTERSECTION 5 software. It was also aimed at comparing the performance of traffic flow during the morning and evening peak hours at four intersections and two roundabouts. The parameters used to assess the performance of the traffic flow were the level of service, delays and delayed travel speed, performance index, operating cost, fuel consumption, and carbon dioxide emission. It was found that the SIDRA INTERSECTION software was able to give an estimate of the current situation of traffic flow in the city. The results showed that the level of service was low, resulting in low speeds and lots of delays during the evening and morning peak hours. The delay was up to 9318.9 seconds and the fuel consumption was nearly 1431.6 lit/h, while the CO2 emission was up to 3594.7 kg/h.

J	Luo, XL; Niu, LY; Zhang, SR				Luo, Xianglong; Niu, Liyao; Zhang, Shengrui			An Algorithm for Traffic Flow Prediction Based on Improved SARIMA and GA	KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						traffic flow prediction; SARIMA; spatio-temporal correlation; GA	KALMAN FILTER; NETWORK; VOLUME; MODELS	The traffic flow prediction plays a key role in modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Although great achievements have been made in traffic flow prediction, it is still a challenge to improve the prediction accuracy and reduce the operation time simultaneously. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid prediction methodology combined with improved seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ISARIMA) model and multi-input autoregressive (AR) model by genetic algorithm (GA) optimization. Since traffic flow data has strong spatio-temporal correlation with neighboring stations, GA is used to select those stations which are highly correlated with the prediction station. The ISARIMA model is used to predict the traffic flow in test station at first. A multiinput AR model with traffic flow data in optimal selected stations is built to predict the traffic flow in test station as well. The final prediction result can be gained by combining with the results of ISARIMA and multi-input AR model. The test results from traffic data provided by TDRL at UMD Data Center demonstrate that proposed algorithm has almost the same prediction accuracy with artificial neural networks (ANNS). However, its operation time is almost the same with SARIMA model. It is proved to be an effective method to perform traffic flow prediction.

The Full Bayesian framework was employed to build the hierarchical models which accounted for three correlation structures at multiple levels: the correlation between speeds of adjoining lanes due to multivariate nature; spatially structured correlations between the adjacent segments, and spatially unstructured correlations among segments. The model estimates which influence the lane-mean speed indicated the directional variation of exogenous factors. For the westbound traffic, the afternoon and night hours were observed to be influential while eastbound traffic was more sensitive to the morning period. The segment length revealed a lane-varying correlation where longer segments influenced a speed reduction for the three lanes closer to the median while the speed in outermost lane exhibited a reverse trend as it increased with longer segments. Both models, with mean speed and speed deviations, demonstrated the significant presence of endogeneity due to mean speeds and speed deviations of adjacent lanes, respectively. This study also assessed the accuracy of predicted mean speed and speed deviations by calculating the measures of discrepancy between the observed and model predicted speeds. The Bayesian residuals, which incorporated the normal, multivariate, and spatial correlation structures, exhibited significant superiority at the prediction accuracy than the Normal ones. This discrepancy in prediction performance reflected the impact of consideration or exclusion of random effects.

With much easier access to information, increased processing power, and precision control, they also offer unprecedented opportunities for energy efficient driving. This paper is an attempt to highlight the energy saving potential of connected and automated vehicles based on first principles of motion, optimal control theory, and a review of the vast but scattered eco-driving literature. We explain that connectivity to other vehicles and infrastructure allows better anticipation of upcoming events, such as hills, curves, slow traffic, state of traffic signals, and movement of neighboring vehicles. Automation allows vehicles to adjust their motion more precisely in anticipation of upcoming events, and save energy. Opportunities for cooperative driving could further increase energy efficiency of a group of vehicles by allowing them to move in a coordinated manner. Energy efficient motion of connected and automated vehicles could have a harmonizing effect on mixed traffic, leading to additional energy savings for neighboring vehicles.

J	Wei, L; Qin, HM; Wang, YP; Zhang, Z; Yu, GZ				Wei, Lei; Qin, Hongmao; Wang, Yunpeng; Zhang, Zhao; Yu, Guizhen			Virus-traffic coupled dynamic model for virus propagation in vehicle-to-vehicle communication networks	VEHICULAR COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Virus propagation; Vehicle-to-vehicle communications; Connected vehicles; Cyber security	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; INFORMATION PROPAGATION; FLOW; COMPLEX; DISSEMINATION	With the development of connected vehicle technology, virus propagation that exists in a traditional network environment will gradually penetrate vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication networks, thus posing a serious threat to the security of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Understanding the characteristics of virus propagation through space and time is the key to ensuring the safety of ITS. However, most existing studies on virus propagation have ignored the dynamic relationship between virus transmission and traffic flow based on the assumption that the probability of virus infection is a constant. In light of this, this study proposes a two-layer model, called the virus-traffic coupled dynamic model, to investigate virus propagation in V2V communication networks. First, the dynamics of traffic flow and vehicular mobility are formulated as many update rules between cellular automata in the lower layer; then, due to the similarity between biological epidemic dissemination and virus propagation, an epidemic model called the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) was built to model the virus propagation process in the upper layer; finally, the lower and upper layer are connected by the probability of virus infection. Numerical experiments show that the model can accurately reproduce the process of virus transmission over space and time. The experiments also prove that reducing the probability of virus infection can constrain the spread of the virus effectively for both different communication range limits and various traffic densities.

Accurate traffic information prediction can improve traffic congestion and operation efficiency, which helps to reduce commute times, noise and carbon emissions. In this study, we present a novel approach for predicting the traffic flow volume by using traffic data in self-organizing vehicular networks. The proposed method is based on using a probabilistic generative neural network techniques called deep belief network (DBN) that includes multiple layers of restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) auto-encoders. Time series data generated from the roadside units (RSUs) for five highway links are used by a three layer DBN to extract and learn key input features for constructing a model to predict traffic flow. Back-propagation is utilized as a general learning algorithm for fine-tuning the weight parameters among the visible and hidden layers of RBMs. During the training process the firefly algorithm (FFA) is applied for optimizing the DBN topology and learning rate parameter. Monte Carlo simulations are used to assess the accuracy of the prediction model. The results show that the proposed model achieves superior performance accuracy for predicting traffic flow in comparison with other approaches applied in the literature. The proposed approach can help to solve the problem of traffic congestion, and provide guidance and advice for road users and traffic regulators.

In this paper, a novel pixel-entropy based algorithm for the automatic detection of the number of lanes and their centers, as well as the formation of their division lines is proposed. Using as input a video from a static camera, each pixel behavior in the gray color space is modeled by a time series; then, for a time period <tau, its histogram followed by its entropy are calculated. Three different types of theoretical pixel-entropy behaviors can be distinguished: (1) the pixel-entropy at the lane center shows a high value; (2) the pixel-entropy at the lane division line shows a low value; and (3) a pixel not belonging to the road has an entropy value close to zero. From the road video, several small rectangle areas are captured, each with only a few full rows of pixels. For each pixel of these areas, the entropy is calculated, then for each area or row an entropy curve is produced, which, when smoothed, has as many local maxima as lanes and one more local minima than lane division lines. For the purpose of testing, several real traffic scenarios under different weather conditions with other moving objects were used. However, these background objects, which are out of road, were filtered out. Our algorithm, compared to others based on trajectories of vehicles, shows the following advantages: (1) the lowest computational time for lane detection (only 32 s with a traffic flow of one vehicle/s per-lane); and (2) better results under high traffic flow with congestion and vehicle occlusion. Instead of detecting road markings, it forms lane-dividing lines. Here, the entropies of Shannon and Tsallis were used, but the entropy of Tsallis for a selected q of a finite set achieved the best results.

J	Nocera, S; Ruiz-Alarcon-Quintero, C; Cavallaro, F				Nocera, Silvio; Ruiz-Alarcon-Quintero, Cayetano; Cavallaro, Federico			Assessing carbon emissions from road transport through traffic flow estimators	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Traffic flow detection; Incomplete information; Single estimators; Combination models; CO2 emissions	TRAVEL-TIME PREDICTION; MISSING DATA; CO2 EMISSIONS; ECONOMIC VALUATION; COMBINATION METHOD; FUEL CONSUMPTION; MODELS; MACHINE	Carbon emissions from road transport are one of the main issues related to modern transport planning. To address them adequately, the acquisition of reliable data about traffic flow is an essential prerequisite. However, the large quantity and the heterogeneity of available information often cause problems; missing or incomplete data are one of the most critical aspects. This paper discusses how technology handles imperfect information in order to obtain more accurate quantification of CO2 emissions. First, an analysis of single estimators and combination models is provided, highlighting their main characteristics. Then, the TANINO model (Tool for the Analysis of Non-conservative Carbon Emissions In TraNspOrt) is presented, jointly developed at the University of Seville and at the IUAV University of Venice. It consists of two different modules: the first is a combination model that optimizes the results of three traffic flow single estimators, while the second is a macro-model of carbon evaluation, which takes into account road infrastructure, vehicle type and traffic conditions. TANINO is then tested to calculate CO2 emissions along the ring road of the Spanish city of Seville, showing its more efficient performance, compared to the single estimators normally adopted for such aims. Transport planning can benefit from the adequate knowledge of traffic flows and related CO2 emissions, since it allows a more reliable monitoring of the progresses granted by specific carbon policies.

Modeling impacts of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control on mixed traffic flow in multi-lane freeway facilities	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC); Microscopic traffic flow modeling; CACC operation strategies	AUTOMATED VEHICLES	Modeling impacts of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) on multi-lane freeway traffic can be challenging. It requires accurate description of the formation and disengagement of CACC vehicle strings when CACC vehicles are mixed with manually driven vehicles in the traffic stream. It also needs to depict the behaviors of CACC vehicles under the influence of CACC operation strategies such as the CACC vehicle managed lane (ML) and implementing the Vehicle Awareness Devices (VAD), which are intended to enhance the CACC string operations. To address these challenges, we extended a state of the art CACC modeling framework to incorporate new algorithms that are essential to describe the interactions among the CACC vehicles and manually driven vehicles in mixed traffic. The updated modeling framework adopts a new vehicle dispatching model to generate the high-volume traffic flow expected to exist due to the CACC string operation. The framework also includes new lane changing rules and automated speed control algorithms that ensure realistic CACC vehicle behaviors at freeway on/off-ramp areas where traffic disturbances might frequently interrupt the CACC string operations. With the model updates, we can further reproduce traffic flow dynamics under the influence of the CACC operation strategies. The modeling capability of the presented framework has been verified via case studies on a simple 4-lane freeway segment with an on-ramp and an off-ramp and a complex 18-kilometer freeway corridor. The case study results indicate that the presented modeling framework not only quantifies the mobility improvements for the study sites under different CACC market penetrations and CACC operation strategies, but also discloses the mechanism that governs the improvement. This study creates a methodology that can estimate detailed kinematics of connected automated vehicles under realistic traffic environments. Findings produced by the methodology are helpful for the future development, implementation and management of the advanced transportation technologies.

J	Flores, C; Milanes, V				Flores, Carlos; Milanes, Vicente			Fractional-order-based ACC/CACC algorithm for improving string stability	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Adaptive cruise control; Cooperative adaptive cruise control; String stability; Fractional-order calculus; Cooperative systems; Intelligent transportation systems	ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL; DESIGN; VALIDATION; CONTROLLER	Traffic flow optimization and driver comfort enhancement are the main contributions of an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system. If communication links are added, more safety and shorter gaps can be reached performing a Cooperative-ACC (CACC). Although shortening the inter-vehicular distances directly improves traffic flow, it can cause string unstable behavior. This paper presents fractional-order-based control algorithms to enhance the car-following and string stability performance for both ACC and CACC vehicle strings, including communication temporal delay effects. The proposed controller is compared with state-of-the-art implementations, exhibiting better performance. Simulation and real experiments have been conducted for validating the approach.

Adaptive traffic signal control with equilibrium constraints under stochastic demand	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Network design; Adaptive signal control; Control buffer; Reliability; Demand uncertainty	NETWORK DESIGN PROBLEM; TRANSPORTATION NETWORK; ROAD NETWORK; USER EQUILIBRIUM; MODELS; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHMS; CAPACITY; UNCERTAINTY; PROGRAMS	This study develops a methodology to model transportation network design with signal settings in the presence of demand uncertainty. It is assumed that the total travel demand consists of commuters and infrequent travellers. The commuter travel demand is deterministic, whereas the demand of infrequent travellers is stochastic. Variations in demand contribute to travel time uncertainty and affect commuters' route choice behaviour. In this paper, we first introduce an equilibrium flow model that takes account of uncertain demand. A two-stage stochastic program is then proposed to formulate the network signal design under demand uncertainty. The optimal control policy derived under the two-stage stochastic program is able to (1) optimize the steady-state network performance in the long run, and (2) respond to short-term demand variations. In the first stage, a base signal control plan with a buffer against variability is introduced to control the equilibrium flow pattern and the resulting steady-state performance. In the second stage, after realizations of the random demand, recourse decisions of adaptive signal settings are determined to address the occasional demand overflows, so as to avoid transient congestion. The overall objective is to minimize the expected total travel time. To solve the two-stage stochastic program, a concept of service reliability associated with the control buffer is introduced. A reliability-based gradient projection algorithm is then developed. Numerical examples are performed to illustrate the properties of the proposed control method as well as its capability of optimizing steady-state performance while adaptively responding to changing traffic flows. Comparison results show that the proposed method exhibits advantages over the traditional mean-value approach in improving network expected total travel times.

J	Tajalli, M; Hajbabaie, A				Tajalli, Mehrdad; Hajbabaie, Ali			Distributed optimization and coordination algorithms for dynamic speed optimization of connected and autonomous vehicles in urban street networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article							CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; SIGNALIZED ARTERIAL; TRAFFIC-FLOW; LIMITS	Dynamic speed harmonization has shown great potential to smoothen the flow of traffic and reduce travel time in urban street networks. The existing methods, while providing great insights, are neither scalable nor real-time. This paper develops Distributed Optimization and Coordination Algorithms (DOCA) for dynamic speed optimization of connected and autonomous vehicles in urban street networks to address this gap. DOCA decomposes the nonlinear network-level speed optimization problem into several sub-network-level nonlinear problems thus, it significantly reduces the problem complexity and ensures scalability and real-time runtime constraints. DOCA creates effective coordination in decision making between each two sub-network-level nonlinear problems to push solutions towards optimality and guarantee attaining near-optimal solutions. DOCA is incorporated into a model predictive control approach to allow for additional consensus between sub-network-level problems and reduce the computational complexity further. We applied the proposed solution technique to a real-world network in downtown Springfield, Illinois and observed that it was scalable and real-time while finding solutions that were at most 2.7% different from the optimal solution of the problem. We found significant improvements in network operations and considerable reductions in speed variance as a result of dynamic speed harmonization.

The traffic flow optimization of four European cities: Malaga, Stockholm, Berlin, and Paris, is addressed with new case studies importing each city's actual roads and traffic lights from OpenStreetMap into the SUMO traffic simulator, so as to find the best ways to redirect the traffic flow, and advise drivers. Additionally, the proposal is compared with three other strategies, which are also combined with Green Swarm in order to improve metrics such as travel times, gas emissions, and fuel consumption. This results in reductions in gas emissions as well as in travel times and fuel consumption in more than 500 city scenarios. The proposal has also been tested in scenarios where not all drivers are using it, to observe the change in traffic conditions when it is only in partial use, successfully paving the way for future sustainable cities.

Due to these possibilities, many research focuses in developing automatic speed control systems that considers the environment condition, with which relieving the human from the control task when the driver's judgement is not suitable for the environmental condition. Time-change-fuzzy-sets has been proven successful in analyzing safety level in traffic condition. This paper proposes an intelligent vehicle control system based on Time-Change-Fuzzy that can safely transit a moving vehicle from its original lane towards the emergency lane automatically when the driver is in lethargic state and the effectiveness was evaluated in a series of simulation.

However, despite considerable advancements, complete traffic patterns, in particular the seasonal effect, have not been adequately handled. Recently, an offline seasonal adjustment factor plus GARCH model was proposed in Shi et al. 2014 to model the seasonal heteroscedasticity in traffic flow series. However, this offline model cannot meet the real-time processing requirement proposed by real-world transportation management and control applications. Therefore, an online seasonal adjustment factors plus adaptive Kalman filter (OSAF+AKF) approach is proposed in this paper to predict in real time the seasonal heteroscedasticity in traffic flow series. In this approach, OSAF and AKF are combined within a cascading framework, and four types of online seasonal adjustment factors are developed considering the seasonal patterns in traffic flow series. Empirical results using real-world station-by-station traffic flow series showed that the proposed approach can generate workable prediction intervals in real time, indicating the acceptability of the proposed approach. In addition, compared with the offline model, the proposed online approach showed improved adaptability when traffic is highly volatile. These findings are important for developing real-time intelligent transportation system applications.

However, other actions such as the installation of left-turn lanes have been proven to improve the efficiency and safety of an intersection without the need for signalization in the short term. Warrants which guide the installation of such lanes in Ghana are adopted from elsewhere and as a result do not reflect local traffic flow conditions. This study established volume warrants based on a delay threshold to guide the installation of left turn lanes at unsignalized T-intersections using VISSIM micro simulation tool. The VISSIM model was calibrated using traffic flow, delay, average and maximum queue length data obtained from a two-hour video recording of the case study intersection during the morning peak period. After calibration, several scenarios covering a wide range of operational conditions were simulated. Using level of service (LOS) C cut off point of 25 s/veh as the maximum acceptable delay to minor road left-turning traffic, an equation y = 0.57x +1091 has been developed which predicts the minor road left-turn volume threshold (y) above which a minor road left-turn lane may be considered and below which a minor road left-turn lane may not be necessary for a range of major road volumes (x). The critical delay to major road left-turning traffic was found to be 16 s/veh. Major road left-turn lane volume warrants were also determined based on this threshold delay value. The approach used in this study can serve as a guide that can be used by metropolitan and municipal road engineers to assess the need for left-turn lanes.

They are nonrecurring events and are major contributors to increased traffic delay, and reduced safety, particularly in urban areas. However, the limited knowledge on the nature of SCs has largely impeded their mitigation strategies. The primary objective of this study was to develop a reliable SC risk prediction model using real-time traffic flow conditions. The study data were collected on a 35-mile I-95 freeway section for three years in Jacksonville, Florida. SCs were identified based on travel speed data archived by the Bluetooth detectors. Bayesian random effect complementary log-log model was used to link the probability of SCs with real-time traffic flow characteristics, primary incident characteristics, environmental conditions, and geometric characteristics. Random forests technique was used to select the important variables. The results indicated that the following variables significantly affect the likelihood of SCs: average occupancy, incident severity, percent of lanes closed, incident type, incident clearance duration, incident impact duration, and incident occurrence time. The study results have the potential to proactively prevent SCs.

J	Yu, B; Chen, YR; Bao, S; Xu, D				Yu, Bo; Chen, Yuren; Bao, Shan; Xu, Duo			Quantifying drivers' visual perception to analyze accident-prone locations on two-lane mountain highways	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Accident-prone locations; Drivers' visual lane model; Horizontal and vertical visual perception; Shape parameters; Probabilistic neural network	ROAD GEOMETRY; WEATHER	Owing to constrained topography and road geometry, mountainous highways are subjected to frequent traffic accidents, and these crashes have relatively high mortality rates. In middle and high mountains, most roads are two-lane highways. Most two-lane mountain highways are located in rural areas in China, where traffic volume is relatively small; namely, traffic accidents are mainly related to the design of roads, rather than the impact of traffic flow. Previous studies primarily focused on the relationship between actual road geometry and traffic safety. However, some scholars put forward that there was a significant discrepancy between actual and visual perceived information. Drivers greatly depend on what they perceived by their vision to determine driving behavior. Thus, in this paper drivers' visual lane model was established to quantify drivers' visual perception. To further explore drivers' perception of horizontal and vertical alignments, the visual lane model was projected onto horizontal and vertical planes in drivers' vision respectively. The length and curvature of the visual curve were extracted as shape parameters of drivers' visual lane models. Real vehicle driving tests were conducted on typical two-lane mountain highway sections of G318 in Tibet, China. Then the differences of visual perception at black spots and accident-free locations were analyzed and compared. In horizontal and vertical projections of visual lane model, there were 9 shape parameters have significant differences between accident-prone and accident-free locations. A probabilistic neural network (PNN) was formed to identify accident-prone locations on two-lane mountain highways. This study will lay a foundation for the improvement of traffic safety on mountain highways based on the quantification of drivers' visual perception, during the phase of both road design and reconstruction, and can also make a contribution to the automatic driving technique.

The crash risk expressed as the potential crash likelihood is assessed under variable speed limit (VSL) and without VSL, in which both spatial correlation between different sites and temporal similarity are contained. Traffic flow data of Whitemud Drive network (WMD) in Canada is used to perform the relevant analysis, including VSL implementation analysis, traffic flow similarity analysis, crash risk and congestion analysis. Analytical results demonstrate that the average traffic flow under VSL schemes 1, 2, 3 and 4 are highly correlated from spatial-temporal perspective. The crash likelihoods and congestions under these VSL schemes are greatly improved. The best VSL control scheme, the most dangerous area and time, together with the most congested station of WMD are eventually determined. Subsequently, a t-test is employed to examine the significance of these results. t-Test results suggest that the improvement degree between crash risk and congestion under the best VSL control scheme show a difference, i.e., the best VSL control scheme can reduce the crash risk of moderate risk area more than high risk area, while it may have a larger melioration on the most congested area than the relatively uncongested area. Finally, these results are considered to have the potential reference in the mitigation of WMD traffic issues.

Thermal and electrical performance assessments of lithium-ion battery modules for an electric vehicle under actual drive cycles	ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH			English	Article						Lithium-ion battery; Electric vehicle; Drive cycle; Temperature distribution; State of charge; Neural network	TRAFFIC FLOW PREDICTION; HEAT-GENERATION; TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTIONS; MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM; RATES; CELLS; MODEL	In this paper, both thermal and electrical performance evaluations of a lithium-ion battery pack using real world drive cycles from an electric vehicle (EV) are presented. For the experimental measurements, a data logger is installed in the EV, and the real world drive cycles are collected. The EV has three lithium-ion battery packs consisting of a total of 20 battery modules in series. Each module contains six series x 49 parallel IFR 18650 cylindrical valence cells. The reported drive cycles consist of different modes: acceleration, constant speed, and deceleration in both highway and city driving at 2 degrees C, 10 degrees C and 17 degrees C ambient temperatures with all accessories on. Later, the same drive cycles are conducted in an experimental facility where four cylindrical lithium-ion cells are connected in series, and both electrical and thermal performances are evaluated. In addition, the battery model is developed using artificial neural network, which is validated with the real world drive cycles. The validation is carried out in terms of voltage, state of charge (SOC), and temperature profiles for all the collected drive cycles. The present model closely estimates the profiles observed in the experimental data. Moreover, with this study, the mathematical function for the average temperature, SOC, and voltage prediction are developed with weights and bias values.

To facilitate large-scale EV applications, optimal locating and sizing of charging stations have become essential. For the investors of a charging station, economic benefit is the primary and the only objective. In this context, this work studies the siting and sizing of EV stations based on the optimal economic benefit. Benefit changes with time, location and capacity. A planning model method considering net present value (NPV) and life cycle cost (LCC) is proposed to determine the site and the size of the charging stations. The model has integrated distribution network constraint, the user constraint and the traffic flow captured constraint. Origin-destination lines and voronoi diagram are selected to calculate the traffic flow and the service region of each charging station, respectively. The quantum genetic algorithm was adopted for a better convergence of the planning model. Finally, a coupled 33-node distribution system and a 36-node transportation system are used to simulate various scenarios in the coupled networks of grid and transportation. The simulation results show that by introducing a planning model method considering NPV and LCC, the charging station economical benefits can be further improved.

A tri-modal transportation network equilibrium model is developed to analyze the effects of EBLs under three different policies: (i) no EBLs (called Policy 1); (ii) EBLs can only be used by bus (called Policy 2); and (iii) EBLs can be used by both bus and carpooling modes (called Policy 3). By taking into account both Ens setting scheme and bus frequencies, a combinatorial optimization model is proposed to test the performance of the tri-modal transportation system. In a traffic corridor case with single O-D pair, numerical results show that travel demand levels will remarkably influence the total system costs under different policies. The effects of average carpooling occupancy and mode choice parameters on travelers' choice behavior are analyzed. Finally, a tri-modal network with nineteen links is used to illustrate that the system could be more efficient when different EBLs policies are adopted on different links.

Based on the control theory, the linear stability analysis of the model was conducted. It shows that the stability of traffic flow on the gradient highway varies with the drivers' characteristics and the slope. Adopting nonlinear stability analysis, the Burgers equation and modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation are derived to describe the triangular shock waves and kink-antikink waves, respectively. The theoretical and numerical results show that aggressive drivers tend to stabilize traffic flow but timid drivers tend to destabilize traffic flow on a gradient highway both on an uphill situation and on a downhill situation. Moreover, the slope of the road also plays an important role in traffic jamming transition.

Bi-objective safe and resilient urban evacuation planning	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Humanitarian logistics; OR in disaster relief; Urban evacuation planning; Cell-transmission model; Resilience	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; HEURISTIC APPROACH; TRAFFIC FLOW; OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEM; WAVES	We consider an urban evacuation scenario with the objective to minimize the overall hazard under various restrictions, e.g. rescuing all evacuees. The relevant parameters are generally assumed as deterministic, although such a situation is characterized by uniqueness and is subject to many uncertainties. We thus take uncertainties with respect to street capacities into account and introduce the aspect of resilience in the context of evacuation planning. This resilience aspect is implemented by utilizing the available street capacities in a more balanced way. For balancing the utilization of the street capacities, we accept a predetermined increase in the minimum hazard level. We present a new bi-objective path-based evacuation model based on the assumptions of the Cell-Transmission Model (CTM). We deal with the two conflicting objective functions by applying the e-Constraint Method. Furthermore, we present a special path algorithm that generates the evacuation path in line with our special requirements. We verify the meaningfulness of our proposed idea of resilient evacuation planning in a computational study. Additionally, the study shows some interesting revelations e.g., the more street capacities are blocked, the greater the benefit of the new approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This paper puts forward an approach for predicting urban road traffic states based on ISOMAP manifold learning. By establishing a distance measurement that represents the overall geometric structure based on the Isometric Feature Mapping (ISOMAP) algorithm, this approach utilizes all consistent information regarding the traffic flow, thus improving the prediction accuracy of the road traffic state. The experimental results indicate that, compared with a traditional prediction approach, the equality coefficient has a bigger increase in value and a much lower prediction error. The traffic state prediction approach based on ISOMAP manifold learning achieves a higher level of accuracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Through linear stability analysis, it is found that the new consideration plays an important influence upon the stability of two-lane traffic flow. Moreover, the mKdV equation near the critical point is derived from nonlinear analysis, which describes the propagation behavior of traffic jam in two-lane traffic system. Simulation results show that the stability of two-lane traffic system can be increased and the emergence of traffic jams are effectively relieved by the optimal estimation of flux difference effect, which is in good agreement with theoretical analysis.

J	Saadi, I; Mustafa, A; Teller, J; Cools, M				Saadi, Ismail; Mustafa, Ahmed; Teller, Jacques; Cools, Mario			Investigating the impact of river floods on travel demand based on an agent-based modeling approach: The case of Liege, Belgium	TRANSPORT POLICY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	12th Conference on Transport Engineering (CIT)	JUN 07-09, 2016	Univ Politecnica Valencia, Sch Civil Engn, Valencia, SPAIN		Univ Politecnica Valencia, Sch Civil Engn	Agent-based modeling; River floods; Travel demand; MATSim		In Belgium, river floods are among the most frequent natural disasters and they may have important consequences on travel demand. In order to better understand how the travel patterns vary, we propose to set up a large scale scenario based on MATSim for guarantying an accurate assessment of the impact of river floods on the transportation system. As inputs, the current agent-based model requires a base year population. A synthetic population with respective set of attributes is generated as a key input. Afterwards, agents are assigned activity chains through an activity-based generation process. Finally, the synthetic population and the transportation network are integrated into MATSim. Regarding data, households travel surveys, OD matrix of Belgium have been used to set up the demand. For simulating river floods effects, a steady-state inundation map has been integrated within MATSim. In the current study, five scenarios have been tested where critical links are associated various levels of service, i.e. 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% (base case scenario). They are systematically compared to the standard scenario to estimate the deviations in terms of traffic patterns and travel times. The results suggest that compared to the standard scenario, the average trip travel time increased by 16.36%, 44.44%, 126.77% and 144.44% with respect to scenarios 75%, 50%, 25% and 10% respectively. Also, the traffic flows have been redistributed more uniformly across the transportation network. Roads with important traffic volumes are subjected to a decrease of activity on the contrary of roads with low traffic volumes. A very few studies have focused on how river floods affect transportation systems, this paper provided new insights in term of methodology and traffic patterns analysis under disruptions.

To study the complicated behaviors of vehicles and pedestrians is significant to understand the dynamics of traffic flow and explore efficient strategies for solving traffic problems. Based on this, this paper studies the effect of pedestrian's jaywalking behavior on vehicle flow with no crosswalks and no traffic lights, and constructs a cellular automata model to describe the dynamic traffic flow by considering some significant traffic behaviors of pedestrians and vehicles. Experimental results show that the maximum vehicle flow will be greatly affected as long as there are jaywalking pedestrians; retreating behavior may lead to the fluctuation in vehicle flow; the maximum vehicle flow is greater if morepedestrians choose the behavior of fast crossing. This research is helpful to further study the interaction between pedestrians and vehicles.

Based on the analysis of their operation and stopping characteristics, a two-lane cellular automaton model for urban roads considering the influence of stopping behavior is established, the vehicle type, cell length and moving speed are re-described. Considering the linear taxi stop and the linear bus stop, the characteristics of traffic flow under two different combination settings are studied. The numerical simulation results show that the combined bottleneck effect has little impact on flow rate and average speed when the bus stop is set on the upstream of the taxi stop, and the distance between stops should be 50 m. These findings lay a solid foundation for better description of urban traffic flow and enable better scientific planning and control of urban traffic.

BIG DATA ANALYSIS IN A GEOINFORMATIC PROBLEM OF SHORT-TERM TRAFFIC FLOW FORECASTING BASED ON A K NEAREST NEIGHBORS METHOD	COMPUTER OPTICS			Russian	Article						traffic flow; short-term forecasting; k nearest neighbors; MapReduce	PREDICTION; MODELS	Accurate and timely information on the current and predicted traffic flows is important for the successful deployment of intelligent transport systems. These data play an essential role in traffic management and control. Using traffic flow information, travelers could plan their routes to avoid traffic congestion, reduce travel time and environmental pollution, as well as improving traffic operation efficiency in general. In this paper, we propose a distributed model for short-term traffic flow prediction based on a k nearest neighbors method, that takes into account spatial and temporal traffic flow distributions. The proposed model is implemented as a MapReduce based algorithm in an Apache Spark framework. An experimental study of the proposed model is carried out on a traffic flow data in the transportation network of Samara, Russia. The results demonstrate that the proposed model has high predictive accuracy and an execution time sufficient for real-time prediction.	[Agafonov, A. A.; Yumaganov, A. S.; Myasnikov, V.

The work aims to evaluate the delays caused to both BRT buses and motorized vehicular traffic at the intersections using the microscopic simulation model, VISSIM 7.0. The present work attempts to deploy the simulation technique as a tool for improving the performance of the urban arterial corridor. The work focuses on the development of the microscopic simulation model of the study stretch including the model calibration and validation. Thus, developed simulation model was used for evaluating the feasible alternative traffic management measures, which may result in reduction of delay and travel time to both BRT buses as well as private vehicles in motorized lane, which may eventually result in emissions reduction also. Furthermore, it is emphasized that the performance of the overall transport system in the urban corridor can be improved by implementing well tested traffic management strategies using simulation beforehand.

J	Salomons, EM; Bakri, T				Salomons, Erik M.; Bakri, Taoufik			Fluctuating traffic noise levels calculated from time-dependent traffic data: an engineering approach	NOISE CONTROL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article							HORIZONTAL PROPAGATION; SOUND	Temporal variations of traffic noise levels originate from two effects: (1) traffic variations and (2) atmospheric variations. Traffic variations include variations of traffic volume and vehicle speed, and cause variations of the emission of sound at the source. Atmospheric variations cause variations of the propagation of sound from the source to the receiver. In this article an engineering method is presented for the calculation of temporal variations of traffic noise levels, based on time-dependent data for traffic volume and speed. The method may be combined with engineering models such as the Dutch traffic noise model, the model ISO 9613-2, or the recently developed model Cnossos-EU. The method employs a simple formula for the time-dependent effect of atmospheric wind and temperature gradients on sound propagation. The formula is derived from sound propagation calculations for a wide range of atmospheric conditions, performed with the Harmonoise model for traffic noise calculations. The engineering method developed in this article is used for a comparison with measurements near a highway in the Netherlands. Using time-dependent open traffic data for the highway, good agreement is obtained with sound levels recorded over a period of 24 hours. The method is of interest for urban traffic optimizations with environmental constraints, for example by means of "city dashboards," showing real time representations of traffic flow and traffic noise in a city.

ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Automated vehicles (AVs); Level 4 SAE; Vulnerable road users; Pedestrians; External Human Machine Interface (e-HMI)	PERCEIVED EASE; ACCEPTANCE; TECHNOLOGY; UTAUT; MODEL	As the desire for deploying automated ("driverless") vehicles increases, there is a need to understand how they might communicate with other road users in a mixed traffic, urban, setting. In the absence of an active and responsible human controller in the driving seat, who might currently communicate with other road users in uncertain/conflicting situations, in the future, understanding a driverless car's behaviour and intentions will need to be relayed via easily comprehensible, intuitive and universally intelligible means, perhaps presented externally via new vehicle interfaces. This paper reports on the results of a questionnaire-based study, delivered to 664 participants, recruited during live demonstrations of an Automated Road Transport Systems (ARTS; SAE Level 4), in three European cities. The questionnaire sought the views of pedestrians and cyclists, focussing on whether respondents felt safe interacting with ARTS in shared space, and also what externally presented travel behaviour information from the ARTS was important to them. Results showed that most pedestrians felt safer when the ARTS were travelling in designated lanes, rather than in shared space, and the majority believed they had priority over the ARTS, in the absence of such infrastructure. Regardless of lane demarcations, all respondents highlighted the importance of receiving some communication information about the behaviour of the ARTS, with acknowledgement of their detection by the vehicle being the most important message. There were no clear patterns across the respondents, regarding preference of modality for these external messages, with cultural and infrastructural differences thought to govern responses. Generally, however, conventional signals (lights and beeps) were preferred to text-based messages and spoken words. The results suggest that until these driverless vehicles are able to provide universally comprehensible externally presented information or messages during interaction with other road users, they are likely to contribute to confusing and conflicting interactions between these actors, especially in a shared space setting, which may, therefore, reduce efficient traffic flow.

By treating ship traffic as a distributed system, a novel Ship Self-Organizing Cooperation algorithm (SSOCA) is proposed to evaluate the effects of self-organizing cooperation between ships. An assumption is made that overtaking is not allowed under the given safety requirement. Observing that traffic efficiency is influenced by speed differences, two types of delay times, wait time and navigation time as increased by speed reductions, are applied to evaluate traffic efficiency. The mathematical model of delay time is inferred in different entry sequences subsequently. Taking advantage of the delay model, each ship makes a decision regarding its own sequence to find the local optimum iteratively. An Arena-based ship traffic model is constructed. The simulation results indicate that average delay time for ships is decreased in comparison with the First Come First Served (FCFS) model. That advantage exists for different combinations of traffic flow parameters. Moreover, a balance between efficiency and computation is also achieved by distributing the computational burden to each ship.

In order to alleviate its traffic pressure effectively, a coordinated arterial traffic type-2 fuzzy logic control (FLC) method is proposed. First, arterial traffic flow model and evaluation index model are set up, in which the turning vehicles and lane length are given full consideration. The traditional queue spillover phenomenon in the traffic models can be prevented here. Second, aiming at the coordination and dynamic uncertainty problem in arterial traffic, a coordinated arterial traffic type-2 fuzzy coordination control method is put forward. It consists of two-layer type-2 fuzzy controller, the basic control layer and the coordination layer. The former allocates green time according to the traffic situation of each intersection, while the latter adjusts each intersection's green time on basis of the vehicles between the intersection and the downstream intersections for the purpose of enlarging green wave hand. Finally, in order to configure the high-dimensional complex parameters of the coordinated two-layer type-2 FLC effectively, the parameters of membership function and the rules of the two controllers are optimized alternately by gravitational search algorithm.

To study the effects of these factors on electromechanical equipment faults, a panel data model was developed. Traffic flow, temperature difference, relative humidity, and wind speed were selected as explanatory variables, with the electromechanical faults being the response variable. The data was based on an investigation of electromechanical equipment faults, and the above-mentioned environmental variables were collected from six highways in Beijing during 2012-2013. Panel data models for pooled regression models and individual fixed and random effects were established. A unit root test was performed on the data sequence. Finally, the F-test and the Hausman-test were used to compare the three predictive models and determine the optimal one. It was found that the individual fixed effects model was superior to the other two. Positive effects of temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed on the electromechanical equipment faults were found to he significant, while traffic flow had a significant negative effect on the electromechanical equipment faults. This paper included four factors, more influences from other factors should be discussed in the further research. In general, this paper showed the importance of traffic flow to highway electromechanical equipments and can be potentially used to increase the service life of the equipments. The contribution of this work would provide theoretical support for fault prediction and emphasize the importance of environment-related preventive maintenance on the highway electromechanical equipment.

This study applies gated recurrent neural network to predict urban traffic flow considering weather conditions. Running results show that, under the review of weather influences, their method improves predictive accuracy and also decreases the prediction error rate. To their best knowledge, this is the first time that traffic flow is predicted in urban freeways in this particular way. This study examines it with respect to extensive weather influence under gated recurrent unit-based deep learning framework.

J	Hu, XJ; Xu, D; Wan, Q				Hu, Xiaojian; Xu, Dan; Wan, Qian			Short-Term Trend Forecast of Different Traffic Pollutants in Minnesota Based on Spot Velocity Conversion	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						traffic emissions prediction; spot velocity; COPERT IV model; hybrid ARIMA model; emission control	EVALUATING SPEED DIFFERENCES; TEMPORAL CHARACTERISTICS; EMISSION INVENTORIES; SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION; MEAN SPEED; CHINA; SYSTEM; SIMULATION; VEHICLES; TRUCKS	Because traffic pollution is a global problem, the prediction of traffic emissions and the analysis of their influencing factors is the key to adopting management and control measures to reduce traffic emissions. Hence, the evaluation of the actual level of traffic emissions has gained more interest. The Computer Program to calculate Emissions from Road Transport model (COPERT) is being downloaded by 100 users per month and is being used in a large number of applications. This paper uses this model to calculate short-term vehicle emissions. The difference from the traditional research was that the input velocity parameter was not the empirical value, but through reasonable conversion of the spot velocity at one point, obtained by the roadside detector, which provided new ideas for predicting traffic emissions by the COPERT model. The hybrid Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model was used to predict spot mean velocity, after converted it to the predicted interval velocity averaged for some period, input the conversion results and other parameters into the COPERT IV model to forecast short-term vehicle emissions. Six common emissions (CO, NOX, CO2, SO2, PM10, NMVOC) of four types of vehicles (PC, LDV, HDV, BUS) were discussed. As a result, PM10 emission estimates increased sharply during late peak hours (from 15:30 p.m.-18:00 p.m.), HDV contributed most of NOX and SO2, accounting for 39% and 45% respectively. Based on this prediction method, the average traffic emissions on the freeway reached a minimum when interval mean velocity reduced to 40 km/h-60 km/h. This paper establishes a bridge between the emissions and velocity of traffic flow and provides new ideas for forecasting traffic emissions. It is further inferred that the implementation of dynamic velocity guidance and vehicle differential management has a controlling effect that improves on road traffic pollution emissions.

J	Malecki, K				Malecki, Krzysztof			A computer simulation of traffic flow with on-street parking and drivers' behaviour based on cellular automata and a multi-agent system	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Computer simulation; Cellular automata (CA); Multi-agent system; On-street parking; Traffic flow	INCLUDING CARS; MODEL; CONGESTION; ECONOMICS; POLICY; RULES; SERVICE; CITY	Urban traffic is becoming more and more intensive, but the amount of space available for parking along city streets is not increasing at a rate commensurate with the rising number of new vehicles. This study looks at on-street/curb car parks, i.e., parking spaces located along streets or in one lane of a street. This article describes a simulation of the behaviour of various drivers in the process of on-street parking, and the impact of such parking on traffic flow, speed and travel time in the studied street fragment. This study is the first among other research studies on curb and on-street parking to consider driver behaviour such as patience, perceptivity and the use of indicators (turn signals). It also considers the impact of vacant parking-space marking. The study was performed on the basis of field research data. Drivers' behaviour was simulated in the form of agents' logic in a multi-agent system. The structure of the road, car park and vehicle traffic were reproduced on the basis of cellular automata, extending the known and proven Nagel-Schreckenberg, STCA, F-STCA and other models. Research results are helpful in teaching motorists how to park on-street or on the curb. Paying attention to the aspects of effective and streamlined parking may significantly improve traffic flow efficiency. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Asaithambi, G; Josep, J				Asaithambi, Gown; Josep, Jibin			Modeling Duration of Lateral Shifts in Mixed Traffic Conditions	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING PART A-SYSTEMS			English	Article						Lateral movement; Lateral shift; Lateral shift duration; Trajectory data set; Mixed traffic; Nonlane discipline		Traffic on urban roads in developing countries is characterized by wide mix of vehicles with loose lane discipline, which results in parallel movement of vehicles in the same lane. Hence, vehicles not only interact longitudinally with the vehicles ahead but also laterally with vehicles to the sides. Lateral movements have a significant impact on the characteristics of traffic flow and therefore are of great importance in microscopic traffic simulation models. Existing simulation models for mixed traffic conditions model lateral shifts (lateral movements) as an instantaneous process but neglects detailed modeling. However, the duration for lateral shifts is generally in the range of 0.5-15 s. The omission of lateral shift duration from simulation models may have a significant impact on simulation outputs. Also, different vehicle types may have different lateral shift durations due to variations in their physical and operational characteristics. This paper attempts to develop a vehicle-specific lateral shift duration model by considering different explanatory variables such as direction of lateral shift, available space gaps, speeds of subject vehicle and surrounding vehicles, vehicle types, and clearance. The models were estimated using trajectory data collected during medium-flow conditions from an urban arterial in Chennai city, India. The findings from this study have direct implications on modeling lateral shifts in microscopic traffic simulations to be developed specifically for mixed traffic conditions.

The atypical conditions prevailing in India motivated this study for the development of a methodology for the proper computation of the capacity for U-turns at these locations. Harders' formula has been widely used by various researchers to evaluate capacity for U-turns and this formula needs three elementary factors-namely, conflicting traffic volume, critical gap, and follow-up time. We collected the required data for capacity estimation from different uncontrolled median openings in India. We estimated the first input parameter required for Harders' formula, conflicting traffic volume, by analyzing the lateral placement of vehicles at the median opening area. We estimated the second parameter, critical gap, by using four different critical gap estimation procedures-namely; modified Raff, maximum likelihood, macroscopic probability equilibrium, and merging behavior. The third parameter, follow-up time, was measured directly in the field. Consequently, we calculated U-turn capacity for the given traffic streams and the findings were tested against the field capacity estimated in the field using Kyte's method. We then determined a suitable method for critical gap estimation in the Indian context by using two statistical parameters. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Exploiting preliminary physical simulations has the twofold benefit of building a drastically simplified BN and of predicting complex system performance metrics. While the approximate BN cannot yield exact probabilities for predictive analyses, its use in backward analyses based on evidenced variables yields promising results as a decision support tool for post-earthquake rapid response. Only a reduced set of infrastructure components, whose importance is ranked through a random forest algorithm, is selected to predict the performance of the system. Further, owing to the higher importance of evidenced nodes, the ranking method is enhanced with a recursive evidence-driven BN-building algorithm, which iteratively inserts evidenced components into the subset identified by the random forest algorithm. This approach is applied to a French road network, where only 5 to 10 components out of 58 are kept to estimate the distribution of system performance metrics that are based on traffic flow. Sensitivity studies on the number of selected components, the number of off-line simulation runs and the discretization of variables reveal that the reduced BN applied to this specific example generates trustworthy estimates.

J	Dong, L; Rinoshika, A; Tang, ZX				Dong, Lin; Rinoshika, Akira; Tang, Zhixian			Dynamic Evaluation on the Traffic State of an Urban Gated Community by Opening the Micro-Inter-Road Network	TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						urban gated community; traffic entropy model; FCM clustering; micro-road network	CONGESTION	The opening of a gated community to expand the micro-road network in an urban traffic system is an importance research topic related to urban congestion. To satisfy the demands of opening an early choosing case, this paper proposes a comprehensive selection framework on qualified communities and their appropriate opening times by describing the traffic state at the boundary road network accurately. The traffic entropy model and fuzzy c-means (FCM) method are used in this paper. In the framework, a new opening evaluation entropy model is built using basic theory of the thermodynamic traffic entropy method. The traffic state entropy values of the boundary road network and entropy production are calculated to determinate the opening time. In addition, a specific fuzzy range evaluation standard at a preset gated community is drawn with an FCM algorithm to verify the opening determination. A case study based on the traffic information in a simulated gated community in Shanghai is evaluated and proves that the findings of opening evaluation are in accordance with the actual situation. It is found that the micro-inter-road network of a gated community should be opened as the entropy value reaches 2.5. As the travel time is less than 20 s, the correlation between the opening entropy value and the journey delay time exhibits a good linear correlation, which indicates smooth traffic flow.

The source of uncertainty is heterogeneity in driving behavior, captured using driver specific speed-spacing relations, i.e., parametric uncertainty. It also results in smooth vehicle trajectories in a stochastic context, which is in agreement with real-world traffic dynamics and, thereby, overcoming issues with aggressive oscillation typically observed in sample paths of stochastic traffic flow models. We utilize ensemble filtering techniques for data assimilation (traffic state estimation), but derive the mean and covariance dynamics as the ensemble sizes go to infinity, thereby bypassing the need to sample from the parameter distributions while estimating the traffic states. As a result, the estimation algorithm is just a standard Kalman-Bucy algorithm, which renders the proposed approach amenable to real-time applications using recursive data. Data assimilation examples are performed and our results indicate good agreement with out-of-sample data. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A fully connected vehicle environment can substantially reduce the latency in response caused by human perception-reaction time with the prospect of improving both safety and comfort. This study presents a dynamical model of route choice under a connected vehicle environment. We analyze the stability of headways by perturbing various factors in the microscopic traffic flow model and traffic flow dynamics in the car-following model and dynamical model of route choice. The advantage of this approach is that it complements the macroscopic traffic assignment model of route choice with microscopic elements that represent the important features of connected vehicles. The gaps between cars can be decreased and stabilized even in the presence of perturbations caused by incidents. The reduction in gaps will be helpful to optimize the traffic flow dynamics more easily with safe and stable conditions. The results show that the dynamics under the connected vehicle environment have equilibria. The approach presented in this study will be helpful to identify the important properties of a connected vehicle environment and to evaluate its benefits.

The growing number of taxi trips and the increasing contribution of taxis to traffic congestion are cause for concern when vacant taxis are not distributed optimally within the city and are unable to find unserved passengers effectively. A way of improving taxi operations is to deploy a taxi dispatch system that matches the vacant taxis and waiting passengers while considering the search friction dynamics. This paper presents a network-scale taxi dispatch model that takes into account the interrelated impact of normal traffic flows and taxi dynamics while optimizing for an effective dispatching system. The proposed model builds on the concept of the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) to represent the dynamic evolution of traffic conditions. The model considers multiple taxi service firms operating in a heterogeneously congested city, where the city is assumed to be partitioned into multiple regions each represented with a well-defined MFD. A model predictive control approach is devised to control the taxi dispatch system. The results show that lack of the taxi dispatching system leads to severe accumulation of unserved taxi passengers and vacant taxis in different regions whereas the dispatch system improves the taxi service performance and reduces traffic congestion by regulating the network towards the undersaturated condition. The proposed framework demonstrates sound potential management schemes for emerging mobility solutions such as fleet of automated vehicles and demand-responsive transit services.

We develop our models, including the cellular automata traffic flow model as well as the linear regression one, aiming at calculating traffic flow and evaluating safety conditions with varied traffic rules. Then, we thoroughly investigate four types of paths in a freeway, namely two straight lanes, three straight lanes, ramps, and roundabouts as case studies and discuss the different traffic rules as comparison. The results demonstrate that "Keep-Right-Except-To-Pass" rule is not as effective as the free rule in promoting traffic flow; however, this rule ensures safety for drivers better than the free rule. Additionally, a new traffic rule, which sets different posted speed limits for adjacent lanes, is proposed to promote better traffic flow with safety requirements satisfied. Furthermore, we apply effective rules and alternatives, left driving norms as well as intelligent system as extension and obtain better results. Finally, model's sensitivity analysis regarding to probability of decelerating and posted speed limits proves the stability of our results. (C) 2018 The Authors.

The variation characteristics of the data collected by the radar when the preceding vehicle changes lanes and enters/exits a curve section are similar. As a result, the target identification may cause unsafe conditions on curve roads. For the proper classification of the curve entry/exit and lane change behaviors of the preceding target, speed, yaw rate, and steering angle were used to model road curvature real time. In this estimation algorithm, the slope of the preceding target's motion trajectory was used to establish a status- identification and motion- tracking model for a straight road. A similar model for a curve road was constructed by using the lateral displacement variation characteristic as a distinction parameter. Field- test data were used to verify both models. Results showed that the classification accuracy rates of the model for the lane change and curve entry of the preceding vehicle when the host vehicle is on a straight road were 91.5 and 89.8%, respectively. When the host vehicle is traveling on a curve road, the classification accuracy rates for the lane change and curve exit of the preceding vehicle were 87.1 and 90.4%, respectively. The proposed algorithm could effectively enhance the safety performance of the active safety system.

A new penalty utility function is added based on the traditional guided local search algorithm. When the traditional guided local search algorithm falls into the local optimum, the penalty strategy is transformed and searched again to expand the neighborhood of the search. By comparing with traditional guided local search algorithm and other algorithm in different examples, the validity and stability of this algorithm in the route planning of emergency vehicles are verified, which provides a theoretical basis for the emergency logistics vehicle route planning.

In this work, a novel MVs imputation approach termed as kernel sparse representation with elastic net regularization (KSR-EN) is developed for reconstructing MVs to facilitate analysis with traffic sensor data. The idea is to represent each sample as a linear combination of other samples due to inherent spatiotemporal correlation, as well as periodicity of daily traffic flow. To discover few yet correlated samples and make full use of the valuable information, a combination of l(1)-norm and l(2)-norm is employed to penalize the combination coefficients. Moreover, the linear representation among samples is extended to nonlinear representation by mapping input data space into high-dimensional feature space, which further enhances the recovery performance of our proposed approach. An efficient iterative algorithm is developed for solving KSR-EN model. The proposed method is verified on both an artificially simulated dataset and a public road network traffic sensor data. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of MVs imputation.

However, little research has been done to install the millimeter-wave radar on the top of a road for detecting road traffic flow at a downward looking direction. In this paper, the vehicle parameters, including the distance, angle and radar cross-section energy, are collected by practical experiments in the aforementioned application scenario. The data features are analyzed from the dimensions of single parameter sampling characteristics and multi-parameter relationships. Further, the correlations of different parameter series are given using the grey correlation analysis method. For millimeter-wave radar used in the traffic flow detection, our work can definitely provide significant support for further intelligent transportation applications, such as vehicle trajectory tracking, traffic flow estimation and traffic event identification.

This study is based on local field measurements in Yopougon (Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire) in 2016; a site representative of anthropogenic activities in West African cities. The measurements provided data on vehicle type and age, traveling time, fuel type, and estimated amount of fuel consumption. The data revealed high traffic flow of personal cars on highways, boulevards, and backstreets, whereas high flows of intra-communal sedan taxis were observed on main and secondary roads. In addition, the highest daily fuel consumption value of 56 L.day(-1) was recorded for heavy vehicles, while the lowest value of 15 L.day(-1) was recorded for personal cars using gasoline. This study is important for the improvement of uncertainties related to the different databases used to estimate emissions either in national or international reports. This work provides useful information for future studies on urban air quality, climate, and health impact assessments in African cities.

Impact of information feedback strategy on the car accidents in two-route scenario	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Two-route scenario; information feedback; car accidents; intersection	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW; HIGHWAY; SYSTEMS; PHYSICS	Various feedback strategies are proposed to improve the traffic flow. However, most of these works did not take road safety into consideration. In this paper, we studied the impact of four feedback strategies on the probability of rear-end collisions (P-ac). We proposed a new feedback strategy named Accidents Coefficient Feedback Strategy (ACFS) in which dynamic information can be generated and displayed on a board at the entrance of two-route scenario with intersection to help drivers to choose the appropriate road. This new strategy can greatly improve road safety and make the flow smooth as possible at the same time. Moreover, the impact of the intersection and boundary rates (alpha and beta) on P-ac is also studied.	[Marzoug, R.; Lakouari, N.; Oubram, O.; Cisneros-Villalobos, L.; Velasquez-Aguilar, J.

The FDMI effect plays an important role on the linear stability condition, from theoretic analysis, in a two-lane system. The FDMI effect including the intensity reaction coefficient and the integral historical time are investigated on two lanes via simulation.

We derive a discontinuous delay differential equation (DDDE) for these profiles. For various cases, we obtain results on existence, uniqueness and local stability of the profiles. The results here offer an alternative approximation, possibly more realistic than the classical vanishing viscosity approach, to the conservation law with discontinuous flux for traffic flow.

This paper reports our experimental and empirical studies on traffic flow instability. We have carried out a large scale experiment to study the car-following behavior in a 51-car platoon. The experiment has reproduced the phenomena and confirmed the findings in our previous 25-car-platoon experiment, i.e., standard deviation of vehicle speeds increases in a concave way along the platoon. Based on our experimental results, we argue that traffic speed rather than vehicle spacing (or density) might be a better indicator of traffic instability, because vehicles can have different spacing under the same speed. For these drivers, there exists a critical speed between 30 km/h and 40 km/h, above which the standard deviation of car velocity is almost saturated (flat) along the 51-car-platoon, indicating that the traffic flow is likely to be stable. In contrast, below this critical speed, traffic flow is unstable and can lead to the formation of traffic jams. Traffic data from the Nanjing Airport Highway support the experimental observation of existence of a critical speed. Based on these findings, we propose an alternative mechanism of traffic instability: the competition between stochastic factors and the so-called speed adaptation effect, which can better explain the concave growth of speed standard deviation in traffic flow.

J	Dakic, I; Stevanovic, A				Dakic, Igor; Stevanovic, Aleksandar			On development of arterial fundamental diagrams based on surrogate density measures from adaptive traffic control systems utilizing stop-line detection	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	22nd International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory (ISTTT)	JUL 24-26, 2017	NW Univ, Evanston Campus, Chicago, IL		NW Univ, Evanston Campus	Arterial fundamental diagram; Surrogate density measures; Stop line detection data; Degree of saturation; Adaptive traffic control systems	NETWORKS; FLOW	A promising framework for understanding flow-density relationship in traffic flow theory is the Fundamental Diagram, originally developed for uninterrupted traffic flow facilities. The concept has been extended to the Arterial Fundamental Diagram (AFD), which has shown that the same relationship holds on arterial streets. However, constructing an AFD is subject to considerable variability in the measured quantities, due to the highly cyclical nature of signalized intersections. In most cases, these diagrams are based on the data from upstream detectors, located away from traffic signals. Recent scientific literature has shown a value of using stop-line detection data to develop AFDs, opening a plethora of opportunities to further investigate traffic dynamics utilizing the data from adaptive traffic control systems (ATCSs). This can, however, be problematic for two major reasons. First, the data may come from detectors unfit to provide good-quality inputs to develop an AFD. Second, such ATCSs may use their own surrogate measures of density and traffic flow, primarily developed for the purpose of controlling traffic, which may be inappropriate for developing fundamental relationships. This study aims to address these issues by investigating appropriateness of using Degree of Saturation (DS), a density-like measure from Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System (SCATS), to develop an AFD. Empirical SCATS data shows an interesting pattern of the AFD, which cannot be explained by the data itself. Hence, we derive a new analytical model of DS based on the high resolution signal and detection data, which reveals parameters that drive its behavior. Additionally, we develop the Cyclical Vehicle Arrival and Discharge Model to simulate SCATS-like operations and derive causal relationships between traffic flow variables and density-like performance measures in a controlled environment. The findings show that DS does not have to be a poor estimator of traffic conditions, but when it is combined with SCATS-measured traffic flows it gives a false representation of near-capacity and over-saturated conditions.

Microscopic Road Traffic Scene Analysis Using Computer Vision and Traffic Flow Modelling	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND INTELLIGENT INFORMATICS			English	Article						traffic scene analysis; intelligent transport systems; computer vision; vehicle detection and tracking; microscopic traffic flow modelling	RECOGNITION; VIDEO	This paper presents the development of a vision-based system for microscopic road traffic scene analysis and understanding using computer vision and computational intelligence techniques. The traffic flow model is calibrated using the information obtained from the road-side cameras. It aims to demonstrate an understanding of different levels of traffic scene analysis from simple detection, tracking, and classification of traffic agents to a higher level of vehicular and pedestrian dynamics, traffic congestion build-up, and multiagent interactions. The study used a video dataset suitable for analysis of a T-intersection. Vehicle detection and tracking have 88.84% accuracy and 88.20% precision. The system can classify private cars, public utility vehicles, buses, and motorcycles. Vehicular flow of every detected vehicles from origin to destination are also monitored for traffic volume estimation, and volume distribution analysis. Lastly, a microscopic traffic model for a T-intersection was developed to simulate a traffic response based on actual road scenarios.

A method for predicting the expected demand pattern at these HREVCs is presented in this paper. This is critical to plan a network of chargers. This novel method uses the freely available traffic flow data and travel patterns extracted from the OpenStreetMap combined with a novel EV battery capacity prediction method, to find future HREVC usage patterns in the U.K. and their dependence on location and EV characteristics. This planning method can he replicated to find HREVC power demand for any location on the strategic road network in the U.K. and can be used in the analysis of the role of high rate EV charging in the wider energy system.

J	Pribyl, P; Pribyl, O; Michek, J				Pribyl, Pavel; Pribyl, Ondrej; Michek, Jan			Computer modelling of fire consequences on road critical infrastructure - tunnels	STRUCTURAL MONITORING AND MAINTENANCE			English	Article						road tunnel; risk analysis; deterministic approach; scenario oriented method; fire; software tool; CAPITA	RISK-ASSESSMENT; SIMULATION; VEHICLE; TIME	The proper functioning of critical points on transport infrastructure is decisive for the entire network. Tunnels and bridges certainly belong to the critical points of the surface transport network, both road and rail. Risk management should be a holistic and dynamic process throughout the entire life cycle. However, the level of risk is usually determined only during the design stage mainly due to the fact that it is a time-consuming and costly process. This paper presents a simplified quantitative risk analysis method that can be used any time during the decades of a tunnel's lifetime and can estimate the changing risks on a continuous basis and thus uncover hidden safety threats. The presented method is a decision support system for tunnel managers designed to preserve or even increase tunnel safety. The CAPITA method is a deterministic scenario-oriented risk analysis approach for assessment of mortality risks in road tunnels in case of the most dangerous situation a fire. It is implemented through an advanced risk analysis CAPITA SW. Both, the method as well as the resulting software were developed by the authors' team. Unlike existing analyzes requiring specialized microsimulation tools for traffic flow, smoke propagation and evacuation modeling, the CAPITA contains comprehensive database with the results of thousands of simulations performed in advance for various combinations of variables. This approach significantly simplifies the overall complexity and thus enhances the usability of the resulting risk analysis. Additionally, it provides the decision makers with holistic view by providing not only on the expected risk but also on the risk's sensitivity to different variables. This allows the tunnel manager or another decision maker to estimate the primary change of risk whenever traffic conditions in the tunnel change and to see the dependencies to particular input variables.

Stop-and-go traffic instabilities can be suppresses using bilateral control-which differs from "car following" and adaptive cruise control in that, counter-intuitively, it uses information about the following vehicle (as well as about the leading vehicle). Stability can be proven mathematically, and can be demonstrated in simulation. A physical analog of a sequence of vehicles using bilateral control is a chain of masses connected by springs and dampers-a system which is inherently stable, since it lacks an external energy source. Here, in order to further understand bilateral control and its capacity to suppress instabilities, we move from a microscopic view (interaction of individual vehicles) to a macroscopic view (densities and flow rates). This leads us to the damped wave equation governing traffic under bilateral control. That equation allows us to determine the speed of propagation of disturbances, as well as their rate of decay. The equation is also useful in fine tuning parameters of bilateral control systems.	[Horn, Berthold K.

This paper presents the short-term operation of WCS by capturing the interdependence among the electricity and transportation networks. In the transportation network, the total travel cost consists of the cost associated with the travel time and the cost of utilized electricity along each path. Each EV takes the path that minimizes its total travel cost. In the electricity network, the changes in WCS demand as a result of changes in the traffic flow pattern impacts the price of electricity. The changes in the price of electricity further affect the charging strategy of the EVs and the associated traffic flow pattern. The coordination between electricity and transportation networks would help mitigate congestion in the electricity network by routing the traffic flow in the transportation network. The presented formulation leverages decentralized optimization to address the economic dispatch in the electricity network as well as the traffic assignment in the transportation network. The presented case studies highlight the merit of the presented model and the developed algorithms for the coordinated operation of WCS in electricity and transportation networks.

J	Kaddoura, I; Nagel, K				Kaddoura, Ihab; Nagel, Kai			Simultaneous internalization of traffic congestion and noise exposure costs	TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						Road traffic noise; Traffic congestion; Internalization; Optimal pricing; Dynamic tolling; Activity-based transport modeling	AIR-POLLUTION; TRANSPORT; SIMULATION; EMISSIONS; EXTERNALITIES; POLICIES; IMPACTS; DEMAND; TOLLS	This study elaborates on the interrelation of external effects, in particular road traffic congestion and noise. An agent-based simulation framework is used to compute and internalize user-specific external congestion effects and noise exposures. The resulting user equilibrium corresponds to an approximation of the system optimum. For traffic congestion and noise, single objective optimization is compared with multiple objective optimization. The simulation-based optimization approach is applied to the real-world case study of the Greater Berlin area. The results reveal a negative correlation between congestion and noise. Nevertheless, the multiple objective optimization yields a simultaneous reduction in congestion and noise. During peak times, congestion is the more relevant external effect, whereas, during the evening, night and morning, noise is the more relevant externality. Thus, a key element for policy making is to follow a dynamic approach, i.e. to temporally change the incentives. During off-peak times, noise should be reduced by concentrating traffic flows along main roads, i.e. inner-city motorways. In contrast, during peak times, congestion is reduced by shifting transport users from the inner-city motorway to smaller roads which, however, may have an effect on other externalities.

J	Park, H; Kim, Y				Park, Hyunsuk; Kim, Youngchan			Model for Filtering the Outliers in DSRC Travel Time Data on Interrupted Traffic Flow Sections	KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						ITS; DSRC; Travel time outlier filtering; travel time estimation		This study aims to develop a model that effectively filters outliers in travel time data obtained by using the DSRC on interrupted traffic flow sections. To establish a direction for model development, we identified the characteristics of the DSRC system and existing abnormal data filtering models, causes of outliers in travel time data and their distribution center, changes in the travel time distribution according to the section length and existence of traffic congestion, variation in the number of data samples obtained, and the status of missing data. When an existing model is used to filter the abnormal travel time data obtained on the interrupted traffic flow sections, the mean and median values derived based on the asymmetry of the travel time distribution deviate from the center of the travel time distribution, which leads to fundamental errors in the estimation of the size of the normal travel time data distribution. Moreover, the performance of this model for filtering abnormal data decreases because of the distorted mean and standard deviation when outliers are mixed and optimizing filtering variables is difficult. To overcome these limitations of existing outlier filtering models, we developed a novel outlier filtering model by establishing a model development direction to improve the methods of obtaining data, setting the travel time distribution center, estimating distribution size, and filtering repetitive outliers. The performance of the developed model in filtering outliers is verified by comparing it with that of existing models for the intelligent transport systems installed on 13 types of single-sections and multi-section on the metropolitan national highway, Korea. The comparison indicates that the developed model generally exhibits the best performance for filtering abnormal data on all types of sections. The normal filtering ratio of the developed model was maintained at over 98.5% for all road types and traffic situations, demonstrating improvement of up to 27.4%. The error ratio of travel time at short interrupted traffic flow sections during non-congestion is significantly improved in this model.

J	Jiang, R; Lee, J; Chung, E				Jiang, Rui; Lee, Jinwoo (Brian); Chung, Edward			Proportional-Derivative (PD) Controller for Heuristic Rule-based Motorway Coordinated Ramp Meters	KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						traffic control; freeway management; ramp metering; freeway; freeway management; motorway		This study proposes a new control method for rule-based motorway coordinated ramp metering. Coordinated ramp metering makes use of the network-wide measurements and allows multiple meters to participate in the control action to prevent or delay the onset of congestion on motorways. An essential component is a controller to dynamically adjust the level of contribution to coordination of each participating meter. The new control method builds on the concept of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis is carried out to formulate the controller structure and coefficients. The final structure takes the form of PD controller with P-term as the main controller and D-term as supplementary to accelerate response speed and to improve the control stability. The PD controller is embedded in a rule-based coordinated ramp metering strategy for performance evaluation. A simulation study demonstrates the effectiveness of the PD controller. The coordinated control improves the mainstream traffic condition by reducing 60% and 8.4% of average traffic delay time over the base case assuming no metering and the local metering control scenario, respectively. The overall traffic travel time also decreased by the coordinated control by 25.1% and 2.0% over the base case and local metering, respectively. The enhanced mainstream traffic flow is achieved by balanced utilization of local meters and on-ramp spaces.

The linear stability condition of the new model is derived, where the effect of traffic jerk and intensity of influence of drivers' behavior on the traffic flow stability is investigated. By applying the reductive perturbation method, we derive a modified Korteweg-de Vries equation near the critical point to describe the evolution properties of traffic density waves via nonlinear stability analysis. The results show that the provision of aggressive drivers is a greater contributor to improving the stability of traffic flow compared to the timid ones in the context of traffic jerk, and that the stability of traffic flow can be improved by the provision of well-experienced drivers.

J	Qi, L; Zhou, MC; Luan, WJ				Qi, Liang; Zhou, Mengchu; Luan, Wenjing			A Dynamic Road Incident Information Delivery Strategy to Reduce Urban Traffic Congestion	IEEE-CAA JOURNAL OF AUTOMATICA SINICA			English	Article						Cell transmission model (CTM); intelligent transportation systems (ITS); traffic incident management (TIM); urban traffic congestion	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; FLOW; ASSIGNMENT; NETWORK; WAVES; ATIS	Advanced information and communication technologies can be used to facilitate traffic incident management. If an incident is detected and blocks a road link, in order to reduce the incident-induced traffic congestion, a dynamic strategy to deliver incident information to selected drivers and help them make detours in urban areas is proposed by this work. Time-dependent shortest path algorithms are used to generate a subnetwork where vehicles should receive such information. A simulation approach based on an extended cell transmission model is used to describe traffic flow in urban networks where path information and traffic flow at downstream road links are well modeled. Simulation results reveal the influences of some major parameters of an incident-induced congestion dissipation process such as the ratio of route-changing vehicles to the total vehicles, operation time interval of the proposed strategy, traffic density in the traffic network, and the scope of the area where traffic incident information is delivered. The results can be used to improve the state of the art in preventing urban road traffic congestion caused by incidents.

J	Do Chung, B; Park, S; Kwon, C				Do Chung, Byung; Park, Sungjae; Kwon, Changhyun			Equitable distribution of recharging stations for electric vehicles	SOCIO-ECONOMIC PLANNING SCIENCES			English	Review						Electric vehicles; Flow refueling location problem; Demand equity; Flow equity	ALTERNATIVE-FUEL STATIONS; REFUELING LOCATION MODEL; PUBLIC FACILITY LOCATION; NETWORK DESIGN PROBLEM; TRANSPORTATION; INFRASTRUCTURE; FORMULATION; DISPERSION; EFFICIENCY; FRAMEWORK	Given the limited driving range of battery electric vehicles and lack of sufficient charging infrastructure, locating charging stations is an important decision problem to enable long-distance travels by battery electric vehicles. This paper considers an important political factor in such location problems: the equitable access to charging stations among geographical regions. We propose three types of equity constraints to the flow refueling location model: two constraints based on travel demand and the other based on traffic flow. For solving the problem with flow equity constraints, we propose a multi-phase heuristic method. We test the proposed models and computational method in a real expressway network in Korea.

Assessing rear-end crash potential in urban locations based on vehicle-by-vehicle interactions, geometric characteristics and operational conditions	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Rear-end crashes; Crash potential; Locational analysis; Near-crash behavior; Multinomial Logit model	LOOP DETECTOR DATA; SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS; RISK; FREEWAYS; PREDICTION; EXPRESSWAYS; VISIBILITY; LIKELIHOOD; FREQUENCY; SEVERITY	Rear-end crashes are one of the most frequently occurring crash types, especially in urban networks. An understanding of the contributing factors and their significant association with rear-end crashes is of practical importance and will help in the development of effective countermeasures. The objective of this study is to assess rear-end crash potential at a microscopic level in an urban environment, by investigating vehicle-by-vehicle interactions. To do so, several traffic parameters at the individual vehicle level have been taken into consideration, for capturing car-following characteristics and vehicle interactions, and to investigate their effect on potential rear-end crashes. In this study rear-end crash potential was estimated based on stopping distance between two consecutive vehicles, and four rear-end crash potential cases were developed. The results indicated that 66.4% of the observations were estimated as rear-end crash potentials. It was also shown that rear-end crash potential was presented when traffic flow and speed standard deviation were higher. Also, locational characteristics such as lane of travel and location in the network were found to affect drivers' car following decisions and additionally, it was shown that speeds were lower and headways higher when Heavy Goods Vehicles lead. Finally, a model-based behavioral analysis based on Multinomial Logit regression was conducted to systematically identify the statistically significant variables in explaining rear-end risk potential. The modeling results highlighted the significance of the explanatory variables associated with rear-end crash potential, however it was shown that their effect varied among different model configurations. The outcome of the results can be of significant value for several purposes, such as real-time monitoring of risk potential, allocating enforcement units in urban networks and designing targeted proactive safety policies.

J	Vasudevan, V; Prakash, P; Sahu, B				Vasudevan, Vinod; Prakash, Puneet; Sahu, Biswajit			Options Framework and Valuation of Highway Infrastructure under Real and Financial Uncertainties	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Public-private partnership (PPP) projects; Uncertainty in prediction of traffic flow; Interest rate; Risk analysis; Simulation	FORECASTS	This study builds and applies a framework that addresses the twin uncertainties of traffic flow and interest rates in build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects. Existing valuation methods address traffic flow estimations using linear models, which yield point estimates of traffic predictions regardless of traffic flow volatility. Additionally, considering traffic projections alone ignores the financial risk of these projects, which is an important variable for public-private partnership (PPP) projects. The framework is demonstrated by simulating scenarios based on the model. The model accounts for possible traffic flow pathways and paths that interest rates can take, resulting in the net present value probability distribution for the project. The outcome is the risk profile of the project under consideration. The constructed profile can be employed for analysis by both government agencies and the concessionaire and can thus promote a more efficient environment for contracting purposes. Finally, various applications of the model, including determining the operation period to be allowed for the concessionaire, setting the toll rates, and determining the impact of other policies, are discussed.
